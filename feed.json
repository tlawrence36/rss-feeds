      "The Vestavia Hills Police Department, which is investigating Meek's death, has not issued any public statements.",
      "Meek made his on-screen debut in 2014's \u201cThe Santa Con,\u201d and had roles in various TV series, including \u201cMacGyver.\u201d He was perhaps best known for his role in the 2017 film \u201cBaby Driver,\u201d in which he played a younger version of Ansel Elgort's titular character.",

      "As season two of Netflix's hit series \u201cSquid Game\u201d returns Thursday, viewers can expect more untimely deaths for many of its characters",
      "Viewers may gasp, cringe or cry out watching characters die on Netflix's \u201cSquid Game,\u201d but those simulated deaths have a different effect on its creator, writer and director. Instead, Hwang Dong-hyuk feels happiness seeing them go.",
      "The show has a huge cast and Hwang says it was \u201creally difficult\u201d to manage everyone on set.",
      "As characters would die, Hwang recalls saying to the actors on their last day, \u201c\u2018Oh no! How sad! I won\u2019t see you tomorrow,' but I was always smiling inside.\u201d",
      "\u201cSquid Game\u201d season two premieres Thursday. It once again stars Lee Jung-jae and centers around a secret competition in South Korea that targets people in debt and the winner gets a big cash prize. What they don't know is that losing the game is deadly.",
      "Hwang originally conceived of the show 15 years ago as a two-hour film but it failed to gain traction with financiers or even interested actors. He put it aside and worked on other films instead. He then had the idea to make it a TV series instead and took the project to Netflix. There, it could reach a wide audience.",
      "\u201cI never in my wildest dream thought it was going to be this huge,\u201d said Hwang, who spoke with the AP about the show and what comes next. Answers have been edited for clarity and length.",
      "___",
      "HWANG: I learned that I shouldn\u2019t give up. If you love something and if you want to create something, it might not work now, but the time might come later. Or that idea could be the source of inspiration for something else.",
      "HWANG: I'm afraid to talk about it but it's a feature film taking place 10-20 years in the future. It's darker than \u201cSquid Game.\u201d It\u2019s going to be quite cruel, quite sad, but at the same time quite quirky and humorous.",
      "HWANG: I used to think you had to have a specific taste to be cool, but I actually think I\u2019m very omnivorous. I like to watch anything. When I\u2019m on the couch watching TV, sometimes I watch CNN or Fox News. And then National Geographic and nature documentaries, I also watch some very soapy Korean shows or reality TV as well. I hop around and watch everything that\u2019s kind of happening in the world. With a series, I often don\u2019t stick with it the whole way through. There\u2019s only about like five shows that I watched until the very end, like \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d and \u201cWhy Women Kill.\u201d",
      "HWANG: Of course. I studied film school at the University of Southern California and there are so many people I'd love to work with. I have had those offers since \u201cSquid Game,\u201d but because I'm a writer-director I think I'm best when I\u2019m working with Korean actors, giving direction in Korean with my Korean script. But, if I come across an amazing scrip, why not? I'd love to work with Jake Gyllenhaal.",
      "HWANG: With seasons two and three, I had more screen time for more characters. This time around we have a lot of younger characters. When I was creating season one, I thought it was very hard for you to be up to your neck in debt when you\u2019re only in your 20s or 30s. I thought you had to be at least middle-aged to need money and want to join the Squid Game. But the world has changed. Now I feel like there are less decent jobs for young people and they feel like working hard doesn't even get them to middle class. They want to hit the jackpot, so that's why they invest in cryptocurrency. In Korea, there are a lot of young people in their early 20s or 30s turning to online gambling. I wanted to show what society really is like today.",
      "HWANG: It's better than season two."

      "Hitmaking record producer Richard Perry has died at 82",
      "Richard Perry, a hitmaking record producer with a flair for both standards and contemporary sounds whose many successes included Carly Simon\u2019s \u201cYou\u2019re So Vain,\u201d Rod Stewart\u2019s \u201cThe Great American Songbook\u201d series and a Ringo Starr album featuring all four Beatles, died Tuesday. He was 82.",
      "Perry, a recipient of a Grammys Trustee Award in 2015, died at a Los Angeles hospital after suffering cardiac arrest, friend Daphna Kastner said.",
      "\u201cHe maximized his time here,\u201d said Kastner, who called him a \u201cfather friend\u201d and said he was godfather to her son. \u201cHe was generous, fun, sweet and made the world a better place. The world is a little less sweeter without him here. But it's a little bit sweeter in heaven.\u201d",
      "Perry was a onetime drummer, oboist and doo-wop singer who proved at home with a wide variety of musical styles, the rare producer to have No. 1 hits on the pop, R&B, dance and country charts. He was on hand for Harry Nilsson\u2019s \u201cWithout You\u201d and The Pointer Sisters' \u201cI\u2019m So Excited,\u201d Tiny Tim\u2019s novelty smash \u201cTiptoe Through the Tulips\u201d and the Willie Nelson-Julio Iglesias lounge standard \u201cTo All the Girls I\u2019ve Loved Before.\u201d Perry was widely known as a \u201cmusician\u2019s producer,\u201d treating artists like peers rather than vehicles for his own tastes. Singers turned to him whether trying to update their sound (Barbra Streisand), set back the clock (Stewart), revive their career (Fats Domino) or fulfill early promise (Leo Sayer).",
      "\u201cRichard had a knack for matching the right song to the right artist,\u201d Streisand wrote in her 2023 memoir, \u201cMy Name is Barbra.\u201d",
      "Perry\u2019s life was a story, in part, of famous friends and the right places. He was backstage for 1950s performances by Little Richard and Chuck Berry, sat in the third row at the 1967 Monterey Pop Festival during Otis Redding\u2019s memorable set and attended a recording session for the Rolling Stones\u2019 classic \u201cLet It Bleed\u201d album. A given week might find him dining one night with Paul and Linda McCartney, and Mick and Bianca Jagger the next. He dated Elizabeth Taylor and Jane Fonda among others and was briefly married to the actor Rebecca Broussard.",
      "In Stewart's autobiography, \u201cRod,\u201d he would remember Perry's home in West Hollywood as \u201cthe scene of much late-night skulduggery through the 1970s and beyond, and a place you knew you could always fall into at the end of an evening for a full-blown knees-up with drink and music and dancing.\u201d",
      "In the '70s, Perry helped facilitate a near-Beatles reunion.",
      "He had produced a track on Starr\u2019s first solo album, \u201cSentimental Journey,\u201d and grown closer to him through Nilsson and other mutual friends. \u201cRingo,\u201d released in 1973, would prove the drummer was a commercial force in his own right \u2014 with some well-placed names stopping by. The album, featuring contributions from Nilsson, Billy Preston, Steve Cropper, Martha Reeves and all five members of The Band, reached No. 2 on Billboard and sold more than 1 million copies. Hit singles included the chart toppers \u201cPhotograph,\u201d co-written by Starr and George Harrison, and a remake of the 1950s favorite \u201cYou\u2019re Sixteen.\u201d",
      "But for Perry and others, the most memorable track was a non-hit, custom made. John Lennon\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m the Greatest\u201d was a mock-anthem for the self-effacing drummer that brought three Beatles into the studio just three years after the band\u2019s breakup. Starr was on drums and sang lead, Lennon was on keyboards and backing vocals and longtime Beatles friend Klaus Voormann played bass. They were still working on the song when Harrison\u2019s assistant phoned, asking if the guitarist could join them. Harrison arrived soon after.",
      "\u201cAs I looked around the room, I realized that I was at the very epicenter of the spiritual and musical quest I had dreamed of for so many years,\u201d Perry wrote in his 2021 memoir, \u201cCloud Nine.\u201d \u201cBy the end of each session, a small group of friends had gathered, standing silently along the back wall, just thrilled to be there.\u201d",
      "McCartney was not in town for \u201cI\u2019m the Greatest,\u201d but he did help write and arrange the ballad \u201cSix O\u2019Clock,\u201d featuring the ex-Beatle and Linda McCartney on backing vocals.",
      "Perry had helped make pop history the year before as producer of \u201cYou\u2019re So Vain,\u201d which he would call the nearest he came to a perfect record. Simon\u2019s scathing ballad about an unnamed lover, with Voormann\u2019s bass runs kicking off the song and Jagger joining on the chorus, hit No. 1 in 1972 and began a long-term debate over Simon\u2019s intended target. Perry\u2019s answer would echo Simon\u2019s own belated response.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll take this opportunity to give my insider\u2019s scoop,\u201d he wrote in his memoir. \u201cThe person that the song is based on is really a composite of several men that Carly dated in the \u201960s and early \u201970s, but primarily, it\u2019s about my good friend, Warren Beatty.\u201d",
      "Perry\u2019s post-1970s work included such hit singles as The Pointer Sisters\u2019 \u201cNeutron Dance\u201d and DeBarge\u2019s \u201cRhythm of the Night,\u201d along with albums by Simon, Ray Charles and Art Garfunkel. He had his greatest success with Stewart\u2019s million-selling \u201cThe Great American Songbook\u201d albums, a project made possible by the rock star\u2019s writer\u2019s block and troubled private life. In the early 2000s, Stewart\u2019s marriage to Rachel Hunter had ended and Perry was among those consoling him. With Stewart struggling to come up with original songs, he and Perry agreed that an album of standards might work, including \u201cThe Very Thought of You,\u201d \u201cAngel Eyes\u201d and \u201cWhere or When.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe were at a back table in our favorite restaurant as we exchanged ideas and wrote them down on a napkin,\u201d Perry wrote in his memoir. Stewart softly sang the options. \u201cAs I sat there and listened to him sing, it was clear that we both sensed we were on to something,\u201d Perry added.",
      "Perry was a New York City native born into a musical family; his parents, Mark and Sylvia Perry, co-founded Peripole Music, a pioneering manufacturer of instruments for young people. With his family\u2019s help and encouragement, he learned to play drums and oboe and helped form a doo-wop group, the Escorts, that released a handful of singles. A music and theater major at the University of Michigan, he initially dreamed of acting on Broadway. Instead, he made the \u201clife-changing\u201d decision in the mid-1960s to form a production company with a recent acquaintance, Gary Katz, who would go on to work with Steely Dan among others.",
      "By the end of the decade, Perry was an industry star, working on Captain Beefheart\u2019s acclaimed cult album, \u201cSafe As Milk\u201d and the debut recording of Tiny Tim and Ella Fitzgerald\u2019s \u201cElla,\u201d featuring the jazz great's interpretations of songs by the Beatles, Smokey Robinson and Randy Newman. In the early 1970s, he would oversee Streisand\u2019s million-selling \u201cStoney End\u201d album, on which the singer turned from the show tunes that made her famous and covered a range of pop and rock music, from the title track, a Laura Nyro composition, to Gordon Lightfoot\u2019s \u201cIf You Could Read My Mind.\u201d",
      "\u201cI liked Richard from the moment we met. He was tall and lanky, with a mop of dark, curly hair and a big smile, which his big heart,\u201d Streisand wrote in her memoir. \u201cAt our first meeting, he arrived laden with songs, and we listened to them together. Whatever hesitation I may have felt about our collaboration soon vanished and I thought, \u2018This could be fun, and musically liberating.\u2019\u201d",

      "The conclusion of a criminal case against Alec Baldwin in the fatal shooting of a cinematographer may clear the way for a related civil lawsuit by relatives of the deceased woman and efforts to depose the actor under oath",
      "SANTA FE, N.M. -- The conclusion of a criminal case against Alec Baldwin in the fatal shooting of a cinematographer clears the way for a related civil lawsuit by relatives of the deceased woman and efforts to depose the actor under oath, attorneys for plaintiffs in the civil suit said Tuesday.",
      "At a news conference in Los Angeles, victims\u2019 rights attorney Gloria Allred said that the parents and younger sister of deceased cinematographer Halyna Hutchins were disappointed that prosecutors won't appeal the dismissal of an involuntary manslaughter charge against Baldwin. The criminal charge against Baldwin was dismissed halfway through trial in July on allegations that police and prosecutors withheld evidence from the defense.",
      "Hutchins died shortly after being wounded during a rehearsal in the movie \u201cRust\u201d in October 2021 at a film-set ranch on the outskirts of Santa Fe, New Mexico.",
      "Baldwin, the lead actor and coproducer, was pointing a pistol at Hutchins when it discharged, killing Hutchins and wounding director Joel Souza. Baldwin has said he pulled back the hammer \u2014 but not the trigger \u2014 and the revolver fired.",
      "Allred said Hutchins' relatives are determined to pursue damages and compensation from Baldwin and \u201cRust\u201d producers in New Mexico civil court, and want Baldwin to answer questions under oath in the proceedings. Hutchins' widower and son previously reached a separate legal settlement.",
      "\u201cWith the withdrawal that was made public yesterday, we are now able to proceed with our civil case,\u201d Allred said. \u201cClearly, the rights of Alec Baldwin were protected, but the due process rights of the victims \u2014 Halyna Hutchins and her parents and her sister \u2014 were violated.\u201d",
      "Allred said she's ready to prove that Hutchins had a close relationship with her parents and sister \u2014 a prerequisite for seeking civil damages.",
      "In November court filings in the civil lawsuit, Baldwin denied allegations that he was negligent or at fault in the shooting of Hutchins and sought to suspend the case. Attorneys for Baldwin could not immediately be reached Tuesday.",
      "Allred read a statement from Hutchins' sister, Svetlana Zemko, that said, \u201cMr. Baldwin must be held accountable.\u201d",
      "In April, a judge sentenced movie weapons supervisor Hannah Gutierrez-Reed to the maximum of 1 1/2 years at a state penitentiary on an involuntary manslaughter conviction in Hutchins\u2019 death.",
      "Allred condemned New Mexico Attorney General Ra\u00fal Torrez for declining to appeal the dismissal of the criminal charge against Baldwin, calling him \u201cthe Grinch who stole Christmas\" at the Christmas Eve news conference.",
      "Torrez spokesperson Lauren Rodriguez defended the decision in an email, citing \u201csignificant procedural irregularities\u201d identified by the judge in the criminal case.",
      "\"Attorney General Torrez will not prolong the grief and anguish of Ms. Hutchins' family in the vain attempt to salvage the compromised criminal case against Mr. Baldwin,\u201d Rodriguez said. \u201cThere are other victims\u2019 families in Santa Fe County and across New Mexico who are awaiting justice, and our energy needs to be devoted to supporting those cases on appeal.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Angel Blue, one of the most admired singers of her generation, is headlining the Metropolitan Opera\u2019s first new production of Verdi\u2019s \u201cAida\u201d in 36 years",
      "If she has the voice of an angel, and the face of an angel, she must be an Angel.",
      "Angel Blue, that is.",
      "The American soprano, one of the most admired singers of her generation, is headlining the Metropolitan Opera\u2019s first new production of Verdi\u2019s \u201cAida\u201d in 36 years. Blue, now 40, debuted at the Met in 2017 as Mimi in Puccini\u2019s \u201cLa Boheme\u201d and has become a fixture at the house, starring in two opening nights and this fall portraying the lead character in Osvaldo Golijov\u2019s \u201cAinadamar.\u201d",
      "But \u201cAida\u201d is something else. The title role of the enslaved Ethiopian princess torn between love for an Egyptian warrior and loyalty to her country represents the pinnacle of Verdi\u2019s mature vocal style. It demands power, flexibility and the ability to spin out long phrases, while conveying the dramatic intensity of the character\u2019s emotional turmoil.",
      "It also comes weighted with history, especially for a Black soprano at the Met, where Leontyne Price embodied the role from her first performance in 1961 until her retirement in 1985.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m the next Leontyne Price, but I\u2019ve definitely looked at her my whole life as an example of someone to model myself after,\u201d Blue said in an interview after a day of rehearsal.",
      "\u201cSometimes in opera there\u2019s an intimidation factor because of those who come before us,\u201d she added. \u201cBut when it\u2019s somebody who I look up to, I feel like, OK it\u2019s my turn. Thank you so much, it\u2019s because of you I\u2019m here.\u201d",
      "Blue\u2019s turn comes on New Year\u2019s Eve, when Michael Mayer\u2019s production opens before a sold-out house with a cast that includes tenor Piotr Beczala as her lover, Radames, mezzo Judit Kutasi as her rival, Amneris, and baritone Quinn Kelsey as her father, Amonasro. Met music director Yannick N\u00e9zet-S\u00e9guin conducts. The Jan. 25 matinee will be broadcast live in HD to movie theaters worldwide.",
      "Blue was less than a year old when Price made her Met farewell, so she never got to hear her live in opera. But her father, a classically trained gospel singer and pastor, loved her recordings and \u2014 according to family lore \u2014 pronounced shortly after Blue was born that she would be \u201cthe next Leontyne Price.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy beautiful dad, he was just enamored of her,\u201d Blue said. \u201cIt was like a thought that came into his heart when I took my first breath.\u201d",
      "Growing up as one of five children in Southern California, Blue sang in church, studied voice and piano in high school, then entered several beauty pageants and used her prize money to help pay for her musical studies. She had been bitten by the opera bug at age 4 when her father took her to see a concert performance of Puccini\u2019s \u201cTurandot\u201d while the family was visiting relatives in Cleveland.",
      "Though she had sung \u201cAida\u201d once in concert in Detroit, her only previous staged performances came last year at London\u2019s Royal Opera House. The critics were impressed, though some felt she was still mastering the role.",
      "\u201cSometimes Blue\u2019s tone frays under pressure,\u201d wrote Neil Fisher in The Times. But he added that she is \u201ca heartfelt, affecting Aida \u2026 riding high in ensembles. This gutsy Aida will grow in authority.\u201d",
      "Mark Elder, who conducted Blue in London, recalled that \u201cwhen she came to me, she wasn\u2019t very experienced in the part, and I was incredibly impressed with how she would quietly go on with studying it and thinking about it and taking on board some of the ideas that I gave her.",
      "\u201cTo express everything the music demands of her is by far the hardest thing that she\u2019s probably ever had to do,\u201d Elder said. \u201cBy the time she did the first performance with me it was clear she was very suited to the role. She will sing it for years to come.\u201d",
      "Mayer said that during the Met rehearsals he was struck by how naturally Blue was able to capture the character\u2019s inner conflicts as she is torn between love for her Egyptian captor and duty to her homeland and her father.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s remarkable about working with Angel is that she is utterly sympathetic,\u201d Mayer said. \u201cShe does the thing that great actors do: She has the thought, and we see it. She\u2019s not doing any histrionic indicating of feelings, she\u2019s trusting that Verdi knew what he was doing in terms of how the music is telling its own story.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s a gentle soul, but then she opens up and you hear this magnificent voice,\u201d Mayer said.",
      "Opening night of the Met production will be a poignant occasion for Blue because New Year\u2019s Eve marks the 18th anniversary of her father\u2019s death. Her mother and brother will be in the audience cheering her on, and the rest of her family will come to a later performance. She\u2019s determined not to disappoint them.",
      "\u201cI feel like a boxer at the side of the ring, and I have these gloves on that say \u2018AIDA,\u2019\u201d Blue said. \u201cPeople are giving me water, patting me down and saying, \u2018Angel, you\u2019ve got this. You can do it!\u2019\u2019\u201d"

      "Of all the movie protagonists you might have seen this year, none is quite like Marianne Jean-Baptiste\u2019s Pansy in Mike Leigh\u2019s \u201cHard Truths.\u201d",
      "Pansy, a middle-aged woman in contemporary London, is foul-tempered from beginning to end. She spends her days in evident pain that she unleashes upon all those around her, including her husband Curtley (David Webber), her 20-something son Moses (Tuwaine Barrett) and most anyone else she encounters. Her venom might fall on a supermarket cashier or a furniture-shopping couple who dare to put their feet up on an ottoman. Heaven help the man who wants her parking spot.",
      "For everyone, Pansy is a test. She tests the patience and empathy of her family, just as she does the viewer. She\u2019s not an antihero, she\u2019s anti-everything.",
      "\u201cThe world is full of Pansys. People live with other people\u2019s conditions,\u201d Jean-Baptiste says. \u201cOften I\u2019ve met people who have just been enraged, because you didn\u2019t see them in the car park pulling into the space. You go: It can\u2019t just be about me. How did you get that angry about something so stupid? You don\u2019t know what they\u2019re going through or how they got there.\u201d",
      "\u201cHard Truths,\u201d which will open nationwide in theaters Jan. 10, never supplies any answers. Instead, it unfolds as a cantankerous character study, led by Jean-Baptiste\u2019s compellingly prickly Pansy.",
      "The performance has earned Jean-Baptiste her best reviews since her last film with Leigh: \u201cSecrets & Lies,\u201d nearly 30 years ago. For that film, Jean-Baptiste became the first Black British actress nominated for an Academy Award. Her performance in \u201cHard Truths\u201d has been just as celebrated, earning best actress from both the New York Film Critics Circle and the Los Angeles Film Critics Association. Three decades later, Jean-Baptiste could be heading back to the Oscars.",
      "\u201cYou sit down with Marianne a hundred years later from \u2018Secrets and Lies,\u2019 in which she played a very intelligent young woman, and Marianne has now moved on in life,\u201d Leigh says. \u201cWe love each other because she\u2019s very, very funny. So sitting down with her ability to be real and profound but also grotesque, that, alone, points me in the direction of possibility.\u201d",
      "Making a film with Leigh, the 81-year-old humanist master of \u201cNaked,\u201d \u201cVera Drake\u201d and \u201cMr. Turner,\u201d isn\u2019t a typical process. There\u2019s no script to begin with, just an invitation.",
      "\u201cIt was the usual: Let\u2019s do a film,\u201d says Jean-Baptiste. \u201cDon\u2019t know anything, but let\u2019s do it.\u201d",
      "Leigh pulls his characters and storyline out of months of rehearsal. In the case of \u201cHard Truths,\u201d they rehearsed for three months \u2014 somewhat short for Leigh (it was six months for \u201cSecrets & Lies\u201d), but extremely lengthy for today\u2019s movie industry.",
      "\u201cNormally you get on set it\u2019s like, \u2018Uh, this is Ralph. He\u2019ll be playing your husband. You\u2019ll stand over there,\u2019\u201d says Jean-Baptiste.",
      "In Leigh\u2019s manner of rehearsal, they begin with a character\u2019s first memory, and then flesh out their life all the way up until the time period of the film. But there are parallel histories for other characters that require constantly going back through and recontextualizing. Meanwhile, costume designers and production designers await clarity on what kind of clothes and homes they should craft.",
      "\u201cAll the decisions about the character that you can make, the actor makes them,\u201d says Jean-Baptiste. \u201cAny of the decisions that God makes for somebody\u2019s life, he makes them. So it\u2019s like: She wants this job, so she applies. A letter arrives in the mail: Unfortunately you did not get it.\u201d",
      "Jean-Baptiste was a recent drama school graduate, classically trained and oriented toward theater, when she co-starred in 1996\u2019s \u201cSecrets & Lies.\u201d It was her breakthrough. A few years after that film, she moved to Los Angeles, where she\u2019s been since, acting in a wide variety of projects including the TV series \u201cWithout a Trace,\u201d \u201cBlindspot\u201d and \u201cHomecoming.\u201d Asked if her collaboration with Leigh had changed from \u201cSecrets & Lies,\u201d Jean-Baptiste said much was the same.",
      "\u201cObviously we\u2019re a lot older,\u201d she says, smiling. \u201cI think we just slipped right back into it. He was gentler.\u201d",
      "Part of what makes Jean-Baptiste\u2019s performance as Pansy so uncanny is how unlike Pansy she is. Jean-Baptiste is charismatic, laughs frequently and enjoys throwing herself into uncertain circumstances (like \u201cHard Truths\u201d). Asked if she has anything in common with Pansy, she replies, with a laugh, \u201cI hope not.\u201d",
      "\u201cI have a sense of humor she doesn\u2019t, although she\u2019s really funny,\u201d Jean-Baptiste says. \u201cI think I recognize that part of myself to the extent that I\u2019m like: That\u2019s not how I want to live. That\u2019s not how I want to be.\u201d",
      "But in Pansy, Jean-Baptiste recognized people she knows, and the kind of character that seldom makes it onto movie screens. \u201cA difficult Black woman, you don\u2019t see that,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t think I ever have.\u201d",
      "In \u201cHard Truths,\u201d the root of Pansy's depression is uncertain, but a sense of festering wounds from the past is palpable. When she speaks to a doctor, she sums it up: \u201cThe heart of the matter is me head.\u201d Later, when asked why she can\u2019t enjoy life, she replies, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Jean-Baptiste, in mapping out Pansy\u2019s history, has some theories about what\u2019s made her this way.",
      "\u201cShe had a number of issues that went unaddressed and found coping mechanisms to get through life,\u201d says Jean-Baptiste. \u201cI think a lot of people are undiagnosed with things and just make do. Maybe she\u2019s one of those.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe fear,\u201d she adds. \u201cIt was the fear that I focused on the most. She attacks before anyone can attack her, and she thinks everyone is attacking her.\u201d",
      "But Pansy\u2019s specific diagnosis isn\u2019t the point of \u201cHard Truths.\u201d It's much more about how her family and the outside world react to her. She might be pushing everyone away, but it's clear she's in urgent need of something.",
      "\u201cI want so desperately for someone to help Pansy,\u201d Jean-Baptiste says. \u201cI think it would be very convenient to go, \u2018She\u2019s got this mental illness or that\u2019s what\u2019s wrong with her.\u2019 But what\u2019s more interesting is that we don\u2019t actually know and she\u2019s just in pain.\u201d",
      "\u201cHard Truths\u201d ultimately ends in a kind of cliffhanger, with Pansy and her family locked in stasis. If Pansy tests the boundaries of empathy an audience might feel for a character, it's a moment of truth: Does Pansy go to her husband or refuse to budge? Jean-Baptiste wants to believe in her.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d like to think that she goes, I do, because I like her,\u201d Jean-Baptiste says. \u201cI like Pansy. I gotta look out for her.\u201d"

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 John Mulaney's second trip to Broadway took little convincing. He didn't even need to look at the script before signing on.",
      "\u201cI was like, \u2018OK, well, send it to me. I\u2019ll read it.\u2019 And they sent it to me. I didn\u2019t read it. I just agreed immediately,\u201d the actor-comedian says.",
      "What Mulaney signed up for was \u201cAll In: Comedy About Love,\u201d a stage adaptation of his friend Simon Rich's short stories that's charming Broadway audiences this winter with a starry cast.",
      "Joining Mulaney \u2014 who made his Broadway debut in 2016 with \u201cOh, Hello\u201d \u2014 is Ren\u00e9e Elise Goldsberry, Richard Kind and Fred Armisen. They'll eventually be replaced by Lin-Manuel Miranda, Jimmy Fallon, Aidy Bryant, Nick Kroll, Tim Meadows, Chloe Fineman, Andrew Rannells, David Cross, Annaleigh Ashford and Hank Azaria.",
      "\u201cAll In\u201d opens with the surreal story of a guy who walks into a bar that has a 12-inch piano player and then goes on to feature personal ads from dogs \u2014 \u201cFull disclosure: I'm neutered but no complaints yet,\u201d reads one \u2014 a love triangle involving The Elephant Man, an aging talent agent confronting Death and a history report from the 2070s.",
      "\u201cThese are such meticulously, beautifully written pieces,\u201d says Mulaney, who befriended Rich when both worked at \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d \u201cBecause they so naturally lend themselves to performing, it\u2019s very fun to take it off the page.\u201d",

      "\u201cOur first reading was 4 1/2 hours long so it took some process of elimination, but we eventually found a batch of stories that we felt were not just thematically linked, but would lend themselves to powerful performances by talented actors,\u201d says Rich.",
      "Once they found the right stories, attention went to presenting them: How many actors should there be? How much of a production should the 90-minute play be? Should there be costumes and sets?",
      "They landed on minimalism and four actors, which offered both a chance to showcase each's versatility and make the play more intimate. The show is enlivened by original illustrations from New Yorker cartoonist Emily Flake and the band The Bengsons playing love songs from The Magnetic Fields' catalog.",
      "\u201cWhat was going to serve the material best was the purest communication of it to the audience,\u201d says Mulaney. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to use a drug thing, but mainlining the material versus taking it in a dissolvable.\u201d",
      "Two of the stories \u2014 a pair of passive-aggressive pirates who abandon their rough ways to raise a young stowaway and a noir detective tale told by babies \u2014 features children and child-rearing, something both Rich and Mulaney can now relate to.",
      "\u201cIt all is greatly enhanced by my own life,\u201d says Mulaney, the \u201ctouring, stand-up comedian, \u2018Saturday Night Live\u2019-writing, complete night owl, Dracula-like creature who now has two kids and lives in the California suburbs.\u201d",
      "The original four cast members will give way to four more but Rich and Mulaney think the structure is sound and can take changes. It helps that each performer sits in chairs for the entire show and has a script in their lap should they need it.",
      "\u201cSo many people can find a way into these stories that I am sure anyone coming in to do any of these pieces will be able to bring themselves to it and rise to the occasion of how good the writing is,\u201d says Mulaney.",
      "The replacements won't slip into the exact performer's spot just vacated \u2014 Rich says they'll scramble the parts up. \u201cIt\u2019s exciting for me to imagine how not just new individual performances will change things, but new pairings as well,\u201d he says. \u201cSo many of the stories live in the scene work between two cast members and that\u2019s another thrilling thing for me to imagine is those shifting dynamics.\u201d",

      "\u201cSquid Game\u201d follows an underground competition in Korea that recruits people in debt to participate in childlike games for money. Once the games begin, the contestants realize there are deadly consequences.",
      "The show was a global hit when it was released in 2021, becoming Netflix's most-watched series. It also won numerous accolades including Primetime Emmy Awards for acting for Lee Jung-jae and directing for Hwang Dong-hyuk. Lee's career catapulted, taking him to the Cannes Film Festival and giving him his first English-language role in the \u201cStar Wars\u201d series \u201cThe Acolyte\u201d for Disney+.",
      "Lee says when Netflix ordered a second season of \u201cSquid Game,\u201d he questioned the timeline because it took Hwang years to work on the first one. \"I wondered, \u2018How many years will it take him to write season two,\u2019\" said Lee. Hwang, in turn, surprised everyone \u2014 including himself \u2014 by taking just six months to write season two and a third and final season. \u201cI'm not sure I'll ever be able to write something that fast again,\u201d he said.",
      "Creating new characters and their individual stories came easily. The biggest, challenge, Hwang said, was deciding what should happen with Gi-hun. Lee says when he read the scripts he thought Hwang \u201creally is a genius.\u201d",
      "It's rare for even successful TV shows in Korea to have more than one season so it was a big swing, even for the new cast.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a Korean phrase, \u2018there\u2019s not a sequel that does better than its prequel,\u2019 said actor Yang Dong-geong, whose character debuts in season two. \"I've been careful because we aren't really sure what the reaction will be.\u201d The outlook is positive. Season two has already been nominated in the best drama series category at the upcoming Golden Globe Awards.",
      "The opportunity to work on a project with worldwide appeal is a dream come true for a performer. Lee Byung-hun, who reprises his villain role from season one, has appeared in big budget English-language films like \u201cG.I.

      "\u201cI\u2019ve been an actor for over three decades and ... maybe most people outside of Korea have never seen anything that I\u2019ve been in. If anyone through \u2018Squid Game\u2019 wishes to see more of me or becomes more curious about my previous works, as an actor, nothing would be more rewarding or bring me greater joy.\"",
      "The audition process moved slowly. Jo Yu-ri recalls waiting two months between the first and second-round. When she finally got the part Jo says, \u201cI actually remember crying.\u201d The actors were asked to not speak publicly about their casting to wait for Netflix to make an announcement. \u201cThere were a couple of close friends that popped champagne for me when they found out,\" said Yang.",
      "Netflix's \u201cSquid Game\u201d universe is also growing. A second season of a reality competition show based on the series has been ordered and an English version is in development. Season three of the original has also completed filming and is in post-production.",
      "Season two is not without controversy. The new episodes feature a transgender character played by Park Sung-hoon. Hwang says he understands why hiring a trans actor would have been ideal, but that the casting is a reflection of how the LGBTQ community and gender identity is viewed in Korea.",
      "\u201cTo be honest with you, in Korea, when it comes to the LGBTQ and gender minority community and culture compared to the Western worlds, it\u2019s not as widely socially accepted yet. Unfortunately, a lot of the groups are marginalized and neglected from society, which is heartbreaking,\" said Hwang.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t have a very large pool of actors that allow for authentic casting when it comes to transgender characters. We did our research. We tried to find someone who we thought could be the best fit. However, we weren\u2019t able to.\u201d Hwang also went on to say that Park's talent and approach to the character ended up making him \u201cthe perfect fit.\u201d",

      "Madison Square Garden is a staple of the NBA's Christmas schedule. Now it merges with a bigger home of the holidays, because the \u201cDunk the Halls\u201d game will be staged at Disney, on a court set up right smack in the middle of where countless families have posed for vacation photos.",
      "Why that location?",
      "Because it was Mickey Mouse\u2019s Christmas wish.",
      "\u201cBasketball courts often have the ability to make a normal environment look special, but in Disney it can only turn out incredible,\u201d Wembanyama said in an ESPN video promoting his Christmas debut.",
      "The story \u2014 this is Disney, after all \u2014 begins with Mickey penning a letter to Santa Claus, asking if he and his pals can host a basketball game. They'll not only get to watch one with NBA players, but some of them will even get to play. Goofy and Donald Duck will sub in for a couple Knicks players, while Mickey and Minnie Mouse will come on to play for the Spurs.",
      "\u201cIt looks to me like Goofy and Jalen Brunson have a really good pick-and-roll at the elite level,\u201d said Phil Orlins, an ESPN vice president of production.",
      "Walt Disney World hosted real NBA games in 2020, when the league set up there to complete its season that had been suspended by the COVID-19 pandemic. Those games were played at the ESPN Wide World of Sports.",
      "The setting for the Christmas game will be Main Street USA, at the entrance of the Magic Kingdom. Viewers will recognize Cinderella\u2019s castle behind one baseline and the train station at the other end, and perhaps some shops they have visited in between.",
      "Previous alternate animated broadcasts included an NFL game taking place in Andy's room from \u201cToy Story;\u201d the \u201cNHL Big City Greens Classic\u201d during a game between the Washington Capitals and New York Rangers; and earlier this month, another NFL matchup between the Cincinnati Bengals and Dallas Cowboys also taking place at Springfield\u2019s Atoms Stadium as part of \u201c The Simpsons Funday Football. \u201d",
      "Unlike basketball, the players are helmeted in those sports. So, this telecast required an extra level of detail and cooperation with players and teams to create accurate appearances of their faces and hairstyles.",
      "\"So, this is a level of detail that we\u2019ve never gone, that we\u2019ve never done on any other broadcast,\" said David Sparrgrove, the senior director of creative animation for ESPN.",
      "Wembanyama, the 7-foot-3 phenom from France who was last season's NBA Rookie of the Year, looks huge even among most NBA players. The creators of the alternate telecast had to design how he'd look not only among his teammates and rivals, but among mice, ducks and chipmunks.",
      "\u201cLike, Victor Wembanyama, seeing him in person is insane. It\u2019s like seeing an alien descend on a basketball court, and I think we kind of captured that in his animated character,\u201d said Drew Carter, who will again handle play-by-play duties, as he had in the previous animated telecasts, and will get an assist from sideline reporter Daisy Duck.",
      "Wembanyama's presence is one reason the Spurs-Knicks matchup, the leadoff to the NBA's five-game Christmas slate, was the obvious choice to do the animated telecast. The noon EST start means it will begin in the early evening in France and should draw well there. Also, it comes after ABC televises the \u201cDisney Parks Magical Christmas Day Parade\u201d for the previous two hours, providing more time to hype the broadcast.",
      "Recognizing that some viewers who then switch over to the animated game may be Disney experts but NBA novices, there will be 10 educational explainers to help with basketball lingo and rules.",
      "Beyond Sports' visualization technology and Sony\u2019s Hawk-Eye tracking allow the animated players to make the same movements and plays made moments earlier by the real ones at MSG. Carter and analyst Monica McNutt will be animated in the style of the telecast, donning VR headsets to experience the game from Main Street, USA.",
      "Other animated faces recognizable to some viewers include NBA Commissioner Adam Silver, who will judge a halftime dunk contest among Mickey and his friends, and Santa himself, who will operate ESPN\u2019s \u201cSkyCam\u201d during the game.",
      "The players are curious how the production \u2014 and themselves \u2014 will look.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to be so crazy to see the game animated,\u201d Spurs veteran Chris Paul said. \u201cI think what\u2019s dope about it is it will give kids another opportunity to watch a game and to see us, basically, as characters.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- In the holiday season battle of big-budget family movies, Paramount Pictures\u2019 \u201cSonic the Hedgehog 3\u201d sped past the Walt Disney Co.\u2019s \u201cMufasa: The Lion King\u201d to take the top spot at the box office ahead of the lucrative Christmas corridor in theaters.",
      "\u201cSonic the Hedgehog 3\u201d debuted with $62 million in ticket sales over the weekend, according to studio estimates. With strong reviews (86% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes) and a high score from audiences (an \u201cA\u201d on CinemaScore), \u201cSonic 3\u201d is well positioned to be the top choice in cinemas during the busiest moviegoing period of the year.",
      "It was telling of some wider trends that \u201cSonic 3\u201d \u2014 made for $122 million \u2014 bested one of Disney\u2019s top properties. Videogame adaptations, once among the most derided movie genres, have emerged as one of the most dependable box office forces in recent years. The two previous \u201cSonic\u201d movies together grossed more $700 million worldwide and the third installment appears likely to do better than both of them. A fourth \u201cSonic\u201d movie is already in development.",
      "\u201cMufasa,\u201d however, was humbled in its opening weekend, coming in notably shy of expectations with $35 million in domestic ticket sales. The photorealistic \u201cLion King\u201d prequel even opened wider than \u201cSonic 3,\u201d launching on 4,100 theaters and gobbling up most IMAX screens, compared with 3,761 locations for \u201cSonic 3.\u201d",
      "Yet \u201cSonic 3\u201d nearly doubled the haul for \u201cMufasa,\u201d which cost more than $200 million to make. Disney could look to $87.2 million in international sales to help make up the difference. The third \u201cSonic\u201d will rollout in most overseas markets in the coming weeks.",
      "In director Jeff Fowler\u2019s \u201cSonic 3,\u201d Ben Schwartz returns as the voice of the hedgehog, alongside Tails the Fox (Colleen O\u2019Shaughnessey), Knuckles the Echidna (Idris Elba) and Jim Carrey in scene-stealing dual roles as Dr. Robotnik and his grandfather.",
      "\u201cMoonlight\u201d filmmaker Barry Jenkins directs \u201cMufasa's\u201d voice cast, including Aaron Pierre, Kelvin Harrison Jr., Donald Glover, Beyonc\u00e9 Knowles-Carter, Mads Mikkelsen and Blue Ivy Carter. It follows Jon Favreau\u2019s 2019 photorealistic \u201cThe Lion King\u201d remake, which made $1.66 billion globally despite mixed reviews. \u201cMufasa\u201d didn\u2019t come close to that film\u2019s huge $191 million opening weekend.",
      "Many of Disney\u2019s live-action adaptations \u2013 including \u201cAladdin,\u201d \u201cBeauty and the Beast\u201d and \u201cJungle Book\u201d \u2013 have been big hits. Others, such as \u201cDumbo,\u201d \u201cMulan\u201d and \u201cThe Little Mermaid,\u201d have been less well received. More are on the way, including a new \u201cSnow White\u201d in March, \u201cLilo & Stitch\u201d in May, and plans for \u201cMoana\u201d and \u201cTangled\u201d to get the same live-action treatment.",
      "Despite \u201cMufasa's\u201d muted opening, Disney is still celebrating its strongest annual performance in years. The studio has accounted for more than $5 billion in ticket sales worldwide, including the year\u2019s top two hits: \u201cInside Out 2\u201d and \u201cDeadpool and Wolverine.\u201d The animated \u201cMoana 2\u201d is poised to round out the top three films of the year. In four weeks of release, it has collected $790.2 million globally, including $13.1 million in U.S. and Canadian theaters over this weekend.",
      "Though Christmas often sees some of the biggest releases of the year, November movies released around Thanksgiving really drove the box office this year. That includes \u201cMoana 2\u201d and Universal Pictures\u2019 \u201cWicked,\u201d which managed third place in its fifth weekend.",
      "\u201cWicked,\u201d the hit musical adaption starring Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande, added $13.5 million in North American theaters to push its domestic total to $383.9 million.",
      "Those films, among others, have led a Hollywood rebound in 2024. After a significant deficit earlier in the year, overall sales are drawing close to those of 2023. According to Comscore, the gap has narrowed to 4.4% behind last year's results. While that\u2019s still significantly less than pre-pandemic years, it\u2019s enough to flip the script on what once looked like a rough year for the movies.",

      "PORTLAND, Ore. -- An Oregon house cat died after eating pet food that tested positive for bird flu, Oregon authorities said, prompting a recall of raw frozen pet food that was sold nationwide.",
      "Northwest Naturals, a pet food company based in Portland, Oregon, said Tuesday it had voluntarily recalled one batch of its two-pound Feline Turkey Recipe raw frozen pet food after it tested positive for the virus. The product was sold through distributors in Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Wisconsin, as well as Canada's British Columbia.",
      "\u201cWe are confident that this cat contracted H5N1 by eating the Northwest Naturals raw and frozen pet food,\u201d Oregon Department of Agriculture State Veterinarian Dr. Ryan Scholz said in a Tuesday news release. \u201cThis cat was strictly an indoor cat; it was not exposed to the virus in its environment, and results from the genome sequencing confirmed that the virus recovered from the raw pet food and infected cat were exact matches to each other.\u201d",
      "The recalled product is packaged in two-pound plastic bags with \u201cbest if used by\u201d dates of May 21, 2026, and June 23, 2026. The company and Oregon authorities said that consumers who bought the recalled product should throw it away immediately and contact the place of purchase for a refund.",
      "No human cases of bird flu have been linked to the incident, but those who were in contact with the cat are being monitored for flu symptoms, Oregon authorities said.",
      "More than 60 people in eight states have been infected, with mostly mild illnesses, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC. One person in Louisiana has been hospitalized with the nation\u2019s first known severe illness caused by the virus, health officials said last week.",

      "President Joe Biden has signed the annual defense authorization bill into law despite his objections to language banning transgender health care for military children",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Joe Biden on Monday signed into law a defense bill that authorizes significant pay raises for junior enlisted service members, aims to counter China's growing power and boosts overall military spending to $895 billion despite his objections to language stripping coverage of transgender medical treatments for children in military families.",
      "Biden said his administration strongly opposes the provision because it targets a group based on gender identity and \"interferes with parents\u2019 roles to determine the best care for their children.\u201d He said it also undermines the all-volunteer military's ability to recruit and retain talent.",
      "\u201cNo service member should have to decide between their family\u2019s health care access and their call to serve our nation,\u201d the president said in a statement.",
      "The Senate forwarded the bill to Biden after passing it last week by a vote of 85-14. In the House, a majority of Democrats voted against the bill after House Speaker Mike Johnson insisted on adding the provision to ban transgender medical care for children. The legislation easily passed by a vote of 281-140.",
      "Biden also objected to other language in the bill prohibiting the use of money earmarked to transfer detainees held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to some foreign countries and into the United States. He urged Congress to lift those restrictions.",
      "The annual defense authorization bill, which directs Pentagon policy, provides a 14.5% pay raise for junior enlisted service members and a 4.5% increase for others.",
      "The legislation also directs resources towards a more confrontational approach to China, including establishing a fund that could be used to send military resources to Taiwan in much the same way that the U.S. has backed Ukraine. It also invests in new military technologies, including artificial intelligence, and bolsters the U.S. production of ammunition.",
      "The U.S. has also moved in recent years to ban the military from purchasing Chinese products, and the defense bill extended that with prohibitions on Chinese goods from garlic in military commissaries to drone technology.",
      "The legislation still must be backed up with a spending package.",

    "story": [
      "The battles over abortion in the U.S. are increasingly focusing on the pills that are now the most common way pregnancies are ended",
      "Opponents of abortion are increasingly focusing on restricting access to pills, which are the most common way to end a pregnancy in the U.S.",
      "This month, the Texas attorney general's office filed a lawsuit against a New York doctor, saying she violated Texas law by prescribing abortion pills to a patient there via telemedicine. The suit represents the first lawsuit of its kind and could lead to a legal test for the New York law designed to protect providers there who prescribe the drugs to patients in states with abortion bans.",
      "Anti-abortion officials are taking other steps, too, through legislation and lawsuits.",
      "Abortion rights advocates are also concerned that President-elect Donald Trump's administration could take action to restrict access if it chose to.",
      "By the time the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022 and opened the door for states to ban abortion, over half of all abortions were obtained using medication, usually a combination of the drugs mifepristone and misoprostol.",
      "The drugs are different than Plan B and other emergency contraceptives that are usually taken within three days after possible conception, weeks before women know they're pregnant. Studies have found they're generally safe and result in completed abortions more than 97% of the time, which is less effective than procedural abortions.",
      "By last year, nearly two-thirds of abortions were from medications, according to a tally by the Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that supports abortion access.",
      "Much of the growth has been through abortion pills prescribed via telehealth and mailed to patients. A survey conducted for the Society of Family Planning found that by the first half of 2024, such prescriptions accounted for about one-tenth of abortions in the U.S.",
      "That number has risen rapidly since 2023 when some Democratic-controlled states started adopting laws that seek to protect medical providers in their borders who prescribe abortion pills via telehealth to patients in states where abortion is banned.",
      "\u201cTelehealth for abortion has been a huge success,\u201d said Ushma Upadhyay, a professor at the Center of Health and Community and the University of California San Francisco. \u201cIt has helped people in an incredible way.\u201d",
      "Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton rolled out a new strategy in the fight over pills this month when he sued Dr. Maggie Carpenter, who is based in New York, alleging she prescribed and sent pills to a Texas woman.",
      "New York is one of at least eight states with a law intended to protect medical providers who prescribe abortion pills to patients in states with bans.",
      "If Texas prevails upon a judge to block Carpenter from prescribing in the state, it's unclear what would happen next. New York's shield law would bar it from being enforced in New York, said David Cohen, a professor at Drexel University\u2019s Thomas R. Kline School of Law.",
      "Cohen said he expects any ruling would not have a major chilling effect on other doctors who prescribe out-of-state patients. \u201cThey certainly seem undeterred by legal risk,\u201d he said.",
      "And, he said, like illegal drugs, they'll continue to be available if there's a demand for them. Cohen said Paxton \u201cis going to plug one hole if he succeeds. There's no way he plugs them all.\u201d",
      "Pill prescribing has already withstood one key effort to block it. The U.S. Supreme Court this year ruled that a group of anti-abortion physicians and organizations that represent them lacked the legal standing to force the undoing of federal approvals for mifepristone.",
      "The state attorneys general from Idaho, Kansas and Missouri responded in October with a legal filing contending that they can make such an argument. Instead of focusing on the drug\u2019s initial approval in 2000, they\u2019re looking at later changes from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration that allow its use for the first 10 weeks of pregnancy and telemedicine prescriptions.",
      "There hasn't yet been a ruling on their case. When there is, it will likely be appealed to a higher court.",
      "This year, Louisiana became the first state with a law to reclassify both mifepristone and misoprostol as \u201ccontrolled dangerous substances.\u201d The drugs are still allowed, but medical personnel have to go through extra steps to access them.",
      "Some doctors said in a legal challenge that the change could cause delays in administering them in emergencies, such as when a woman is hemorrhaging after giving birth.",
      "Dr. Jennifer Avengo, director of the New Orleans Health Department, said that in the first few months of enforcement, she did not hear of any cases where the drugs could not be accessed in time.",
      "Additional states are considering ways to restrict abortion pills in their 2025 legislative sessions.",
      "In Tennessee, a Republican state lawmaker has proposed creating a $5 million civil liability against those who deliver or help access abortion pills with the intent of helping someone end a pregnancy.",
      "Rep. Gino Bulso said he filed the bill after learning that abortion pills were being sent to Tennessee despite state law prohibiting such actions. \u201cI began to think about how we might be able to both provide an additional deterrent to companies violating the criminal law and provide a remedy for the family of the unborn children,\u201d he said.",
      "A proposal in Missouri would make it a crime to deliver mifepristone or other drugs with the intent of causing an abortion. In November, the state's voters adopted a constitutional amendment to allow abortion until fetal viability \u2014 which is somewhere past 21 weeks into a pregnancy, though there's no fixed timeframe.",
      "Trump's administration also could take action on the pill policy.",
      "One approach that abortion rights advocates have warned about \u2014 and which some abortion opponents have suggested \u2014 includes enforcing an 1873 law against pills that bans mailing medications or instruments used in abortion. President Joe Biden's administration has declined to do so.",
      "The FDA could also change its approvals of the drugs, even without being forced to do so by a court ruling.",
      "During his campaign, Trump flip-flopped on abortion policy and at points attempted to distance himself from abortion opponents. Since he won the election, though, he has nominated abortion opponents to administration posts.",
      "In an interview with Time magazine published this month, he gave rambling answers to questions about pills. He said he intended to maintain access but also left the door open to changing his mind.",

      "An example of a biased handoff with blame was about an adult patient with diabetes who \"cut her dose in half 2 months ago because she was having some falls and thought she was getting hypoglycemic but never actually checked her blood glucose.\" The neutral version of that handoff was rephrased to describe someone who \"cut her dose in half after experiencing hypoglycemic symptoms.\"",
      "",
      "After residents listened to three handoffs, the researchers followed up with three items: a multiple-choice clinical information recall question; an adapted version of the PASS scale to assess attitudes towards patients; and three open-ended \"key takeaway\" responses.",
      "",
      "Overall, Wesevich and colleagues found that those who heard biased handoffs had less accurate clinical information recall compared with those who heard neutral ones, but the difference wasn't statistically significant.",
      "",
      "They also found that those who reported bias as a key takeaway of the handoff had lower clinical information recall accuracy than those who did not (85% vs 93%; OR 0.47, 95% CI 0.26-0.85, P=0.01).",
      "",
      "In addition, participants had lower empathy scores as measured by PASS item 2 when hearing biased handoffs compared with neutral ones (3.1 vs 3.3, P<0.001), and more positive attitudes toward patients were associated with higher clinical information recall accuracy (OR 1.12, 95% CI 1.02-1.22).",
      "",
      "Wesevich and colleagues concluded that biased handoffs can \"adversely impact the quality of care for Black patients\" as they impeded the accurate transfer of key clinical information and diminished empathy, \"potentially endangering patients and worsening health disparities.\"",
      "",
      "\"If you're trying to add context to who someone is ... and you choose negative phrases, you wield a lot of power about how that person is viewed,\" Wesevich said, adding that it would be helpful for physicians to have trainings or monitoring or \"accept the recommendations by multiple national organizations to standardize the handoff process.\"",
      "",
      "\"It's okay to recognize that we have biases and stereotypes,\" he added. \"If clinicians can accept that they're human beings that have things to work on, and by taking some of these measures, we can try to reduce the impact of implicit biases on the care of patients  --  that level of honesty and introspection will go a long way.\"",
      "",
      "The study was limited because the handoffs were simulated, and thus could be different in clinical settings. Also, the findings may not be generalizable outside of residents and medical students.",

      "Singh was admitted to New Delhi\u2019s All India Institute of Medical Sciences late Thursday after his health deteriorated due to a \u201csudden loss of consciousness at home,\u201d the hospital said in a statement.",
      "\u201cResuscitative measures were started immediately at home. He was brought to the Medical Emergency\u201d at 8:06 p.m., the hospital said, but \u201cdespite all efforts, he could not be revived and was declared dead at 9:51 PM.\u201d",
      "Singh was being treated for \u201cage-related medical conditions,\u201d the statement said.",
      "A mild-mannered technocrat, Singh became one of India\u2019s longest-serving prime ministers for 10 years and leader of the Congress Party in the Parliament's Upper House, earning a reputation as a man of great personal integrity. He was chosen to fill the role in 2004 by Sonia Gandhi, the widow of assassinated Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi.",
      "But his sterling image was tainted by allegations of corruption against his ministers.",
      "Singh was reelected in 2009, but his second term as prime minister was clouded by financial scandals and corruption charges over the organization of the 2010 Commonwealth Games. This led to the Congress Party\u2019s crushing defeat in the 2014 national election by the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party under the leadership of Narendra Modi.",
      "Singh adopted a low profile after relinquishing the post of prime minister.",
      "Prime Minister Modi, who succeeded Singh in 2014, called him one of India\u2019s \u201cmost distinguished leaders\u201d who rose from humble origins and left \u201ca strong imprint on our economic policy over the years.\u201d",
      "\u201cAs our Prime Minister, he made extensive efforts to improve people\u2019s lives,\u201d Modi said in a post on social platform X. He called Singh\u2019s interventions in Parliament as a lawmaker \u201cinsightful\u201d and said \u201chis wisdom and humility were always visible.\u201d",
      "Rahul Gandhi, from the same party as Singh and the opposition leader in the lower house of the Indian Parliament, said Singh\u2019s \u201cdeep understanding of economics inspired the nation\u201d and that he \u201cled India with immense wisdom and integrity.\u201d",

      "Born on Sept. 26, 1932, in a village in the Punjab province of undivided India, Singh\u2019s brilliant academic career took him to Cambridge University in Britain, where he earned a degree in economics in 1957. He then got his doctorate in economics from Nuffield College at Oxford University in 1962.",
      "Singh taught at Panjab University and the prestigious Delhi School of Economics before joining the Indian government in 1971 as economic advisor in the Commerce Ministry. In 1982, he became chief economic adviser to the Finance Ministry. He also served as deputy chair of the Planning Commission and governor of the Reserve Bank of India.",
      "As finance minister, Singh in 1991 instituted reforms that opened up the economy and moved India away from a socialist-patterned economy and toward a capitalist model in the face of a huge balance of payments deficit, skirting a potential economic crisis.",
      "His accolades include the 1987 Padma Vibhushan Award, India\u2019s second-highest civilian honor; the Jawaharlal Nehru Birth Centenary Award of the Indian Science Congress in 1995; and the Asia Money Award for Finance Minister of the Year in 1993 and 1994.",
      "Singh was a member of India\u2019s Upper House of Parliament and was leader of the opposition from 1998 to 2004 before he was named prime minister. He was the first Sikh to hold the country\u2019s top post and made a public apology in Parliament for the 1984 Sikh Massacre in which some 3,000 Sikhs were killed after then-Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was assassinated by Sikh bodyguards.",
      "Under Singh, India adopted a Right to Information Act in 2005 to promote accountability and transparency from government officials and bureaucrats. He was also instrumental in implementing a welfare scheme that guaranteed at least 100 paid workdays for Indian rural citizens.",
      "The coalition government he headed for a decade brought together politicians and parties with differing ideologies that were rivals in the country\u2019s various states.",
      "In a move hailed as one of his biggest achievements apart from economic reforms, Singh ended India\u2019s nuclear isolation by signing a deal with the U.S. that gave India access to American nuclear technology.",
      "But the deal hit his government adversely, with Communist allies withdrawing support and criticism of the agreement growing within India in 2008 when it was finalized.",
      "Singh adopted a pragmatic foreign policy approach, pursuing a peace process with nuclear rival and neighbor Pakistan. But his efforts suffered a major setback after Pakistani militants carried out a massive gun and bomb attack in Mumbai in November 2008.",
      "He also tried to end the border dispute with China, brokering a deal to reopen the Nathu La pass into Tibet, which had been closed for more than 40 years.",
      "His 1965 book, \u201cIndia\u2019s Export Trends and Prospects for Self-Sustained Growth,\u201d dealt with India\u2019s inward-oriented trade policy.",

      "Azerbaijan Airlines\u2019 Embraer 190 was en route from Azerbaijani capital of Baku to the Russian city of Grozny in the North Caucasus on Wednesday when it was diverted for reasons that aren't fully clear yet. It crashed while making an attempt to land in Aktau, Kazakhstan, after flying east across the Caspian Sea.",

      "However, some aviation experts say the holes seen in the plane\u2019s tail section pictured after the crash likely indicate that it could have come under fire from Russian air defense systems fending off a Ukrainian drone attack.",

      "Yan Matveyev, an independent Russian military expert, noted that the images of the crashed plane\u2019s tail show damage compatible with shrapnel from the Russian Pantsyr-S1 air defense system.",
      "It's unclear why the pilots decided to fly hundreds of miles east across the Caspian Sea instead of trying to land in Russia after the plane was hit, he said, adding that they probably faced restrictions on landing at a closer venue and may have thought that the damage was not critical.",

      "China says its economy grew a bit more in 2023 than earlier thought, according to an economic census conducted every five years",
      "BANGKOK -- China's economy grew a bit more in 2023 than earlier thought, but the revision has not affected forecasts for \u201cabout 5%\u201d growth in the GDP this year, the government said Thursday.",
      "The estimate for total economic activity, or GDP, in 2023 for the world's second largest economy was increased by about 2.7% to 129.4 trillion yuan ($17.7 trillion), based on an economic census conducted once every five years. Earlier this year, the government said the GDP in 2023 was 126.06 trillion yuan.",
      "The exact impact on China\u2019s annual economic growth in 2023 was not given. Officials said further details would be released later. The economy grew at a 5.2% annual pace in 2023, according to the earlier estimate, up from 3% in 2022.",
      "The size of the U.S. economy in 2023 was $27.36 trillion.",
      "The economic census included years when the COVID-19 pandemic was causing severe disruptions to business activity, travel and ordinary activities in China. The economy is still recovering from those shocks and from a severe downturn in the housing market that followed a crackdown on excessive borrowing by property developers.",
      "The government has stepped up measures to counter the slowdown in consumer spending and business investment, pledging again this week to step up spending and issue more bonds to finance support from local governments that are suffering partly due to the property crisis.",
      "Such efforts are helping, the World Bank said in a report Thursday. It lifted its estimate for China\u2019s growth this year to 4.9% from its forecast in June of 4.8%.",
      "The World Bank's update for China's annual growth next year was raised to 4.5% from an earlier 4.1%, but it still shows growth slowing in coming years. The forecast for 2026 is for the economy to expand at a 4% pace.",
      "Weakness in the property sector remains a drag on growth, and people whose houses have lost value will remain reluctant to spend much. That will keep inflation low, the report said, at 0.4% for this year, rising to 1.1% in 2025.",
      "It noted that while moves to boost demand by cutting mortgage down payments and interest rates, funding affordable housing projects and subsidizing recycling programs for cars and appliances are supporting demand, such measures won't do enough to restore growth to higher levels.",
      "The risk of higher tariffs on Chinese exports to the U.S. once President-elect Donald Trump takes office and other limits on trade are other potential threats to the economy given China's growing reliance on exports to help drive growth.",
      "The World Bank reiterated its calls for China to improve its social safety net and to help redress widening inequality to help provide a firmer economic footing for the hundreds of millions of its people who are either low income or part of what it calls the \u201cvulnerable middle class,\u201d and are at risk of falling back into poverty."

      "Pope Francis is bringing his Holy Year to Rome\u2019s main prison",
      "ROME -- Pope Francis inaugurated his Holy Year at Rome\u2019s main prison on Thursday, bringing a message of hope to inmates and involving them in the Catholic Church\u2019s once every quarter-century celebration that is expected to bring about 32 million pilgrims to Rome.",
      "Francis stood up from his wheelchair, knocked on the door to the chapel at Rebibbia prison and walked across the threshold, reenacting the gesture he performed at the Holy Door of St. Peter\u2019s Basilica two nights earlier on Christmas Eve.",
      "The opening of the Holy Door at the basilica officially kicked off the Jubilee year, a church tradition dating to 1300 that nowadays occurs every 25 years and involves the faithful coming to Rome on pilgrimages.",
      "\"The first Holy Door I opened at Christmas in St. Peter's. I wanted the second one to be here, in a prison,\" Francis told the Rebibbia inmates before he entered. \u201cI wanted each of us here, inside and out, to have the possibility of throwing open the door of our hearts and understanding that hope doesn't disappoint.\u201d",
      "Francis dedicated the 2025 Jubilee to hope and made clear that prisoners would be an important part of it: The final grand event of the Jubilee is a special Mass for inmates at St. Peter's on Dec. 14, 2025. Francis has long made prison ministry an important part of his priestly vocation and has made several visits to Rebibbia since becoming pope in 2013 while also including prison visits in many of his foreign trips.",
      "His message is always one of hope, believing that people who are serving prison sentences need something to look forward to more than most. That is especially true in Italy, where prison overcrowding and inmate suicides are at record highs, according to the Antigone Association, which tracks prison conditions.",
      "According to Antigone's 2024 report, 88 prisoners killed themselves in Italian lockups this year \u2014 more than any other year \u2014 and Italy's inmate population was 132% over the system's capacity.",
      "In a statement Thursday, Antigone called on Italian authorities to hear Francis' appeal to give prisoners hope. It called for structural reforms that put into practice the constitutional principles of \u201ca punishment that is dignified, humane and looks to the social reintegration of those who are in prison.\u201d",
      "In his homily, Francis suggested the prisoners think of hope as an anchor that is fixed on the ground and that they try to hold tight to the rope that is attached to it, even if it sometimes hurts their hands.",
      "\u201cHold onto the rope of hope, hold onto the anchor,\" Francis said. \u201cNever let it go.\u201d",
      "Speaking to reporters outside, Francis recalled that whenever he speaks to prisoners, the first thing he always asks himself is \u201cwhy them and not me.\u201d",
      "\u201cBecause we all can fall, the important thing is to not lose hope, to hold onto that anchor of hope,\" he said.",
      "Back at the Vatican for his noon blessing, Francis called prison \u201ca cathedral of pain and hope\u201d as he repeated his message. He also doubled down on his 2025 wish for peace in the world and for wealthy countries to reduce or eliminate the debt owed by poorer countries.",
      "\u201cOne of the things that characterizes Jubilees is the remission of debts,\u201d Francis said, calling the debts owed by many poor countries simply \u201cunsustainable.\"",
      "Francis\u2019 outing to Rebibbia on a frigid morning was his final big event of the week after he celebrated Christmas Eve Mass on Tuesday evening at St. Peter\u2019s Basilica and delivered his Christmas Day blessing from the loggia overlooking the square.",
      "The 88-year-old pope, who often suffers from respiratory infections in winter, has a few days to rest before gearing up for the New Year\u2019s Eve vigil and Mass the following day.",
      "With the St. Peter\u2019s Holy Door now open to the public, a steady stream of pilgrims was filing into the basilica, a pace that is expected to continue through next year until the door closes on Jan. 6, 2026.",
      "Francis\u2019 2025 involves a dizzying calendar of Jubilee events that will sorely test his stamina, with special Jubilee Masses for all the main groups of pilgrims who are being celebrated during the year: Adolescents, migrants, teachers and law enforcement, among others.",
      "So far, he has only one foreign trip under study: A May visit to Turkey to commemorate the 1,700th anniversary of the Council of Nicaea, Christianity\u2019s first ecumenical council.",

      "SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea\u2019s main opposition party submitted a motion on Thursday to impeach the country\u2019s acting leader over his reluctance to fill three Constitutional Court vacancies ahead of the court\u2019s review of rebellion charges against impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol stemming from his short-lived martial law decree on Dec. 3.",
      "The court appointments have stalled amid an intensifying dispute between the liberal opposition and Yoon\u2019s conservative party, and the potential impeachment of Prime Minister Han Duck-soo may deepen the political paralysis that has halted high-level diplomacy and rattled financial markets.",
      "The opposition-controlled National Assembly also passed motions calling for the appointment of three Constitutional Court justices as the court prepares to start deliberations on whether to dismiss or reinstate Yoon. The vote came shortly after Han reiterated in a televised statement that he wouldn\u2019t appoint the justices without bipartisan consent.",
      "National Assembly Speaker Woo Won Shik urged Han to swiftly appoint the justices, saying that his calls for bipartisan consent essentially amounted to a refusal and \u201cinfringes on the National Assembly\u2019s right to select Constitutional Court justices.\u201d",
      "Yoon\u2019s People Power Party, whose members mostly boycotted the National Assembly vote, argued that Han shouldn\u2019t exercise presidential authority to appoint the proposed justices while Yoon has yet to be formally removed from office.",
      "The main opposition Democratic Party has accused the conservatives of undermining the court process to save Yoon\u2019s presidency, and its motion to impeach Han could go to a floor vote as early as Friday. The Democrats\u2019 floor leader, Park Chan-dae, said Han\u2019s comments showed \u201che lacks both the qualifications to serve as the acting leader and the will to uphold the Constitution.\u201d",
      "Yoon\u2019s presidential powers were suspended after the National Assembly voted to impeach him on Dec. 14 over an attempted power grab that lasted only hours but has triggered weeks of political turmoil that has shaken one of Asia\u2019s most robust democracies.",
      "To formally end Yoon\u2019s presidency, at least six justices on the nine-member Constitutional Court must vote in favor. Three seats remain vacant following retirements and a full bench could make conviction more likely.",
      "The court, which is to hold a pretrial hearing in Yoon\u2019s case on Friday, has said it believes the acting president can exercise the right to appoint justices.",
      "Three of the court\u2019s nine justices are directly appointed by the president. Three are nominated by the head of the Supreme Court and three by the National Assembly, and they are then formally appointed by the president in what is widely considered a procedural matter.",
      "The three seats that are currently open are to be nominated by lawmakers. South Korea\u2019s Constitution states that the National Assembly \u201cselects\u201d three spots on the court rather than recommends, suggesting that the presidential appointments for these spots are a formality rather than a substantive authority, according to some legal experts.",
      "\u201cThe consistent spirit reflected in our Constitution and laws is that an acting president should focus on maintaining stability in governance to help the country overcome crisis while refraining from exercising significant powers exclusive to the president, including appointments to constitutional institutions,\u201d Han said. \u201cI will withhold the appointment of Constitutional Court justices until the ruling and opposition parties submit an agreed-upon proposal.\u201d",
      "Han has also clashed with the Democrats over his vetoes of controversial agricultural bills endorsed by the opposition and refusal to approve bills calling for independent investigations of Yoon and corruption allegations involving his wife, Kim Keon Hee.",
      "If Han is impeached, Choi Sang-mok, the country\u2019s deputy prime minister and finance minister, is next in line.",
      "The impeachment vote against Han could face legal ambiguities. Most South Korean officials can be impeached with a simple majority of the National Assembly, but impeaching presidents requires two-thirds. The rival parties differ on which standard should apply to an acting president. The Democratic Party controls 170 of the National Assembly\u2019s 300 seats, so it would need support from members of other parties including Yoon\u2019s own to get a two-thirds majority.",
      "While focusing on defending himself in the Constitutional Court, Yoon has dodged several requests by law enforcement authorities to appear for questioning over rebellion charges and also blocked searches of his office. The Corruption Investigation Office for High-Ranking Officials, which is leading a joint investigation with police and military authorities of Yoon, summoned him for questioning this Sunday after he ignored a request to appear on Christmas Day. The office plans to question Yoon on charges of abuse of authority and orchestrating a rebellion.",
      "Authorities have already arrested Yoon\u2019s defense minister, police chief and several other military commanders involved in the attempt to implement martial law, which harkened back to the days of authoritarian leaders the country hasn\u2019t seen since the 1980s.",
      "In a news conference in Seoul, Yoo Seung Soo, lawyer for former Defense Minister Kim Yong Hyun, repeated Yoon\u2019s claim that his martial law decree was to \u201csound alarm against ... political abuse\u201d by an opposition that has bogged down his agenda, and did not amount to a rebellion.",

      "The Israeli strikes followed several days of Houthi launches setting off sirens in Israel.

The Houthis also have been targeting shipping on the Red Sea corridor, calling it solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza.",

      "Islamic Jihad is a smaller and more extreme ally of Hamas and took part in the Oct. 7, 2023 attack in southern Israel that ignited the war. Israel's military identified four of the men as combat propagandists and said that intelligence, including a list of Islamic Jihad operatives found by soldiers in Gaza, had confirmed that all five were affiliated with the group.",

      "Israel has banned the pan-Arab Al Jazeera network and accused six of its Gaza reporters of being militants.

      "He says he taped all around the door, soaked some clothes in water and rolled them up under the door to prevent the gas from coming in. \u201cI even taped the key hole,\u201d he said.",
      "A few months earlier, Arbeeni said, the local first responders of the Syrian Civil Defense, also known as White Helmets, had instructed residents in the opposition-held suburbs of Damascus what to do in case of a chemical attack.",
      "He remembers them saying they should cover their nose and mouth with a cloth soaked in water with white vinegar, and breathe through that.",
      "They huddled for three hours inside the room \u2014 time that seemed endless that night. Outside, many people were dying.",
      "\u201cIt is all because of God and this locked room,\u201d Arbeeni says of their survival.",
      "Around daybreak, the White Helmets members rushed into their house, found the family inside the room on the ground floor and told them to leave the area immediately.",
      "They ran into the street and saw dead bodies lying all around. A passing truck took the family on and gave them a ride. Their neighbor, who had fainted from the shock of the horrific scene, was taken away by paramedics.",
      "\u201cI was scared to look,\u201d said Arbeeni\u2019s mother, Khadija Dabbas, 66.",
      "The family stayed for a few weeks some miles away from Zamalka but then came back.",
      "Despite Obama's threat, in the end, Washington settled for a deal with Moscow for Russia-backed Assad to give up his chemical weapons\u2019 stockpile.",
      "But Assad's government was widely believed to have kept some of the weapons and was accused of using them again \u2014 including a 2018 chlorine gas attack over Douma, another Damascus suburb, that killed 43 people.",
      "Today, Arbeeni \u2014 remembering all the neighbors, friends and townspeople who perished \u2014 says he wants the \u201charshest punishment\u201d for those behind the attack in Zamalka.",
      "\u201cAll those children and innocent people who were killed should get justice,\u201d he said, looking at his 12-year-old son, Laith, a baby at the time of the attack.",
      "The new authorities in Syria are led by the jihadi group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, which late last month launched a stunning offensive from its northwestern stronghold that blitzed across large swaths of Syria and toppled Assad. They have vowed to bring to justice former Syrian government officials blamed for atrocities.",
      "But times are still unsettled \u2014 a few short weeks after Assad's ouster, no one knows what Syria's future will look like.",
      "\u201cThe overthrow of the Assad government creates the possibility of justice for thousands of victims of atrocities, including those killed by chemical and other banned weapons,\u201d says Adam Coogle, deputy director with the Middle East and North Africa division at Human Rights Watch.",
      "\u201cBut justice will only happen if the new authorities prioritize it and urgently act to preserve evidence,\u201d Coogle added. He urged for immediate access for U.N. agencies and international experts who would create a comprehensive plan to ensure that Syrians can seek justice and accountability.",
      "On Wednesday, about a dozen people visited the Martyrs Cemetery in Zamalka and the graves of people from the area killed during Syria's nearly 14-year war.",
      "Arbeeni's brother, Hassan, pointed to part of the cemetery that holds a mass grave. There are no names of the dead there, only a sign in Arabic that reads: \u201cAugust 2013.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe martyrs of the chemical attack are here,\" Hassan said, and recited a Muslim prayer for the dead."

      "WASHINGTON -- Cosmetic companies would have to take extra steps to ensure that any products containing talc are free of asbestos under a federal rule proposed Thursday.",
      "The proposal from the Food and Drug Administration and mandated by Congress is intended to reassure consumers about the safety of makeup, baby powder and other personal care products.",
      "It follows years of lawsuits against Johnson & Johnson and other companies alleging links between talc-based baby powder and cancer.",
      "Despite the lawsuits, research has found mixed evidence of a potential link between cancer and talc, although the possibility has been recognized for decades because of how it is mined.",
      "Talc is a mineral used to absorb moisture or improve the texture, feel and color of cosmetics. It is mined from underground deposits that are sometimes located near the toxic mineral asbestos. The risk of cross contamination has long been recognized by cosmetic companies.",
      "But recent FDA-sponsored testing hasn't uncovered any safety issues. Since 2021, laboratory analysis of more than 150 cosmetic samples has come back negative for asbestos, according to the FDA.",
      "Still, concerns about the risk prompted Congress to pass a 2023 law requiring the FDA to release new industry standards for asbestos testing.",
      "Dr. Linda Katz, the director of the FDA's Office of Cosmetics and Colors, said in a statement that the agency has \u201ccarefully considered the scientific evidence and complex policy issues related to detecting and identifying asbestos in talc and talc-containing cosmetic products.\u201d",
      "\"We believe that the proposed testing techniques are appropriate methods to detect asbestos to help ensure the safety of talc-containing cosmetic products,\u201d Katz said.",

Even large studies in thousands of women might not gather enough data to show a clear connection or definitively rule one out.

      "Most economists forecast the average rate on a 30-year mortgage to remain above 6% next year, with some including an upper range as high as 6.8%. That range would be largely in line with where rates have hovered this year.",
      "Borrowing costs on 15-year fixed-rate mortgages, popular with homeowners seeking to refinance their home loan at a lower rate, also rose this week. The average rate increased to 6% from 5.92% last week. A year ago, it averaged 5.93%, Freddie Mac said.",
      "Elevated mortgage rates and rising home prices have kept homeownership out of reach of many would-be homebuyers. While sales of previously occupied U.S. homes rose in November for the second straight month, the housing market remains in a slump and on track for its worst year since 1995.",
      "Mortgage rates are influenced by several factors, including the moves in the yield on U.S. 10-year Treasury bonds.",
      "Bond yields climbed last week after the Federal Reserve signaled that it will likely deliver fewer cuts to rates next year than it forecast just a few months ago. While the central bank doesn\u2019t set mortgage rates, its actions and the trajectory of inflation influence the moves in the 10-year Treasury yield.",
      "The biggest wildcard for mortgage rates next year is whether President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s policy initiatives will contribute to higher inflation and swell the national debt, which could keep mortgage rates elevated. That\u2019s because what happens with inflation, the U.S. deficit and the economy can have an effect on the 10-year Treasury yield.",

      "In a milestone for China, the world's biggest auto market, EVs hit 50% of new car sales in July. That included pure battery EVs plus plug-in hybrid electric vehicles. Chinese companies such as BYD continue to gain traction worldwide with their inexpensive EVs.",
      "Electric vehicles also made headway in Europe and the U.S. Uncertainty around purchase subsidies could complicate matters come 2025, especially under the incoming Trump administration in the U.S. But mainstream consumers remain interested in new models, longer driving ranges, better performance and lower prices.",

      "Rho Motion estimates 15.2 million EVs had been sold worldwide ahead of the end of the year, and the International Energy Agency expected electrified vehicle sales to reach one in five cars sold globally. Most were in China.",
      "Mexico sold roughly 5 times as many EVs this year than last, mostly from Chinese powerhouse automaker BYD, according to Rho Motion.",
      "Because China's population is so much larger, its 40% growth year-to-date translates to many more EVs than Mexico's fivefold increase.",
      "Other areas of note are the United Kingdom, which saw a roughly 17% increase year-to-date. That's interesting to compare to France and Germany, which saw sales decline.",
      "In Turkey, the EV market grew by almost 50% year-to-date, driven by Tesla entering the market last year and Togg, a Turkish auto company, ramping up its sales.",
      "In Norway, which for years has been in first place for share of vehicles that are electric, 90% of new cars were EVs.",

      "Thousands of workers are facing an unsettling reality heading into 2025",
      "NEW YORK -- Jason LaCroix felt privileged to work from home, especially as a father to two young children. He needed flexibility when his son, then 6, suffered a brain injury and spent 35 days in intensive care.",
      "LaCroix, a senior systems engineer based in Atlanta, took time off and then worked from home while managing his son's care and appointments. But LaCroix was laid off last February from that job, where he'd been working remotely for five years. His new role requires him to spend four days a week in a company office and commute for three hours a day.",
      "\u201cI want to be around for my kids,\u201d LaCroix, 44, said. \u201cIt\u2019s very important for me to be around for my son, because we almost lost him.\u201d",
      "Heading into 2025, thousands of workers face an unsettling reality: after years of working from the comfort of home, they must return to the office full-time for the first time since the coronavirus pandemic or look for new work.",
      "Employees at Amazon, AT&T and other companies have been called back to the office five days per week. President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to fire federal workers who don't show up to do their jobs in-person.",
      "\u201cPeople always want to have flexibility,\u201d said Mark Ma, a University of Pittsburgh associate professor of business administration. \u201cI have never heard anyone telling me that I thank my job because it\u2019s so rigid in its schedule.\u201d",
      "Ma researched what happened when technology and finance companies in the S&P 500 stopped allowing employees to work remotely in recent years. He found the companies experienced high turnover rates after implementing return-to-office mandates, especially among female employees \u2014 who often have childcare responsibilities \u2014 and senior-level executives.",
      "\u201cOver the years, people have adjusted their lives. They\u2019ve figured out, \u2018Oh wow, I can pick my kids up for school. Wow. I can caretake for my aging parents while I am still working,'\" said Shavon Terrell-Camper, a therapist and mental wellness coach. \u201cOnce you have tasted work-from-home ... it\u2019s difficult to see your life going back to something that could\u2019ve been unsustainable from the beginning.\u201d",
      "Workers and experts have advice to share about how to navigate the changes when an employer calls you back to the office.",
      "Employers can compromise if their goal is to increase how much time staff members spend together. Ma suggests an \u201cemployee-choice\u201d approach which gives teams the authority to decide how many days they will work in the office as a group.",
      "If that's not an option, employees also can ask to adjust their hours. LaCroix leaves home at 5 a.m. and works in the office until 2 p.m. to reduce time in traffic and allow him to be home when his kids get off the bus after school. His employer requires eight hours in the workplace but is flexible on which hours.",
      "\u201cA lot of people are pushing back, and they are trying to work out scenarios to see what type of flexibility does exist within the mandate,\u201d Terrell-Camper said.",
      "Some are coming up with work-arounds that aren't endorsed by upper management. \u201cCoffee badging\u201d is a technique that involves heading to the office, swiping a company ID, having a coffee and leaving to work from home. Desperate to hold onto valuable employees, supervisors have tried a \u201chushed hybrid\u201d approach, where they take their subordinates\u2019 ID badges and swipe them \u201cin\u201d and \u201cout\u201d to make it appear they\u2019ve been in the office, Ma said.",
      "It's best to have an honest conversation with a manager about any personal needs and to \u201cask for forgiveness ahead of time, because your family is the most important thing,\u201d said Amy Dufrane, CEO of the Human Resource Certification Institute. Many companies have employee assistance programs that do more than most people realize, such as directing employees to resources that can help them care for parents or children, she said.",
      "Medical conditions can make it especially challenging to work on-site. Kyle Ankney, a public relations strategist based in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, has cerebral palsy and needs a nurse to help him change a catheter three times a day. His health insurance will only send a nurse to one location, so working in an office isn't an option.",
      "\u201cIf that weren\u2019t an issue, I could find my way into the office,\u201d he said.",
      "Ankney, who ran his own PR firm for years, was seeking director-level roles, but a recruiter told him he should consider less-senior roles because of his need to work remotely. Instead, he applied to director-level jobs that were advertised as on-site or hybrid, and then reached out to explain his circumstances and ask if the hiring companies were open to him working from home.",
      "\u201cWhile I would never normally, especially in a career setting, lead with, \u2018I have cerebral palsy and I\u2019m in a wheelchair,\u2019 I\u2019m finding that I'm almost having to make myself vulnerable in that way just to see if the opportunity is even there for me,\u201d Ankney said.",
      "Landing a fully remote job can be competitive. \u201cThere are going to be many people that don\u2019t have the luxury just to leave\" their current jobs if they're required to return to the office, \"especially in a volatile market such as we\u2019re in right now,\u201d Terrell-Camper said.",
      "Attorney Holly Keerikatte was recently working on-site five days a week at a hospital, commuting about three hours a day and looking for a role that allowed more time with her family. She received two job offers. One was fully remote. The other paid 50% more but required a long commute. She recalled reading the phrase, \u201cThe only people who remember you worked late are your children.\u201d She chose the remote job.",
      "\u201cMy primary driver is what\u2019s best for my family,\u201d Keerikatte said. \u201cMy advice is to be up-front and transparent about what you want, what you\u2019re looking for and why.\"",
      "When faced with the inevitability of returning to an office, look for the positives. Friendships can blossom as colleagues take coffee breaks together or sample new lunch spots. In-person conversations can spark ideas that wouldn\u2019t surface at home.",
      "Employers can ease the transition by organizing activities that create camaraderie. For example, managers can put together a series of talks about the transition and have groups share what works for them, Dufrane said.",
      "Face-to-face contact allows people to better understand what colleagues are thinking and doing, which helps prevent resentment and can provide helpful feedback.",
      "Video director Deborah Ann DeSnoo, who owns Plug-In Inc., a video production company in Chofu, Japan, says she has worked in many countries where the film industry was male-dominated and female directors like her were uncommon. She makes a point to connect with colleagues in person, giving her a chance to bond.",
      "\u201cYou can read the air in a different way, and you find a solution,\u201d DeSnoo said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re on a Zoom and they ignore you, there\u2019s nothing you can do.\u201d",

      "Earlier in the week, a task force led by Brazilian prosecutors said it had rescued 163 Chinese nationals it said were working in \u201cslavery-like\u201d conditions at the site. A video from the Labor Prosecutor\u2019s Office of dorms housing the workers showed beds with no mattresses and rudimentary cooking facilities.",

    "story": [
      "A Japanese government panel has largely supported a draft energy policy calling for bolstering renewables up to half of Japanese electricity needs by 2040",
      "TOKYO -- A government-commissioned panel of experts on Wednesday largely supported Japan's new energy policy for the next few years that calls for bolstering renewables up to half of electricity needs by 2040 while maximizing the use of nuclear power as the country seeks to accommodate the growing power demand in the era of AI while meeting decarbonization targets.",
      "The Industry Ministry presented the draft plan for final review by the panel of 16 mostly pro-nuclear members from business, academia and civil groups. It calls for maximizing the use of nuclear energy, reversing a phaseout policy adopted after the meltdown crisis at the Fukushima Daiichi power plant in 2011 that led to extensive displacement of residents and lingering anti-nuclear sentiment.",
      "The plan is due to receive Cabinet approval by March after a period of consultation and will then replace the current energy policy, which dates from 2021. The new proposal says nuclear energy should account for 20% of Japan\u2019s energy supply in 2040, up from just 8.5% last year, while expanding renewables to 40-50% from 22.9% and reducing coal-fired power to 30-40% from nearly 70% last year.",
      "The current plan set a 20-22% target for nuclear energy, 36-38% for renewables and 41% for fossil fuel, for 2030.",
      "Demand for low-carbon energy, such as renewables and nuclear, is growing because of the demand from data centers using AI and semiconductor factories around the country.",
      "Industry Minister Yoji Muto, who attended Wednesday\u2019s panel meeting, said Japan must strengthen its energy security by not relying too much on a single source.",
      "\u201cHow we can secure decarbonized energy determines Japan\u2019s future growth,\u201d Muto said. \u201cIt's time to stop discussing a choice between renewable energy and nuclear power. We should maximize the use of both renewables and nuclear.\u201d",
      "Japan has set a goal of achieving net zero emissions of climate-warming gases by 2050, and a 73% reduction by 2040 compared to 2013 levels.",
      "The draft energy plan places renewables as the main power source and calls for development of next-generation energy source, such as solar batteries and portable solar panels.",
      "It outlines a number of risk scenarios, including a possibility of less-than-expected investment and cost reduction in renewables. However, some experts said the plan lacked a feasibility outlook for 2040 or a roadmap for the phaseout of fossil fuels.",
      "The plan also calls for acceleration of the restarts of reactors that meet the post-Fukushima safety standards, and proposes construction of next-generation reactors -- at plants where existing reactors are being decommissioned.",
      "Still, to achieve the 20% target, all 33 workable reactors in Japan must be back online, with only 14 back in service after the Fukushima disaster. Given the current pace of safety checks by the nuclear regulation authority, experts say meeting the target would be difficult.",
      "Despite criticisms and skepticism about its feasibility, Japan still sticks to its pursuit of developing advanced reactors and a struggling spent fuel reprocessing program to achieve a complete nuclear fuel cycle.",

      "Just about everyone dreams about cars they wish they could own, and there\u2019s no better time than the holidays to make a list of vehicles you\u2019d love to have in your driveway. The car pros at Edmunds rounded up five of their favorite dream-worthy vehicles. But rather than just list the most outlandish and expensive exotics, they focused on highlighting models that are expensive but not so pricey that it\u2019d be completely unrealistic for you to own one one day. The vehicles are ordered in ascending order of price and include destination fees.",
      "Off-road trucks look fantastic and are extremely capable. What truck enthusiast wouldn\u2019t have one topping their wish list? The king of the hill for 2025 is the F-150 Raptor R. The regular Raptor is already impressive, and the R takes it to the next level with a bonkers 720-horsepower supercharged 5.2-liter V8 engine, upgraded Fox dual-value shock absorbers, and massive 37-inch all-terrain tires. An R-specific grille and hood are also part of the R\u2019s upgrades.",
      "Thankfully, the Raptor R isn\u2019t all bark and bite. It also has plenty of features to make it a livable truck for daily driving. Standard features include leather upholstery, cooling front seats, a premium sound system, and a surround-view camera to help make this big truck easier to park.",
      "Starting Price: $112,825",
      "Few sedans can match the Mercedes-Benz S-Class for opulence, luxury and prestige. This grand sedan showcases nearly every luxury, technology and performance innovation that Mercedes-Benz has concocted. Everything you touch inside is likely covered in leather, heated, or bathed in disco-worthy ambient light.",
      "A novel could be written about all of the S-Class\u2019 luxury and comfort features, but one of the most notable is the E-Active Body Control system. It scans the road surface ahead and adjusts the suspension to deliver the best ride possible. The S-Class also boasts an extensive list of advanced safety features and has an augmented reality head-up display that projects images that appear to float in front of the car. For the ultimate S-Class, get the 791-horsepower AMG S 63 E Performance model.",
      "Starting Price: $118,900",
      "Who needs a European exotic car when the Corvette ZR1 is just as capable? A sports car fanatic\u2019s wish list wouldn\u2019t be right without the ZR1. The new Corvette hit a record-setting top speed of 233 mph, making it the fastest car ever built by an American automaker and the fastest current production car priced under $1 million, according to Chevrolet.",
      "The top speed record was possible thanks to the ZR1\u2019s turbocharged 5.5-liter V8 engine that cranks out a staggering 1,064 horsepower. Its carbon-fiber aero package kept it glued to the track by generating over 1,200 pounds of downforce at top speed. Chevrolet also says the ZR1 can accelerate through the quarter mile in less than 10 seconds. We expect the Corvette ZR1 to go on sale in early 2025.",
      "Estimated starting price: $150,000",
      "Does your wish list include a big and powerful SUV? If it does, the Escalade-V should top it. The big Caddy roars like a muscle car thanks to its supercharged 6.2-liter V8 that churns out 682 horsepower and helps it hit 60 mph in just 4.4 seconds. The Escalade-V also boasts enormous 24-inch wheels and large Brembo brakes that help bring the three-ton SUV to a stop.",
      "But the Escalade-V isn\u2019t only about brute power. It also has three rows of seating, plenty of cargo space and offers impressive tech like Super Cruise, a hands-free highway driving system, and an enormous 55-inch curved display that spans the dashboard.",
      "Starting Price: $161,990",
      "What if we told you there was a car that could outpace almost anything on a drag strip, keep up with high-end sports cars on a racetrack, and be comfortable enough for daily errands? Well, if that sounds amazing, add the Air Sapphire to your dream list.",
      "The Air Sapphire is a high-performance electric luxury sedan made by Lucid, an electric vehicle startup. It\u2019s one of the most powerful production cars in the world, producing an astonishing 1,234 horsepower from its three electric motors. Lucid says it has a top speed of 205 mph and can rocket to 60 mph in a mind-numbing 1.9 seconds. You can adjust the vehicle\u2019s setting for exceptional track performance or simply provide a comfortable ride around town.",
      "Starting price: $250,500",
      "Even if you can\u2019t afford any of these vehicles, you can still picture one sitting in your driveway or imagine yourself cruising around town in it. And who knows, maybe holiday magic will give you the opportunity to own one in the future.",

      "American Airlines briefly grounded flights nationwide due to a technical problem just as the Christmas travel season kicked into overdrive and winter weather threatened more potential problems for those planning to fly or drive",
      "WASHINGTON -- American Airlines briefly grounded flights nationwide Tuesday because of a technical problem just as the Christmas travel season kicked into overdrive and winter weather threatened more potential problems for those planning to fly or drive.",
      "Government regulators cleared American flights to get airborne about an hour after the Federal Aviation Administration ordered a national ground stop for the airline. The order, which prevented planes from taking off, was issued at the airline's request after it experienced trouble with its flight operating system, or FOS. The airline blamed technology from one of its vendors.",
      "As a result, flights were delayed across American\u2019s major hubs, with only 37% of the airline's 3,901 domestic and international flights leaving on time, according to Cirium, an aviation analytics company. Nineteen flights were canceled.",
      "Dennis Tajer, a spokesperson for the Allied Pilots Association, a union representing American Airlines pilots, said the airline told pilots at 7 a.m. Eastern that there was an outage affecting the FOS system. It handles different types of airline operations, including dispatch, flight planning, passenger boarding, as well as an airplane's weight and balance data, he said.",
      "Some components of FOS have gone down in the past, but a systemwide outage is rare, Tajer said.",
      "Hours after the ground stop was lifted, Tajer said the union had not heard about any \u201cchaos out there beyond just the normal heavy travel day.\u201d He said officials were watching for any cascading effects, such as staffing problems.",
      "On social media, however, customers expressed frustrations about delays that caused them or their family members to miss connecting flights. One person asked if American planned to hold flights for passengers to make connections, while others complained about the lack of assistance they said they received from the airline or gate agents.",
      "Cirium noted that the vast majority of flights were departing within two hours of their scheduled departure time. A similar percentage \u2014 36% \u2014 were arriving at their destinations as scheduled.",
      "Dallas-Fort Worth, New York\u2019s Kennedy Airport and Charlotte, North Carolina, saw the greatest number of delays, Cirium said. Washington, Chicago and Miami experienced considerably fewer delays.",
      "Meanwhile, the flight-tracking site FlightAware reported that 4,058 flights entering or leaving the U.S., or serving domestic destinations, were delayed, with 76 flights canceled. The site had not posted any American Airlines flights on Tuesday morning, but showed in the afternoon that 961 American flights were delayed.",
      "Amid the travel problems, significant rain and snow were expected in the Pacific Northwest at least into Christmas Day. Showers and thunderstorms were developing in the South. Freezing rain was reported in the Mid-Atlantic region near Baltimore and Washington, and snow fell in New York.",
      "Because the holiday travel period lasts weeks, airports and airlines typically have smaller peak days than they do during the rush around Thanksgiving, but the grind of one hectic day followed by another takes a toll on flight crews. And any hiccups \u2014 a winter storm or a computer outage \u2014 can snowball into massive disruptions.",
      "That is how Southwest Airlines stranded 2 million travelers in December 2022, and Delta Air Lines suffered a smaller but significant meltdown after a worldwide technology outage in July caused by a faulty software update from cybersecurity company CrowdStrike.",
      "Many flights during the holidays are sold out, which makes cancellations even more disruptive than during slower periods. That is especially true for smaller budget airlines that have fewer flights and fewer options for rebooking passengers. Only the largest airlines, including American, Delta and United, have \u201cinterline agreements\u201d that let them put stranded customers on another carrier\u2019s flights.",
      "This will be the first holiday season since a Transportation Department rule took effect that requires airlines to give customers an automatic cash refund for a canceled or significantly delayed flight. Most air travelers were already eligible for refunds, but they often had to request them.",
      "Passengers still can ask to get rebooked, which is often a better option than a refund during peak travel periods. That\u2019s because finding a last-minute flight on another airline tends to be expensive.",
      "An American spokesperson said Tuesday was not a peak travel day for the airline \u2014 with about 2,000 fewer flights than the busiest days \u2014 so the airline had somewhat of a buffer to manage the delays.",
      "The groundings happened as millions of travelers were expected to fly over the next 10 days. The Transportation Security Administration expects to screen 40 million passengers through Jan. 2.",
      "Airlines expect to have their busiest days on Thursday, Friday and Sunday.",
      "Many flights during the holidays are sold out, which makes cancellations more disruptive than during slower periods. Even with just a brief outage, the cancellations have a cascading effect that can take days to clear up.",
      "About 90% of Americans traveling far from home over the holidays will be in cars, according to AAA.",
      "\u201cAirline travel is just really high right now, but most people do drive to their destinations, and that is true for every holiday,\u201d AAA spokesperson Aixa Diaz said.",
      "Gasoline prices are similar to last year. The nationwide average Thursday was $3.04 a gallon, down from $3.13 a year ago, according to AAA. Charging an electric vehicle averages just under 35 cents per per kilowatt hour, but varies by state.",
      "Transportation-data firm INRIX says travel times on the nation\u2019s highways could be up to 30% longer than normal over the holidays, with Sunday expected to see the heaviest traffic. Boston, New York City, Seattle and Washington are the metropolitan areas primed for the greatest delays, according to the company.",

    "summary": "North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper leaves his job next week after eight years",

      "North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper leaves his job next week after eight years",
      "RALEIGH, N.C. -- RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) \u2014 North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper is leaving his job after eight years in which the southern Democrat picked his moments against a Republican-dominated legislature, winning big on Medicaid expansion and clean energy while falling short in fights over private-school vouchers and abortion rights.",
      "Cooper, who steered the state through the coronavirus pandemic, Hurricanes Helene and Florence and an early flashpoint in the culture wars over access to public restrooms, was barred from seeking a third consecutive term. He is wrapping up 24 consecutive years in statewide office \u2014 the first 16 as attorney general.",
      "In a December interview with The Associated Press at the executive mansion, Cooper reflected on his gubernatorial terms with an emphasis on the positive \u2014 an easier undertaking compared with many Democrats around the country in the aftermath of this year's election.",
      "\"To be able to wake up every morning and get to lead the state that you love has been humbling, challenging and fulfilling. I have really valued every day,\u201d said Cooper, who will be succeeded by state Attorney General Josh Stein, a fellow Democrat, in early January.",
      "Faced with veto-proof majorities for almost half of his time as governor, Cooper was unable to stop many GOP initiatives, including deep income tax cuts, taxpayer-funded vouchers to help public school students attend private schools and new restrictions on abortion.",
      "But Cooper, one of several Democratic governors seen as potential contenders for federal office, managed last year to persuade GOP legislative leaders to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act \u2014 something he had sought since getting sworn in as governor in 2017. Now 600,000 low-income adults are enrolled in the program a year ahead of expectations.",
      "\u201cThis is a generational investment in people\u2019s health,\u201d Cooper said during a farewell address last week in Nash County, where he grew up and launched his first gubernatorial campaign in 2015. Another bipartisan agreement was reached in 2021 on a milestone energy bill that ordered sharp reductions in greenhouse gas emissions from power plants.",
      "Cooper takes credit for conditions that led to big corporate expansions that he says have contributed to hundreds of thousands of new jobs being created during the past eight years, including those in the clean energy sector. But he also gives his rare praise to Republican lawmakers for all working together on offering economic incentives that have lured companies such as Apple, Toyota and Boom Supersonic to build in the state.",
      "Still, Republicans contend Cooper receives too much acclaim for the state\u2019s broad economic success and has pushed for reckless state spending at every turn. Half of his record 100-plus vetoes were overridden.",
      "\u201cThere has not been a governor who has had less of his agenda enacted and North Carolina has succeeded in spite of his leadership failures,\" state GOP spokesperson Matt Mercer said.",
      "Regardless, Cooper\u2019s perceived accomplishments in a swing state raised his national profile during this year\u2019s presidential campaign, making him as a potential running mate for Kamala Harris until he said it \"just wasn\u2019t the right time\" for him and for North Carolina. Now Cooper, 67, will have to decide whether trying to unseat U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis, a Republican, in 2026 is in the cards after holding what he calls the \u201cbest job I have ever had.\u201d",
      "While North Carolina Democrats have won eight of past nine gubernatorial elections, they haven\u2019t won a U.S. Senate race since 2008.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re going to run for public office again, you must have your heart and soul in it, you must have the fire in the belly,\u201d Cooper told the AP.",
      "With that in mind, he said he planned to take a couple of months to clear his head before deciding what\u2019s next: \u201cI\u2019m going to think about how I can best contribute to the things that I care about.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s little wonder why many North Carolina Democrats want Cooper to remain on the political stage. He has never lost a race for state office, from the legislature in the mid-1980s and including a 10,000-vote win over then-GOP Gov. Pat McCrory in 2016.",
      "\u201cWhat he\u2019s done really from my perspective is he\u2019s kept the progressive flame alive in North Carolina in a difficult time,\u201d said Gary Pearce, a longtime Democratic political consultant who worked with four-term Gov. Jim Hunt. \u201cI\u2019m not sure anybody else could have done it as well as he did.\u201d",
      "Cooper took on Republicans even before he was sworn in.",
      "As governor-elect he began a series of lawsuits challenging legislation approved weeks before he took office that shifted executive branch powers to the legislature. The legal results were mixed, and even now litigation over his appointment powers remains in court. This month, Republican lawmakers enacted more changes that would weaken Stein's gubernatorial authority. Two lawsuits related to that law have been filed so far.",
      "In his first three months in office, Cooper worked with lawmakers to partially repeal the 2016 \u201cbathroom bill,\u201d which had required transgender people to use public bathrooms aligned with the gender on their birth certificate. The law had lost the state business, including canceled sporting events and job expansions, and \u201cNorth Carolina\u2019s reputation was in tatters,\u201d Cooper said.",
      "Eight years later, \u201cwe built a North Carolina that is healthier, better educated, with more money in people\u2019s pockets, and we stand ready to welcome prosperity with open arms for generations to come,\u201d Cooper said.",
      "Republicans cite several shortcomings in Cooper's administration. They include spending overruns at the state Department of Transportation; continued delays to rebuild or renovate homes for eastern North Carolina residents after Hurricanes Matthew in 2016 and Florence in 2018; and executive orders that helped extend restrictions on businesses and school instruction during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been painful dealing with the governor fiscally,\u201d Republican state Sen. Warren Daniel said. \u201cI just think he\u2019s not very good at managing government.\u201d",
      "Cooper has defended his actions, particularly his pandemic leadership, saying North Carolina came out better than many other states.",
      "Even in policy defeats, Cooper secured the admiration of supporters. The Democratic governor used lots of political capital in 2023 trying unsuccessfully to block a law that changed the state\u2019s ban on most abortions from after 20 weeks of pregnancy to 12 weeks. Republicans overrode his veto.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s simply no governor who\u2019s ever fought as hard or as publicly as Gov. Cooper has to protect access to abortion,\u201d said Paige Johnson with Planned Parenthood South Atlantic.",
      "Plenty of North Carolinians see that differently. Cooper\u2019s opposition to the abortion bill reflects an administration that \u201chas been consistently hostile to policies that serve the best interests of North Carolina families,\u201d said Tami Fitzgerald, executive director of the NC Values Coalition.",
      "Cooper said he has confidence that Stein, who succeeded him as attorney general, will \u201ccontinue a lot of the progress that we have made.\u201d Cooper hired Stein two decades ago, while attorney general, to be his consumer protection chief.",
      "Otherwise, Cooper knows that he\u2019ll miss \u201chaving the opportunity every single day to do something to make a real difference.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s what you can do in this job,\u201d he added. \"And whatever I decide to do, that\u2019s going to be hard to replicate.\""

    "summary": "A powerful government panel has failed to reach consensus on the possible national security risks of a nearly $15 billion proposed deal for Nippon Steel of Japan to purchase U.S. Steel",
    "story": [
      "A powerful government panel has failed to reach consensus on the possible national security risks of a nearly $15 billion proposed deal for Nippon Steel of Japan to purchase U.S. Steel",
      "WASHINGTON -- A powerful government panel on Monday failed to reach consensus on the possible national security risks of a nearly $15 billion proposed deal for Nippon Steel of Japan to purchase U.S. Steel, leaving the decision to President Joe Biden, who opposes the deal.",
      "The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, known as CFIUS, sent its long-awaited report on the merger to Biden, who formally came out against the deal in March. He has 15 days to reach a final decision, the White House said. A U.S. official familiar with the matter, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the private report, said some federal agencies represented on the panel were skeptical that allowing a Japanese company to buy an American-owned steelmaker would create national security risks.",
      "Monday was the deadline to approve the deal, recommend that Biden block it or extend the review process.",
      "Both Biden and President-elect Donald Trump have courted unionized workers at U.S. Steel and vowed to block the acquisition amid concerns about foreign ownership of a flagship American company. The economic risk, however, is giving up Nippon Steel's potential investments in the mills and upgrades that might help preserve steel production within the United States.",
      "Under the terms of the proposed $14.9 billion all-cash deal, U.S. Steel would keep its name and its headquarters in Pittsburgh, where it was founded in 1901 by J.P. Morgan and Andrew Carnegie. It would become a subsidiary of Nippon Steel, and the combined company would be among the top three steelmakers in the world, according to 2023 figures from the World Steel Association.",
      "Biden, backed by the United Steelworkers, said earlier this year that it was \"vital for (U.S. Steel) to remain an American steel company that is domestically owned and operated.\u201d",
      "Trump has also opposed the acquisition and vowed earlier this month on his Truth Social platform to \u201cblock this deal from happening.\u201d He proposed reviving U.S. Steel's flagging fortunes \u201cthrough a series of Tax Incentives and Tariffs.\u201d",
      "The steelworkers union questions if Nippon Steel would keep jobs at unionized plants, make good on collectively bargained benefits or protect American steel production from cheap foreign imports.",
      "\u201cOur union has been calling for strict government scrutiny of the sale since it was announced. Now it\u2019s up to President Biden to determine the best path forward,\u201d David McCall, the steelworkers' president, said in a statement Monday. \u201cWe continue to believe that means keeping U.S. Steel domestically owned and operated.\u201d",
      "Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel have waged a public relations campaign to win over skeptics.",
      "U.S. Steel said in a statement Monday that the deal \u201cis the best way, by far, to ensure that U.S. Steel, including its employees, communities, and customers, will thrive well into the future.\u201d",
      "Nippon Steel said Tuesday that it had been informed by CFIUS that it had referred the case to Biden, and urged him to \u201creflect on the great lengths that we have gone to to address any national security concerns that have been raised and the significant commitments we have made to grow U. S. Steel, protect American jobs, and strengthen the entire American steel industry, which will enhance American national security.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are confident that our transaction should and will be approved if it is fairly evaluated on its merits,\u201d it said in a statement.",
      "A growing number of conservatives have publicly backed the deal, as Nippon Steel began to win over some steelworkers union members and officials in areas near its blast furnaces in Pennsylvania and Indiana. Many backers said Nippon Steel has a stronger financial balance sheet than rival Cleveland-Cliffs to invest the necessary cash to upgrade aging U.S. Steel blast furnaces.",
      "Nippon Steel pledged to invest $2.7 billion in United Steelworkers-represented facilities, including U.S. Steel\u2019s blast furnaces, and promised not to import steel slabs that would compete with the blast furnaces.",
      "It also pledged to protect U.S. Steel in trade matters and to not lay off employees or close plants during the term of the basic labor agreement. Earlier this month, it offered $5,000 in closing bonuses to U.S. Steel employees, a nearly $100 million expense.",
      "Nippon Steel also said it was best positioned to help American steel compete in an industry dominated by the Chinese.",
      "The proposed sale came during a tide of renewed political support for rebuilding America\u2019s manufacturing sector, a presidential campaign in which Pennsylvania was a prime battleground, and a long stretch of protectionist U.S. tariffs that analysts say has helped reinvigorate domestic steel.",
      "Chaired by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, CFIUS screens business deals between U.S. firms and foreign investors and can block sales or force parties to change the terms of an agreement to protect national security.",
      "Congress significantly expanded the committee's powers through the 2018 Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act, known as FIRRMA.",
      "In September, Biden issued an executive order broadening the factors the committee should consider when reviewing deals \u2014 such as how they impact the U.S. supply chain or if they put Americans\u2019 personal data at risk.",
      "Nippon Steel has factories in the U.S., Mexico, China and Southeast Asia. It supplies the world\u2019s top automakers, including Toyota Motor Corp., and makes steel for railways, pipes, appliances and skyscrapers.",

Starbucks said it has committed to an annual pay increase of 1.5% or more for unionized workers. If the company gave a lower increase to non-union workers in any given year, it still would give union workers a 1.5% increase.",

      "In 2018, Ford recalled around 1.5 million Ford Focus sedans from the 2012-2018 model years because they could lose power. The issue was a malfunctioning canister purge valve and software that didn\u2019t adequately detect when it was stuck open.

      "PUERTO JIM\u00c9NEZ, Costa Rica -- The endangered Geoffrey\u2019s spider monkeys that dangle high in the rainforest canopy are elusive and hard for scientists to track.",
      "So biologist Jenna Lawson hid 350 audio monitors in trees across Costa Rica's lush Osa Peninsula to spy on them.",
      "The devices recorded the sounds of the forest and surrounding countryside for a week, collecting so much data that Lawson could have spent years listening to it all.",
      "Instead, she fed it into artificial intelligence systems trained to instantly recognize spider monkey calls and detect where the animals traveled. One of the world\u2019s largest acoustic wildlife studies when Lawson began the project in 2021, it revealed troubling findings about the health of a treasured wildlife refuge.",
      "More of this AI-assisted wildlife surveillance is \u201curgently needed\u201d as some 28% of all plant and animal species are now at risk of extinction, according to a paper published in the academic journal Science this summer. Researchers from Dutch and Danish universities showed that machine-learning techniques can \u201chandle huge amounts of data and uncover sound patterns, allowing for faster, cheaper, and better ecological studies\u201d that can aid in biodiversity conservation. But many technical challenges remain.",
      "Tech giant Microsoft's philanthropic AI for Good Lab announced this month it is hoping to answer some of those technical challenges with a new kind of hardware and computing system for eavesdropping on the planet's wildest places.",
      "\u201cThose remote places are also the most important places on the Earth from a biodiversity perspective,\u201d said Microsoft's chief data scientist, Juan Lavista Ferres, in an interview last week by video call from Colombia, where a research team was preparing to test the new approach.",
      "Powered by the sun and energy-efficient AI computer chips, the devices can run for years rather than weeks without human intervention. And they can regularly transmit their data online via low-Earth orbit satellites. It's called Sparrow, short for Solar-Powered Acoustic and Remote Recording Observation Watch.",
      "Pablo Arbelaez, director of an AI-focused research center at the University of the Andes, said a first Sparrow test will happen in a jungle preserve along Colombia's largest river, the Magdalena. Eventually, the researchers hope to get a better idea of how deforestation \u2014 and efforts to reverse it \u2014 is affecting the population behavior of jaguars, blue-beaked paujil birds, spider monkeys and other endangered species.",
      "Another project closer to Microsoft headquarters will monitor forests in Washington state's Cascade Mountains. By late 2025, Lavista Ferres plans to have devices on all continents, from remote corners of the Amazon rainforest to gorilla habitats of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. That will then be \u201copen-sourced\u201d to make it accessible to a wide body of researchers in real time, but with measures to obscure sensitive location data.",
      "\u201cWhat we don\u2019t want is these devices to ever be used for poachers to understand where the animals are,\u201d Lavista Ferres said.",
      "It was a concern about encroachments on Costa Rican spider monkey habitat that led Lawson, then at Imperial College London, to undertake her ambitious bio-acoustic study three years ago. She persuaded landowners to let her place recording devices on their properties outside Corcovado National Park, a jewel of Costa Rica's decades-long efforts to preserve biodiversity by encouraging wildlife tourism.",
      "\u201cShe basically realized the spider monkey is in a really critical situation,\u201d said local environmentalist and bug scientist Jim C\u00f3rdoba-Alfaro. On a follow-up visit last year, he and Lawson trekked across a private reserve with an Associated Press reporter to observe the monkeys and check on the audio monitors.",
      "Compared to the charismatic capuchin monkey and the notoriously loud howler monkey -- both commonly seen or heard throughout Costa Rica \u2014 spider monkeys are far more wary of humans and the changes they bring.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re the most sensitive of the primates that we have here,\u201d said Lawson. \u201cThe spider monkey would be the first animal to leave when there\u2019s signs of trouble. They would be the last animal to come back once forests are restored because they need mature secondary and primary forest to be able to survive.\u201d",
      "The Royal Society of London in March 2023 published Lawson's findings of what the audio monitors revealed: the spider monkeys weren't going anywhere near paved roads or the plantations harvesting palm oil and teak wood that bisect the region's protected national parks. That meant government-designated wildlife corridors meant to extend their range through and beyond the Osa Peninsula were not working as well as designed. She came back to present those conclusions to local officials.",
      "After hours of searching, a troop of spider monkeys appeared \u2014 peering down at the humans who found them. Within moments, they were on their way again \u2014 extending their lanky arms and prehensile tails to grasp at trees and propel themselves across the canopy with spidery acrobatics.",
      "Unattended acoustic detection of animal sounds is valuable not just in rainforests but in a wide variety of ecosystems, according to the Science paper published earlier this year. For example, it could help sailors avoid colliding their ships with large baleen whales heard to be passing through a shipping channel.",
      "Lavista Ferres said there are still numerous challenges to overcome, from humidity that can fray jungle monitors to elephants in African savannas unintentionally knocking them off a tree.",
      "Lawson said using the audio monitors to capture the spider monkey's distinctive whinny enables biologists to study a larger area at lower cost, but also provides a truer account of how the monkeys behave without scientists following them around.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re reducing our influence on their behavior,\u201d she said. \u201dAnd also \u2014 they don\u2019t want us here.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 23 Dec 2024 10:42:36 -0500",
    "summary": "In Nigeria, the first part of a $1 billion project to clean up Ogoniland in the Niger Delta, where there have been thousands of oil spills, was a &ldquo;total failure.&rdquo;",
    "story": [
      "In Nigeria, the first part of a $1 billion project to clean up Ogoniland in the Niger Delta, where there have been thousands of oil spills, was a \u201ctotal failure.\u201d",
      "As it passed above the Niger Delta in 2021, a satellite took an image. It showed acres of land, scraped bare. The site, outside the city of Port Harcourt, was on a cleanup list kept by the United Nations Environment Programme, supposed to be restored to green farmland as the Delta was before thousands of oil spills turned it into a byword for pollution. Instead the land was left a sandy \u201cmoonscape\u201d unusable for farming, according to U.N. documents.",
      "That failed cleanup was not an exception, records obtained by The Associated Press show. Previously unreported investigations, emails, letters to Nigerian ministers and minutes from meetings make clear that senior U.N. officials were increasingly concerned that the Nigerian agency in charge of cleaning up crude oil spills has been a \u201ctotal failure.\u201d",
      "The agency, known as Hyprep, selected cleanup contractors who had no relevant experience, according to a U.N. review. It sent soil samples to laboratories that didn't have the equipment for tests they claimed to perform. Auditors were physically blocked from making sure work had been completed.",
      "A former Nigerian minister of the environment told the AP that the majority of cleanup companies are owned by politicians, and minutes show similar views were shared by U.N. officials.",
      "It wasn\u2019t supposed to be this way.",
      "There have been thousands of crude oil spills in the tidal mangroves and farmlands of the Niger Delta since oil drilling and production began in the 1950s. Reports and studies document what is widely known here: People often wash, drink, fish and cook in contaminated water.",
      "Spills still occur frequently. The Ogboinbiri community in Bayelsa state suffered its fourth spill in three months in November, harming farm fields, streams and the fish people rely on.",
      "\u201cWe bought the land in 2023; we have not harvested anything from the farmland; both the profit, our interest, everything is gone,\u201d said Timipre Bridget, a farmer in the community. \u201cNo way to survive with our children again.\u201d",
      "Many of the spills are caused by lawbreakers illegally tapping into pipelines to siphon off crude oil they process into gasoline in makeshift refineries.",
      "After a major U.N. survey of spills more than a decade ago, oil companies agreed to create a $1 billion cleanup fund for the worst affected area, Ogoniland, and Shell, the largest private oil and gas company in the country, contributed $300 million. The Nigerian government handled the funds and the U.N. was relegated to an advisory role.",
      "To oversee the work, the government created the Hydrocarbon Pollution Remediation Project, or Hyprep. It first addressed sites that were supposed to be easy to clean, like the one outside Port Harcourt. Then it would move on to complex ones, where oil had sunk more deeply into the ground.",
      "But a confidential investigation by U.N. scientists last year found the site outside Port Harcourt was left with a \u201ccomplete absence of topsoil\u201d and almost seven times more petroleum in the subsoil than Nigerian health limits.",
      "The company that performed that work has since had its contract revoked, Nenibarini Zabbey, the current director of Hyprep, who took over last year, told the AP.",
      "The head of operations when the contract was awarded, Philip Shekwolo, called allegations in the U.N. documents \u201cbaseless, mischievous and cheap blackmail.\u201d",
      "Shekwolo, who used to head up oil spill remediation for Shell, said by email he knows more about tackling pollution than any U.N. expert and insists the cleanup has been successful.",
      "But the documents show U.N. officials raising the alarm about Hyprep with Nigerian officials since 2021, when Shekwolo was acting chief.",
      "A January 2022 U.N. review found that of 41 contractors allowed to clean up spill sites, 21 had no relevant experience. Not one was judged competent enough to handle more polluted sites.",
      "They include Nigerian construction companies and general merchants. The websites of two construction firms, for example, Jukok International and Ministaco Nigeria, make no mention of pollution cleanups.",
      "In the minutes of a meeting with U.N. officials and Shell, Hyprep\u2019s own chief of communications, Joseph Kpobari, is shown to have said bad cleanups happen because his agency hired incompetent companies. The U.N. delegation warned that despite their inadequate work, these companies were being rewarded with contracts for tougher sites.",
      "Zabbey denied in an email this admission took place. The cleanup of the simple sites was not a failure, he insisted, because 16 out of 20 had now been certified as clean by Nigerian regulators and many returned to communities. Hyprep always complied with guidelines when issuing contracts, Zabbey said, and their monitors were U.N.-trained.",
      "Two sources close to the cleanup efforts in the Delta, speaking anonymously for fear of loss of business or employment, said test results held up by Hyprep as proof of cleanup could not have been real because when officials visited the laboratories, they found they did not have the equipment to perform those tests.",
      "In a letter to its customers, one laboratory in the U.K. frequently used by Hyprep acknowledged its tests for most of 2022 were flawed and unreliable. The U.K. laboratory accreditation service confirmed the lab\u2019s authorization to carry out the tests was suspended twice.",
      "Zabbey defended the cleanup agency in a statement to the AP, saying it monitors contractors more closely now. Labs adhere to Nigerian and U.N. recommendations and are frequently checked, he said, and the U.N. could have trained local lab staff if it chose to.",
      "The U.N. cited another problem \u2014 contractors were allowed to assess pollution levels at their sites. No government agency was setting a baseline for what needed to be cleaned up at oil-damaged sites. This meant companies were monitoring their own progress, effectively handed a \u201cblank check,\u201d U.N. Senior Project Advisor Iyenemi Kakulu is recorded as having said in minutes of a meeting in June of last year between the U.N., Hyprep and Shell.",
      "The U.N. warned the Nigerian government in an assessment in 2021 that spending at the cleanup agency was not being tracked. Internal auditors were viewed as \u201cthe enemy\u201d and \u201cdemonized for doing their job.\u201d Shekwolo\u2019s predecessor as head of Hyprep blocked new financial controls and \u201cphysically prevented\u201d auditors from seeing if work had been performed properly before paying contractors, according to the U.N. assessment.",
      "Zabbey said this too, has changed since that assessment: The audit team is now valued, he said, and accounts are now audited annually, although he provided only one audit cover letter. In it, the accounting firm asked what steps had been taken to \u201ccorrect the identified weaknesses.\u201d",
      "Shekwolo referred the AP to the office of Nigeria\u2019s president, which did not respond to a request to show how funds are being spent. Environment Minister Iziaq Salako\u2019s office declined an interview.",
      "Sharon Ikeazor was born in Nigeria, educated in Britain, and spent decades as a lawyer before entering politics. In 2019, she was appointed environment minister of Nigeria. She was well aware of Hyprep\u2019s alleged failings and determined to address them.",
      "\u201cThere wasn\u2019t any proper remediation being done,\u201d she told the AP in a phone interview. \u201cThe companies had no competence whatsoever.\u201d",
      "In February 2022, she received a letter from senior U.N. official Muralee Thummarukudy, with what experts say is unusually strong language in diplomacy. It warned of \u201csignificant opportunities for malpractice within the contract award process,\u201d in the Nigerian oil cleanup work. Ikeazor removed Shekwolo as acting chief of Hyprep the next month, explaining that she believed he was too close to the politicians.",
      "The \u201cmajority\u201d of cleanup companies were owned by politicians, she said. The few competent companies \u201cwouldn\u2019t get the big jobs.\u201d",
      "One of Shekwolo\u2019s roles, Ikeazor said, was to deem who was competent for contract awards. Ikeazor said Shekwolo\u2019s former employer Shell and the U.N. warned her about him, something Shekwolo says he was unaware of.",
      "When she hired a new chief of Hyprep was, she had him review every suspect contract awarded over the years and investigate the cleanup companies.",
      "\u201cThat sent shockwaves around the political class,\u201d said Ikeazor. \u201cThey all had interests.\"",
      "\"That was when the battle started,\u201d she said.",
      "It was a short battle, and she lost. She was replaced as environment minister and Shekwolo was rehired. He had been gone for two months.",
      "Shekwolo says the only politicians he was close to were the two environment ministers he served under. He was never given a reason for his removal, he said, and suggested Ikeazor simply didn\u2019t like him.",
      "Last year, the U.N. Environment Programme broke ties with the Nigerian oil spill agency, explaining its five-year consultancy was over. The last support ended in June.",
      "Ikeazor said the real reason U.N. pulled out was frustration over corruption. The two sources close to the project concurred the U.N. left because it couldn\u2019t continue to be associated with the Nigerian cleanup organization.",
      "Zabbey responded that he believes the U.N. merely changed its goals and moved on.",

    "story": [
      "As many as one-third of people displaced by the August 2023 Maui fires wound up in the homes of friends and family in the weeks after the disaster",
      "WAILUKU, Hawaii -- The Lahaina home Tamara Akiona shared with 10 people was never quiet, and she loved it that way.",
      "Akiona, her husband, uncle, stepdaughter, and her best friend\u2019s family filled the house once owned by her grandparents, with four bedrooms, two living rooms and a spacious backyard.",
      "She remembers the happy anticipation of hearing the front door open and not knowing who'd come home. Someone was always in the kitchen cooking. Neighbors gathered in the evening to chat and share food from their gardens. Kids chased the shave-ice man as he rolled past in his truck.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the stuff I miss,\u201d said Akiona, 51. \u201cWe just don\u2019t have that anymore.\u201d",
      "The home was one of the 1,898 residential structures that burned in the August 2023 Maui fires, which killed at least 102 people and displaced 12,000. Now Akiona and her husband live in a two-bedroom condo in Wailuku, 40 minutes from Lahaina. When they moved, she insisted her uncle, Ron Sambrano, come with them.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like \u2018Lilo and Stitch,\u2019\u201d said Akiona, referring to the Disney movie about family bonds. \u201cNobody\u2019s left behind.\u201d",
      "Estimates say up to one-third of those displaced by the Maui fires wound up in the homes of friends and family in the weeks after the disaster. It was a natural solution on an island already struggling with a housing crisis and where values like generosity and family are deeply rooted. But increasing a household's size overnight can be stressful, and expensive.",
      "The Akionas and families like them received support from a first-of-its-kind disaster-relief program. For one year, the Council for Native Hawaiian Advancement's Host Housing Support Program gave people who took in displaced loved ones stipends of $500 per person, up to $2,000, each month.",
      "Disaster responders and advocates say it\u2019s a powerful example of how to shape support around survivors' cultural values and preferences, while alleviating the demand for temporary housing and keeping families and communities intact.",
      "\u201cEvery single time we see a megafire we see mass displacement, and the most common displacement we see is that people then double and triple up with relatives and friends, sometimes for a few years even,\u201d said Jennifer Gray Thompson, CEO of the disaster-advocacy nonprofit After The Fire. \u201cBut what they never get is actual money to do it.\u201d",
      "Right after the fires, the Council for Native Hawaiian Advancement, or CNHA, quickly learned how many displaced were bunking with friends and family \u2014 to avoid the hotels where 8,000 people were temporarily sheltered, because they couldn\u2019t find an affordable rental, or because they simply preferred it.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s very normal in Hawaii where you lean on your friends and family,\u201d said Kuhio Lewis, CEO of the 23-year-old Oahu nonprofit. \u201cThat\u2019s just part of the fabric of Hawaii, it\u2019s this aloha spirit that\u2019s unique to us.\u201d",
      "CNHA recognized that these informal living arrangements would be essential to keeping families housed and decided to make them part of its overall disaster response. It launched a small pilot program in October 2023 that paid households $375 per person for six months. Both host and guest went through a vetting process, including interviews and an in-person home inspection.",
      "With donations from the Hawaii Community Foundation and the American Red Cross, CNHA increased the payment to $500 per person and extended the program to 12 months. The $2.5 million effort supported 672 displaced people staying in 253 households.",
      "The money helped the Akionas pay the new condo HOA fee and gas to commute back to Lahaina. It provided a cushion when Tamara\u2019s work managing a vacation rental slowed and Kawehi, 50, took on a second job valeting cars at a hotel only to fall and break his knee.",
      "Having their own stability made it possible for the Akionas to help Tamara's uncle Ron Sambrano, too.",
      "Sambrano, 60, watched the neighborhood burn that August night. For months after, he would pull his hat over his eyes whenever he had to ride through Lahaina.",
      "\u201cIt was a special place, in less than 24 hours, all that\u2019s wiped out,\u201d he said. \u201cSo it\u2019s pretty traumatic.\u201d",
      "Living with his niece and nephew has been a comfort. \u201cThey\u2019re doing their best to help me out and just make things work,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a blessing. I could be on the street without them.\"",
      "While it\u2019s common for disaster survivors to get financial assistance to stay in hotel rooms or temporary rentals, paying hosts to take in loved ones hadn't been tried in the United States. Doing so can help the entire recovery, said Gray Thompson of After The Fire.",
      "\u201cIt has a lot of benefits people might not understand at first glance,\u201d she said. Placing people in already occupied homes can take pressure off a tight housing market as hundreds or thousands of households seek shelter. It can prevent kids from having to change schools, and puts money back into the local economy by helping families afford to shop for groceries and other needs.",
      "Perhaps most important, host programs can help keep families and communities intact. In the year after the fire, estimates say more than 1,500 Lahaina families left Maui due to a lack of housing and job options.",
      "\u201cWe need people to stay home in Hawaii,\u201d said Lewis. All of CNHA's housing initiatives since the fires \u2014 paying hosts, leasing rentals to families, covering rent, and even building temporary houses \u2014 are aimed at preventing further erosion of the community.",
      "Helping people stay with loved ones had unexpected upsides, too. Of the 6,000 households CNHA has helped since the fires, it found the ones in the host program moved through FEMA and Small Business Administration applications months more quickly than the others.",
      "\u201cThe greatest strength of the program was to allow the survivors time and the ability to heal comfortably, while pursuing the more challenging aspects of disaster recovery,\u201d said Skye Kolealani Razon-Olds, director of resiliency for CNHA's Maui programs.",
      "While the first-of-its-kind program ended in November, Maui isn't the only community still struggling with mass displacement. In North Carolina, 10,000 households were placed in hotel rooms after Hurricane Helene, and half are still there.",
      "When asked if the program could be replicated in other communities, an American Red Cross spokesperson said the group \u201cwill apply the successes and lessons learned for potential use in future responses.\u201d",
      "CNHA is entering its next phase, helping people rebuild and return to Lahaina. It partnered with Maui architects to offer free and reduced design plans and is giving almost 200 families grants of up to $15,000 to cover pre-building costs like permit fees, among other initiatives.",
      "The Akionas want to rebuild their home, eventually. They\u2019re waiting on a lot survey. Water hasn\u2019t been restored to their street. With building costs so expensive, they might wait until they can afford to build a house they want to grow old in.",
      "In the meantime, most of their 11-person household has moved to Wailuku or to Kihei, a 20-minute drive away. \u201cFor the most part we feel like we have our family unit,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re as close as we can be now.\u201d",

      "The move could usher in an end to a protracted political crisis in the European Union country following the annulment of a presidential election by a top court. Parliament approved the new administration in a 240-143 vote in Romania's 466-seat legislature.",
      "The new coalition is made up of the leftist Social Democratic Party, or PSD, the center-right National Liberal Party, PNL, the small ethnic Hungarian UDMR party and national minorities. It caps a month-long period of turmoil in which far-right nationalists made significant gains in a Dec. 1 parliamentary election, a week after a first-round presidential race saw the far-right outsider Calin Georgescu emerge as the front-runner.",
      "\u201cIt will not be an easy mandate for the future government,\u201d Ciolacu, whose PSD party topped the polls in the parliamentary election, said in a statement Monday.",
      "\u201cWe are aware that we are in the midst of a deep political crisis,\" he said. \"It is also a crisis of trust, and this coalition aims to regain the trust of citizens, the trust of the people.\u201d",
      "Romani's 16 ministerial positions will be shared among the parties, which will hold a slim majority in the legislature. It's widely seen as a tactical partnership to shut out far-right nationalists whose voices found fertile ground amid high living costs and a sluggish economy.",
      "Ciolacu, who came third in the first-round presidential ballot despite polls indicating he would win the most votes, has served as prime minister since June 2023.",
      "After parliament\u2019s approval, President Klaus Iohannis swore in the new government and warned the new Cabinet that it's entering a \u201cdifficult new period\u201d in which \u201cfor many Romanians, there are major concerns.\u201d",

      "\u201cWe go through complicated times, but I think we all learned from mistakes of the past,\u201d Ciolacu said. \u201cI hope that together with my colleagues in the coalition, we\u2019ll find the best solutions to get past the challenges we have in front of us.\u201d",
      "Ciolacu said that the new government would aim to quickly organize the rerun of the presidential election in which the new coalition has agreed to put forward an agreed common pro-European candidate.",
      "Cristian Andrei, a political consultant based in Bucharest, said that the new government made up of the same political parties will likely embrace \u201csoft populist\u201d rhetoric such as economic patriotism, anti-austerity, and a peace solution in neighboring Ukraine to counter the rise of far-right populism.",
      "\u201cThis will be a way to answer the concerns of many Romanians who voted for populists \u2026 but will not solve the fundamental problem of trust,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only decisive factor now will be who and how convincing the pro-European candidates will be against this popular revolt.\u201d",
      "George Simion, the leader of the far-right Alliance for the Unity of Romanians, which came second in the parliamentary election, said that all lawmakers from his party on Monday would vote against the Ciolacu government.",
      "In 2021, the PSD and the PNL also formed an unlikely but increasingly strained coalition together with UDMR, which exited the Cabinet last year after a power-sharing dispute.",

      "Japanese automakers Nissan and Honda have announced plans to work toward a merger that would catapult them to a top position in an industry in the midst of tectonic shifts as it transitions away from its reliance on fossil fuels",
      "TOKYO -- Japanese automakers Honda and Nissan have announced plans to work toward a merger that would form the world\u2019s third-largest automaker by sales, as the industry undergoes dramatic changes in its transition away from fossil fuels.",
      "The two companies said they had signed a memorandum of understanding on Monday and that smaller Nissan alliance member Mitsubishi Motors Corp. also had agreed to join the talks on integrating their businesses.",
      "Automakers in Japan have lagged behind their big rivals in electric vehicles and are trying to cut costs and make up for lost time as newcomers like China's BYD and EV market leader Tesla devour market share.",
      "Honda's president, Toshihiro Mibe, said Honda and Nissan will attempt to unify their operations under a joint holding company. Honda will lead the new management, retaining the principles and brands of each company. They aim to have a formal merger agreement by June and to complete the deal and list the holding company on the Tokyo Stock Exchange by August 2026, he said.",
      "No dollar value was given and the formal talks are just starting, Mibe said.",
      "There are \u201cpoints that need to be studied and discussed,\u201d he said. \u201cFrankly speaking, the possibility of this not being implemented is not zero.\u201d",
      "A merger could result in a behemoth worth more than $50 billion based on the market capitalization of all three automakers. Together, Honda, Nissan and Mitsubishi would gain scale to compete with Toyota Motor Corp. and with Germany\u2019s Volkswagen AG. Toyota has technology partnerships with Japan\u2019s Mazda Motor Corp. and Subaru Corp.",
      "News of a possible merger surfaced earlier this month, with unconfirmed reports saying Taiwan iPhone maker Foxconn was seeking to tie up with Nissan by buying shares from the Japan's company's other alliance partner, Renault SA of France.",
      "Nissan's CEO Makoto Uchida said Foxconn had not directly approach his company. He also acknowledged that Nissan's situation was \u201csevere.\u201d",
      "Even after a merger Toyota, which rolled out 11.5 million vehicles in 2023, would remain the leading Japanese automaker. If they join, the three smaller companies would make about 8 million vehicles. In 2023, Honda made 4 million and Nissan produced 3.4 million. Mitsubishi Motors made just over 1 million.",
      "\u201cWe have come to the realization that in order for both parties to be leaders in this mobility transformation, it is necessary to make a more bold change than a collaboration in specific areas,\u201d Mibe said.",
      "Nissan, Honda and Mitsubishi earlier agreed to share components for electric vehicles like batteries and to jointly research software for autonomous driving to adapt better to electrification.",
      "Nissan has struggled following a scandal that began with the arrest of its former chairman Carlos Ghosn in late 2018 on charges of fraud and misuse of company assets, allegations that he denies. He eventually was released on bail and fled to Lebanon.",
      "Speaking Monday to reporters in Tokyo via a video link, Ghosn derided the planned merger as a \u201cdesperate move.\u201d",
      "From Nissan, Honda could get truck-based body-on-frame large SUVs such as the Armada and Infiniti QX80 that Honda doesn\u2019t have, with large towing capacities and good off-road performance, Sam Fiorani, vice president of AutoForecast Solutions, told The Associated Press.",
      "Nissan also has years of experience building batteries and electric vehicles, and gas-electric hybrid powertrains that could help Honda in developing its own EVs and next generation of hybrids, he said.",
      "But the company said in November that it was slashing 9,000 jobs, or about 6% of its global work force, and reducing its global production capacity by 20% after reporting a quarterly loss of 9.3 billion yen ($61 million).",
      "It recently reshuffled its management and Uchida, its chief executive, took a 50% pay cut while acknowledging responsibility for the financial woes, saying Nissan needed to become more efficient and respond better to market tastes, rising costs and other global changes.",
      "\u201cWe anticipate that if this integration comes to fruition, we will be able to deliver even greater value to a wider customer base,\u201d Uchida said.",
      "Fitch Ratings recently downgraded Nissan\u2019s credit outlook to \u201cnegative,\u201d citing worsening profitability, partly due to price cuts in the North American market. But it noted that it has a strong financial structure and solid cash reserves that amounted to 1.44 trillion yen ($9.4 billion).",
      "Nissan\u2019s share price also had fallen to the point where it is considered something of a bargain. On Monday, its Tokyo-traded shares gained 1.6%. They jumped more than 20% after news of the possible merger broke last week.",
      "Honda's shares surged 3.8%. Honda's net profit slipped nearly 20% in the first half of the April-March fiscal year from a year earlier, as its sales suffered in China.",
      "The merger reflects an industry-wide trend toward consolidation.",
      "At a routine briefing Monday, Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said he would not comment on details of the automakers' plans, but said Japanese companies need to stay competitive in the fast changing market.",
      "\u201cAs the business environment surrounding the automobile industry largely changes, with competitiveness in storage batteries and software is increasingly important, we expect measures needed to survive international competition will be taken,\" Hayashi said.",

    "story": [
      "The economic and technological rivalry between the U.S. and China has come to the drone market, where Chinese-made flying devices are a dominant player in America",
      "WASHINGTON -- Russell Hedrick, a North Carolina farmer, flies drones to spray fertilizers on his corn, soybean and wheat fields at a fraction of what it would cost him to use a conventional ground spreader.",
      "As a volunteer rescuer, Hedrick uses thermal drones to search for people trapped by mudslides and cargo drones to send water and baby formula to those who are stranded \u2014 something he did after Hurricane Helene.",
      "Now he is fretting that one day he will have to ground his drone fleet. Most commercial drones sold in the United States, including those used by Hedrick, are made in China. They have become a target of U.S. lawmakers, who see the dominance of Chinese drones not only as an espionage threat but as a commercial threat because they make it nearly impossible for American manufacturers to compete.",
      "It\u2019s another front in the U.S.-China economic and technological competition that\u2019s likely to intensify with the return to the White House in January of Republican Donald Trump, who has promised to get tough on China.",
      "Washington has already placed restrictions on Chinese telecommunications companies and imposed high tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles as the U.S. competes with China in semiconductors, artificial intelligence and other areas.",
      "A defense bill that Congress passed on Dec. 18 includes a clause to stop two Chinese companies from selling new drones in the U.S. if a review finds they pose \u201can unacceptable risk\u201d to American national security. Congress has banned federal agencies from acquiring Chinese drones, with some exceptions, and several states have barred publicly funded programs from using or procuring Chinese drones.",
      "A broader ban is worrisome for Americans for whom drones have become a part of their lives and work. It could disrupt wide-ranging operations, from law enforcement to mapping and filmmaking that drone operators say are viable because of the low cost and high performance of the Chinese drones. American-made drones just aren\u2019t comparable, they say.",
      "In Hickory, North Carolina, Hedrick began flying Chinese-made drones in 2019 to fertilize crops and monitor crop health. A drone spreader costs $35,000, while a conventional ground sprayer would set him back $250,000, he said.",
      "\u201cWith the drone efficiency, we are able to do things we were never able to do before: to apply fertilizer but use less, which is good for American consumers,\u201d Hedrick said.",
      "But it\u2019s precisely that reliance on Chinese drones that worries U.S. lawmakers.",
      "\u201cIt is strategically irresponsible to allow Communist China to be our drone factory,\u201d argued Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., who has been tapped by Trump to be the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. She led earlier House efforts to ban new Chinese drones.",
      "It was the role of drones in everyday life that drove Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., to get Congress to restrict the purchase of Chinese drones by federal agencies. Those restrictions were included in a defense bill that Democratic President Joe Biden signed last year.",
      "Scott has compared Chinese drones to spy balloons that could \u201cgather data or carry harmful payloads\u201d across America, posing risks to military bases, critical infrastructure and natural resources.",
      "Michael Robbins, president and chief executive officer of AUVSI, an advocacy group for unmanned vehicles such as drones, opposes an immediate ban. Instead, his group has urged the government to support the U.S. drone-making industry through investment so it can catch up with its Chinese competitors in both capability and cost.",
      "He applauds Congress for addressing some of the issues in the 2025 defense budget, including promoting investment in autonomous technology and working to develop a secure supply chain for U.S. drone manufacturing.",
      "That vulnerability was clear earlier this year when Beijing sanctioned the U.S. drone maker Skydio, forcing it to ration its batteries sourced from China.",
      "\u201cThis is an attempt to eliminate the leading American drone company and deepen the world\u2019s dependence on Chinese drone suppliers,\u201d wrote Adam Bry, chief executive officer of Skydio.",
      "Citing security interests, China has restricted exports to the U.S. of drone parts, including motors, flight controllers and imaging equipment.",
      "John Goodson, CEO of Darkhive, a San Antonio-based drone maker, said a ban would not stop Chinese drone makers from selling their products elsewhere in the world but could hurt U.S. drone companies that rely on China for parts.",
      "For now, it remains unrealistic to ban Chinese drones when there are few comparable products, said Faine Greenwood, a drone enthusiast who writes extensively about drones. \u201cIf we ban the Chinese drones, we knock out many amazing things we do.\u201d",
      "The best-known Chinese drones are those by DJI Technology Co., a company founded in 2006 and based in the southern city of Shenzhen. It's named in the defense spending bill, along with another Chinese company, Autel Robotics.",
      "DJI has the lion's share of the global drone market and is the dominant player in the U.S. market. Its devices are known for their affordability and high performance. They are even used on the battlefield in Ukraine by both sides, even though DJI does not make military drones.",
      "DJI's drones have been used by first responders to locate disaster victims, mappers to survey roads and utility lines, mosquito control officers to reach swarms of larvae, and filmmakers to capture aerial footage. Police use them to help prevent crime and find missing people.",
      "Hedrick, the North Carolina farmer, mobilized drone search efforts as a volunteer after Helene hit. On the first night, he and his teammates located 150 stranded people. When they could not be immediately rescued, Hedrick said his team used DJI cargo drones to send in supplies.",
      "\u201cI am not going to say I won\u2019t love to have U.S. drones, but I don\u2019t see the American drones as anywhere close to the DJI drones in terms of reliability, ease of use, and just the user-friendly software,\u201d Hedrick said. \u201cThe U.S. drones are not as good as the DJI ones but cost twice as much.\u201d",
      "But as U.S.-China relations have soured, DJI drones have come under scrutiny. The U.S. government has put the company on several blacklists, saying it violates human rights by supplying drones to Chinese police to surveil members of the ethnic Uyghur minority, and alleging links to the Chinese military.",
      "DJI has denied wrongdoing and is suing the Pentagon over the designation that it is a Chinese military company. U.S. customs officials also have blocked some DJI shipments over concerns that the products might have been made with forced labor. DJI has called it \u201ca customs-related misunderstanding.\u201d",
      "As for the defense bill, DIJ said it contains no provision that would allow the company to defend itself. \u201cWe call on a relevant technical intelligence agency to undertake an audit of our products, and we ask for a fair right of reply to any findings,\u201d DJI said.",
      "The Chinese Embassy in Washington said China opposes what it calls the politicization of trade.",
      "\u201cThe Chinese government firmly supports Chinese companies in carrying out international trade and cooperation in drones for civilian use, and opposes certain countries\u2019 frequent illegal sanctions on Chinese companies and individuals on the grounds of so-called national security,\u201d Liu Pengyu, the embassy spokesman, said in a statement.",
      "Several states have already restricted the use of Chinese drones. In Tennessee, public agencies, including police and fire departments, are no longer allowed to purchase DJI drones.",
      "That caused a headache for Capt. Chris Lowe of the Kingsport Fire Department. After his department lost a DJI Mavic Pro drone, he was quoted $5,000 for a replacement from an approved list of drones, when another DJI Mavic Pro would cost $1,000 to $1,500.",
      "\u201cBasically it would be a DJI clone but doesn\u2019t have all the capabilities,\u201d Lowe said of the alternative. Without any state assistance, he said he would either forgo a new drone or tighten the belt in equipment maintenance elsewhere. He said the department has used drones to scope out wildfires, chemical leaks and disaster scenes and to search for missing people. \u201cIt's about life and death,\u201d he said.",
      "In Wimberley, Texas, Gene Robinson has used high-resolution drone images to analyze differences in vegetation to discover buried bodies. He said he helped police find a victim's buried arm, making prosecution possible. Robinson doesn\u2019t think there\u2019s a viable alternative to the DJI drone he uses.",
      "He said his project at Texas State University's Forensic Anthropology Center would be \u201cdeader than a doornail\u201d if there's a national ban on Chinese-made drones.",
      "At the Interior Department, the policy against foreign-made drones has hamstrung its drone operations, resulting in the \u201closs of opportunities to collect data on landscape, natural and cultural resources, wildlife and infrastructure,\" according to a September report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office.",
      "In Florida, law enforcement officers last year complained to the state senate that a ban on state-funded agencies operating Chinese-made drones left them with costlier aircraft that didn't perform as well. That prompted state lawmakers to appropriate $25 million to help government-run drone programs acquire compliant models.",
      "Christopher Todd, executive director of the not-for-profit group Airborne International Response Team, described the ban and the subsequent switch as \u201can absolute mess.\"",
      "\u201cLawmakers failed to understand that this issue is far more complicated than simply changing from one drone to another,\" he said. \u201cYou need to learn a new user interface with new shortcuts and new protocols, and then you need to change all of the software and accessories and re-examine all of your network configurations to accommodate the technology change.\"",
      "But the financial assistance as well as training programs, such as the one provided by his group, made the transition possible, he said.",
      "More than 90% of law enforcement agencies in Florida used DJI drones in 2022, and the share plummeted to about 14% after the ban, according to Todd's group.",
      "In Orange County, where Orlando is located, the sheriff's office said it spent nearly $580,000 to replace 18 noncompliant drones last year and received nearly $400,000 in reimbursements from the state.",
      "\u201cThe transition has gone well and has simultaneously increased our drone fleet with better capabilities and technology,\u201d the sheriff's office said.",

      "ORLANDO, Fla. -- If Jimmy Butler wants a trade, the Miami Heat have no plans to make him happy.",
      "Heat President Pat Riley \u2014 in a rare move \u2014 spoke out to address rumors Thursday, saying the team has no plans to trade Butler. It's a clear sign that, if necessary, the team will be willing to let Butler leave as a free agent and get nothing in return.",
      "\u201cWe usually don\u2019t comment on rumors, but all this speculation has become a distraction to the team and is not fair to the players and coaches,\" Riley said in a release distributed by the team. \"Therefore, we will make it clear \u2014 we are not trading Jimmy Butler.\u201d",
      "The Heat play in Orlando on Thursday. Butler did not fly with the team to Orlando on Wednesday night, and his intentions for future games seem a bit unclear as well.",
      "Butler has not asked the Heat for a trade, but ESPN, citing sources it did not name, reported Wednesday that the six-time All-Star wants a trade by the league\u2019s Feb. 6 deadline and is open to joining teams such as Phoenix, Golden State, Houston and Dallas.",
      "\u201cYou have to compartmentalize in this business,\u201d Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said Thursday at the team's morning shootaround in Orlando. \u201cWe want Jimmy here. There\u2019s no ifs, ands or buts about it. And it\u2019s just unfortunate that you have to control or deal with a lot of the noise on the outside.\u201d",
      "Butler, to be fair, has fueled some of the noise.",
      "The primary colors of his reportedly preferred teams include orange, yellow, red and blue. Butler\u2019s hair, perhaps not coincidentally, has been tinged in those colors at times in recent weeks.",
      "\u201cI actually like it,\u201d Butler said earlier this month when asked about being linked to trade talks and speculation. \u201cIt\u2019s good to be talked about. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s such a thing as bad publicity \u2014 to a point.\u201d",
      "Miami, if it doesn\u2019t trade Butler, would run the risk of potentially losing him for nothing as a free agent next summer. He's making $49 million this season and has a player option for $52 million next season.",
      "Riley's statement is another development in a long-running saga involving Butler\u2019s future with the Heat, one that began picking up steam back in May when Riley was noncommittal about giving Butler an extension over the summer.",
      "Butler is eligible for an extension that would guarantee him $113 million for the 2025-26 and 2026-27 seasons. But he is 35 and misses, on average, about one out of every four games in his Heat tenure.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s a big decision on our part to commit those kinds of resources unless you have somebody who\u2019s going to be there and available every single night,\u201d Riley said in May. \u201cThat\u2019s the truth.\u201d",
      "Butler twisted an ankle in Miami\u2019s loss to Oklahoma City on Friday but missed the remainder of that game and the next two Heat games \u2014 at Orlando last Saturday and against Brooklyn on Monday \u2014 with illness, not the ankle, cited as the reason.",
      "Butler has helped Miami make the NBA Finals twice in his Heat tenure. He is averaging 18.5 points, 5.8 rebounds and 4.9 assists this season.",

      "The Detroit Red Wings have fired coach Derek Lalonde and named Todd McLellan as his replacement",
      "The Detroit Red Wings fired coach Derek Lalonde on Thursday and named Todd McLellan as his replacement, a major change by general manager Steve Yzerman more than a third of the way through another disappointing season in the place known as \u201cHockeytown.\u201d",
      "The move the day after Christmas comes with the Red Wings on a three-game skid and having lost nine of their past 12. They've lost 21 of their first 34 games this season and are above only the lowly Buffalo Sabres in the Eastern Conference.",
      "Lalonde was nearly midway through his third season with Detroit after winning the Stanley Cup twice as an assistant with Tampa Bay. Yzerman inherited Jeff Blashill as coach when he left the Lightning for the Red Wings in 2019 and hired Lalonde in the summer of 2022 with the goal of getting the team back in the playoffs.",
      "Despite signing three-time Stanley Cup champion Patrick Kane in 2023 and re-signing him last offseason, the success has not approached the Red Wings\u2019 glory days when they won the Cup four times between 1996-97 and 2007-08 \u2014 three times with Yzerman as captain and once with him working in the front office. Instead, their playoff drought is on track to reach a ninth year \u2014 second-longest in the league behind Buffalo.",
      "Associate coach Bob Boughner was also fired and Trent Yawney hired to work on McLellan\u2019s staff as an assistant. McLellan signed a multiyear contract to start his fourth NHL head coaching job after stints with San Jose, Edmonton and Los Angeles.",
      "McLellan, 57, coached his team to the playoffs in nine of the 14 full seasons he was in charge behind the bench. He returns to the Motor City after getting his first job in the league as a Red Wings assistant in 2005 and serving under coach Mike Babcock on the 2008 title run.",
      "The Melville, Saskatchewan, native was hired by the Sharks just after and led them on three trips to the West final. Most recently, McLellan was fired by the Kings in February during the All-Star break and interviewed for other vacancies since.",
      "This is the fourth coaching change around the NHL this season and 15th this calendar year, counting Rick Bowness' retirement in Winnipeg. The Boston Bruins in November fired Jim Montgomery, who was hired by the St. Louis Blues less than a week later, and the Chicago Blackhawks replaced Luke Richardson with Anders Sorensen in early December.",

      "\u201cThe transfer window in the winter is not easy, but even the players know that we have to add some new players,\u201d said Guardiola, who has had to cope without a host of key players, including Ballon d'Or winner Rodri, through injury this season.",

      "Bates used his platform as an NFL player to spread his love of Jesus in\u202f a prime-time interview on NBC \u202fafter lifting the Lions to a win over the Texans with a 52-yard field goal as time expired.",
      "A month later, Bates told The Associated Press it is a duty to share his Christian faith.",
      "\u201cThis doesn\u2019t happen without Jesus and by this, I mean any of this, like, living doesn\u2019t happen without Jesus dying on the cross,\u201d Bates said recently at the team\u2019s practice facility. \u201cHe put us on a stage to glorify his name.\u201d",
      "The\u202f NFL \u202fis filled with players and coaches who feel the same way.",
      "Quarterbacks\u202f C.J. Stroud \u202fof Houston,\u202f Kirk Cousins \u202fof Atlanta and\u202f Lamar Jackson \u202fof Baltimore along with Ravens coach\u202f John Harbaugh \u202fare among the many in the league who speak publicly about their Christian beliefs.",
      "Stroud, in particular, has been a source of inspiration for Bates. He especially admires how the quarterback regularly credits Jesus at press conferences.",
      "\u201cWhat he\u2019s been able to do in the media and spreading Jesus\u2019 love has been awesome to see,\u201d Bates said.",
      "Harbaugh started his latest postgame news conference, reminding reporters and anyone watching or listening that Christmas was coming up and shared the prayer the Ravens had just heard in the locker room.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a big football week, all right? It\u2019s also a big life week,\u201d Harbaugh said. \u201cIt\u2019s a big spiritual week.\u201d",

      "Although Christianity is the dominate religion at all levels of the sport, some Jewish and Muslim players have also used their platform to publicly share their faith. Recently, for example, Jake Retzlaff became the first Jewish quarterback to play for Brigham Young University, the Utah private school run by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. He has embraced his role as an ambassador of Judaism in football.",
      "In the NFL, Bates\u2019 story is perhaps one of the most unique in league history.",
      "He grew up about 30 miles northwest of Houston in Tomball, Texas, and played soccer at Central Arkansas before switching sports and transferring twice.",
      "Bates was a kickoff specialist for two seasons at Texas State and for one year at Arkansas, earning All-SEC honors in 2022.",
      "His hometown Texans signed him on Aug. 1, 2023, and waived him 11 days later to send him searching for a new career in the brick business.",

      "Bates, though, wasn\u2019t ready to hang up his cleats for good and went to an XFL \u202fshowcase in fall of 2023.",
      "\u201cMy last shot,\u201d he said.",
      "Bates did enough to get signed by the Michigan Panthers and made three field goals from at least 60 yards while playing for them in the United Football League, a team that shares the same home field with the Lions.",
      "Bates believes it was divine intervention.",
      "He has made the most of the opportunity, making game-winning kicks against NFC North rivals\u202f Minnesota \u202fand\u202f Green Bay \u202fas well as Houston. He earned the NFC special teams player of the month honors in November.",

      "The answer could be found on a white board in Paris.",
      "Golfers at the Olympics were asked to write their nicknames, countries, favorite Olympic sports and their goal in Paris. Most of the players said their goal was gold, or at least to win a medal.",
      "Scheffler wrote: Have fun.",
      "He shot 62 in the final round and won the gold medal. That was fun. In fact, from Kapalua in January to being voted PGA Tour player of the year in December, Scheffler used some form of the word \u201cfun\u201d 183 times in news conferences.",
      "It was like that for a lot of people in the world of golf, who created memories that make this year's edition of \u201cTales from the Tour.\u201d",

      "\u201cWe didn\u2019t take holidays,\u201d he said. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t afford them. We went around to junior golf tournaments in the summer. That was our holidays. And that was good.\u201d",
      "There was a quiet contentment about him as he watched his son, now one of the top players and characters in the sport. The father resumed his thoughts.",

      "The season opener can be a good tone-setter, and it's not always measure by a scorecard.",
      "All the attention on money includes the caddies.",
      "Xander Schauffele and Austin Kaiser were teammates at San Diego State and close friends ever since. Kaiser was working in a warehouse when Schauffele asked if he would caddie for him. They got their PGA Tour card in 2017, the first win, and before long Schauffele was a mainstay among the top 10 in the world ranking.",
      "Kaiser wasn\u2019t doing too bad, either.",
      "The standard fee for many caddies is 10% for a win. With $20 million purses, it adds up. Schauffele was discussing this at Bay Hill when he looked over at Kaiser and told him, \u201cYou get paid too much.\u201d",
      "Kaiser didn't blink.",
      "\u201cYeah, but you're the (expletive) paying me,\u201d he replied.",
      "Both broke out laughing. Some four months later, they had two major championships. Money well spent.",
      "The U.S. Open was approaching and Jack Nicklaus was asked what he thought about the toughest test in golf giving up a pair of 62s the previous year at Los Angeles Country Club. His thoughts instead turned to the course, which he had not seen in some time.",
      "\u201cI played it in 1954, the U.S. Junior. I was 14 years old,\u201d Nicklaus. \u201cI got beat in the second round. I think Hugh Royer Jr. beat me.\u201d",
      "Think about it. This is an 84-year-old who has competed at more than 1,000 tournaments since he was a boy. How can he remember losing 70 years ago to someone named Hugh Royer?",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t want to tell you,\" Nicklaus added with a smile, \"but I think it was 5-and-3.\u201d",
      "That afternoon came a phone call on another matter to Michael Trostel, the great USGA resource on history. He had a U.S. Junior Amateur record book near him and was asked to look up 1954 at LA Country Club. How did Nicklaus fare?",
      "\u201cLooks like he lost in the second round ... to Hugh Royer Jr.,\u201d Trostel replied.",
      "The score?",
      "\u201cHold on ... 4 and 3,\" he said.",
      "Nicklaus rarely misses, and when he does, it's not by much.",

      "For two holes, anyway.",
      "On her third hole, the par-3 12th at Lancaster, Korda after a long wait hit her 6-iron long into a bunker. She blasted out to a severely sloped green and watched it roll off the front and into a stream. Her next chip from the other side of the stream wasn\u2019t strong enough and went in the water. So did the one after that.",
      "It was a horror show unfolding before her eyes \u2014 and the eyes of her swing coach. Because of the long wait, Jamie Mulligan and had gone up to the grandstands.",
      "After the third ball found the water, Mulligan quietly said, \u201cThis is kind of tough to watch.\u201d",
      "She made 10.",
      "Mulligan, however, didn\u2019t lose his sense of humor, one of the reasons they mesh so well. An acquaintance sitting next to Mulligan found a reason to head back toward the clubhouse.",
      "\u201cI need to find her manager to get more golf balls,\u201d he said.",
      "Steve Stricker accepted the award. His daughter called the shots.",
      "Stricker easily won the Golf Writers Association of America award as the senior player of the year after a blockbuster 2023 season of six wins, three of them majors. It was a festive night at the awards dinner. The only question was whether Stricker would get emotional.",
      "It started when he approached the podium, partly because Gary Woodland got everyone emotional with heartfelt gratitude returning from brain surgery.",
      "Stricker rallied, his voice still a little unsteady, but the message was back on track.",
      "\u201cIf he looks at my mom he\u2019s going to lose it,\u201d his oldest daughter, Bobbi, whispered from her seat in the auditorium.",
      "Stricker spoke of his special year and said he wanted to thank his family. That\u2019s when he turned to look at them and it was over. He went seven full seconds before he could get out another word. Amid the tears, he laughed at himself.",
      "It\u2019s what makes him so endearing to so many.",
      "Justin Thomas made a solid recovery this year, but he couldn\u2019t afford a bad week at the BMW Championship. And he was having a rough week with his putting at Castle Pines.",
      "Thomas was 49th in the key putting statistic going into the third round. He was on the practice green with his father when he mentioned where he ranked and said, \u201cI can\u2019t believe there\u2019s someone putting worse than me this week.\u201d",
      "Mike Thomas had to deliver the bad news \u2014 Hideki Matsuyama had withdrawn, and there were only 49 players left in the field.",
      "The good news for Thomas? He made just enough over the weekend to finish 30th place in the FedEx Cup and get back to the Tour Championship.",
      "Scheffler won the gold medal at the Paris Olympics. His caddie, Ted Scott, also received a medal and was never prouder.",
      "Since 2008, the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee has given American medalists the \u201cOrder of Ikkos\u201d medallion to present to a key member of their team, usually a coach.",
      "For Scheffler, it was an easy choice.",
      "He spoke after the second round about struggling with his attitude and how his caddie helped him. Scott later filled in the details.",
      "It was on the eighth hole, after Scheffler made double bogey from a bad lie in the fairway.",
      "\u201cI called him off the side of the green and I had a stern talking to him,\u201d Scott said. \u201cI just said, 'I want you to look into my eyes, listen to my words and don\u2019t talk back.\u2019\u201d",
      "The message that followed was for Scheffler not to overcomplicate his game or overreact. The mission going forward was to commit to the shot and accept the outcome.",
      "\u201cI said, \u2019You might make everything at the end of the tournament. You don\u2019t know. Let\u2019s see what happens,'\u201d Scott said.",
      "He made everything at the end, a 29 on the back nine won the gold medal. He showered Scott was more praise than usual when it was over.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve never had a pro look me in the eyes and say he couldn\u2019t do it without me,\u201d Scott said. \u201cIt was special.\u201d",

      "Player said he wasn't searching. Friends approached him during a fundraiser at Leopard Creek in South Africa about a woman he should meet. It never happened. He was in New York for a golf course design when someone else brought up her name. Again, they never connected. Then he was invited to be an honorary member for a new golf course in Miami, where memberships go for about $1.3 million.",
      "\u201cI'm on the putting green and this lady comes up and says, \u2018I\u2019m Susan Waterfall. Everyone has been trying to introduce us,'\u201d Player said. \u201cI put my arm around her \u2014 she's gorgeous \u2014 and I said, \u2018I love this country, America, so much. I\u2019ve got to have an American girlfriend.' She blushes, doesn't say anything. So I said, \u2018Will you come to dinner with me?\u2019\u201d",
      "He called her two days later in New York \u2014 he says she stepped out of a board meeting to take his call \u2014 and they headed to Gleneagles in Scotland to go fishing.",
      "\u201cShe's very rich,\u201d he said. \u201cI said, \u2018Listen, Susan, I don\u2019t need your money. I'm also rich. You don't need my money. But if you die before me, you can leave me a little.'\u201d",
      "Nelly Korda is celebrating part of Christmas a little early because younger brother Sebastian is headed Down Under for the Australian Open tennis tournament. And then she\u2019s off to the mountains for a little ... dog sledding?",
      "\u201cI\u2019m very excited for that, something I\u2019ve never done,\u201d Korda said. \u201cI love the mountains, I love snow and so I\u2019m super excited for that to recharge my batteries. I skied as a kid, but I do not ski now. I\u2019m already fragile enough.\u201d",
      "The real recharging of batteries follows the start of the year.",
      "Korda found a recipe that worked during her epic season of seven victories that led to being LPGA player of the year. She played twice in Florida (winning the second event) at the start, sat out a month during the first Asia swing, returned and won her next four starts.",
      "She said she would skip the early Asia swing again and won\u2019t return until the West Coast.",
      "The Crypto.com Showdown had everything, except for a lot of people watching.",
      "The made-for-TV match at Shadow Creek brought PGA Tour stars Scottie Scheffler and Rory McIlroy against LIV Golf stars Bryson DeChambeau and Brooks Koepka. It was under the lights at Shadow Creek in Las Vegas. It was billed as the PGA Tour vs. LIV, just what golf fans wanted.",
      "But according to Sports Business Journal, the 16-hole match (Scheffler and McIlroy won handily) drew only 625,000 viewers across two networks on TNT and TBS on a Tuesday night.",
      "Sports Business Journal said that put it as the second-lowest viewership for \u201cThe Match\u201d series.",
      "One of those viewers was Fred Couples, but not until the fifth hole.",
      "\u201cI did not know it was on,\u201d Couples said. He only realized it when his longtime caddie, Joe LaCava, sent him a text and \u201cI don't even need to say what the text about.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt was pitch dark and freezing. Now, I don\u2019t know why they would do that, to play a match that big. ... But I thought it was fun,\u201d Couples said. \u201cI just ... we just didn't get the pitch dark. It was just weird.\u201d",
      "Still to be announced is what kind of rating the PNC Championship had during NFL Sunday.",
      "Ron Price had the unique distinction of working with three PGA Tour commissioners and even briefly serving as one himself. Price announced to the tour staff last week he is retiring at the end of the year.",
      "He leaves as the chief operating officer, having previously been the chief financial officer. He had a hand in most financial matters, whether it was the FedEx Cup bonus program or the new player equity plan.",
      "But he was unknown outside tour headquarters for the majority of his career, until he found himself under the brightest of spotlights.",
      "Price was co-commissioner for five weeks when Jay Monahan stepped away for health reasons after announcing the shock deal on June 6, 2023, with the Saudi-backers of LIV Golf. It was Price, along with board member Jimmy Dunne, who was summoned to Washington for a congressional hearing.",
      "Price worked at Ernst & Young when he was an advisor to former Commissioner Deane Beman. He served under Tim Finchem for 22 years and then Monahan when he took over in 2017.",
      "There\u2019s no better time than the holidays to release charity donations from various tournaments, and the Western Golf Association dropped a big one. The 125-year-old WGA, which runs the BMW Championship, said the tournament at Castle Pines in Colorado raised a record $10.2 million for the Evans Scholars Foundation.",
      "The BMW Championship has raised its profile since going back to its WGA roots and moving around outside its Chicago headquarters. Next year it returns to Caves Valley outside Baltimore.",
      "The Wells Fargo Championship in its final year as title sponsor raised $5.9 million for charity donations from the tournament and from previous net reserves. The tournament has raised more than $36 million dating to its inaugural year in 2003.",
      "The tournament has a new title sponsor in Truist starting in 2025 and will move to the Philadelphia Cricket Club for one year because Quail Hollow in Charlotte, North Carolina, is hosting the PGA Championship for the second time.",
      "The PNC Championship not only had a great finish, it had an even better start. The tournament announced Pittsburgh-based PNC Bank has extended its contract as title sponsor through 2032. ... The Epson Tour has announced a 20-tournament schedule for 2025 that includes three new tournaments and total prize money of $5 million. ... Fred Couples says he has been asked to introduce players on the first tee when the Skins Game returns next year on the Friday after Thanksgiving. Couples was known as \u201cMr. Skins\u201d during the event's peak years. Couples made nearly $4.5 million \u2014 back when $4.5 million meant something \u2014 in 11 appearances. ... The TMRW Golf League that starts next month is going worldwide before a shot has been struck into the monstrous screen in SoFi Center. It has agreements for Canal+ to show matches live in France and sub-Saharan Africa, while Disney+ has secured rights to show them exclusively in the five Nordic countries. Both deals are through 2026.",
      "Ten of the 20 professionals in the PNC Championship have been No. 1 in the world.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t try to compare my seasons. It\u2019s very easy to do that. I\u2019m super proud of myself and my entire team of what we accomplished this year and what we went through, but next year I always look at as a clean slate and I\u2019m hungry for more.\" \u2014 Nelly Korda.",

      "Oklahoma City leads the Western Conference and has a MVP candidate in Shai Gilgeous-Alexander",
      "Oklahoma City leads the Western Conference and has a MVP candidate in Shai Gilgeous-Alexander. Milwaukee has the NBA's leading scorer in Giannis Antetokounmpo. They were the teams that made their way to the NBA Cup final.",
      "By any measure, they're both very good teams.",
      "And neither will play on Christmas Day this year. Bah, humbug.",
      "In its defense, the NBA faces the same challenge every summer, figuring out which 10 teams will get the honor \u2014 and it is an honor \u2014 of playing on Christmas Day.",
      "The Knicks and Lakers almost always find their way onto the slate, which makes sense given the size of the New York and Los Angeles media markets. The teams coming off runs to the NBA Finals typically get a Christmas invite, so hello, Boston and Dallas. The rest is a mix of stars, ratings potential, storylines and, hopefully, good teams.",
      "Victor Wembanyama \u2014 the French star who already is a massive draw both in the U.S. and Europe \u2014 makes his Christmas debut when San Antonio goes to New York. Minnesota plays Dallas in a West finals rematch. Boston plays Philadelphia, a forever rivalry. The Lakers play Golden State, LeBron James vs. Stephen Curry. And Denver plays Phoenix in the nightcap. Nobody could have said those games were Christmas mistakes when the schedule came out.",
      "It's also a sign of the parity in the NBA right now \u2014 there are clearly more than 10 teams worthy of Christmas consideration. That said, the Thunder and Bucks certainly have the right to feel snubbed.",
      "\u201cWe should\u2019ve had a Christmas day game, I believe, but the NBA felt different,\u201d Bucks guard Khris Middleton said on media day, back in September. \u201cThat\u2019s how they feel. I said my opinion on it. And sometimes it happens, sometimes it doesn\u2019t.\u201d",
      "The Thunder not getting picked is puzzling, especially after being the No. 1 seed in the West last season.",
      "This is the 17th consecutive season of the NBA having five games on Christmas Day. More often than not \u2014 75% of the time \u2014 the No. 1 seeds for the East and West playoffs have been picked for a Christmas game the following season. And entering this year, each of the previous 11 No. 1 seeds in the West playoffs wound up having a game on Dec. 25 that same year.",
      "But not the Thunder.",
      "\u201cDisappointed, for sure,\" Gilgeous-Alexander said. \u201cI'd love to play on Christmas Day. And I think we're that caliber of team. The NBA makes their decisions. Can't slight them for it. Ball's in our court to prove to them why we deserve to be in that game.\u201d",
      "There have been reasons for some of the eight No. 1 seeds who got snubbed in that span to get snubbed. Some examples:",
      "\u2014 Cleveland was the East's No. 1 seed in 2010. LeBron James left Cleveland that summer and went to Miami, and the Cavaliers became a far-less-marketable team overnight so putting them on the Christmas schedule wouldn't have made much sense.",
      "\u2014 Indiana was the East's No. 1 seed in 2014. Paul George got hurt badly while playing for USA Basketball that summer and the Pacers weren't the same the following the season, which the schedule-makers probably realized could happen.",
      "\u2014 Toronto was the East's No. 1 seed in 2018. Toronto didn't make the Christmas list a few months later for the simple reason that the Raptors are from Canada, and Canadian viewers don't count in American television ratings. (The then-reigning NBA champion Raptors made the Christmas lineup in 2019.)",
      "None of those situations would apply to the Thunder.",
      "Oklahoma City is a small market, sure. Only Memphis and New Orleans are smaller among NBA cities in the U.S., according to Nielsen. It's easy to deduce that national ratings play a part in the decision of who plays on Christmas and who doesn't, but it's also clear that those who just want to see good ball on Dec. 25 probably would have tuned in for a Thunder game.",
      "\u201cThey make the schedule. We play it,\u201d Thunder coach Mark Daigneault said. \u201cOur players, I know, would have liked to play on Christmas because that's such a staple day in the NBA season. But we can't control that. All we can control is playing the schedule we're given, playing the hand we're dealt.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Lindsey Vonn thinks her new titanium knee could be the start of a trend in ski racing",
      "ST. MORITZ, Switzerland -- When Lindsey Vonn last raced on the World Cup circuit nearly six years ago, the constant pain in her knee left her in tears and led to retirement.",
      "Flash forward to Vonn\u2019s comeback race on a titanium knee at age 40 last weekend, and the American skiing standout couldn\u2019t have felt more different.",
      "No more pain. No more swelling. No more tears.",
      "\u201cThe last few years of my career were so much different than they are right now. I\u2019m skiing without thinking about my knee, which I really haven\u2019t done since I first tore my ACL in 2013. So it\u2019s been a long time that I felt this good,\u201d Vonn said Saturday after placing 14th in a super-G in St. Moritz. \u201cI\u2019m a little bit older, but honestly I\u2019m a hell of a lot stronger than I once was.\u201d",
      "So much stronger that she\u2019s talking up her knee replacement surgery \u2014 the first of its kind in World Cup skiing \u2014 as a new frontier for the sport.",
      "In April, Vonn had a robot-assisted replacement performed by Martin Roche, a South Florida-based orthopedist specializing in complex knee disorders. Part of the bone in her right knee was cut off and replaced by two titanium pieces. A month later, she was planning her comeback.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a lot better than my non-existent cartilage,\u201d said Vonn, one of the most successful skiers of all time with 82 World Cup wins. \u201cI\u2019ve talked to a lot of skiers already about it and I really think that it could be something that should be considered.",
      "\u201cI feel amazing. I mean, obviously not everyone responds the same way to surgeries. For some reason, I bounce back pretty well from surgery. But I think it\u2019s something to seriously consider for athletes that have a lot of knee problems.\u201d",
      "Andrea Panzeri, the Italian Winter Sports Federation\u2019s head physician and an orthopedist who has operated numerous times on Vonn\u2019s good friend and fellow downhiller, Sofia Goggia, said knee replacements are usually performed on patients older than 50.",
      "\u201cThis is definitely the first time in World Cup history that such a young athlete has raced with one,\" Panzeri told The Associated Press. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not aware of any other elite-level athletes in other sports competing with one, either.\u201d",
      "Panzeri performs knee replacements. But he had never even thought about doing one on a World Cup skier \u2014 until he saw Vonn competing with one.",
      "\u201cPartial prosthetics, like the half-knee ones, are definitely the ones that offer the best performance and we\u2019re seeing that (with Vonn),\" Panzeri said. \u201cI don\u2019t think her decision is going to change pro sports. But it could provide more motivation for so-called \u2018normal\u2019 people to try a prosthetic.\"",
      "Three-time Grand Slam tennis champion Andy Murray played with an artificial hip at the end of his career. Vonn\u2019s former skiing teammate Julia Mancuso also redid her hip a few months after she retired in 2018 and maintains an active lifestyle.",
      "\u201cI, for sure, would have considered a comeback if I didn\u2019t have kids,\" Mancuso told The AP recently. \"So I can totally relate to Lindsey.\u201d",
      "But Panzeri said that \u201chips have different biomechanics than a knee and many more people are able to play sports with a hip prosthetic than a knee prosthetic.\"",
      "Elan Goldwaser, a sports medicine physician at Columbia University Medical Center who works with the U.S. Ski Team, has seen many athletes come to his clinic for knee replacements but not elite-level competitors.",
      "So, is Vonn\u2019s operation going to be a trend-setter in skiing?",
      "\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s the go-to like in baseball with Tommy John surgery,\u201d Goldwaser said in St. Moritz. \u201cBut if it\u2019s necessary, it\u2019s a good procedure to do.\u201d",
      "Chris Knight, Vonn\u2019s personal coach, said they had questions over whether her titanium knee would hold up to the forces required to navigate downhill skiing turns at 80 mph (130 kph) as she hurls herself down steep mountains.",
      "\u201cThere was not a lot of research out there with high-level athletes and partial knee replacements,\" Knight said. \u201cIt is a new frontier. But so far everything\u2019s working really well... And I would not be surprised if other people do it because the results that Lindsey\u2019s had, with no pain and no swelling, have been unbelievable.",
      "\u201cGranted, she stayed in great shape the entire time she hasn\u2019t been racing. So, that probably helped. I mean, if you\u2019re sitting around as a non-active skier and not doing anything with your fitness, then maybe it wouldn\u2019t be as effective. But if you\u2019re an athlete who\u2019s got some knee problems, from what I\u2019m seeing, I wouldn\u2019t be saying no to them.\u201d",
      "Vonn\u2019s new knee also left an impression on U.S. Ski Team head coach Paul Kristofic.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m definitely due for one myself,\u201d Kristofic said. \u201cI\u2019m going to talk to her.\"",
      "Still, there are doubters.",
      "Four-time overall World Cup champion Pirmin Zurbriggen told Swiss tabloid Blick last week that \u201cthere is a risk that Vonn will tear her artificial knee to pieces.\u201d",
      "But Panzeri said the titanium does not rupture.",
      "\u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a small prosthetic that doesn\u2019t break.\u201d",
      "Vonn will race next in St. Anton, Austria, Jan. 11-12.",

      "Koclanes worked with new GM Curt Miller in Connecticut on his staff from 2016-22 and helped the Sun reach the WNBA Finals in 2019 and 2022.

Hill went behind the net to get the puck, which caromed off one of the linesman\u2019s skates and went on goal.

      "With veteran sailor Ernesto Echauz at the helm, Centennial 7 will embark on the 628-nautical mile (722 miles, 1,160 kilometers) race. One of six international entrants out of the more than 100-strong fleet, Centennial 7\u2019s crew comprises sailors from the Philippines\u2019 national team and the Philippines navy.",

He was playing in just his eighth game, missing many due to left knee soreness, three after a suspension for an altercation with a reporter in the locker room and another following a sinus fracture sustained on Dec. 10. Monday's game marked just the fifth time Embiid, Paul George and Tyrese Maxey, Philadelphia\u2019s Big Three, were in the starting lineup together.",
      "Wearing a mask while playing in just his second game since suffering the sinus fracture, Embiid had nine points and three rebounds in 14:22, shooting 2 for 8.

Then, they initially assessed Wembanyama with a technical foul for flopping. Maxey shot and made a free throw and the point went on the scoreboard, only for the officials to rescind the technical, remove the point and restart the game.",

He pleaded guilty and served 21 months in federal prison before resuming his career in 2009. He retired in 2017 and had been working as an NFL analyst for Fox Sports and as an animal rights activist.",

      "\u201cHis journey is one of resilience and redemption and unwavering commitment to growth,\u201d Webb said.",
      "Vick has no coaching experience and is the latest former NFL star who had not coached before to take the helm of an HBCU program, a club that includes Deion Sanders and Eddie George.",
      "Norfolk State has made only one playoff appearance since moving to FCS in 1997. The last five Spartan head coaches have had losing records, including Dawson Odoms, who was fired in November after going 15-30 in four seasons.",
      "School officials hailed Vick\u2019s hiring as transformational, however. Webb said Vick\u2019s name \u201cresonates around the world.\u201d",
      "Added rector Kim Brown: \u201cToday we turn the corner and we embrace a new season for our football program.\u201d",
      "For his part, Vick said he won\u2019t be outworked, and that he will recruit hard in his home region, long a hotbed of talent. He said he attended Norfolk State games while playing youth football in Newport News and has followed the program over the years.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a lot of pressure being in your hometown,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve always thrived off it.\u201d",

      "No. 2 Georgia is resting its national championship hopes on backup quarterback Gunner Stockton",
      "No. 2 Georgia is resting its national championship hopes on backup quarterback Gunner Stockton.",
      "Coach Kirby Smart said Monday that Georgia is preparing Stockton to start in the Sugar Bowl on Jan. 1 in the College Football Playoff quarterfinal against No. 3 Notre Dame. Stockton took over when starter Carson Beck suffered a right elbow injury in the the first half in the Bulldogs\u2019 22-19 overtime win over Texas in the Southeastern Conference championship game on Dec. 7 in Atlanta.",
      "Georgia's first-round bye in the playoffs has given Stockton, a sophomore, more time to prepare for his new starting role. Smart said the experience with the first-team is the primary benefit in \u201cseveral practices\u201d since the SEC championship game.",
      "\u201cHe got lots of reps prior to these practices, but he\u2019s getting much more now,\u201d Smart said. \u201cI do think ... when you get ready for an opponent like Notre Dame, you need time and we have time.\u201d",
      "The Fighting Irish advanced by beating Indiana 27-17 in the first round on Friday night. Smart said Stockton and Georgia can focus on Notre Dame.",
      "\u201cBut I think the biggest thing is just competition at practice,\u201d Smart said. \u201cYou know, the situations we put him in. All those things allow him to get better as a quarterback.\u201d",
      "Georgia announced on Dec. 9 that Beck and his family were considering treatment options for his elbow. Those options could include surgery, though Georgia has not released details about the injury.",
      "Two weeks later, no decision has been released by Beck or Georgia.",
      "\u201cThe only thing I can update is that they\u2019re still going through those deliberations in terms of the decision-making process time, all the kind of decisions they have to make as a family,\u201d Smart said.",
      "Beck suffered the injury to his throwing arm in the first half of the SEC championship game and made a dramatic return to the field for the handoff on the game-winning play in overtime. Stockton had to leave the field for one play after having his helmet knocked off.",
      "Even though he was able to take the snap and hand off to Trevor Etienne for the running back\u2019s decisive 4-yard touchdown run, Beck was unable to raise his right arm.",
      "Stockton completed 12 of 16 passes for 71 yards with one interception against Texas.",
      "Smart downplayed the suggestion Stockton could give the Bulldogs more options as a running quarterback.",
      "\u201cI think we are who we are in regards to that,\u201d Smart said. \u201cI mean, we played an entire season, offensively. You know, Gunner\u2019s a good athlete. I think Carson is a good athlete. So it\u2019s one of those deals that I don\u2019t know how much that changes things.\u201d",
      "Beck, a fifth-year senior, is 24-3 as a starter. He started all 26 games for the Bulldogs in 2023 and 2024. He passed for 3,941 yards with 24 touchdowns and only six interceptions in 2023 but had more difficulties with turnovers this season. Beck passed for 28 touchdowns with 12 interceptions this season and completed 7 of 13 passes for 56 yards before his injury in the SEC championship game.",

      "The Dallas Wings have hired Chris Koclanes as head coach",
      "The Dallas Wings hired Chris Koclanes as the franchise's new head coach, the team announced Monday.",
      "Koclanes has more than a decade of experience as an assistant coach in the WNBA and Division I women's basketball.",
      "\u201cWe are thrilled to welcome Chris Koclanes as the new head coach of the Dallas Wings,\u201d said Curt Miller, executive vice president and general manager. \u201cThroughout our extensive search and interview process, Chris continued to rise to the top and check the boxes of our important pillars. He is a servant leader who places a high value on connection, collaboration, and a positive and consistent communication style with all those he coaches.\"",
      "Koclanes worked with Miller in Connecticut on his staff from 2016-22 and helped the Sun reach the WNBA Finals in 2019 and 2022. Miller was hired as the Wings' general manager last month.",
      "The Connecticut Sun defense shined under Koclanes, consistently finishing in the top three in the WNBA in opponent scoring average, opponent turnovers committed and opponent field goal and 3-point shooting percentages.",
      "\u201cChris is a fantastic teacher of the game and has an outstanding basketball IQ. He is committed to player development and has a forward thinking and innovative mind for the game,\" Miller said. \"He is a tireless worker with a foundation built through preparation.\u201d",
      "Koclanes, who is currently in his second season as an assistant at USC, will be formally introduced at a press conference on Jan. 9.",
      "\u201cI am grateful for the opportunity to lead the Dallas Wings,\u201d said Koclanes. \u201cI would like to thank Chairman Bill Cameron, CEO and Managing Partner Greg Bibb and General Manager Curt Miller for entrusting me with this incredible responsibility.\"",
      "The Wings have the No. 1 pick in the upcoming WNBA draft after winning the lottery. They let coach Latricia Trammell go in October after she went 31-49 in two seasons with the team, including 2-3 in playoff appearances. This past season the Wings went 9-31 and missed the WNBA postseason for the first time since 2020.",
      "There is still one head coaching opening left in the WNBA, which had seven coaches get fired after the season ended, as Washington has yet to name a replacement.",

      "A great gray owl and a snowy owl are being treated by experts after being rescued by a northern Minnesota woman",
      "Annabell Whelan woke up Tuesday and frantically checked on her holiday overnight guest \u2014 Nowl the snowy owl, who she rescued from the grille of a car the day before.",
      "Whelan was out with her boyfriend's family Monday in Duluth, Minnesota, when she saw the owl \u201cjust hanging out there, literally\" after car and bird had collided, she told The Associated Press. The car's owner had already called for help, but the animal rescue organization that the bird needed was closed \u2014 so Whelan stepped in, not for the first time that day.",
      "Earlier Monday, Whelan found an injured great gray owl on the ground further north in Two Harbors, Minnesota. Experts at Wildwoods, a Duluth-based wildlife rehabilitation center, told her how to safely catch the bird.",
      "\u201cI definitely thought that I had had my fix of owls with the first one,\" said Whelan, 22, a Lake Superior Zoo guest experience manager who graduated earlier this year with a biology and environmental science degree.",
      "\u201cI could tell he was having a hard time with one of his eyes,\" she said. \u201cI kind of took my time and just sat there with him and talked quietly and was just kind of trying to coax him to trust me a little bit.\u201d",
      "Whelan scooped the owl up in a blanket, transferred him to a dog crate in the car and dropped the great gray owl off at Wildwoods. He was sent along with another animal to the University of Minnesota's Raptor Center in St. Paul.",
      "But the snowy owl she found hours later was in a much scarier situation, she said.",
      "\u201cIt was obviously a lot more trauma,\" she said.",
      "Since Wildwoods had already closed for the night, Whelan wrapped Nowl in a blanket and crated her overnight in a dark, quiet room in her home \u2014 keeping her and her cousin's curious cats and dog at bay. She named her Nowl, a play on noel.",
      "\u201cI tried to prepare myself in case I woke up in the morning and she didn't make it through the night,\u201d Whelan said. But she said she cried happy tears when she saw Nowl moving and awake, bringing her to Wildwoods that morning.",
      "Nowl \u201cis quite beaten up,\" Wildwoods posted on Facebook Tuesday after examining the bird. \u201cWe applied a wing wrap, gave her meds, and coordinated with The Raptor Center to get her down to them.\u201d",
      "The rescue said people should slow down, stay alert, and call for help when they see an injured animal. The animals are terrified of people and should be quickly moved to a quiet, safe space where they can be left alone until professionals can step in, the rescue said.",

      "Japanese automakers Honda and Nissan will attempt to merge and create the world\u2019s third-largest automaker by sales as the industry undergoes dramatic changes in its transition away from fossil fuels",
      "BANGKOK -- Japanese automakers Honda and Nissan will attempt to merge and create the world\u2019s third-largest automaker by sales as the industry undergoes dramatic changes in its transition away from fossil fuels.",
      "The two companies said they had signed a memorandum of understanding on Monday and that smaller Nissan alliance member Mitsubishi Motors also had agreed to join the talks on integrating their businesses. Honda will initially lead the new management, retaining the principles and brands of each company.",
      "Following is a quick look at what a combined Honda and Nissan would mean for the companies, and for the auto industry.",
      "The ascent of Chinese automakers is rattling the industry at a time when manufacturers are struggling to shift from fossil fuel-driven vehicles to electrics. Relatively inexpensive EVs from China's BYD, Great Wall and Nio are eating into the market shares of U.S. and Japanese car companies in China and elsewhere.",
      "Japanese automakers have lagged behind big rivals in EVs and are now trying to cut costs and make up for lost time.",
      "Nissan, Honda and Mitsubishi announced in August that they will share components for electric vehicles like batteries and jointly research software for autonomous driving to adapt better to dramatic changes in the auto industry centered around electrification. A preliminary agreement between Honda, Japan's second-largest automaker, and Nissan, third largest, was announced in March.",
      "A merger could result in a behemoth worth about $55 billion based on the market capitalization of all three automakers.",
      "Joining forces would help the smaller Japanese automakers add scale to compete with Japan's market leader Toyota Motor Corp. and with Germany\u2019s Volkswagen AG. Toyota itself has technology partnerships with Japan's Mazda Motor Corp. and Subaru Corp.",
      "Nissan has truck-based body-on-frame large SUVs such as the Armada and Infiniti QX80 that Honda doesn't have, with large towing capacities and good off-road performance, said Sam Fiorani, vice president of AutoForecast Solutions.",
      "Nissan also has years of experience building batteries and electric vehicles, and gas-electric hybird powertrains that could help Honda in developing its own EVs and next generation of hybrids, he said.",
      "\u201cNissan does have some product segments where Honda doesn\u2019t currently play,\u201d that a merger or partnership could help, said Sam Abuelsamid, a Detroit-area automotive industry analsyt.",
      "While Nissan's electric Leaf and Ariya haven't sold well in the U.S., they're solid vehicles, Fiorani said. \u201cThey haven't been resting on their laurels, and they have been developing this technology,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have new products coming that could provide a good platform for Honda for its next generation.\u201d",
      "Nissan said last month that it was slashing 9,000 jobs, or about 6% of its global work force, and reducing global production capacity by 20% after reporting a quarterly loss of 9.3 billion yen ($61 million).",
      "Earlier this month it reshuffled its management and its chief executive, Makoto Uchida, took a 50% pay cut to take responsibility for the financial woes, saying Nissan needed to become more efficient and respond better to market tastes, rising costs and other global changes.",
      "Fitch Ratings recently downgraded Nissan's credit outlook to \u201cnegative,\u201d citing worsening profitability, partly due to price cuts in the North American market. But it noted that it has a strong financial structure and solid cash reserves that amounted to 1.44 trillion yen ($9.4 billion).",
      "Nissan's share price has fallen to the point where it is considered something of a bargain. A report in the Japanese financial magazine Diamond said talks with Honda gained urgency after the Taiwan maker of iPhones Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., better known as Foxconn, began exploring a possible acquisition of Nissan as part of its push into the EV sector.",
      "The company has struggled for years following a scandal that began with the arrest of its former chairman Carlos Ghosn in late 2018 on charges of fraud and misuse of company assets, allegations that he denies. He eventually was released on bail and fled to Lebanon.",
      "Honda reported its profits slipped nearly 20% in the first half of the April-March fiscal year from a year earlier, as sales suffered in China.",
      "Toyota made 11.5 million vehicles in 2023, while Honda rolled out 4 million and Nissan produced 3.4 million. Mitsubishi Motors made just over 1 million. Even after a merger Toyota would remain the leading Japanese automaker.",
      "All the global automakers are facing potential shocks if President-elect Donald Trump follows through on threats to raise or impose tariffs on imports of foreign products, even from allies like Japan and neighboring countries like Canada and Mexico. Nissan is among the major car companies that have adjusted their supply chains to include vehicles assembled in Mexico.",
      "Meanwhile, analysts say there is an \u201caffordability shift\u201d taking place across the industry, led by people who feel they cannot afford to pay nearly $50,000 for a new vehicle. In American, a vital market for companies like Nissan, Honda and Toyota, that's forcing automakers to consider lower pricing, which will eat further into industry profits.",

    "story": [
      "Bluesky has seen its user base soar since the U.S. presidential election, boosted by people seeking refuge from Elon Musk\u2019s X, or wanting an alternative to Meta\u2019s Threads and its algorithms",
      "Bluesky has seen its user base soar since the U.S. presidential election, boosted by people seeking refuge from Elon Musk's X, which they view as increasingly leaning too far to the right given its owner's support of President-elect Donald Trump, or wanting an alternative to Meta's Threads and its algorithms.",
      "The platform grew out of the company then known as Twitter, championed by its former CEO Jack Dorsey. Its decentralized approach to social networking was eventually intended to replace Twitter's core mechanic. That's unlikely now that the two companies have parted ways. But Bluesky's growth trajectory \u2014 with a user base that has more than doubled since October \u2014 could make it a serious competitor to other social platforms.",
      "But with growth comes growing pains. It's not just human users who've been flocking to Bluesky but also bots, including those designed to create partisan division or direct users to junk websites.",
      "The skyrocketing user base \u2014 now surpassing 25 million \u2014 is the biggest test yet for a relatively young platform that has branded itself as a social media alternative free of the problems plaguing its competitors. According to research firm Similarweb, Bluesky added 7.6 million monthly active app users on iOS and Android in November, an increase of 295.4% since October. It also saw 56.2 million desktop and mobile web visits, in the same period, up 189% from October.",
      "Besides the U.S. elections, Bluesky also got a boost when X was briefly banned in Brazil.",
      "\u201cThey got this spike in attention, they\u2019ve crossed the threshold where it is now worth it for people to flood the platform with spam,\u201d said Laura Edelson, an assistant professor of computer science at Northeastern University and a member of Issue One\u2019s Council for Responsible Social Media. \u201cBut they don\u2019t have the cash flow, they don\u2019t have the established team that a larger platform would, so they have to do it all very, very quickly.\u201d",
      "To manage growth for its tiny staff, Bluesky started as an invitation-only space until it opened to the public in February. That period gave the site time to build out moderation tools and other distinctive features to attract new users, such as \u201cstarter packs\u201d that provide lists of topically curated feeds. Meta recently announced that it is testing a similar feature.",
      "Compared to the bigger players like Meta's platforms or X, Bluesky has a \u201cquite different\u201d value system, said Claire Wardle, a professor at Cornell University and an expert in misinformation. This includes giving users more control over their experience.",
      "\u201cThe first generation of social media platforms connected the world, but ended up consolidating power in the hands of a few corporations and their leaders,\u201d Bluesky said on its blog in March. \u201cOur online experience doesn\u2019t have to depend on billionaires unilaterally making decisions over what we see. On an open social network like Bluesky, you can shape your experience for yourself.\u201d",
      "Because of this mindset, Bluesky has achieved a scrappy underdog status that has attracted users who've grown tired of the big players.",
      "\u201cPeople had this idea that it was going to be a different type of social network,\u201d Wardle said. \u201cBut the truth is, when you get lots of people in a place and there are eyeballs, it means that it\u2019s in other people\u2019s interests to use bots to create, you know, information that aligns with their perspective.\u201d",
      "Little data has emerged to help quantify the rise in impersonator accounts, artificial intelligence-fueled networks and other potentially harmful content on Bluesky. But in recent weeks, users have begun reporting large numbers of apparent AI bots following them, posting plagiarized articles or making seemingly automated divisive comments in replies.",
      "Lion Cassens, a Bluesky user and doctoral candidate in the Netherlands, found one such network by accident \u2014 a group of German-language accounts with similar bios and AI-generated profile pictures posting in replies to three German newspapers.",
      "\u201cI noticed some weird replies under a news post by the German newspaper \u2018Die Ziet,\u2019\u201d he said in an email to The Associated Press. \u201cI have a lot of trust in the moderation mechanism on Bluesky, especially compared to Twitter since the layoffs and due to Musk\u2019s more radical stance on freedom of speech. But AI bots are a big challenge, as they will only improve. I hope social media can keep up with that.\u201d",
      "Cassens said the bots' messages have been relatively innocuous so far, but he was concerned about how they could be repurposed in the future to mislead.",
      "There are also signs that foreign disinformation narratives have made their way to Bluesky. The disinformation research group Alethea pointed to one low-traction post sharing a false claim about ABC News that had circulated on Russian Telegram channels.",
      "Copycat accounts are another challenge. In late November, Alexios Mantzarlis, director of the Security, Trust and Safety Initiative at Cornell Tech, found that of the top 100 most followed named individuals on Bluesky, 44% had at least one duplicate account posing as them. Two weeks later, Mantzarlis said Bluesky had removed around two-thirds of the duplicate accounts he\u2019d initially detected \u2014 a sign the site was aware of the issue and attempting to address it.",
      "Bluesky posted earlier this month that it had quadrupled its moderation team to keep up with its growing user base. The company also announced it had introduced a new system to detect impersonation and was working to improve its Community Guidelines to provide more detail on what\u2019s allowed. Because of the way the site is built, users also have the option to subscribe to third-party \u201cLabelers\u201d that outsource content moderation by tagging accounts with warnings and context.",
      "The company didn't respond to multiple requests for comment for this story.",
      "Even as its challenges aren\u2019t yet at the scale other platforms face, Bluesky is at a \u201ccrossroads,\u201d said Edward Perez, a board member at the nonpartisan nonprofit OSET Institute, who previously led Twitter\u2019s civic integrity team.",
      "\u201cWhether BlueSky likes it or not, it is being pulled into the real world,\u201d Perez said, noting that it needs to quickly prioritize threats and work to mitigate them if it hopes to continue to grow.",
      "That said, disinformation and bots won't be Bluesky's only challenges in the months and years to come. As a text-based social network, its entire premise is falling out of favor with younger generations. A recent Pew Research Center poll found that only 17% of American teenagers used X, for instance, down from 23% in 2022. For teens and young adults, TikTok, Instagram and other visual-focused platforms are the places to be.",
      "Political polarization is also going against Bluesky ever reaching the size of TikTok, Instagram or even X.",
      "\u201cBluesky is not trying to be all things to all people,\u201d Wardle said, adding that, likely, the days of a Facebook or Instagram emerging where they're \u201ctrying to keep everybody happy\u201d are over. Social platforms are increasingly splintered along political lines and when they aren't \u2014 see Meta's platforms \u2014 the companies behind them are actively working to de-emphasize political content and news.",

      "The whistleblower helped train artificial intelligence systems behind ChatGPT.",
      "Suchir Balaji, a former OpenAI engineer and whistleblower who helped train the artificial intelligence systems behind ChatGPT and later said he believed those practices violated copyright law, has died, according to his parents and San Francisco officials. He was 26.",
      "Balaji worked at OpenAI for nearly four years before quitting in August. He was well-regarded by colleagues at the San Francisco company, where a co-founder this week called him one of OpenAI's strongest contributors who was essential to developing some of its products.",
      "\u201cWe are devastated to learn of this incredibly sad news and our hearts go out to Suchir\u2019s loved ones during this difficult time,\u201d said a statement from OpenAI.",
      "Balaji was found dead in his San Francisco apartment on Nov. 26 in what police said \u201cappeared to be a suicide. No evidence of foul play was found during the initial investigation.\u201d The city's chief medical examiner's office confirmed the manner of death to be suicide.",
      "His parents Poornima Ramarao and Balaji Ramamurthy said they are still seeking answers, describing their son as a \u201chappy, smart and brave young man\u201d who loved to hike and recently returned from a trip with friends.",
      "Balaji grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area and first arrived at the fledgling AI research lab for a 2018 summer internship while studying computer science at the University of California, Berkeley. He returned a few years later to work at OpenAI, where one of his first projects, called WebGPT, helped pave the way for ChatGPT.",
      "\u201cSuchir\u2019s contributions to this project were essential, and it wouldn\u2019t have succeeded without him,\u201d said OpenAI co-founder John Schulman in a social media post memorializing Balaji. Schulman, who recruited Balaji to his team, said what made him such an exceptional engineer and scientist was his attention to detail and ability to notice subtle bugs or logical errors.",
      "\u201cHe had a knack for finding simple solutions and writing elegant code that worked,\u201d Schulman wrote. \u201cHe\u2019d think through the details of things carefully and rigorously.\u201d",
      "Balaji later shifted to organizing the huge datasets of online writings and other media used to train GPT-4, the fourth generation of OpenAI's flagship large language model and a basis for the company's famous chatbot. It was that work that eventually caused Balaji to question the technology he helped build, especially after newspapers, novelists and others began suing OpenAI and other AI companies for copyright infringement.",
      "He first raised his concerns with The New York Times, which reported them in an October profile of Balaji.",
      "He later told The Associated Press he would \u201ctry to testify\u201d in the strongest copyright infringement cases and considered a lawsuit brought by The New York Times last year to be the \u201cmost serious.\u201d Times lawyers named him in a Nov. 18 court filing as someone who might have \u201cunique and relevant documents\u201d supporting allegations of OpenAI's willful copyright infringement.",
      "His records were also sought by lawyers in a separate case brought by book authors including the comedian Sarah Silverman, according to a court filing.",
      "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel right to be training on people\u2019s data and then competing with them in the marketplace,\u201d Balaji told the AP in late October. \u201cI don\u2019t think you should be able to do that. I don\u2019t think you are able to do that legally.\u201d",
      "He told the AP that he gradually grew more disillusioned with OpenAI, especially after the internal turmoil that led its board of directors to fire and then rehire CEO Sam Altman last year. Balaji said he was broadly concerned about how its commercial products were rolling out, including their propensity for spouting false information known as hallucinations.",
      "But of the \u201cbag of issues\u201d he was concerned about, he said he was focusing on copyright as the one it was \u201cactually possible to do something about.\u201d",
      "He acknowledged that it was an unpopular opinion within the AI research community, which is accustomed to pulling data from the internet, but said \u201cthey will have to change and it\u2019s a matter of time.\u201d",
      "He had not been deposed and it\u2019s unclear to what extent his revelations will be admitted as evidence in any legal cases after his death. He also published a personal blog post with his opinions about the topic.",
      "Schulman, who resigned from OpenAI in August, said he and Balaji coincidentally left on the same day and celebrated with fellow colleagues that night with dinner and drinks at a San Francisco bar. Another of Balaji\u2019s mentors, co-founder and chief scientist Ilya Sutskever, had left OpenAI several months earlier, which Balaji saw as another impetus to leave.",
      "Schulman said Balaji had told him earlier this year of his plans to leave OpenAI and that Balaji didn't think that better-than-human AI known as artificial general intelligence \u201cwas right around the corner, like the rest of the company seemed to believe.\u201d The younger engineer expressed interest in getting a doctorate and exploring \u201csome more off-the-beaten path ideas about how to build intelligence,\u201d Schulman said.",
      "Balaji's family said a memorial is being planned for later this month at the India Community Center in Milpitas, California, not far from his hometown of Cupertino.",

      "The death of an Oregon house cat from bird flu and a pet food recall are raising questions about how people can protect their pets",
      "The death of an Oregon house cat and a pet food recall are raising questions about the ongoing outbreak of bird flu and how people can protect their pets.",
      "Bird flu has been spreading for years in wild birds, chickens, turkeys and many other animals. It was first confirmed in U.S. dairy cattle in March.",
      "The virus has been causing sporadic, mostly mild illnesses in people in the U.S., and nearly all of those infected worked on dairy or poultry farms. When the virus is found, every bird on a farm is killed to limit the spread of the disease.",
      "Oregon health officials traced the cat's illness to frozen cat food that contained raw turkey. Virus recovered from the recalled pet food and the infected cat matched.",
      "Some pet owners feed their animals raw meat, but that can be dangerous, even fatal for the animals, said Dr. Michael Q. Bailey, president-elect of the American Veterinary Medical Association. Cooking meat or pasteurizing raw milk destroys the bird flu virus and other disease-causing germs.",
      "\u201cRaw milk, raw meat products can be and are a vector for carrying this virus,\u201d he said.",
      "Though cases of infection are rare, cats seem especially susceptible to the bird flu virus, or Type A H5N1. Even before the cattle outbreak, there were feline cases linked to wild birds or poultry. Since March, dozens of cats have caught the virus. These include barn and feral cats, indoor cats, and big cats in zoos and in the wild.",
      "The Los Angeles County Department of Public Health is investigating the deaths of four house cats that drank recalled raw milk.",
      "Dogs seem to be less vulnerable than cats, but they should eat only thoroughly cooked foods, Bailey said.",
      "Cats should not drink unpasteurized dairy products or eat raw meat. Pet owners should keep cats away from wild birds, livestock and poultry.",
      "Don't let them wander freely in the outdoors, Bailey said, \u201cbecause you don\u2019t know what they\u2019re getting into. Cats are natural hunters, and one of the animals they love to hunt are birds.\u201d",
      "Avoid touching sick or dead birds yourself. Thoroughly wash your hands after handling poultry or animals.",
      "Cats sick with bird flu might experience loss of appetite, lethargy and fever.",
      "If your cat is usually playful and likes to look out the window, but instead has been sleeping all the time or hiding from you, take note, Bailey said. \u201cThere\u2019s something wrong,\u201d he said.",
      "They could have reddened or inflamed eyes and discharge from the eyes and nose. They might have difficulty breathing or have tremors or seizures.",
      "If your cat is sick, call your veterinary clinic and keep the cat away from anyone with a weakened immune system.",
      "Northwest Naturals, a pet food company in Portland, Oregon, announced a voluntary recall Tuesday of one batch of its 2-pound Feline Turkey Recipe raw frozen pet food after it tested positive for the virus. The product was sold in Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Wisconsin, as well as Canada\u2019s British Columbia.",
      "The recalled food has \u201cbest if used by\u201d dates of May 21, 2026, and June 23, 2026. Consumers should throw it away and contact the place of purchase for a refund.",

      "Williamson is calling for a reinvention of the Democrat party.",
      "Marianne Williamson, spiritual leader and author who ran two longshot Democratic presidential campaigns in 2020 and 2024, is running for chair of the Democratic National Committee, framing her run as a way to reimagine the Democratic Party as the party regroups and takes stock of its losses during the 2024 election cycle.",
      "In an announcement video posted early Thursday morning, Williamson framed her candidacy for party chair as a chance to rethink the party as a whole.",
      "\"I feel that in order for the Democrats to rise like a phoenix on the ashes of our electoral defeat, we need to look at more than just the outer issues, such as data analysis and field organizing and fundraising,\" Williamson said. \"We need to transform -- in a way, we need to reinvent the Democratic Party in order to counter what MAGA is bringing to the table.\"",
      "In an accompanying blog post, Williamson stressed Democrats must better understand President-elect Donald Trump's appeal and strategy to better counter it, adding that she wants to \"reinvent the party from the inside out.\"",
      "\"President Trump has ushered in an age of political theater -- a collective adrenaline rush that has enabled him to not only move masses of people into his camp, but also masses of people away from ours. It does not serve us to underestimate the historic nature of what he has achieved,\" Williamson wrote. \"In fact, it's important that we recognize the psychological and emotional dimensions of Trump's appeal. We need to understand it to create the energy to counter it.\"",
      "\"As Chairwoman, I will work to reinvent the party from the inside out. For if we want a new President in four years, and a new Congress in two, then we must immediately get about the task of creating a new party,\" she added later.",
      "Williamson also said that she would have a \"a 365-days-of-the-year strategy\" to allow Americans to be politically involved yearround and that she wants the party to inspire Americans.",
      "Williamson was unable to generate a groundswell of support in either of her bids for president, although she stayed in the race until the Democratic presidential primaries concluded and she gained some traction with Democrats who wanted to protest the White House on the Israel-Hamas war.",
      "Williamson was also hypercritical of the DNC, in part, for not holding presidential primary debates against President Joe Biden Biden last cycle and has accused it of rigging the process against her.",
      "\"We have a very frayed bond of affection with millions of Americans particularly working people in the United States. We have to address the problem on that level. On the level of the heart. On the level of the mind,\" Williamson told ABC News Live anchor Kyra Phillips on Thursday afternoon. \"People aren't feeling it about Democrats anymore. At least not enough of them to make for the kind of victory we need in '26 and '28.\"",
      "Williamson needs to get the support of at least 40 DNC members to qualify for the first DNC candidate forum in early January. The DNC plans on hosting four moderated forums before the election.",
      "She joins a handful of other declared candidates for DNC chair, including Wisconsin Democratic Party chair Ben Wikler and Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party chair Ken Martin and former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley. Jamie Harrison, the current chairman, isn't running for reelection.",
      "DNC leadership elections will be held at National Harbor outside Washington on Feb. 1.",

    "published": "Wed, 25 Dec 2024 07:41:32 -0500",

    "story": [
      "The fate of President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s Cabinet is still unclear after Republican senators spent much of December carefully dodging questions",
      "WASHINGTON -- The fate of President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s Cabinet is still unclear after Republican senators spent much of December carefully dodging questions about Robert F. Kennedy Jr. \u2019s views on vaccines, accusations of sexual misconduct against Pete Hegseth and Tulsi Gabbard's 2017 meeting with then-President Bashar Assad of Syria.",
      "While some GOP senators have indicated they are all-in for Trump\u2019s picks, others have withheld support, for now, especially on some of his more controversial nominees. The dynamic is injecting uncertainty into the process as Republicans prepare to take the Senate majority in January with a four-seat margin and as Trump aggressively challenges them to confirm his Cabinet immediately.",
      "It\u2019s not unusual for senators to wait until after confirmation hearings to publicly announce a decision. But Republicans are under more pressure than usual as Trump and his allies make clear that they will confront senators who don\u2019t fall in line.",
      "\u201cYou only have control of the Senate because of Donald Trump,\u201d the president-elect\u2019s son, Donald Trump Jr., warned during a media appearance this month. \u201cWithout that, you\u2019d be relegated to insignificance.\u201d",
      "There has been one casualty of the process so far \u2014 former Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida, who withdrew from contention as attorney general after senators relayed private concerns. But Trump has enthusiastically stood by the rest, including Kennedy for secretary of Health and Human Services, Hegseth for secretary of Defense and Gabbard for director of national intelligence.",
      "With hearings starting by mid-January, before Trump is even inaugurated, senators will soon have to decide how closely they will scrutinize the nominees and whether they are willing to vote against any of them. Republicans will have a 53-47 majority, so Trump cannot lose more than three votes on any nomination if Democrats are united in opposition.",
      "The outcome of the confirmation process, and the level of dissent in the Senate, will likely set the tone for Trump\u2019s presidency and his relationship with Congress, which was frequently tumultuous during his first term. He often clashed with the Senate, in particular, but has signaled he expects Republican senators to be more compliant this time around.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not about putting yeses on the board, it\u2019s about keeping nos off the board,\u201d said Oklahoma Sen. Markwayne Mullin, one of Trump\u2019s top allies in the Senate, who speaks with him frequently.",
      "While most Senate Republicans have scrambled to display as much loyalty to Trump as possible, a handful have made clear that they are willing to defend the body\u2019s \u201cadvise and consent\u201d role. Among the senators to watch are moderate Republicans Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Susan Collins of Maine and incoming freshman Sen. John Curtis of Utah.",
      "\u201cAnybody who wants to give me heat for doing my job, bring it on,\u201d Curtis said Sunday on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d when asked about vetting Trump\u2019s nominees. \u201cThis is my job. It\u2019s my constitutional responsibility.\u201d",
      "Still, even moderate senators have shied away from directly criticizing Trump\u2019s picks. And not a single Republican has gone on the record against a nominee.",
      "Several of Trump's picks are expected to sail to confirmation, perhaps even with some Democratic votes. Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., has indicated he will support Florida Sen. Marco Rubio for secretary of State and Rep. Elise Stefanik for United Nations ambassador, as have a few other Democrats.",
      "For the more controversial nominees, though, party unity will be key.",
      "One of Trump\u2019s most embattled picks is Hegseth, a Fox News host and veteran who some see as inexperienced and has publicly questioned whether women should serve in combat. He has also faced allegations of sexual assault and excessive drinking that he has denied. But it's all given some senators pause, despite Trump's enthusiastic support.",
      "Hegseth has faced particular pressure from Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst, herself a combat veteran who has worked to address sexual assault in the military. She has met with Hegseth several times, and has not yet said she will support him. She will have a chance to question him, publicly and face-to-face, in a Senate Armed Services Committee confirmation hearing that is scheduled for Jan. 14.",
      "Though a hearing for Gabbard has not yet been set, senators will also be able to question her publicly and in a classified setting about her trip to Syria after the U.S had severed diplomatic relations. Gabbard has defended the trip, saying it\u2019s important to open dialogue, but critics hear echoes of Russia-fueled talking points in her commentary. Assad fled to Moscow earlier this month after opposition forces overtook Syria in a surprise attack, ending his family\u2019s five decades of rule.",
      "While Republican senators have mostly refrained from publicly expressing concerns about Gabbard\u2019s ties abroad, nearly 100 former senior U.S. diplomats and intelligence and national security officials have urged Senate leaders to schedule closed-door hearings to allow a full review of the government\u2019s files on her.",

      "After a report in the New York Times that one of his advisers filed a petition to revoke approval for the polio vaccine in 2022, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell issued a statement saying that \u201cefforts to undermine public confidence in proven cures are not just uninformed \u2014 they\u2019re dangerous,\u201d and that \u201canyone seeking the Senate\u2019s consent to serve in the incoming administration would do well to steer clear of even the appearance of association with such efforts.\u201d",

      "President-elect Donald Trump says he'll \u201cvigorously pursue\u201d capital punishment after President Joe Biden commuted the sentences of most people on federal death row partly to stop Trump from pushing forward their executions",
      "FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. -- President-elect Donald Trump promised on Tuesday to \u201cvigorously pursue\u201d capital punishment after President Joe Biden commuted the sentences of most people on federal death row partly to stop Trump from pushing forward their executions.",
      "Trump criticized Biden\u2019s decision on Monday to change the sentences of 37 of the 40 condemned people to life in prison without parole, arguing that it was senseless and insulted the families of their victims. Biden said converting their punishments to life imprisonment was consistent with the moratorium imposed on federal executions in cases other than terrorism and hate-motivated mass murder.",
      "\u201cJoe Biden just commuted the Death Sentence on 37 of the worst killers in our Country,\u201d he wrote on his social media site. \u201cWhen you hear the acts of each, you won\u2019t believe that he did this. Makes no sense. Relatives and friends are further devastated. They can\u2019t believe this is happening!\u201d",
      "Presidents historically have no involvement in dictating or recommending the punishments that federal prosecutors seek for defendants in criminal cases, though Trump has long sought more direct control over the Justice Department's operations. The president-elect wrote that he would direct the department to pursue the death penalty \u201cas soon as I am inaugurated,\u201d but was vague on what specific actions he may take and said they would be in cases of \u201cviolent rapists, murderers, and monsters.\u201d",
      "He highlighted the cases of two men who were on federal death row for slaying a woman and a girl, had admitted to killing more and had their sentences commuted by Biden.",
      "On the campaign trail, Trump often called for expanding the federal death penalty \u2014 including for those who kill police officers, those convicted of drug and human trafficking, and migrants who kill U.S. citizens.",
      "\u201cTrump has been fairly consistent in wanting to sort of say that he thinks the death penalty is an important tool and he wants to use it,\u201d said Douglas Berman, an expert on sentencing at Ohio State University\u2019s law school. \u201cBut whether practically any of that can happen, either under existing law or other laws, is a heavy lift.\u201d",
      "Berman said Trump\u2019s statement at this point seems to be just a response to Biden\u2019s commutation.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m inclined to think it\u2019s still in sort of more the rhetoric phase. Just, \u2018don\u2019t worry. The new sheriff is coming. I like the death penalty,\u2019\u201d he said.",
      "Most Americans have historically supported the death penalty for people convicted of murder, according to decades of annual polling by Gallup, but support has declined over the past few decades. About half of Americans were in favor in an October poll, while roughly 7 in 10 Americans backed capital punishment for murderers in 2007.",
      "Before Biden's commutation, there were 40 federal death row inmates compared with more than 2,000 who have been sentenced to death by states.",
      "\u201cThe reality is all of these crimes are typically handled by the states,\u201d Berman said.",
      "A question is whether the Trump administration would try to take over some state murder cases, such as those related to drug trafficking or smuggling. He could also attempt to take cases from states that have abolished the death penalty.",
      "Berman said Trump's statement, along with some recent actions by states, may present an effort to get the Supreme Court to reconsider a precedent that considers the death penalty disproportionate punishment for rape.",
      "\u201cThat would literally take decades to unfold. It\u2019s not something that is going to happen overnight,\u201d Berman said.",
      "Before one of Trump's rallies on Aug. 20, his prepared remarks released to the media said he would announce he would ask for the death penalty for child rapists and child traffickers. But Trump never delivered the line.",
      "One of the men Trump highlighted on Tuesday was ex-Marine Jorge Avila Torrez, who was sentenced to death for killing a sailor in Virginia and later pleaded guilty to the fatal stabbing of an 8-year-old and a 9-year-old girl in a suburban Chicago park several years before.",
      "The other man, Thomas Steven Sanders, was sentenced to death for the kidnapping and slaying of a 12-year-old girl in Louisiana, days after shooting the girl's mother in a wildlife park in Arizona. Court records show he admitted to both killings.",
      "Some families of victims expressed anger with Biden's decision, but the president had faced pressure from advocacy groups urging him to make it more difficult for Trump to increase the use of capital punishment for federal inmates. The ACLU and the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops were some of the groups that applauded the decision.",
      "Biden left three federal inmates to face execution. They are Dylann Roof, who carried out the 2015 racist slayings of nine Black members of Mother Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina; 2013 Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev; and Robert Bowers, who fatally shot 11 congregants at Pittsburgh\u2019s Tree of Life Synagogue in 2018, the deadliest antisemitic attack in U.S history. _______",

    "published": "Tue, 24 Dec 2024 19:03:16 -0500",
    "summary": "Congress members urged President Joe Biden to exonerate civil rights leader Marcus Garvey.",
    "story": [
      "J. Edgar Hoover allegedly targeted Garvey over a century ago.",
      "A group of 21 House Democrats signed a letter urging the president to exonerate former civil rights leader Marcus Garvey, according to a statement sent by the lawmakers to ABC News on Monday.",
      "Congresswoman Yvette D. Clarke (D-NY) led the panel of lawmakers -- mostly from the Congressional Black Caucus -- to exonerate Garvey on the heels of President Joe Biden's commutation of 37 sentences from federal death row on Monday.",
      "Garvey, one of the earliest internationally-known Black civil rights leaders, was convicted of mail fraud in 1923 and was given a five-year sentence, according to a letter sent to Biden from the Congress members, obtained by ABC News. President Calvin Coolidge pardoned Garvey two years into his sentence. Garvey was immediately deported to his birth country of Jamaica.",
      "\"Exonerating Mr. Garvey would honor his work for the Black community, remove the shadow of an unjust conviction, and further this administration's promise to advance racial justice,\" the lawmakers said in the letter to the president. \"At a time when Black history faces the existential threat of erasure by radical state legislatures, a presidential pardon for Mr. Garvey would correct the historical record and restore the legacy of an American hero.\"",
      "Congress members have been trying for decades to clear Garvey's name, according to the congress members. Congressman John Conyers led hearings in 1987 for the House Judiciary Committee on Garvey's exoneration. Congressman Charles Rangel introduced resolutions, highlighting alleged injustices against the former civil rights leader in 2004.",
      "\"Exactly 101 years ago, Mr. Garvey was convicted of mail fraud in a case that was marred by prosecutorial and governmental misconduct,\" The congress members said in the letter. \"The evidence paints an abundantly clear narrative that the charges against Mr. Garvey were not only fabricated but also targeted to criminalize, discredit, and silence him as a civil rights leader.\"",
      "The White House did not immediately reply to ABC News' request for a response.",
      "Garvey, who was born in Jamaica in 1887, was a notable Pan-Africanist, believing that people of African descent around the world should be unified because of their alleged common interests.",
      "Garvey was the founder of the Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA) which was created to challenge racial inequality, according to the lawmakers. The organization championed self-determination and economic independence for Black people at a time when Jim Crow laws oppressed African Americans and colonization subjugated Africans on their own continent.",
      "Garvey also established the Black Star Line, one of the first Black-owned shipping companies in the Western Hemisphere, connecting Black businesses across the Americas, according to the lawmakers. The civil rights leader eventually wanted to route the vessels to Africa for a redemption program, according to the U.S. National Archives and Records Administration. He wanted to establish a nation for those who were born into slavery or were the descendants of enslaved people, according to The Washington Post.",
      "Garvey also created the Negro World Newspaper which, at its peak, reached a circulation of 200,000 readers weekly, according to the congressmembers.",
      "Garvey shared the segregationist views of the Ku Klux Klan as he sought a separate state for those of the African diaspora, according to The Washington Post.",
      "\"I regard the Klan the Anglo Saxon clubs and white American societies as far as the Negro is concerned, as better friends of the race than all other groups of hypocritical whites put together,\" Garvey said according to The New York Times.",
      "Other Black civil rights activists were outraged. W. E. B. Du Bois said Garvey was the most dangerous enemy of the Negro race and was either \"a lunatic or a traitor,\" according to PBS. Du Bois also said Garvey \"suffered from serious defects of temperament and training.\"",
      "The newly formed Bureau of Investigation, later becoming the FBI, and the director of its intelligence division, a-young J. Edgar Hoover, brought mail fraud proceedings against Garvey in connection to the sale of Black Star Line shipping stock, according to The Washington Post. He was sentenced to five years in prison and served two years before his pardon and eventual deportation by Coolidge.",
      "The FBI declined ABC News' request for a comment.",
      "Garvey never returned to the U.S. again, according to the U.S. National Archives and Records Administration.",
      "\"As we approach the conclusion of your administration, this moment provides a chance to leave an indelible mark on history,\" the lawmakers told Biden in their letter.",

We must not lose our year-long struggle for freedom. However, we must continue to be open to cooperation and trade with the whole world, especially with our neighbours.\"",
      "Trump similarly expressed an interest in trying to purchase Greenland during his first administration.",

      "Frederiksen was reelected in 2022. The Danish prime minister's office, in a statement to ABC News, said the \"Danish Government is looking forward to welcoming the new American ambassador. And the Government is looking forward to working with the new administration.\"",
      "\"In a complex security political situation as the one we currently experience, transatlantic cooperation is crucial,\" the office said. \"As far as statements about Greenland, the Prime Minister's Office has no comments other than reference to what was stated by the Premier of Greenland about Greenland not being for sale, but open for cooperation.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 23 Dec 2024 22:39:06 -0500",
    "summary": "A House Ethics Committee report found \"substantial evidence\" that former Rep. Matt Gaetz had sex with a 17-year-old in 2017 in violation of Florida's statutory rape law.",
    "story": [
      "Gaetz had sued the committee to stop the release of the report.",
      "The bipartisan House Ethics Committee on Monday released a scathing report concluding its yearslong investigation into former Rep. Matt Gaetz, finding \"substantial evidence\" that he had sex with a 17-year-old in 2017 in violation of Florida's statutory rape law, and engaged in a broader pattern of paying women for sex.",
      "The report also detailed evidence of illegal drug use, acceptance of improper gifts, granting special favors to personal associates, and obstruction, after Gaetz refused to comply with subpoenas and withheld evidence from the committee.",
      "A woman testified to the committee that Gaetz had sex with her in 2017, when she was 17 and had just completed her junior year of high school, and Gaetz was in his first year in Congress. Identified only as \"Victim A\" in the report, the woman told investigators she received $400 in cash from the then-congressman that evening, \"which she understood to be payment for sex,\" according to the report.",
      "\"The Committee received credible testimony from Victim A herself, as well as multiple individuals corroborating the allegation,\" the report says. \"Victim A said that she did not inform Representative Gaetz that she was under 18 at the time, nor did he ask her age.\"",
      "While many of the allegations in the committee's report have been previously reported, this is the first time the woman's direct testimony about Gaetz having sex with her when she was a minor has been made public, along with corroborating testimony from others.",
      "Investigators noted that while the former Florida congressman has \"suggested that the allegations against him have been manufactured\" and had called into question Victim A's credibility, \"the Committee found no reason to doubt the credibility of Victim A.\"",
      "The report details that between 2017-2020, records obtained by the committee show Gaetz paid nearly $100,000 dollars to 12 different women and to Joel Greenberg, his one-time close friend who in 2021 pleaded guilty to numerous crimes, including sex trafficking Victim A.",
      "While all the women who testified to the committee described their sexual encounters with Gaetz as consensual, according to the report, one woman raised concerns that drug use at the parties and events may have \"impair[ed their] ability to really know what was going on or fully consent.\" Another woman told the committee, \"When I look back on certain moments, I feel violated.\"",
      "The report alleges that Gaetz \"took advantage of the economic vulnerability of young women to lure them into sexual activity for which they received an average of a few hundred dollars after each encounter.\"",
      "\"Such behavior is not 'generosity to ex-girlfriends,' and it does not reflect creditably upon the House,\" the report reads, referencing the former congressman's previous statement dismissing the allegations as someone \"trying to recategorize my generosity to ex-girlfriends as something more untoward.\"",
      "\"Based on the above, the Committee determined there is substantial evidence that Representative Gaetz violated House Rules and other standards of conduct prohibiting prostitution, statutory rape, illicit drug use, impermissible gifts, special favors or privileges, and obstruction of Congress,\" the report says.",
      "Following the release of the report, Gaetz shared on X what appears to be a message he received from President-elect Donald Trump, though it is unclear when the message was sent.",
      "\"I got a great note from President Trump!\" Gaetz wrote alongside a photograph showing what appears to be a brief message from Trump, saying, \"Matt very unfair!\"",
      "Gaetz has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing. The Justice Department declined to charge him last year after a yearslong investigation into similar allegations.",
      "Last month, Trump tapped Gaetz to serve as attorney general in the incoming administration, and Gaetz resigned his congressional seat shortly after. Gaetz subsequently withdrew his name from consideration for AG, saying his confirmation process was \"unfairly becoming a distraction to the critical work of the Trump/Vance Transition.\"",
      "The Ethics Committee was in the final stages of its probe into Gaetz when Trump tapped him for attorney general. The committee generally drops investigations of members if they leave office, but Gaetz's resignation prompted a fiery debate on Capitol Hill over whether the panel should release its report to allow the Senate to perform its role of vetting presidential nominations.",
      "Following indications last week that the committee would release its report, Gaetz took to X in a lengthy post, writing in part that when he was single he \"often sent funds to women\" he dated and that he \"never had sexual contact with someone under 18.\"",
      "\"It's embarrassing, though not criminal, that I probably partied, womanized, drank and smoked more than I should have earlier in life. I live a different life now,\" he posted. \"I've never been charged. I've never been sued. Instead, House Ethics will reportedly post a report online that I have no opportunity to debate or rebut as a former member of the body.\"",
      "In its report, the committee concluded that it did not find substantial evidence that Gaetz violated federal sex trafficking laws, finding that while Gaetz \"did cause the transportation of women across state lines for purposes of commercial sex,\" investigators did not find evidence \"that any of those women were under 18 at the time of travel, nor did the Committee find sufficient evidence to conclude that the commercial sex acts were induced by force, fraud, or coercion.\"",
      "According to the report, the committee conducted over two dozen interviews, issued 29 subpoenas, reviewed nearly 14,000 documents, and requested information from multiple government agencies as part of its extensive investigation into the allegations.",
      "The committee received written testimony from Greenberg but, due to credibility concerns, investigators said they would \"not rely exclusively on information provided by Mr. Greenberg,\" according to the report.",
      "The committee also accused Gaetz of obstructing its investigation by ignoring subpoenas, withholding documents, and declining to answer questions about the allegations.",
      "\"Representative Gaetz continuously sought to deflect, deter, or mislead the Committee in order to prevent his actions from being exposed,\" the report reads. \"His actions undermine not only his claims that he had exculpatory information to provide, but also his claims that he intended to cooperate with the Committee in good faith. It is apparent that Representative Gaetz's assertions were nothing more than attempts to delay the Committee's investigation.\"",
      "The committee had been investigating allegations that Gaetz engaged in sexual misconduct and illicit drug use, shared inappropriate images or videos on the House floor, misused state identification records, converted campaign funds to personal use, and/or accepted a bribe, improper gratuity, or impermissible gift, according to sources.",
      "Earlier this year, the committee released a statement that it would continue its probe but would no longer pursue allegations that Gaetz \"may have shared inappropriate images or videos on the House floor, misused state identification records, converted campaign funds to personal use, and/or accepted a bribe or improper gratuity.\"",
      "According to the report, while several committee members did not support its release, a majority of its members voted in favor of its release on Dec. 10. In a statement at the conclusion of the report, House Ethics Chairman Michael Guest reiterated his stance against the release of the report on behalf of the dissenting members while acknowledging that he and other members do not dispute the report's findings.",
      "\"We believe and remain steadfast in the position that the House Committee on Ethics lost jurisdiction to release to the public any substantive work product regarding Mr. Gaetz after his resignation from the House on November 14, 2024,\" Guest wrote.",
      "Earlier Monday Gaetz filed a lawsuit against the Ethics Committee in an effort to stop the committee from releasing its report.",
      "\"This action challenges the Committee's unconstitutional and ultra vires attempt to exercise jurisdiction over a private citizen through the threatened release of an investigative report containing potentially defamatory allegations,\" the filing from Gaetz said.",
      "Gaetz in the filing asked the court to issue a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction to block the release of the report or any findings, which he says would cause \"damage to his reputation and professional standing\" that would be \"immediate and severe.\"",
      "\"The threatened release of information believed to be defamatory by a Congressional committee concerning matters of sexual propriety and other acts of alleged moral turpitude constitutes irreparable harm that cannot be adequately remedied through monetary damages,\" the filing stated.",

    "published": "Sun, 22 Dec 2024 11:22:27 -0500",
    "summary": "\u201cIf you're rooting against the president, you are rooting against the nation,\u201d the Pennsylvania Democratic senator told ABC \u201cThis Week\u201d co-anchor Jonathan Karl.",
    "story": [
      "Fetterman said his colleagues should \"chill out\" over everything Trump does.",
      "Pennsylvania Democrat Sen. John Fetterman said he hopes President-elect Donald Trump is successful in his second term and that he's not \"rooting against him.\"",
      "\"If you're rooting against the president, you are rooting against the nation,\" Fetterman told ABC \"This Week\" co-anchor Jonathan Karl. \"So country first. I know that's become maybe like a cliche, but it happens to be true.\"",
      "Fetterman, who has made headlines as one of the few in his party who have met with several of Trump's cabinet picks, said his Democratic colleagues need to \"chill out\" over everything Trump does.",
      "\"I've been warning people, like, 'You got to chill out,' you know? Like the constant, you know, freakout, it's not helpful,\" Fetterman said. \"Pack a lunch, pace yourself, because he hasn't even taken office yet.\"",
      "Asked by Karl what the single biggest factor was behind Vice President Kamala Harris' loss in November, Fetterman pointed to the \"undeniable\" and \"singular political talent\" of Trump.",
      "\"He had the energy and almost a sense of fearlessness to just say all those kinds of things,\" Fetterman said. \"You literally were shot in your head and had the presence of mind to respond, you know, 'Fight, fight, fight!' I mean, that's a political talent.\"",
      "Fetterman also said that the election was \"never about fascism\" to him. Harris said in an October town hall that she believed Trump was a fascist after Trump's former chief of staff John Kelly said that his old boss fit the definition of one. Fetterman said that was not a word he would use.",
      "\"Fascism, that's not a word that regular people, you know, use, you know?\" Fetterman said. \"I think people are going to decide who is the candidate that's going to protect and project, you know, my version of the American way of life, and that's what happened.\"",
      "Fetterman also pointed to Elon Musk's endorsement of Trump as another key factor in the election.",
      "\"It's rare to have a surrogate that has a lot of fanboys and is very compelling to a lot of the demographic that we are losing in my party and in Pennsylvania,\" Fetterman said about the billionaire businessman.",
      "Fetterman said Musk's endorsement \"really mattered\" and he believed it did \"move the needle.\"",
      "Fetterman was the first Democrat in the Senate to meet with Pete Hegseth, the controversial former Fox News anchor who Trump selected for defense secretary. Fetterman has not ruled out supporting him -- or any of Trump's other picks.",
      "\"My commitment, and I think I'm doing the job, is I'm going to sit down and have a conversation,\" Fetterman said. \"To me, it would be distressing if, if he is confirmed, if the Democrats are going to turn our back collectively to the leader of the defense. I mean, that's astonishing and that's dangerous.\"",
      "Along with Hegseth, Fetterman has met with Tulsi Gabbard, Trump's pick for director of national intelligence, and Kash Patel, Trump's selection for FBI director.",
      "Patel's vow to take on Trump's political enemies has drawn scrutiny. Asked by Karl whether he thinks Patel will use the FBI to do so, Fetterman said while he wasn't able to go into detail due to the off-the-record nature of the meeting, \"That's never going to happen.\"",
      "\"So you see yourself inclined to be open to supporting these controversial nominees?\" Karl asked.",
      "\"Potentially,\" Fetterman replied. \"But nobody can accuse me of just saying I had a closed mind, or I just said no because Trump picked this person, or whatever.\"",
      "Fetterman has said he will vote to confirm Rep. Elise Stefanik as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. He said he will also back Sen. Marco Rubio for secretary of state.",
      "\"Rubio, for me, it's like, he's in the other party, obviously, but you know, there's a lot of, the Venn [diagram] is closer, there's a lot of overlap,\" Fetterman said. \"If I was, as a Democrat, looking to assemble a bipartisan cabinet, he'd be a solid choice.\"",
      "Asked what his message to Trump would be if the president-elect called him, Fetterman said he'd like to talk about opportunities where \"we could work together.\"",
      "\"I'd like to avoid the, you know, the cheap heat and some of the other stuff, but it's going to be a kooky ride, I'm sure,\" he said. \"And you know, I try to be a committed, steady voice for Pennsylvania and to remember that we have to find as many wins in the middle of incredibly divisive times.\"",

      "A line of severe thunderstorms are firing up in Texas and could spark severe weather, including high winds, hail and potential tornadoes",
      "DALLAS -- Some flights were delayed or canceled in Texas on Thursday after a line of thunderstorms started moving across parts of the state in a system the National Weather Service predicted could bring high winds, hail and possible tornadoes.",
      "Nearly 90 flights were delayed and more than two dozen cancelled at Dallas Fort Worth International Airport early Thursday. Delays and thunderstorm-related cancellations also were reported at Dallas' Love Field and George Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston, according to FlightAware, an aviation company that tracks flights across the world.",
      "The greatest weather risk was forecast for a stretch of Texas east of Dallas, between Houston and portions of southern Arkansas and western and northern Louisiana, said Brian Hurley, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service's Weather Prediction Center.",
      "\u201cThere does look like the possibility of one or a few tornadoes with this risk, but the main risk will be with high winds and hail,\u201d Hurley said, adding that he expected wind gusts generally between 60 and 80 mph (96 to 128 kph), and hail one inch (2.5 centimeters) in diameter or greater.",
      "Hurley said the storms will likely push into southern Arkansas and western and northern Louisiana after dark, posing a potentially dangerous situation for holiday travelers.",
      "\u201cPeople can't see a whole lot and may not be as weather aware,\u201d he said."

      "Republicans in Congress plan to move quickly in their effort to overhaul the nation\u2019s voting procedures, seeing an opportunity with control of the White House and both chambers of Congress",
      "ATLANTA -- Republicans plan to move quickly in their effort to overhaul the nation\u2019s voting procedures, seeing an opportunity with control of the White House and both chambers of Congress to push through long-sought changes that include voter ID and proof-of-citizenship requirements.",
      "They say the measures are needed to restore public confidence in elections, an erosion of trust that Democrats note has been fueled by false claims from President-elect Donald Trump and his allies of widespread fraud in the 2020 election. In the new year, Republicans will be under pressure to address Trump\u2019s desires to change how elections are run in the U.S., something he continues to promote despite his win in November.",
      "The main legislation that Republicans expect to push will be versions of the American Confidence in Elections Act and the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act, said GOP Rep. Bryan Steil of Wisconsin, chair of the Committee on House Administration, which handles election-related legislation. The proposals are known as the ACE and SAVE acts, respectively.",
      "\u201cAs we look to the new year with unified Republican government, we have a real opportunity to move these pieces of legislation not only out of committee, but across the House floor and into law,\u201d Steil said in an interview. \u201cWe need to improve Americans\u2019 confidence in elections.\u201d",
      "Republicans are likely to face opposition from Democrats and have little wiggle room with their narrow majorities in both the House and Senate. Steil said he expects there will be \u201csome reforms and tweaks\u201d to the original proposals and hopes Democrats will work with Republicans to refine and ultimately support them.",
      "New York Rep. Joe Morelle, the ranking Democrat on the committee, said there was an opportunity for bipartisan agreement on some issues but said the two previous GOP bills go too far.",
      "\u201cOur view and the Republicans\u2019 view is very different on this point,\u201d Morelle said. \u201cThey have spent most of the time in the last two years and beyond really restricting the rights of people to get to ballots \u2013 and that\u2019s at the state level and the federal level. And the SAVE Act and the ACE Act both do that \u2013 make it harder for people to vote.\u201d",
      "Morelle said he wants to see both parties support dedicated federal funding for election offices. He sees other bipartisan opportunities around limiting foreign money in U.S. elections and possibly imposing a voter ID requirement if certain safeguards are in place to protect voters.",
      "Democrats say some state laws are too restrictive in limiting the types of IDs that are acceptable for voting, making it harder for college students or those who lack a permanent address.",
      "Morelle said he was disappointed by the GOP\u2019s claims in this year's campaigns about widespread voting by noncitizens, which is extremely rare, and noted how those claims all but evaporated once Trump won. Voting by noncitizens is already illegal and and can result in felony charges and deportation.",
      "\u201cYou haven\u2019t heard a word about this since Election Day,\u201d Morelle said. \u201cIt\u2019s an Election Day miracle that suddenly the thing that they had spent an inordinate amount of time describing as a rampant problem, epidemic problem, didn\u2019t exist at all.\u201d",
      "Before the November election, House Republicans pushed the SAVE Act, which passed the House in July but stalled in the Democrat-controlled Senate. It requires proof of citizenship when registering to vote and includes potential penalties for election officials who fail to confirm eligibility.",
      "Republicans say the current process relies on an what they call an honor system with loopholes that have allowed noncitizens to register and vote in past elections. While voting by noncitizens has occurred, research and reviews of state cases have shown it to be rare and typically a mistake rather than an intentional effort to sway an election.",
      "Under the current system, those seeking to register are asked to provide either a state driver\u2019s license number or the last four digits of a Social Security number. A few states require a full Social Security number.",
      "Republicans say the voter registration process is not tight enough because in many states people can be added to voter rolls even if they do not provide this information and that some noncitizens can receive Social Security numbers and driver\u2019s licenses. They believe the current requirement that anyone completing a voter registration form sign under oath that they are a U.S. citizen is not enough.",
      "They want to force states to reject any voter registration application for which proof of citizenship is not provided. Republicans say that could include a REAL ID-compliant driver\u2019s license, a passport or a birth certificate.",
      "In Georgia, a perennial presidential battleground state, election officials said they have not encountered any hiccups verifying the citizenship status of its nearly 7.3 million registered voters. They conducted an audit in 2022 that identified 1,634 people who had attempted to register but were not able to be verified as U.S. citizens by a federal database.",
      "A second audit this year used local court records to identify people who said they could not serve as a juror because they were not a U.S. citizen. Of the 20 people identified, six were investigated for illegal voting, though one of those cases was closed because the person had since died.",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019ve done by doing those audits is give voters confidence that we do not have noncitizens voting here in Georgia,\u201d said Brad Raffensperger, Georgia\u2019s secretary of state. \u201cAnd when society is highly polarized, you have to look at building trust. Trust is the gold standard.\u201d",
      "Raffensperger, a Republican who supports both voter ID and proof of citizenship requirements, credits the state\u2019s early adoption of REAL ID and use of automatic voter registration for ensuring voter lists are accurate. The latter is something he hopes more Republicans will consider, as he argued it has allowed Georgia election officials to use the motor vehicle agency\u2019s process to verify citizenship and track people moving in and around the state.",
      "\u201cYou have to get it right because you\u2019re talking about people\u2019s priceless franchise to vote,\u201d Raffensperger said.",
      "If Congress does pass any changes, it would fall to election officials across the country to implement them.",
      "Raffensperger and Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, a Democrat, said it would be a mistake to move the country to a single day of voting, something Trump has said he would like to see happen, because it would eliminate early voting and limit access to mail ballots. Both methods are extremely popular among voters. In Georgia, 71% of voters in November cast their ballots in person before Election Day.",
      "Both said they hoped lawmakers would look to what is working in their states and build off those successes.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve proven time and time again in our states that our elections are secure and are accurate,\u201d Benson said."

      "A lot of Americans, after an intense presidential election campaign, are looking for a break in political news",
      "NEW YORK -- As a Democrat who immersed himself in political news during the presidential campaign, Ziad Aunallah has much in common with many Americans since the election. He's tuned out.",
      "\u201cPeople are mentally exhausted,\u201d said Aunallah, 45, of San Diego. \u201cEveryone knows what is coming and we are just taking some time off.\u201d",
      "Television ratings \u2014 and now a new poll \u2014 clearly illustrate the phenomenon. About two-thirds of American adults say they have recently felt the need to limit media consumption about politics and government because of overload, according to the survey from the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.",
      "Smaller percentages of Americans are limiting their intake of news about overseas conflicts, the economy or climate change, the poll says. Politics stand out.",
      "Election news on CNN and MSNBC was taking up too much of Sam Gude's time before the election, said the 47-year-old electrician from Lincoln, Nebraska. \u201cThe last thing I want to watch right now is the interregnum,\u201d said Gude, a Democrat and no fan of President-elect Donald Trump.",
      "The poll, conducted in early December, found that about 7 in 10 Democrats say they are stepping back from political news. The percentage isn't as high for Republicans, who have reason to celebrate Trump's victory. Still, about 6 in 10 Republicans say they've felt the need to take some time off too, and the share for independents is similar.",
      "The differences are far starker for the TV networks that have been consumed by political news.",
      "After election night through Dec. 13, the prime-time viewership of MSNBC was an average of 620,000, down 54% from the pre-election audience this year, the Nielsen company said. For the same time comparison, CNN's average of 405,000 viewers was down 45%.",
      "At Fox News Channel, a favorite news network for Trump fans, the post-election average of 2.68 million viewers is up 13%, Nielsen said. Since the election, 72% of the people watching one of those three cable networks in the evening were watching Fox News, compared to 53% prior to election day.",
      "A post-election slump for fans of the losing candidate is not a new trend for networks that have become heavily identified for a partisan audience. MSNBC had similar issues after Trump was elected in 2016. Same for Fox in 2020, although that was complicated by anger: many of its viewers were outraged then by the network's crucial election night call of Arizona for the Democratic presidential candidate, Joe Biden, and sought alternatives.",
      "MSNBC had its own anger issues after several \u201cMorning Joe\u201d viewers became upset that hosts Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski visited Trump shortly after his victory last month. Yet while the show's ratings are down 35% since Election Day, that's a smaller drop than the network's prime-time ratings.",
      "CNN points out that while it has been suffering in the television ratings, its streaming and digital ratings have been consistent.",
      "MSNBC can take some solace in history. In previous years, network ratings bounce back when the depression after an election loss lifts. When a new administration takes office, people who oppose it are frequently looking for a gathering place.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll be tuning back in once the clown show starts,\u201d Aunallah said. \u201cYou have no choice. Whether or not you want to hear it, it's happening. If you care about your country, you have no choice but to pay attention.\u201d",
      "But the ride may not be smooth. MSNBC's slide is steeper than it was in 2016; and there's some question about whether Trump opponents will want to be as engaged as they were during his first term. People are also unplugging from cable television in rates that are only getting more rapid, although MSNBC believes it has bucked this trend eating away at audiences before.",
      "The poll indicates that Americans want less talk about politics from public figures in general. After an election season where endorsements from celebrities like Taylor Swift made headlines, the survey found that Americans are more likely to disapprove than approve of celebrities, large companies and professional athletes speaking out about politics.",
      "Still, Gude is among those discovering other ways to get news to which he does want to pay attention, including on YouTube.",
      "MSNBC is also in the middle of some corporate upheaval that raises questions about potential changes. Parent company Comcast announced last month that the cable network is among some properties that will spin off into a new company, which will give MSNBC new corporate leadership and cut its ties to NBC News.",
      "Some of the Americans who have turned away from political news lately also had some advice for getting them engaged again.",
      "Gude said, for example, that MSNBC will always have a hard-core audience of Trump haters. But if the network wants to expand its audience, \u201cthen you have to talk about issues, and you have to stop talking about Trump.\u201d",
      "Kathleen Kendrick, a 36-year-old sales rep from Grand Junction, Colorado, who's a registered independent voter, said she hears plenty of people loudly spouting off about their political opinions on the job. She wants more depth when she watches the news. Much of what she sees is one-sided and shallow, she said.",
      "\u201cYou get a story but only part of a story,\u201d Kendrick said. \u201cIt would be nice if you could get both sides, and more research.\u201d",
      "Aunallah, similarly, is looking for more depth and variety. He's not interested \u201cin watching the angry man on the corner yelling at me anymore,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cIt's kind of their own fault that I'm not watching,\u201d he said. \u201cI felt they spent all this time talking about the election. They made it so much of their focus that when the main event ends, why would people want to keep watching?\u201d",

      "What a wonderful year 2024 has been for investors",
      "NEW YORK -- What a wonderful year 2024 has been for investors.",
      "U.S. stocks ripped higher and carried the S&P 500 to records as the economy kept growing and the Federal Reserve began cutting interest rates.",
      "The year featured many familiar winners, such as Big Tech, which got even bigger as their stock prices kept growing. But it wasn't just Apple, Nvidia and the like. Bitcoin, gold and other investments also drove higher.",
      "Here's a look at some of the numbers that defined the year. All are as of Dec. 20.",
      "Remember when President Bill Clinton got impeached or when baseball's Mark McGwire hit his 70th home run against the Montreal Expos? That was the last time the U.S. stock market closed out a second straight year with a leap of at least 20%, something the S&P 500 is on track to do again this year. The index has climbed 24.3% so far this year, not including dividends, following last year's spurt of 24.2%.",
      "The number of all-time highs the S&P 500 has set so far this year. The first came early, on Jan. 19, when the index capped a two-year comeback from the swoon caused by high inflation and worries that high interest rates instituted by the Federal Reserve to combat it would create a recession. But the index was methodical through the rest of the year, setting a record in every month outside of April and August, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. The latest came on Dec. 6.",
      "The number of times the Federal Reserve has cut its main interest rate this year from a two-decade high, offering some relief to the economy. Expectations for those cuts, along with hopes for more in 2025, were a big reason the U.S. stock market has been so successful this year. The 1 percentage point of cuts, though, is still short of the 1.5 percentage points that many traders were forecasting for 2024 at the start of the year. The Fed disappointed investors in December when it said it may cut rates just two more times in 2025, fewer than it had earlier expected.",
      "That\u2019s how many points the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose by the day after Election Day, as investors made bets on what Donald Trump\u2019s return to the White House will mean for the economy and the world. The more widely followed S&P 500 soared 2.5% for its best day in nearly two years. Aside from bitcoin, stocks of banks and smaller winners were also perceived to be big winners. The bump has since diminished amid worries that Trump\u2019s policies could also send inflation higher.",
      "The level that bitcoin topped to set a record above $108,000 this past month. It's been climbing as interest rates come down, and it got a particularly big boost following Trump's election. He's turned around and become a fan of crypto, and he's named a former regulator who\u2019s seen as friendly to digital currencies as the next chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, replacing someone who critics said was overly aggressive in his oversight. Bitcoin was below $17,000 just two years ago following the collapse of crypto exchange FTX.",
      "Gold's rise for the year, as it also hit records and had as strong a run as U.S. stocks. Wars around the world have helped drive demand for investments seen as safe, such as gold. It's also benefited from the Fed's cut to interest rates. When bonds are paying less in interest, they pull away fewer potential buyers from gold, which pays investors nothing.",
      "It's a favorite number of Elon Musk, and it's also a threshold that Tesla's stock price passed in December as it set a record. The number has a long history among marijuana devotees, and Musk famously said in 2018 that he had secured funding to take Tesla private at $420 per share. Tesla soared this year, up from less than $250 at the start, in part because of expectations that Musk's close relationship with Trump could benefit the company.",
      "That's how much revenue Nvidia made in the nine months through Oct. 27, showing how the artificial-intelligence frenzy is creating mountains of cash. Nvidia's chips are driving much of the move into AI, and its revenue through the last nine months catapulted from less than $39 billion the year before. Such growth has boosted Nvidia's worth to more than $3 trillion in total.",
      "GameStop\u2019s gain on May 13 after Keith Gill, better known as \u201cRoaring Kitty,\u201d appeared online for the first time in three years to support the video game retailer\u2019s stock, which he helped rocket to unimaginable heights during the \u201c meme stock craze \u201d in 2021. Several other meme stocks also jumped following his post in May on the social platform X, including AMC Entertainment. Gill later disclosed a sizeable stake in the online pet products retailer Chewy, but he sold all of his holdings by late October.",
      "That's how much the U.S. economy grew, at annualized seasonally adjusted rates, in each of the three first quarters of this year. Such growth blew past what many pessimists were expecting when inflation was topping 9% in the summer of 2022. The fear was that the medicine prescribed by the Fed to beat high inflation \u2014 high interest rates \u2014 would create a recession. Households at the lower end of the income spectrum in particular are feeling pain now, as they contend with still-high prices. But the overall economy has remained remarkably resilient.",
      "This is the vacancy rate for U.S. office buildings \u2014 an all-time high \u2014 through the first three quarters of 2024, according to data from Moody's. The fact the rate held steady for most of the year was something of a win for office building owners, given that it had marched up steadily from 16.8% in the fourth quarter of 2019.

      "That's the total number of previously occupied homes sold nationally through the first 11 months of 2024. Sales would have to surge 20% year-over-year in December for 2024's home sales to match the 4.09 million existing homes sold in 2023, a nearly 30-year low. The U.S. housing market has been in a sales slump dating back to 2022, when mortgage rates began to climb from pandemic-era lows. A shortage of homes for sale and elevated mortgage rates have discouraged many would-be homebuyers.",

      "Jerry and Sibrina Barnett never spent a single day apart in 35 years together",
      "ERWIN, Tenn. -- Jerry and Sibrina Barrett never spent a day apart over 35 years. They worked long hours, never took vacations, and liked to relax with their son at home. They had no idea that a hurricane could reach them in the mountains of East Tennessee.",
      "Living in Johnson City, they were barely aware that Hurricane Helene made landfall in Florida on September 26. The next day it was raining heavily, so Sibrina went in late to her once-a-week cleaning job at the Impact Plastics factory.",
      "It was the last time they saw each other.",
      "Today, Sibrina Barnett's clothes are just where she left them, on her side of the bed. Her nail polish and shampoo are still in the bathroom. Her sweater still hangs from the back of a kitchen chair. Jerry knows he will have to move them one day, but not yet.",
      "Helene caused catastrophic damage, the deadliest storm to hit the U.S. mainland since Katrina in 2005. At least 221 people were killed. Many were like Sibrina, drowning in floods hundreds of miles inland. Behind every number was a person whose absence is sorely felt.",
      "She was 17 and he was 20 when they met, and \"35 years later, we never left each other\u2019s side,\u201d Jerry said.",
      "At first they would cruise in Jerry's Camaro and blast the stereo, which \u201cyou could hear from a little way,\u201d he jokes. They would \"catch a group of friends or something, maybe park and sit around and talk\u201d between her night shifts as a waitress.",
      "\u201cWe wasn\u2019t really wild people or anything. We was just a couple young people trying to enjoy life a little bit,\u201d he said.",
      "A few years later, she was pregnant. They got married and made their future, in a mobile home in the same community Jerry has known all his life.",
      "\u201cMe and her, both, growing up as kids, didn\u2019t really have a lot,\u201d Jerry says. \u201cWe wasn\u2019t poor, but we wasn\u2019t wearing Levi\u2019s and Nikes and stuff either.\u201d",
      "They were both workaholics. He does HVAC repair, but she was proud to be the main breadwinner. Six days a week, she'd handle a morning cleaning job, then clean a private school in the evening. Clients loved her for being meticulous \u2014 she'd sometimes go back over areas already cleaned by a different crew until they met her standards.",
      "\u201cWork making money, that\u2019s how you\u2019re going to have anything,\u201d Jerry says. \u201cShe spoiled me and my son. That\u2019s exactly what she did.\u201d",
      "Caimen is 21 now, but the first thing visitors see in the home he shares with his dad is a coffee-table-sized resin model of characters from the Dragonball Z anime show. Dozens of smaller models fill a living room display case. Still more line the hallway. Sibrina ordered the figures and they would assemble them together. Some came all the way from Japan and cost thousands of dollars.",
      "\"We decided to kind of just enjoy it as we went, instead of trying to have a bunch for retirement or our older age,\u201d Jerry said. Given what happened, \u201cI\u2019m kind of glad we did.\u201d",
      "One of the display cases now holds Sibrina\u2019s urn.",
      "Sibrina hated driving in bad weather, so she went in late to Impact Plastics on Sept. 27. Rainwater would often pool on the factory parking lot, but she called Jerry on her break to report it was higher than usual. Then she called again \u2014 the water had risen to the bottom of her car door. Jerry put his tools away and drove to get her, but the exit off the interstate was blocked.",
      "\"Don\u2019t worry about even trying to get down in here,\u201d she told him. \u201cShe said, \u2018Just go home. It looks like I\u2019m going to be here for a few hours.\u2019\u201d",
      "What happened next, Jerry learned second-hand. As the water kept rising, Sibrina and nine other workers retreated to the highest point \u2014 the flatbed of a tractor-trailer loaded with giant coils of plastic tubing. It wasn't high enough. They called 911, but first responders were focused on a different emergency: Dozens of people were trapped on the roof of a nearby hospital.",
      "Then the truck flipped over, sending the workers into the raging water. Some managed to float on the tubing and were washed onto a pile of debris. Sibrina was one of six who died.",
      "Many Americans haven't thought of inland areas as being particularly vulnerable to severe weather, but places like Erwin, in a valley alongside the Nolichucky River, are increasingly prone to disasters.",
      "Jerry hung up with Sibrina and went back to work. He had no idea how bad the flooding was, and didn't learn she was missing until hours later. He tried searching for clues in YouTube videos. Eight days passed before her body was recovered.",
      "Jerry's lawyer, Luke Widener, said the workers relied on management to warn them of dangers outside because the factory had few windows. Some said they weren't allowed to stop work until the power went out. By then the access road was under water.",
      "Widener also represents Zinnia Adkins, who earned $11.50 an hour as a temporary employee at Impact Plastics. She's alive, she said, because a co-worker gripped her tightly in the chest-deep water. She can't swim and is deathly afraid of spiders, which were all over the water's surface. Months later, she still sleeps on the couch because the bed feels too open and unsafe.",
      "\u201cA lot of good people lost their lives that day,\" Adkins said. \u201cIt\u2019s just it\u2019s a hard memory for me to relive.\u201d",
      "The family of another employee, Johnny Peterson, filed a wrongful-death lawsuit against the company and its owner, Gerald O\u2019Connor, who said the workers were dismissed with enough time to escape.",
      "The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation and the state\u2019s workplace safety office have opened investigations."

      "A man accused of attempting to assassinate President-elect Donald Trump in South Florida won\u2019t be tried until September 2025",
      "ORLANDO, Fla. -- A man accused of attempting to assassinate President-elect Donald Trump in South Florida won't be tried until September 2025, a federal judge ruled this week.",
      "Ryan Routh's trial will begin Sept. 8 instead of the previously scheduled Feb. 10, 2025 start date, U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon said in an order released on Monday.",
      "Routh, 58, a Hawaii resident, has pleaded not guilty.",
      "Routh's attorneys had asked the judge to delay the trial until no earlier than next December, saying they needed more time to review the evidence against him and decide whether to mount an insanity defense.",
      "Routh owned 17 cellphones and numerous other electronic devices, and there are hundreds of hours of police body camera and surveillance videos that have been provided to the defense, Routh's attorneys argued during a hearing two weeks ago in Fort Pierce, Florida.",
      "In her order, Cannon said she wanted to err on the side of providing more time given the seriousness of the allegations, but that starting the trial no earlier than December would be an excessive amount. A September trial date didn't amount to an \u201cunreasonable delay,\u201d she said.",
      "The judge said that any insanity defense or any request related to Routh's mental competency must be made by early February. Any visit to the scene of the assassination attempt must be made by the end of February.",
      "Prosecutors say Routh methodically plotted to kill Trump for weeks before aiming a rifle through the shrubbery as Trump played golf on Sept. 15, 2024 at his West Palm Beach country club. Before Trump came into view, Routh was spotted by a Secret Service agent. Routh allegedly aimed his rifle at the agent, who opened fire, causing Routh to drop his weapon and flee without firing a shot. Prosecutors say he left behind a note describing his intentions.",
      "He was arrested a short time later driving on a nearby interstate.",
      "Routh\u2019s charge of attempted assassination of a major presidential candidate carries a potential life sentence in the event of a conviction. Other charges include assaulting a federal officer and three firearms counts. He is being held without bail at the federal jail in Miami.",
      "Routh\u2019s arrest came two months after Trump was shot and wounded in the ear in an assassination attempt during a campaign rally in Pennsylvania. The Secret Service acknowledged failings leading up to that shooting but has said security worked as it should have to thwart the potential Florida attack.",

      "The fate of President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s Cabinet is still unclear after Republican senators spent much of December carefully dodging questions",
      "WASHINGTON -- The fate of President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s Cabinet is still unclear after Republican senators spent much of December carefully dodging questions about Robert F. Kennedy Jr. \u2019s views on vaccines, accusations of sexual misconduct against Pete Hegseth and Tulsi Gabbard's 2017 meeting with then-President Bashar Assad of Syria.",
      "While some GOP senators have indicated they are all-in for Trump\u2019s picks, others have withheld support, for now, especially on some of his more controversial nominees. The dynamic is injecting uncertainty into the process as Republicans prepare to take the Senate majority in January with a four-seat margin and as Trump aggressively challenges them to confirm his Cabinet immediately.",
      "It\u2019s not unusual for senators to wait until after confirmation hearings to publicly announce a decision. But Republicans are under more pressure than usual as Trump and his allies make clear that they will confront senators who don\u2019t fall in line.",
      "\u201cYou only have control of the Senate because of Donald Trump,\u201d the president-elect\u2019s son, Donald Trump Jr., warned during a media appearance this month. \u201cWithout that, you\u2019d be relegated to insignificance.\u201d",
      "There has been one casualty of the process so far \u2014 former Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida, who withdrew from contention as attorney general after senators relayed private concerns. But Trump has enthusiastically stood by the rest, including Kennedy for secretary of Health and Human Services, Hegseth for secretary of Defense and Gabbard for director of national intelligence.",
      "With hearings starting by mid-January, before Trump is even inaugurated, senators will soon have to decide how closely they will scrutinize the nominees and whether they are willing to vote against any of them. Republicans will have a 53-47 majority, so Trump cannot lose more than three votes on any nomination if Democrats are united in opposition.",
      "The outcome of the confirmation process, and the level of dissent in the Senate, will likely set the tone for Trump\u2019s presidency and his relationship with Congress, which was frequently tumultuous during his first term. He often clashed with the Senate, in particular, but has signaled he expects Republican senators to be more compliant this time around.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not about putting yeses on the board, it\u2019s about keeping nos off the board,\u201d said Oklahoma Sen. Markwayne Mullin, one of Trump\u2019s top allies in the Senate, who speaks with him frequently.",
      "While most Senate Republicans have scrambled to display as much loyalty to Trump as possible, a handful have made clear that they are willing to defend the body\u2019s \u201cadvise and consent\u201d role. Among the senators to watch are moderate Republicans Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Susan Collins of Maine and incoming freshman Sen. John Curtis of Utah.",
      "\u201cAnybody who wants to give me heat for doing my job, bring it on,\u201d Curtis said Sunday on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d when asked about vetting Trump\u2019s nominees. \u201cThis is my job. It\u2019s my constitutional responsibility.\u201d",
      "Still, even moderate senators have shied away from directly criticizing Trump\u2019s picks. And not a single Republican has gone on the record against a nominee.",
      "Several of Trump's picks are expected to sail to confirmation, perhaps even with some Democratic votes. Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., has indicated he will support Florida Sen. Marco Rubio for secretary of State and Rep. Elise Stefanik for United Nations ambassador, as have a few other Democrats.",
      "For the more controversial nominees, though, party unity will be key.",
      "One of Trump\u2019s most embattled picks is Hegseth, a Fox News host and veteran who some see as inexperienced and has publicly questioned whether women should serve in combat. He has also faced allegations of sexual assault and excessive drinking that he has denied. But it's all given some senators pause, despite Trump's enthusiastic support.",
      "Hegseth has faced particular pressure from Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst, herself a combat veteran who has worked to address sexual assault in the military. She has met with Hegseth several times, and has not yet said she will support him. She will have a chance to question him, publicly and face-to-face, in a Senate Armed Services Committee confirmation hearing that is scheduled for Jan. 14.",
      "Though a hearing for Gabbard has not yet been set, senators will also be able to question her publicly and in a classified setting about her trip to Syria after the U.S had severed diplomatic relations. Gabbard has defended the trip, saying it\u2019s important to open dialogue, but critics hear echoes of Russia-fueled talking points in her commentary. Assad fled to Moscow earlier this month after opposition forces overtook Syria in a surprise attack, ending his family\u2019s five decades of rule.",
      "While Republican senators have mostly refrained from publicly expressing concerns about Gabbard\u2019s ties abroad, nearly 100 former senior U.S. diplomats and intelligence and national security officials have urged Senate leaders to schedule closed-door hearings to allow a full review of the government\u2019s files on her.",
      "Senators have been a bit more openly skeptical of Kennedy, who has long questioned the use of some vaccines.",
      "After a report in the New York Times that one of his advisers filed a petition to revoke approval for the polio vaccine in 2022, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell issued a statement saying that \u201cefforts to undermine public confidence in proven cures are not just uninformed \u2014 they\u2019re dangerous,\u201d and that \u201canyone seeking the Senate\u2019s consent to serve in the incoming administration would do well to steer clear of even the appearance of association with such efforts.\u201d",
      "McConnell, who had polio as a child, is leaving leadership next year but will stay in the Senate. His votes will also be closely watched after years of tension with Trump as he assumes a new role free from the responsibilities of leadership.",
      "Like McConnell, many senators have taken an \u201cadvice\u201d approach, telling the nominees what they need to do to be confirmed.",
      "North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis says he\u2019s told all of the nominees he\u2019s met with so far, \u201cgo out and see what the press is saying about you, find your top 10 and disarm the conversation by having a good solution for why that isn\u2019t you.\u201d",
      "In addition, Tillis said, \u201cyou\u2019ve got to have a good showing in committee.\""

      "The U.S. Census Bureau currently is getting public feedback about how it should tally responses from people into new race and ethnicity groups",
      "As the U.S. Census Bureau gets public feedback about how it should tally people into new race and ethnicity groups, the agency has released new research reflecting how U.S. residents from different backgrounds regard their racial and ethnic identities.",
      "Earlier this year, the U.S. government changed how it categorizes people by race and ethnicity to more accurately count residents who identify as Hispanic and of Middle Eastern and North African heritage. Before this year, the categories hadn't been changed in 27 years.",
      "Under the revisions, questions about race and ethnicity that previously were asked separately on forms will be combined into a single question. That will give respondents the option to pick multiple categories at the same time, such as \u201cBlack,\u201d \u201cAmerican Indian\u201d and \u201cHispanic.\u201d Research has shown that large numbers of Hispanic people aren\u2019t sure how to answer the race question when that question is asked separately because they understand race and ethnicity to be similar and they often pick \u201csome other race\u201d or do not answer the question.",
      "A Middle Eastern and North African category also was added to the choices available for questions about race and ethnicity. People descended from places such as Lebanon, Iran, Egypt and Syria had been encouraged to identify as white, but now will have the option of identifying themselves in the new group.",
      "Results from the 2020 census, which asked respondents to write in their backgrounds on the form, suggest that more than 3.1 million U.S. residents identify as Middle Eastern and North African, otherwise known as MENA.",
      "New research released this month by the Census Bureau showed that more than 2.4 million people, or around 80%, who wrote that their background was MENA did so under the white category in the question about their race on the 2020 census questionnaire.",
      "Almost 500,000 people, or more than 16%, who wrote that they were MENA identified themselves as \u201csome other race,\u201d and almost 139,000 MENA people, or 4.5%, identified as Asian. Almost 50,000 MENA write-ins, or 1.6%, did so under the Black race category.",
      "Among MENA subgroups, people of Lebanese and Syrian backgrounds had the highest percentages of people identifying their race as white, and people who identified as North African, Berber and Moroccan had the highest rates of marking their race as Black. People with Omani, Emirati and Saudi backgrounds identified at the highest rates as Asian, the report said.",
      "In a separate report also released this month, the Census Bureau said there was a noticeable variation regarding racial identity among different U.S. Hispanic groups in the 2020 census.",
      "\u201cSome other race\u201d and American Indian and Alaska Native responses were most common among people from Central America. White and \u201csome other race\u201d responses were most prevalent among residents from South America. Black alone responses and \u201cBlack and some other race\u201d answers were most common among people from the Caribbean, the report said.",
      "There also was variation by region and state.",
      "The Northeast and West \u2014 particularly California, Maryland and New York \u2014 had the highest share of Hispanic respondents reporting that they were \u201csome other race\u201d alone. Identifying as white alone or \u201cwhite and some other race\u201d was most common among Hispanic respondents in the South. The Northeast had the highest share of Hispanic residents reporting as Black alone or \u201cBlack and some other race.\" The Midwest had the largest rate of Hispanic residents identifying as American Indian and Alaska Native, particularly in South Dakota, the report said.",
      "The new race and ethnicity categories will be used by the Census Bureau starting in the 2027 American Community Survey \u2014 the most comprehensive survey of U.S. life \u2014 and the 2030 census, which determines how many congressional seats and Electoral College votes each state gets.",
      "The Census Bureau is seeking feedback from the public through mid-February. The statistical agency wants to hear from groups who feel that they are misclassified or if any groups should be added to the list of codes used to tally people by race and ethnicity.",

      "Michael Miske, 50, died of \u201ctoxicity of fentanyl and para-fluorofentanyl,\u201d the medical examiner\u2019s office said in a statement. The death appears to have been accidental but the case is still under investigation, it added, and an autopsy report will likely take at least another 30 days.",
      "It's not clear how Miske got ahold of fentanyl or para-fluorofentanyl while at the Honolulu Federal Detention Center. Para-fluorofentanyl is a synthetic opioid that appears in illicit drugs and is more potent than fentanyl.",

      "Miske was found unresponsive at the lockup on Dec. 1. Efforts by staff and emergency medical responders failed to save him, the agency said.",
      "He was convicted in July on 13 charges including racketeering conspiracy, murder in the aid of racketeering, and kidnapping resulting in death. He was accused of orchestrating crimes that included the kidnapping of a 72-year-old accountant who owed a debt, the release of a toxic chemical into a rival\u2019s nightclubs and the killing of his late son\u2019s best friend.",
      "The conviction entitled the government to take control of up to $28 million in Miske\u2019s assets, including boats, houses and artwork.",

      "Three Oregon lawmakers say they plan to introduce a bill that would bar utilities from raising rates if they have unresolved wildfire lawsuits for three or more years",
      "PORTLAND, Ore. -- Three Oregon lawmakers say they plan to introduce a bill that would bar utilities from raising rates if they have unresolved wildfire lawsuits for three or more years, describing it as an effort to hold PacifiCorp accountable as the utility faces a series of lawsuits stemming from the deadly 2020 wildfires that ravaged the state.",
      "Republican state Reps. Jami Cate, Virgle Osborne and Ed Diehl announced their proposal in a statement Monday, on the heels of an approved rate increase for PacifiCorp customers and a federal lawsuit against the electric power company.",
      "The federal government sued PacifiCorp last week over the Archie Creek Fire, which ignited in Oregon's Douglas County in September 2020 and burned more than 200 square miles (520 square kilometers), about half of which was federal land. The complaint accuses the company of negligence for failing to maintain its power lines to prevent wildfires. In its filing, the government says it brought the suit to recover \u201csubstantial costs and damages.\"",
      "A PacifiCorp spokesperson said in an emailed statement Monday that the company was working with the U.S. government to resolve the claims.",
      "\u201cIt is unfortunate the U.S. government decided to file a lawsuit in federal district court, however PacifiCorp will continue to work with the U.S. government to find reasonable resolution of this matter,\u201d the statement said.",
      "The federal lawsuit was filed on the same day the Oregon Public Utility Commission approved a 9.8% rate increase for PacifiCorp's residential customers next year. In its rate case filings, the company said its request to increase rates was partly due to higher costs stemming from wildfire risk and activity.",
      "When the new rate takes effect in January, PacifiCorp rates will have increased nearly 50% since 2021, according to the Oregon Citizens' Utility Board, which advocates on behalf of utility customers.",
      "The three lawmakers said they will introduce their bill in the upcoming legislative session, which starts in January.",
      "\u201cThe federal government is doing the right thing by filing this lawsuit, and we stand firmly behind it,\u201d Osborne, who is set to be the future bill's co-chief sponsor, said in a statement. \u201cPacifiCorp needs to pay up and take responsibility for the destruction they\u2019ve caused, and putting a stop to rate hikes is the best way to achieve it.\u201d",
      "PacifiCorp is poised to be on the hook for billions in damages in the series of lawsuits over Oregon's 2020 fires.",
      "The company has already reached two settlement agreements over the Archie Creek Fire, including one for $299 million with 463 plaintiffs impacted by the blaze and another for $250 million with 10 companies with commercial timber interests, according to its website.",
      "In other litigation, an Oregon jury in June 2023 found it liable for negligently failing to cut power to its 600,000 customers despite warnings from top fire officials and determined it should have to pay punitive and other damages \u2014 a decision that applied to a class including the owners of up to 2,500 properties. Since then, other Oregon juries have ordered the company to pay tens of millions to other wildfire victims.",
      "The wildfires that erupted across Oregon over Labor Day weekend in 2020 were among the worst natural disasters in state history, killing nine people and destroying thousands of homes."

    "published": "Fri, 27 Dec 2024 00:11:08 GMT",
    "summary": "New users? New algorithms? Or something else going on behind the scenes? The story behind the new changes on the social media site",
    "story": [
      "Billionaire Elon Musk has hailed Twitter as a bastion for freedom of expression ever since he acquired the social media site two years ago. But over the course of 2024, X, as it is now called, has evolved from what felt like a communal town square into a polarised hub where views and posts seem even more controversial.",
      "\u200b\u200bCertain profiles that have shared misleading takes on politics and the news, some of which have been accused of triggering hate, have recently shot to prominence.",
      "All of this matters because X might not have as many users as some other major social media sites, but it does seem to have a significant impact on political discussions. Not only is it a place where certain high-profile politicians, governments and police forces share statements and views - but now its owner Mr Musk has directly aligned himself with Donald Trump, a relationship that could redefine how the bosses of other social media giants deal with the next US President.",
      "So, what's behind this new wave of change? Has there been a shift in the demographic of people using X over the last year - or could it be the result of deliberate decisions made by those in charge?",
      "Rise of the Twitter 'media'",
      "Two months ago, Inevitable West didn't exist on X. Now the profile, which calls itself a \"Defender of Western values and culture\", has amassed 131,600 followers (a number that is rapidly growing). It is racking up around 30 million views each day collectively among all of its posts, according to its creator. Mr Musk has even responded to Inevitable West's posts on X.",
      "Their recent posts, which often feature news alert-style captions, include a faked video showing Trump telling the British Prime Minister he is going to \"invade your country and make Britain Great Again\".",
      "There have also been several posts in support of far-right activist Tommy Robinson, as well as some debunked claims about the farmer's protests in the UK and a knife attack in Southport, in which three children were killed during a Taylor Swift-themed dance workshop.",
      "\u200b\u200bInevitable West denies accusations of pushing disinformation and inciting abuse or violence. \"The purpose of my X account is to be the voice for the silent majority of the Western world,\" its creator told me. They refused to share their identity with me when we corresponded, but claim to be \"Gen Z\" and \"not Russian\".",
      "\"Uncensored information and opinions will inevitably lead [to] the US and entire West and Europe moving further right, [which is] proven by Donald Trump getting elected and surges in Europe's far right,\" they argued. \"Globally, it would mean corrupt politicians and leaders would get found out.\"",
      "They appear to see the rise of their account as the \"death\" of what they would call the \"MSM\" or Mainstream Media. That's perhaps no surprise given that, following the US Election, Mr Musk himself told X users: \"You are the Media Now\".",
      "From blue ticks to likes: Changes at X",
      "When Mr Musk first acquired Twitter, he emphasised the need to house all political opinions and push back against censorship by social media companies and governments.",
      "Changes - including mass layoffs and alterations to moderation policies on issues like political misinformation - started immediately.",
      "There have also been various alterations to the nature of feeds including the creation of two separate sections: \"Following\", which features accounts you follow, and \"For You\", which is algorithmically curated, as on TikTok.",
      "Over the course of 2024, however, there have been another wave of alterations that appear to have transformed it further. The block function has been changed, meaning that if you block an account you won't be protected from that profile viewing what you post. Likes, meanwhile, have been made private.",
      "The site still features crowd-sourced community notes used to factcheck or rebuff what posts say - and users are able to pay for blue ticks, which were previously given free of charge as a sign authenticating that the person was who they said they were.",
      "What to X-pect from Elon Musk in 2025",
      "What to X-pect from Elon Musk in 2025",
      "Now, though, it is necessary to pay to subscribe to X Premium to receive a checkmark. (There are three tiers of subscription - in the UK, the Premium Tier currently costs around \u00a310 a month).",
      "Premium profiles are entitled to more privileges and prominence - and can make money from the engagement they get from other checkmarked profiles. From October, X changed its rules so that instead of basing revenue for individual accounts around ads, it now takes into account likes, shares and comments from other Premium accounts.",
      "Of course other social media sites allow users to make money from posts and let them share sponsored content - this is not uncommon - but most major sites have rules that allow them to de-monetise or suspend profiles that post misinformation.",
      "X does not have rules to de-monetise accounts over these kinds of posts, although it does allow users to add community notes to misleading or false tweets. And it does not allow \"misleading media\" like manipulated or synthetic videos that \"may result in widespread confusion on public issues, impact public safety or cause serious harm\".",
      "According to Inevitable West, X can now become a job. They told me when they were posting around seven times a day they could accrue a minimum of \"$2,500 a month\".",
      "They say they know of another account making \"$25,000\" each month - that account allegedly has 500,000 followers and posts \"roughly 30\" times a day.",
      "Has the algorithm changed?",
      "Change can sometimes come about when a website alters the algorithms (or recommendation systems) in some way, for example in order to boost and benefit certain posts. What\u2019s unclear is whether or not that may be the case here?",
      "Certainly, I've observed a difference in the variety of posts recommended on the \"For You\" feed compared with that a year ago.",
      "This is something I analysed through an \"Undercover Voter project\", in which I created and ran social media accounts belonging to more than 20 fictional characters, based in the US and UK, which reflect views from across the political spectrum.",
      "These characters have profiles on the main sites including X, allowing me to interrogate what different accounts were recommended on social media. The accounts are private and do not message real people or have friends.",
      "Regardless of the different political views their accounts express, I observed that in the last six months of this year their feeds have become dominated by divisive posts, and tend to feature more in support of Trump or in opposition to politicians and people across the world who are not seen to be aligned with the US president elect.",
      "However, all of this seems to be the consequence of the environment and the various changes to the wider site, rather than solely a simple tweak to the algorithm.",
      "Andrew Kaung, who was previously an analyst on user safety at TikTok and has also worked at Meta, has spent years observing how these recommendation systems can be updated and changed. \"What we've seen on X is not just about algorithms changing, it is also informed by the lack of safety mechanisms in the name of free speech,\" he says.",
      "Nina Jankowicz is former Executive Director on the Disinformation Governance Board of the United States, which was set up in 2022 to advise the Department of Homeland Security on issues including Russian disinformation and later disbanded after public backlash over concerns including around freedom of expression and transparency. She argues that X's algorithms now \"privilege divisive and misleading rhetoric\" and suggests that users who post less controversial content have found a reduction in the views.",
      "\"The consequence is that the platform that touts itself as a public square is an extraordinarily artificial environment, a true black mirror of the most worrying parts of human nature.\"",
      "The unintended influencers",
      "I messaged dozens of other large accounts, who describe the growing influence they're able to have on the site, often unexpectedly.",
      "\"I never really intended to become an influencer,\" admits one profile called Andi, who says he's based in New York. \"But I figure since I have this platform I should try to use it to advance my own causes.\"",
      "He describes how he shared a meme of squirrel - after learning about a squirrel that was euthanised over concerns it could have rabies - which now has 45 million views. Andi compares his reach to that of popular podcaster Joe Rogan, who has 14.5 million followers on X.",
      "\"But I am no Joe Rogan, so it's really special that something I post can get almost as much viewership.\"",
      "Andi and other X accounts I've corresponded with believe that the changes to X are a good thing, as they now have a reach they could have never anticipated.",
      "Allegations of moderation bias",
      "\u200b\u200bEarlier this month, an attack at a German market, which killed five people and injured more than 200, was widely debated on X. Much of the discussion centred around the suspect, a German resident originally from Saudi Arabia. German prosecutors have said the investigation is ongoing, but suggested one potential motive for the attack \"could have been disgruntlement with the way Saudi Arabian refugees are treated in Germany\".",
      "Inevitable West was among those who commented: \"Raid the mosques. Ban the Quran. Carry out mass deportations. Our patience has officially expired.\"",
      "\u200b\u200bThe account has been accused of inflaming hate with posts about issues including immigration and religion. Other users said this could incite violence. But the profile responded by saying that they were \"actually inciting safety\".",
      "When questioned on this, Inevitable West told me that they'd say the same about other religions. Separately, they also said they would never delete their own posts - even when they turn out to be untrue.",
      "Meanwhile, their content is being seen by feeds around the world.",
      "Allegations of bias in moderation methods have long been levelled at Twitter, both before and since Mr Musk acquired the company, alongside questions about whether the site previously limited freedom of expression.",
      "I spoke to Twitter insiders about this for a Panorama investigation which aired in 2023, and they told me that, in their view, the company was going to struggle to protect users from trolling, state-coordinated disinformation and child sexual exploitation, putting this down to, among other things, mass layoffs.",
      "At the time, X did not respond to the points raised. Afterwards, Mr Musk tweeted a BBC article about the Panorama episode with the caption: \"Sorry for turning Twitter from nurturing paradise into a place that has\u2026 trolls\". He also declared, \"trolls are kinda fun\".",
      "Separately, Mr Musk had said he had \"no choice\" but to reduce the company's workforce because of financial losses.",
      "Lisa Jennings Young, former head of content design at X who worked there until 2022, says: \"I feel like we're all living through a vast social experiment [on humanity].\"",
      "It doesn't have a specified goal, she says. Instead, in her view, it is \"not a controlled social science experiment [but one] we're all a part of\". No one really knows what the final result could be, she argues.",
      "Some X users tell me that they have recently decided to migrate to other social media platforms, including Bluesky, which started in 2019 as an experimental \"de-centralised\" social media site created by former Twitter boss Jack Dorsey. It now has more than 20 million users.",
      "It is difficult to determine exactly how many real users have chosen to leave X - or indeed if it has grown.",
      "Elon Musk and X did not respond to the points raised in this article, nor to requests for an interview.",
      "X says that its priority is to protect and defend the user's voice and it has guidelines about hate, which say that users \"may not target others with abuse or harassment or encourage other people to do so\".",
      "An X spokesperson previously told the BBC: \"X has in place a range of policies and features to protect the conversation surrounding elections. We will label content that violates our synthetic and manipulated media policy, and remove accounts engaged in platform manipulation or other serious violations of our rules.\"",
      "The site also told the European Commission in November: \"[X] strives to be the town square of the internet by promoting and protecting freedom of expression.\"",
      "Social media meets political influence",
      "Since the 2024 US presidential election, X has cemented its place as the home of political updates about the new Trump administration.",
      "Mr Musk endorsed Trump as a candidate as far back as July. He has now been offered a government position, leading a new advisory team called the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge).",
      "Sam Freeman, a former Meta employee who now works as an expert in Trust and Safety for a company called Cinder, believes that this will have a broader effect on other social media bosses too. He predicts them \"needing to have a more personal relationship with the incoming administration\", particularly if they feel increasing pressure over regulation and online safety.",
      "Mark Zuckerberg, who founded Facebook (now Meta) and has since acquired Instagram, recently had dinner with Trump at his home in Mar-a-Lago.",
      "The President-elect had taken aim at Mr Zuckerberg on previously occasions, accusing his website and others of bias. \"Facebook, Google and Twitter, not to mention the Corrupt Media, are sooo on the side of the Radical Left Democrats,\" Trump once wrote.",
      "Could the dinner indicate a softening of relations? Certainly it suggests that Mr Zuckerberg considers that being at least somewhat in close proximity to Trump could be in his interest.",
      "So, it seems, does TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew, who was also reported to have met Trump at Mar-a-Lago as the social media company fights plans by US authorities to ban the app.",
      "The US government claims TikTok's parent company ByteDance has links to the Chinese state. Both TikTok and ByteDance deny this. The Supreme Court is due to hear legal arguments from TikTok in January.",
      "In the the UK, the Online Safety Act will soon be enforced, under which companies will have to make commitments to the regulator Ofcom about how they will tackle illegal content and posts that are harmful to children. In Australia, politicians have gone a step further and approved plans to ban children under 16 from using social media.",
      "Ultimately though - given how many social media giants are based in the US - it is the approach of the American government and president that could have the greatest impact.",
      "The France rape trial throws up a difficult question about porn fantasies - and male desire",
      "What now for Syria\u2019s \u00a34.5bn illegal drug empire",
      "Syria's rebel leaders say they've broken with their jihadist past - can they be trusted?",
      "\"I see Trump's feelings towards a platform dictating the way his administration views them,\" argues Mr Freeman.",
      "The question that remains is what Trump's views on this really are - and whether he will demand accountability in a different way from these sites in the future, or not at all.",
      "The ramifications, whichever way it goes, will no doubt be far-reaching.",

    "summary": "Manmohan Singh was instrumental in bringing India out of economic and nuclear isolation.",
    "story": [
      "Former Indian prime minister Manmohan Singh has died at the age of 92.",
      "Singh was one of India's longest-serving prime ministers and he was considered the architect of key liberalising economic reforms, as premier from 2004-2014 and before that as finance minister.",
      "He had been admitted to a hospital in the capital Delhi after his health condition deteriorated, reports say.",
      "Among those who paid tribute to Singh on Thursday were Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who wrote on social media that \"India mourns the loss of one of its most distinguished leaders\".",
      "Modi said that Singh's \"wisdom and humility were always visible\" during their interactions and that he had \"made extensive efforts to improve people's lives\" during his time as prime minister.",
      "Priyanka Gandhi, the daughter of former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi and a Congress party member, said that Singh was \"genuinely egalitarian, wise, strong-willed and courageous until the end\".",
      "Her brother Rahul, who leads Congress, said he had \"lost a mentor and guide\".",
      "Singh was the first Indian leader since Jawaharlal Nehru to be re-elected after serving a full first term, and the first Sikh to hold the country's top post. He made a public apology in parliament for the 1984 riots in which some 3,000 Sikhs were killed.",
      "But his second term in office was marred by a string of corruption allegations that dogged his administration. The scandals, many say, were partially responsible for his Congress party's crushing defeat in the 2014 general election.",
      "Singh was born on 26 September 1932, in a desolate village in the Punjab province of undivided India, which lacked both water and electricity.",
      "After attending Panjab University he took a master's degree at the University of Cambridge and then a DPhil at Oxford.",
      "While studying at Cambridge, the lack of funds bothered Singh, his daughter, Daman Singh, wrote in a book on her parents.",
      "\"His tuition and living expenses came to about \u00a3600 a year. The Panjab University scholarship gave him about \u00a3160. For the rest he had to depend on his father. Manmohan was careful to live very stingily. Subsidised meals in the dining hall were relatively cheap at two shillings sixpence.\"",
      "Daman Singh remembered her father as \"completely helpless about the house and could neither boil an egg, nor switch on the television\".",
      "Consensus builder",
      "Singh rose to political prominence as India's finance minister in 1991, taking over as the country was plunging into bankruptcy.",
      "His unexpected appointment capped a long and illustrious career as an academic and civil servant - he served as an economic adviser to the government, and became the governor of India's central bank.",
      "In his maiden speech as finance minister he famously quoted Victor Hugo, saying that \"no power on Earth can stop an idea whose time has come\".",
      "That served as a launchpad for an ambitious and unprecedented economic reform programme: he cut taxes, devalued the rupee, privatised state-run companies and encouraged foreign investment.",
      "The economy revived, industry picked up, inflation was checked and growth rates remained consistently high in the 1990s.",
      "'Accidental PM'",
      "Manmohan Singh was a man acutely aware of his lack of a political base. \"It is nice to be a statesman, but in order to be a statesman in a democracy you first have to win elections,\" he once said.",
      "When he tried to win election to India's lower house in 1999, he was defeated. He sat instead in the upper house, chosen by his own Congress party.",
      "The same happened in 2004, when Singh was first appointed prime minister after Congress president Sonia Gandhi turned down the post - apparently to protect the party from damaging attacks over her Italian origins. Critics however alleged that Sonia Gandhi was the real source of power while he was prime minister, and that he was never truly in charge.",
      "The biggest triumph during his first five-year term was to bring India out of nuclear isolation by signing a landmark deal securing access to American nuclear technology.",
      "But the deal came at a price - the government's Communist allies withdrew support after protesting against it, and Congress had to make up lost numbers by enlisting the support of another party amid charges of vote-buying.",
      "A consensus builder, Singh presided over a coalition of sometimes difficult, assertive and potentially unruly regional coalition allies and supporters.",
      "Although he earned respect for his integrity and intelligence, he also had a reputation for being soft and indecisive. Some critics claimed that the pace of reform slowed and he failed to achieve the same momentum he had while finance minister.",
      "When Singh guided Congress to a second, decisive election victory in 2009, he vowed that the party would \"rise to the occasion\".",
      "But the gloss soon began to wear off and his second term was in the news mostly for all the wrong reasons: several scandals involving his cabinet ministers which allegedly cost the country billions of dollars, a parliament stalled by the opposition, and a huge policy paralysis that resulted in a serious economic downturn.",
      "LK Advani, a senior leader in the rival BJP party, called Singh India's \"weakest prime minister\".",
      "Manmohan Singh defended his record, saying his government had worked with \"utmost commitment and dedication for the country and the welfare of its people\".",
      "Pragmatic foreign policy",
      "Singh adopted the pragmatic foreign policies pursued by his two predecessors.",
      "He continued the peace process with Pakistan - though this process was hampered by attacks blamed on Pakistani militants, culminating in the Mumbai gun and bomb attack of November 2008.",
      "He tried to end the border dispute with China, brokering a deal to reopen the Nathu La pass into Tibet which had been closed for more than 40 years.",
      "Singh increased financial support for Afghanistan and became the first Indian leader to visit the country for nearly 30 years.",
      "He also angered many opposition politicians by appearing to end relations with India's old ally, Iran.",
      "A low-profile leader",
      "A studious former academic and bureaucrat, he was known for being self-effacing and always kept a low profile. His social media account was noted mostly for dull entries and had a limited number of followers.",
      "A man of few words, his calm demeanour nevertheless won him many admirers.",
      "Responding to questions on a coal scandal involving the illegal allocation of licences worth billions of dollars, he defended his silence on the issue by saying it was \"better than thousands of answers\".",
      "In 2015 he was summoned to appear in court to answer allegations of criminal conspiracy, breach of trust and corruption related offences. An upset Singh told reporters that he was \"open for legal scrutiny\" and that the \"truth will prevail\".",
      "After his time as premier, Singh remained deeply engaged with the issues of the day as a senior leader of the main opposition Congress party despite his advancing age.",
      "In August 2020, he told the BBC in a rare interview that India needed to take three steps \"immediately\" to stem the economic damage of the coronavirus pandemic, which had sent the country's economy into a recession.",
      "The government needed to provide direct cash assistance to people, make capital available for businesses, and fix the financial sector, he said.",
      "History will remember Singh for bringing India out of economic and nuclear isolation, although some historians may suggest he should have retired earlier.",
      "\"I honestly believe that history will be kinder to me than the contemporary media, or for that matter, the opposition parties in parliament,\" he told an interviewer in 2014.",
      "Singh is survived by his wife and three daughters."

      "Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander is now seeking views from automotive and charging experts to \"restore clarity\" on how to deliver the ban.",
      "Car industry leaders have warned drivers were not switching to electric vehicles at the rate needed to meet the deadline due to the cost of buying the cars privately and charging point infrastructure.",
      "Last month, Ford said the UK government's mandate to produce and sell more electric vehicles (EVs) \"just doesn't work\" without demand.",
      "Lisa Brankin, Ford UK's chair and managing director, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"The one thing that we really need is government-backed incentives to urgently boost the uptake of electric vehicles.\"",
      "The Department for Transport said the consultation would \"restore clarity for vehicle manufacturers and the charging industry\" so they \"have the confidence to invest in the UK in the long term and drive growth in the UK automotive industry\".",
      "'The price point is crazy'",
      "But some say they are not yet sold on switching to EVs. Kaylan Evans from London said she wouldn't buy an electric car because \"the price point is crazy\".",
      "\"I don't like the element of relying on charging points and stations when the infrastructure isn't that set up at the moment,\" she added.",
      "She said she and her husband are sticking to their petrol car for now.",

      "She wants to move away from her diesel car because of \"the rising cost of fuel and the environmental issues\".",
      "Hybrid sales",
      "The government said the consultation would be part of a \"wider push\" to make it easier and cheaper to charge electric cars.",
      "There are now more than 72,000 public charging points in the UK, with another 100,000 planned by local authorities across England, according to the government.",
      "The lack of sufficient charging infrastructure, particularly in rural areas and homes without private parking spaces poses an issue as well - one that analysts will take several years to resolve.",
      "The cost of EVs remains a barrier to people switching as even the most affordable models are still pricier than their petrol or diesel counterparts.",
      "The government said EVs made up one in four cars sold in the UK. It said industry data put 1 in 3 used electric cars at under \u00a320,000.",
      "Edmund King, president of the AA, said drivers have been \"hesitant about the transition but not hostile\" but the consultation would bring more clarity and certainty.",
      "Mike Hawes, chief executive of the SMMT, said it was \"imperative we get an urgent resolution\" to adapt the mandate to help car makers achieve it along with \"bold incentives\" to get drivers to buy electric vehicles.",
      "The consultation proposes updates to the Zero Emission Vehicle (Zev) mandate, which sets out the percentage of new zero emission cars and vans that manufacturers will be required to sell each year up to 2030.",
      "In 2024, EVs must make up 22% of a carmaker's car sales, and 10% of van sales. This target is set to rise. Firms failing to meet these targets face a \u00a315,000 fine per sale.",
      "Companies can avoid fines by buying \"credits\" from firms that have exceeded their quotas for electric car sales. They can also \"borrow\" allowances from future years.",
      "The Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU) think tank said target required to be achieved by each manufacturer was due to be reached as an average across the industry because these credits would be taken into account.",
      "Colin Walker, transport lead at the ECIU added: \"Certain manufacturers are proving themselves not just equal but better to the task they've been set. The likes of BMW, Mercedes, Hyundai, for example. They are all selling more EV's than they need to. It's proof it can be done and that more ambitious targets in the years ahead can be hit.\"",

      "What does net zero mean?",
      "Where does the UK get its energy from?",
      "The government's eight-week consultation aims to gather views on which cars can be sold alongside zero emission vehicles from 2030, including full hybrids and plug-in hybrids, as well as the strategy for vans and the policy for small volume manufacturers.",
      "More than two-thirds of car manufacturers in the UK, including Stellantis, have committed to transitioning fully to electric cars by 2030.",
      "However, firms have also announced thousands of job cuts, partly because of EV targets.",
      "UK car production experienced a sharp decline in October 2024, with overall output dropping by over 15% compared to the previous year. Automotive industry body the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) attributed this fall to weak demand and a significant decrease in exports.",
      "Electric and hybrid vehicle production saw an even steeper decline, falling by one-third due to flagging European demand and factory retooling for new models.",
      "\"Today's measures will help us capitalise on the clean energy transition to support thousands of jobs, make the UK a clean energy superpower, and rebuild Britain,\" Alexander said.",
      "Dan Caesar, chief executive of Electric Vehicles UK said this was an opportunity to position the UK as \"one of the most attractive battery EV markets on the global stage.\" He said there was a growing demand for used and new batteries, and this roadmap would give manufacturers and users more clarity."

      "But, as he looks around him and remembers the destruction caused by the flash floods which struck the eastern Spanish region of Valencia on 29 October, tears well up in Andreu's eyes.",
      "\"The water came in and water and mud covered everything,\" he says. \"And when it had gone, it left a terrible sight. All the stock we had was ruined, the machinery was useless.\"",
      "He adds: \"All my life working. And for what?\"",
      "The floodwater left a six-feet-high (1.8m) mark on the wall, and although the water has now gone, mud still clings to the machines. Miraculously, the photo of his grandfather was not washed away.",
      "But, now in his sixties, and still waiting to see how much insurance money he might receive, Andreu is too disheartened to start over.",
      "The flash flood killed more than 220 people in the Valencia region, many of them caught in their cars, or on the ground floors of buildings when the tsunami-like waters hit. But as well as claiming lives, the disaster also devastated livelihoods. Valencia's chamber of commerce estimated that 48,000 companies have been affected.",
      "The towns and industrial belt surrounding the Mediterranean city of Valencia, which itself avoided the impact of the floods, were the worst hit. In total, the province of Valencia represents 5% of Spain's GDP, according to CaixaBank Research, which estimates that the disaster could reduce national economic output by one to two percentage points in the fourth quarter of 2024.",
      "Much of the damage has been caused on industrial estates. Diego Rom\u00e1, executive president of the federation of industrial estates in the Valencia region (Feteval), says that \"thousands and thousands of jobs are in the air\" and that a total of 58 industrial estates were affected by the flood water.",
      "\"Most companies are working hard to resume production, but unfortunately there are maybe 10 to 20% of companies which are going to close,\" he said.",
      "The legacy of 29 October is still visible on the industrial estates. Abandoned cars sit on the side of the road covered in mud, debris has been pushed up against walls and the shutters of many businesses remain closed.",
      "Electro Fern\u00e1ndez, an electricity installation company, is one of the few which has reopened, having lost \u20ac40,000 ($42,000; \u00a333,000) worth of tools in the floods.",
      "\"We were immediately affected 100% because we lost our tools and vehicles,\" said Patricia Mu\u00f1oz, who co-owns the company with her husband. She says that they are currently working at 10% of their capacity.",
      "\"We've cleaned the place, we've got all our employees here, and we've taken action to get going again,\" she says. \"But a lot of the companies on this industrial estate, and on others are nowhere near that, they are still cleaning up.",
      "\"This has been an absolute disaster. You only realise the scale of it when you see it for yourself.\"",
      "Not far away is a car storage area, where hundreds of the 120,000 or so vehicles damaged or destroyed by the flooding have been removed from roads and piled one on top of the other. As part of a \u20ac17bn relief plan announced by the government in the first month after the tragedy, it promised to provide up to 10,000 euros to car owners to replace their vehicles.",

      "\"I think this time the same thing is going to happen,\" he says.",
      "Valencians' faith in their authorities has already been severely shaken by the immediate response to the disaster. Protesters have been demanding the resignation of regional president Carlos Maz\u00f3n, who, it emerged, was absent from his office for several hours on the day the floods struck because he was having lunch with a journalist. Many believe his administration's delay in issuing an alert to the phones of people in the region cost lives.",
      "Maz\u00f3n has rejected such claims. \"We did the best we could with the information available,\" he says.",
      "Others criticise the central government for failing to deploy the military and other resources more forcefully. S\u00e1nchez, however, has insisted that his administration \"fulfilled its duties and did so from the very beginning\" of the crisis.",
      "Meanwhile, help has been provided by the private sector. Alcem-se, a charity platform set up by local supermarket entrepreneur Juan Roig, says it has distributed \u20ac35m euros in non-refundable aid to 4,600 businesses.",
      "However, for many, including Mr Milla, the relief may not be enough. He owned a local TV channel, an estate agency and a bar and he has only managed to reopen the latter \u2013 partially \u2013 in the wake of the October floods.",
      "He lists several nearby businesses - including a petrol station, a gym, a beautician and an optician \u2013 which he says will not reopen.",
      "But it is not just urban areas which were hit on 29 October. The Valencia region is part of an agricultural heartland in south-eastern Spain, which exports large quantities of fruit and vegetables to the rest of Europe.",
      "Twenty-five miles (40km) south of Valencia city, Jos\u00e9 Espa\u00f1a visits his orange trees. Beneath them, oranges which were washed off their branches by the floodwater lie rotting on the ground.",

      "\"Farmers have had a few years now in which we've been abandoned, and the floods might end up causing a few more farmers than usual to leave the industry,\" he says. \"In order to get things back to how they were before the flooding, it's going to take two or three years.\"",

      "Probably more than you might think, given she's behind the popular TV series which tells a myriad of birth stories.",
      "Thomas's Bafta-winning BBC drama explores the lives of the midwives and nuns who live together in a convent, Nonnatus House, and the families they care for in post-war east London.",
      "\"Call the Midwife will always be a drama for me about women and the working classes,\" she tells the BBC.",
      "The British writer's superpower is arguably her ability to deftly mix stories of care and warmth with the brutal realities of poverty, racism, backstreet abortions, child loss and domestic abuse, to name but a few.",
      "The BBC One show - consistently a high performer in TV ratings - is now approaching its 14th series since 2012, which is no mean feat in an increasingly competitive TV landscape.",
      "Thomas manages to cram in tough storylines into a cosy 8pm, Sunday night slot, often shared with shows such as Antiques Roadshow.",
      "There have only been two instances where she's been asked to change something in the show, which was initially set in 1957 and is about to hit the 1970s.",
      "\"One was for the haemorrhage machine,\" she recalls, describing a contraption which recreates post-birth blood loss.",
      "\"I think it's a unique piece of equipment to us.",
      "\"We were told the blood was too noisy on the lino [on the floor] - so that was literally about a sound effect.\"",
      "The other was \"a tussle\" over the use of the word bastard, a dated and offensive way of describing a child born to unmarried parents.",
      "Thomas says they had to do a bit of \"creative cutting\" to remove it.",
      "Amazingly, though, despite running pre-watershed, she hasn't had a single plotline censored or knocked back by the BBC.",
      "\"We've never had to compromise our style of storytelling, because it's set in Nonnatus House, \" she says, where the nuns and midwives live and share words of wisdom, along with tea and cake.",
      "\"We take emotional care of our audience, so even if we push them quite hard by showing them dark emotions or desperate circumstances, we bring them back to a place where they feel safe.\"",

      "\"People often think graphic means blood sliding down the walls, but it can mean showing somebody in the pits of despair; interestingly, that's always permissible, even before the watershed.",
      "\"But even when our stories don't end happily, there is always a note of hope somewhere.\"",
      "Thomas has also managed to write endless fresh storylines, reflecting the health and social issues of the era.",

      "This is what made her decide to write about sexually transmitted diseases in the upcoming series in January.",
      "\"In the health report for Poplar [in London's East End], there was this brilliant description of how gonorrhea was getting out of control, and the Greater London Council instigated tracing teams of middle-aged women,\" she says.",
      "\"I just thought, 'this is Miss Higgins' - I love Miss Higgins.\"",
      "Miss Higgins, played by Georgie Glen, is the prim surgery receptionist with a poignant family backstory, which revealed her hidden strengths.",

      "\"I never know which organ is coming under pressure.",
      "\"But there's this kind of 'Wow' moment, when I see things that actually happened, and then that feeds into the fictional process of developing the drama.\"",
      "The show is also a family affair for Thomas, given her husband Stephen McGann plays a central character, GP Dr Patrick Turner.",
      "His recognisable face is often the reason the couple are approached in the street by fans, who don't always realise who Thomas is.",
      "\"He's always quick to say: \"'Oh, this is the lady who writes it',\" she says, \"and then they kind of go into a meltdown! I think some people don't realise we're married in real life.\"",

      "She laughs as she recalls seeing the dubbed version of McGann on Italian TV while the couple were away on holiday there.",
      "\"They gave him a really deep, sexy laugh, out of all proportion to what he was saying - it was a lovely 'har har har'.\"",
      "Thomas, whose other writing work includes 2007 BBC period drama Cranford and 2017 mini-series Little Women, says despite how much of her life is entwined with the show, she still manages to keep home and work separate.",
      "She rarely goes on set during filming, and explains that McGann never sees the scripts before they're issued to the other actors.",
      "\"That was a decision I made to protect his integrity as an actor at an early stage,\" she says. \"But I think it's protected my writing space as well.\"",

      "\"I've lived quite a long life now. I'm 62 and I grew up with quite a severely disabled brother, and that opened me to the goodness of people,\" she says.",
      "\"To the people who just met him as he was, accepted him as he was and loved him for what he was - that, at a very early, informative age, was my introduction to humanity,\" she says.",

      "Here's a light-hearted look at some of 2024's biggest flops and fails.",
      "1. Katy Perry's comeback",
      "It was supposed to be a triumphant return, but critics and fans complained Katy Perry's latest album 143 sounded dated and showed little artistic growth.",
      "The music video for Woman's World, which saw Perry join a group of dancers wearing tiny outfits on a construction site, was criticised for being regressive, although Perry later said it was supposed to be satirical.",
      "Matters were only made worse when the singer attracted the attention of the Spanish government for shooting the video for follow-up single Lifetimes in ecologically-sensitive sand dunes in the Balearic Islands.",
      "But many fans defended the album, which wasn't as bad as some reviews made out, and Perry's accompanying tour has been a huge success.",
      "2. Joker bombing at the box office",
      "Making a sequel to 2019's Joker, which grossed more than $1bn (\u00a3790m), was something Hollywood found simply irresistible.",
      "Unfortunately, the resulting film, Joker: Folie \u00e0 Deux, was something audiences found entirely resistible.",
      "Making the film a musical was a bold swing, but the tonal handbrake turn alienated the fans and critics who adored the Oscar-winning original.",
      "Folie \u00e0 Deux managed to scrape over the $200m (\u00a3158m) mark, but that was barely enough to cover its production budget, let alone marketing costs.",
      "It wasn't the only movie flop of the year - audiences were also unenthusiastic about Madame Web, The Fall Guy, Kraven the Hunter, Megalopolis, Borderlands, Argylle, Unstoppable and Furiosa: A Mad Max Story.",
      "3. Ticketmaster's dynamic pricing",
      "Ticketmaster attracted a storm of controversy after making use of so-called \"dynamic pricing\" for UK dates on the Oasis reunion tour, which raised the cost of a ticket by \u00a3200 due to the predictable demand.",
      "Charging fans \u00a3350 per ticket was a dubious PR move for a band famous for their working class roots, and the Gallagher brothers wisely distanced themselves from the strategy.",
      "But Ticketmaster argued prices are set by artists and promoters. Dynamic pricing was later ditched for the band's US tour dates.",
      "Meanwhile, 50,000 fans who'd paid inflated prices on secondary platforms in order to secure tickets faced having them cancelled. A total omnishambles for everyone involved.",
      "4. The ruined surprise party",
      "When BBC weather presenter Kawser Quamer was asked in February about her plans for the weekend, she cheerfully explained she was attending her niece's surprise birthday party.",
      "Host Annabel Tiffin said that all sounded very lovely, but presumably the party was no longer a surprise, having just been announced on live TV. \"Oh goodness me,\" replied an alarmed Quamer, \"I've spoiled the surprise!\"",
      "The glorious mishap made its way across the Atlantic, going viral and featuring on Jimmy Kimmel Live.",
      "But Quamer handled it beautifully, and even managed to convince her niece she was talking about a different relative, keeping the surprise element intact.",
      "5. Kaos",
      "Chaos is a term which could be applied to a lot of entries in this list, but one of the biggest casualties of the year was Kaos itself.",
      "Just a month after the first series of Jeff Goldblum's Greek mythology drama was released, Netflix announced it would not return for a second.",
      "Streamers can tell quickly if something is a hit or not by measuring viewing figures and completion rates. Their data even gives them the prospective ratings of the following months based on the first.",
      "But although fans campaigned for its return, ultimately Kaos was Kancelled.",
      "6. The Co-op Live Arena",
      "Manchester's hottest new live venue finally opened this year, but only after several attempts. There was a string of cancellations due to various technical problems, including a ventilation unit falling from the ceiling.",
      "Shows by Peter Kay, Olivia Rodrigo, Take That and others were cancelled or moved, before the venue finally opened with a successful concert from rock band Elbow.",
      "The problems did at least bring one delightful moment: A Radio 4 newsreader announcing the delay of a gig by US rapper A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie.",
      "7. Joe Biden's debate performance",
      "Flops don't come much bigger than a debate performance which was so poor, it brought down an entire presidential campaign.",
      "Joe Biden seemed distant and frail when he took part in a televised live debate in June, struggling to finish some of his sentences and keep pace with Donald Trump.",
      "Biden tried to stay in the race, but the pressure on him became too high as figures including Democrat fundraiser George Clooney publicly called for him to stand down, leading to Kamala Harris replacing him as the candidate.",
      "8. The Olympics opening ceremony",
      "A barnstorming performance from Celine Dion sadly wasn't enough to rescue this soggy croissant of an opening ceremony, which was badly hampered by rain.",
      "Organisers took the event outside of the traditional stadium setting and had performers spread out across Paris instead, which was both a security nightmare and challenging for spectators.",
      "The spread meant things felt somewhat disjointed and it was hard for the ceremony to build any momentum.",
      "Meanwhile, some viewers were upset by a scene involving drag queens which many interpreted as a reference to the Last Supper, but artistic director Thomas Jolly said was a reference to pagan gods.",
      "9. The unofficial Bridgerton ball",
      "Hot on the heels of the disastrous Willy Wonka experience was an unofficial Bridgerton ball, where fans of the Netflix series were invited to dress up and \"step into the enchanting world of the Regency era\".",
      "Unfortunately, they were greeted with disappointing food and drab decor, with one violinist and a pole dancer for entertainment. Creators blamed \"organisational challenges\" and said they \"sincerely apologised\".",
      "We anticipate the event being eviscerated in Lady Whistledown's next newsletter.",
      "10. Eurovision. The whole thing.",
      "This year's Eurovision Song Contest was, frankly, a disaster from start to finish.",
      "A row about Israel's participation prompted security concerns, put all the entrants in an awkward position and even led to the head of Eurovision being booed during the grand final.",
      "Dutch singer Joost Klein was disqualified at the last minute due a backstage incident where a woman's video camera was knocked to the ground.",

      "Host city Malmo said they would refuse to stage the event again if Sweden won, saying they wouldn't have the \"strength and stamina\".",
      "And to top it all off, the UK languished in 18th place.",
      "11. Broadcasting blunders",
      "Laura Kuenssberg withdrew from an interview with Boris Johnson in October after mistakenly sending her briefing notes to the former prime minister himself, resulting in what she called a few \"red faces\".",
      "ITV took over and Johnson later told BBC Radio 5 Live's Matt Chorley his originally scheduled interview had \"blown up on the launch pad\".",
      "Elsewhere, thousands of viewers complained to Ofcom in August when Home Secretary Yvette Cooper was interviewed on Good Morning Britain by her own husband, Ed Balls, about the violent unrest in parts of the UK.",
      "ITV's chief executive later noted it was a fluid news morning and the team had short notice that Cooper was coming on. She said the interview was impartial and fair but it wouldn't happen again.",
      "Another daytime presenter, Lorraine Kelly, became the subject of a viral X account which monitored her show attendance throughout the year (hovering just below 60%, if you're interested).",
      "Over on Strictly Come Dancing, which had already had a fairly appalling year before this series even started, fans were puzzled by some unusual on-screen encounters between singer Wynne Evans and his partner Katya Jones.",
      "Viewers spotted Jones apparently refusing to high-five Evans, and later moving his hand away from her waist.",
      "The show's welfare team checked in on them after concerns were raised, but the pair apologised for what they said was actually just a \"very silly inside joke\" between them.",
      "12. The Oppenheimer stage invasion",
      "When Oppenheimer was named best film at February's Baftas, the prize was collected by actor Cillian Murphy, director Christopher Nolan, producer Emma Thomas... and a random man standing silently in the background.",
      "The intruder was actually YouTuber Lizwani, who managed to infiltrate the event and make it all the way to the stage during the night's biggest moment.",
      "But the fact he was standing quietly and respectfully meant few viewers even noticed anything was wrong. Bafta have since tightened security.",
      "A month later, there was more awkwardness when Oppenheimer was named best picture at the Oscars, in an announcement fumbled by Al Pacino.",

      "In an emotional monologue, she reflected on the fact you don't really know what's going on in each other's lives, as footage switched between different characters being told the news.",
      "It was originally meant to be a silent sequence, but writer Jonathan Harvey told BBC News: \"It felt like it needed the gravitas of one of our longest-running characters to pass comment on the community that, when the programme started, was close-knit, looked out for each other and knew everybody's business. That's the cliche of what soaps are.",

    "story": [
      "Actress Blake Lively was arguably the internet's public enemy number one for a couple of weeks in the summer. She's now filed an explosive legal case that she claims lifts the lid on \"hostile work environments\" that are created to harm reputations in Hollywood - and which are making people question who and what to believe.",
      "Blake Lively had always been a pretty inoffensive kind of actress.",
      "She had been in successful TV shows and films, like Gossip Girl and The Sisterhood of the Travelling Pants. She married fellow superstar Ryan Reynolds. She's friends with Taylor Swift.",
      "Then in August, while promoting her latest movie It Ends With Us, she suddenly became controversial, to the verge of being cancelled.",
      "She was criticised for comments appearing to downplay domestic violence, the film's theme; while awkward old interviews were resurfaced and repurposed as evidence of bullying behaviour.",
      "Public opinion - at least among those who knew and cared - seemed to have turned against her.",
      "Then the film came out, the furore died down, and social media moved on.",
      "But Lively has now filed a legal case that claims she suffered sexual harassment by It Ends With Us co-star and director Justin Baldoni - and that when she complained, he and his studio Wayfarer retaliated by waging a campaign to \"destroy\" her reputation.",
      "She was the subject of \"a sophisticated, co-ordinated, and well-financed retaliation plan\" designed \"to silence her\", involving a \"weaponised a digital army\" and fake stories being fed to \"unwitting reporters\", her lawyers have alleged - and that's why she became the focus of negative publicity.",
      "Throughout the complaint, which spans some 80 pages, Lively's team repeatedly accuses Badoni and Wayfarer of creating a \"hostile work environment that nearly derailed production of the film\".",
      "Her lawyers have published text messages sent between Baldoni's publicist Jennifer Abel and Melissa Nathan, a crisis communications specialist hired by his studio to help manage the harassment complaint. They appear to give a rare glimpse into conversations that are normally kept well out of the spotlight.",
      "Nathan pitched a strategy to \"start threads of theories\" on social media, to \"create, seed, and promote content that appeared to be authentic\", and engage in \"social manipulation\", according to the legal papers.",
      "\"You know we can bury anyone,\" Nathan wrote to Abel in one damning discussion.",
      "Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni: What you need to know",
      "Hollywood stars support Blake Lively over legal complaint",
      "Actor Baldoni women's solidarity award rescinded amid allegations",
      "Now, the people hired to do crisis PR for Baldoni are doing crisis PR for themselves.",
      "Abel has said Lively's lawyers \"cherry picked\" messages to include in their case without crucial context, and that there was \"no 'smear' implemented\".",
      "\"No negative press was ever facilitated, no social combat plan, although we were prepared for it as it's our job to be ready for any scenario.",
      "\"But we didn't have to implement anything because the internet was doing the work for us.\"",
      "The backlash against Lively occurred naturally and didn't need their help, Abel said.",
      "Lawyer Bryan Freedman, representing Baldoni and his studio as well as Abel and Nathan, echoed that.",
      "He said Baldoni hired a crisis manager due to \"multiple demands and threats\" allegedly made by Lively, including \"threatening to not [show] up to set, threatening to not promote the film, ultimately leading to its demise during release, if her demands were not met\".",
      "He said the plan drawn up by Nathan's firm \"proved unnecessary as audiences found Lively's own actions, interviews and marketing during the promotional tour distasteful, and responded organically to that, which the media themselves picked up on\".",
      "Overall, Freedman called Lively's complaint \"shameful\" and full of \"categorically false accusations\".",
      "In recent days, Lively has received support from a string of former co-stars and others in Hollywood.",
      "The name of one of her supporters stands out.",
      "Amber Heard, former wife of Johnny Depp, told NBC: \"Social media is the absolute personification of the classic saying, 'A lie travels halfway around the world before truth can get its boots on.'",
      "\"I saw this firsthand and up close. It's as horrifying as it is destructive.\"",
      "Heard was on the receiving end of social media hostility during two high-profile libel trials involving Depp in the UK and US in 2020 and 2022. Nathan also reportedly worked for Depp.",
      "Freedman responded to Heard by saying the only connection between her and Lively was that \"for decades every move they have made has been out there for everyone to see\" so the public could \"make up their own minds - which they did, organically\".",
      "Tortoise Media head of investigations Alexi Mostrous, who hosted a podcast called Who Trolled Amber? earlier this year examining the abuse she received, said there were parallels.",
      "\"In both the Blake Lively case and the Amber Heard case, you see PR companies working with digital media specialists and other 'contractors' to promote online stories beneficial to their wealthy clients in ways that are opaque and not well understood,\" he told BBC News.",
      "\"It's an unregulated world where all sorts of tactics can take place behind closed doors.\"",
      "'Common tactic'",
      "Variety said Lively's case \"lays bare a show business process that's meant to operate in the shadows \u2013 the hiring of expensive crisis communications experts to sway opinion and uplift clients\".",
      "Her allegations suggest a \"sinister shadow campaign\" that went \"beyond what most publicity firms in Hollywood see as acceptable\", The Wrap's Sharon Waxman wrote.",
      "According to Rory Lynch, partner and head of reputation management law at Gateley Legal, it is \"quite a common tactic\" in Hollywood and business disputes to \"have PRs on both sides planting negative stories, sometimes false stories, about the opposition\".",
      "\"Even back in the golden era of Hollywood, there were rumours that Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor were using PR professionals to negatively brief against each other.\"",
      "However, the PR people who worked for Baldoni and his studio \"dropped the ball a little bit\" by discussing tactics in texts, he told BBC News.",
      "\"It doesn't surprise me, especially in the US and Hollywood, that you've got quite aggressive crisis PR people.",
      "\"But the fact that they put that in writing, I think, was possibly not the wisest thing. Normally they might do something like that over the phone.\"",
      "Lively herself is \"a sophisticated operator\" who will \"have her own PR people working away in the background as well\", Lynch added.",
      "'Our eyes are open'",
      "The New York Times, which broke the story of Lively's complaint at the weekend, said she \"denied that she or any of her representatives planted or spread negative information about Mr Baldoni or Wayfarer\".",
      "The paper also pointed out that \"it is impossible to know how much of the negative publicity\" towards Lively was originally seeded by those working on behalf of Baldoni, \"and how much they noticed and amplified\".",
      "Some fans have stressed that their criticisms were genuine, but many who turned against Lively now see the situation in a different light.",
      "\"We are so able to be manipulated into hating a woman that all it takes is a co-ordinated PR effort for us to switch sides against a domestic abuse victim, or a long-beloved American sweetheart,\" wrote Maddy Mussen in the Standard.",
      "\"Now our eyes are open, will we be harder to fool? Or will we still want any excuse to turn on a famous woman who is suddenly, in our eyes and the eyes of the ones manipulating us, no longer worthy?\"",
      "The Guardian's Laura Snapes wrote that she and her friends had now \"looked back, horrified, on what we had said about her in recent months\".",
      "She added: \"Lively's complaint has left my head spinning. What can you really trust?\""

      "That victory came as the band thought \"anyone but us would win,\" recalls the singer.",

      "Sir Roger's daughter Deborah remembers her father couldn't keep up with Frank Sinatra's drinking and would secretly pour his whisky into the plant pots.",
      "The family would watch comedy duo Morecambe and Wise on TV on a Friday night, says Geoffrey, and then Eric and Ernie would come over for Sunday lunch.",

      "At the end of a day's filming, Sir Roger would simply enjoy watching TV with his family in his dressing gown and slippers.",
      "\"His treat was baked beans on toast,\" says Geoffrey. \"He didn't need caviar.\"",

      "His big break came in 1962, playing Simon Templar in the TV series, The Saint.",
      "Geoffrey recalls the phone call his father received when he found out he had been chosen to take over the role of Britain's most famous secret agent.",
      "The last three digits of Sir Roger's phone number just happened to be 007.",
      "\"He answered the phone with '007', because that's what you do, and the voice said, 'That you are Roger,'\" says Geoffrey.",

      "He always had a very sardonic approach, says Geoffrey, and that was his interpretation, he adds.",
      "\"Let's make James Bond Roger Moore,\" he says, \"[as] opposed to Roger having to play a hired gun who is licensed to kill. And I think he was more like 'licensed to thrill.'\"",
      "This took an enormous amount of talent, says Geoffrey.",
      "Of the Bond films that starred Sir Roger, Geoffrey says his father's favourite was The Spy Who Loved Me.",
      "Growing up on movie sets was fantastic, recalls Geoffrey, but having James Bond as your father attracted quite a bit of attention on the school run.",
      "When Sir Roger came to pick him up from school one day, he remembers the car was suddenly surrounded by pupils - keen to catch a glimpse of the star.",

      "\"I said, 'Well, thanks for the heads up! How long have I got?'\" says Geoffrey.",

      "However, prosecutors claim he was involved in commercial transactions of up to 60kg.",

      "\"Everyone asked me what I was talking about,\" he said. \"Something seemed a little odd.\"",
      "'In love' with the fair, Goldberg wrote to Heller, introducing himself and proposing a new iteration of the Austrian's original dream.",
      "The two slowly built a rapport and Heller revealed that the attractions had been stored in 44 shipping containers in Austin, Texas since their disassembly.",
      "Opening in 1987, Luna Luna was a colourful success for three months. Its run was extended twice due to high demand, but while trying to fund a European tour, Heller fell into debt and sold the fair to an American foundation.",
      "The foundation tried to back out of the deal - \"buyers remorse\", according to Goldberg - but eventually went through with it. For the duration of the years-long battle and the new ownership, however, the rides were kept in storage.",
      "Decades since Luna Luna was packed away, Goldberg rallied a team of investors to buy what might be left of the exhibition from the foundation - sight unseen.",

      "\"The idea of restoring something so rich in cultural history outweighed the risks and for us, it wasn't about guarantees,\" Anthony Gonzales, CEO of DreamCrew, told the BBC.",
      "The New York Times estimated they paid $100m (about \u00a380m). The Guardian reported the sum at $1m. Goldberg did not disclose the final price to the BBC.",
      "When he opened the first of the containers, Goldberg started to sweat. Luna Luna's original merchandise had been torn to shreds.",
      "\"Did I just lead a group to spend millions of dollars on a pile of dust artwork that essentially rotted away?\" he wondered.",
      "It was a sleepless night.",

      "Most of the original rides are now housed in a towering 17,000-square foot space. There, exhibition-goers can \"marry\" one another in Heller's Wedding Chapel - originally a form of protest art against anti-LGBTQ marriage laws of the 80s.",
      "Hockney's Enchanted Tree Pavilion still smells faintly sweet, as if stampeding children once crushed fallen popcorn into its floor.",
      "Goldberg's wish to incorporate \"today's greatest artists\" is fulfilled with a soundtrack by modern musicians Andr\u00e9 3000, Jamie xx and Jockstrap echoing around the space.",
      "Drake isn't involved day-to-day but, \"he is passionate about Luna Luna and has provided his full support since the beginning,\" Gonzales said.",
      "All the fun of the fair?",
      "There's one big difference between 1987's Luna Luna and today's: Children aren't allowed on the rides.",
      "Basquiat's Ferris Wheel and Kenny Scharf's swing ride are display-only. So too (thankfully) is Manfred Deix's Palace of the Winds in which performers originally farted into microphones.",
      "Haring biographer Gooch doesn't think the artist would have approved of children just watching his carousel turn.",
      "\"I can't imagine he would allow it,\" he said. \"He was pretty insistent about interactivity of children with art, and this was art that was specifically made for them.\"",
      "Poots, who played a significant role in coordinating the interdisciplinary side of the exhibition said of the decision: \"They're priceless works of art now.\"",
      "But he champions the possibility of audiences becoming \"part of this moving exhibition\" through the \"carnival-esque environment with performance artists with light, with sound\".",
      "It has been a career-long mission of Poots not \"to create these silos for elites\".",

      "Among the families wandering around The Shed on Thanksgiving weekend were Raemy Suwatson and her 11-year-old daughter, who learned she wouldn't be able to go on the rides the morning of their visit.",
      "Haring's carousel was her favourite. \"I wanted to ride it\" she said, then added \"but it was also cool to watch\".",

    "published": "Tue, 24 Dec 2024 22:06:10 GMT",
    "summary": "Over the centuries, painters in India have depicted Jesus's birth from a uniquely local perspective.",
    "story": [
      "The birth of Jesus Christ - a seminal biblical event - has been the subject of many paintings by Western artists, who have often applied the ideas of beauty and creativity prevalent there while depicting the event on canvas.",
      "These works are among the most widely available representations of Christian art, shaping how the world views this biblical event and subliminally divesting those outside the West from influencing it.",
      "But over the centuries, artists in India have sought to express their vision of this event by painting Jesus's birth and other Christian themes in their own style.",
      "Some have done so consciously, others unconsciously, but the end result is a body of work that breathes new life and meaning into the event of Christ's birth, and Christianity itself.",
      "Here are some paintings from Indian art history that present Jesus's birth from a uniquely local perspective.",
      "Mughal emperor Muhammad Jalaluddin Akbar is credited with introducing northern India to Christianity by inviting Jesuit missionaries to visit his court.",
      "The missionaries brought with them holy scriptures and European artworks on Christian themes which influenced court painters. Akbar and his successors also commissioned many murals with Christian themes and some court painters began infusing these paintings with elements of Islamic art.",
      "Neha Vermani, a historian of South Asia, talks about a painting made by Mughal court artists which featured emperor Jahangir in the nativity scene, which traditionally feature Mary, Joseph and baby Jesus.",
      "\"Mughal rulers saw themselves as being 'just' rulers, capable of maintaining harmony and balance in their kingdoms; they were 'universal rulers'. Allowing different religions to co-exist was integral to how they saw themselves and wanted themselves to be remembered,\" Ms Vermani says.",
      "The 18th Century painting below features typical stylistic elements of Mughal art, including highly stylised figures, vibrant colours, naturalism and ornamentation.",
      "Born in 1887 in what is now India's West Bengal state, Jamini Roy is celebrated for creating a unique visual language by bringing together elements of Bengali folk art and Kalighat paintings - a distinctive art form that originated in the vicinity of a renowned temple in Kolkata city.",
      "Ashish Anand, CEO and managing director of art firm DAG says that art critic WG Archer once observed that Christ represented a Santhal figure (the Santhals are an Indian tribal group) for Jamini Roy.",
      "\"The simplicity of Christ's life and his sacrifice appealed to Roy, making his paintings on Christian themes at least as important as those on Hindu mythology, all of them rendered in the folk style of modernism that he made distinctively his own,\" he says.",
      "Born in 1902 in the western state of Goa, Angelo de Fonseca is credited with creating unique Christian iconography that married Eastern and Western influences with his Goan sensibilities.",
      "In his paintings, Mary isn't depicted as a fair maiden in a blue gown, but looks very much like an Indian woman with brown skin, dressed in a sari and wearing a mangalsutra (a piece of traditional Indian jewellery worn by married Hindu women).",
      "Biblical scenes unfold in local settings and feature motifs and elements that speak to an Indian audience.",
      "Through his art, he tried to counter the narrative of the West being the cradle of beauty and artistic creativity.",
      "\"Fonseca wanted to situate Christianity - which has largely been viewed as a western religious tradition - within the Indian subcontinent. It was from this angst that his watercolours painted Christianity anew,\" Rinald D'Souza, director of the Xavier Centre of Historical Research, Goa, told the BBC."

      "There are few books in recent years that have become as big a cultural phenomenon    as Colleen Hoover's novel - it has sold 20m copies and became an internet sensation on TikTok with more than one billion tags on the app.",
      "When Blake Lively, who rose to fame in the 2000s playing Serena van der Woodsen in Gossip Girl, was cast as the main character, fans became even more excited, describing her as the perfect choice to play Lily Bloom, a young woman who grew up witnessing domestic abuse and winds up in the same position years later.",
      "Lily, a florist in Boston, navigates a complicated love triangle between her charming but abusive boyfriend Ryle Kincaid - played by Jane the Virgin's Justin Baldoni - and her compassionate first love, Atlas Corrigan (Brandon Sklenar).",
      "Released at the beginning of August, the film became a box office success bringing in more than $350m (\u00a3280m) globally.",
      "But despite its financial success, everything wasn't running so smoothly behind the scenes. Rumours of a feud between Baldoni and Lively began swirling before the film was even released.",
      "Last week, Lively filed a legal complaint against her co-star, accusing him of sexual harassment and starting a smear campaign against her, something Baldoni strongly denies. Here is the story so far:",
      "Hollywood stars support Blake Lively over legal complaint",
      "Blake Lively accuses co-star Justin Baldoni of smear campaign",
      "It Ends With Us press tour",
      "For a film about domestic abuse, the press tour for It Ends With Us was probably not what you would have expected. There were pink carpets, flowers galore and the promotion of Lively's new haircare brand and her husband's gin company.",
      "Instead of advocacy on the red carpet, Lively highlighted fashion and florals.",
      "At the London premiere, press were told to keep questions \"fun and light-hearted\" with one event organiser telling me to \"steer away from questions on domestic abuse\".",
      "One of her remarks made at the New York premiere - \"you are so much more than just a survivor or just a victim\" - sparked backlash on social media.",
      "Domestic abuse survivor Ashley Paige criticised Ms Lively's language and told the BBC that her own trauma \"shaped my identity\".",
      "Lively was also criticised for her comments in another clumsy promotional tour video where she said: \"Grab your friends, wear your florals and head out to see it.\"",
      "Ms Paige accused Lively of promoting the film like it's \"the sequel to Barbie\".",
      "Justin Baldoni's absence",
      "Alongside the press tour being described as \"tone-deaf\", people started asking questions about why the Lively and Baldoni weren't photographed on the red carpet together at the film's New York premiere on 6 August.",
      "The pair also did no interviews together during the press tour and at the London premiere, which Baldoni didn't attend, I was warned by Lively's team to not \"ask any questions about Justin\".",
      "Internet sleuths also spotted that cast members including Lively and author Hoover did not follow Baldoni on social media.",
      "Neither Lively or Baldoni addressed rumours of a feud during the press tour and the only reference to each other was Baldoni telling Today that his co-star was a \"dynamic creative\".",
      "\"She had her hands in every part of this production, and everything she touched made [it] better,\" he said about the 37-year-old.",
      "Mixed critic reviews",
      "While the film was a box office success, it received mixed reviews from critics with some saying it romanticised domestic abuse.",
      "There was a two-star review from The Telegraph's Tim Robey, who called it a \"queasy drama\" that \"repackages domestic violence as slick romance\".",
      "He suggested the film \"splices abuse and glossy courtship in the big city to deeply dubious effects\".",
      "The movie also sparked a debate on TikTok, with some saying that it's not clear from the trailer that this story is about an abusive relationship and rather it appears to be telling a love story.",
      "Based on this misconception, some people said they found the film traumatic as they didn't know it contained scenes of domestic abuse.",
      "'Smear campaign'",
      "During the film's press tour, Baldoni hired a crisis manager, Melissa Nathan, whose previous clients include Johnny Depp and Drake.",
      "Shortly after the press tour, Lively faced a barrage of criticism on social media relating to her comments on that tour as well as from old interviews.",
      "One of the interviews to resurface was one shared by a Norwegian journalist, Kjersti Flaa, who posted a video on YouTube of her interviewing Lively in 2016. It was titled \"The Blake Lively interview that made me want to quit my job.\"",
      "Flaa has since said she had \"nothing to do with Justin Baldoni and his smear campaign\".",
      "Actor Brandon Sklenar, who plays Atlas in the film, defended Lively and said in a post on Instagram that people had been \"vilifying\" the women involved in the film online.",
      "He said it was \"disheartening to see the amount of negativity being projected\" and that someone close to him who had experienced a relationship similar to Lily's had credited the film with \"saving her life\".",
      "Legal complaint",
      "Four months after the film's launch, Lively filed a legal complaint against Mr Baldoni in which she accused him of sexual harassment.",
      "The complaint also listed Wayfarer Studios, Mr Baldoni's production company which produced It Ends With Us, as a defendant.",
      "The legal filing accuses Mr Baldoni and Wayfarer CEO Jamey Heath of \"repeated sexual harassment and other disturbing behaviour\". Some other female cast and crew had also spoken up about their conduct, the filing alleges.",
      "It also alleges that Ms Lively, Mr Baldoni and other people involved in the development of the film attended a meeting in January to address \"the hostile work environment\" on set. Her husband, actor Ryan Reynolds, attended the meeting alongside her, according to the complaint.",
      "At the meeting, attendees agreed to a list of demands, including Mr Baldoni and Mr Heath making \"no more descriptions of their own genitalia\", requiring an intimacy coordinator on set at all times when Ms Lively was in scenes with Mr Baldoni and no \"friends\" of the producers and directors being on set during scenes when Ms Lively was in a state of nudity.",
      "The list of demands also implied that Mr Baldoni had asked Ms Lively's trainer how much she weighed and alleged that Mr Baldoni and Mr Heath had spoken about their \"pornography addiction\" to Ms Lively.",
      "Plan to 'destroy' reputation",
      "In the filing, Ms Lively also alleges that Mr Baldoni and his team attacked her public image after the meeting.",
      "She accuses him of orchestrating a plan to \"destroy\" her reputation in the press and online, including hiring a crisis manager who led a \"sophisticated, coordinated, and well-financed retaliation plan\" against her and used a \"digital army\" to post social media content that seemed authentic.",
      "\"To safeguard against the risk of Ms Lively ever revealing the truth about Mr Baldoni, the Baldoni-Wayfarer team created, planted, amplified, and boosted content designed to eviscerate Ms Lively's credibility,\" her team wrote in the filing.",
      "It adds: \"They engaged in the same techniques to bolster Mr Baldoni's credibility and suppress any negative content about him.\"",
      "In the filing, Ms Lively says that this had led to \"substantial harm\" that affected \"all aspects\" of her life.",
      "Mr Baldoni's legal team told the BBC the allegations are \"categorically false\" and said they hired a crisis manager because Ms Lively had threatened to derail the film unless her demands were met.",
      "Responding to the legal complaint, Mr Baldoni's lawyer, Bryan Freedman, said on Saturday: \"It is shameful that Ms Lively and her representatives would make such serious and categorically false accusations against Mr Baldoni, Wayfarer Studios and its representatives.\"",
      "Mr Freedman accused Ms Lively of making numerous demands and threats, including \"threatening to not show up to set, threatening to not promote the film\", which would end up \"ultimately leading to its demise during release, if her demands were not met\".",
      "Support for Lively",
      "Hollywood stars including America Ferrera, Amber Tamblyn and Alexis Bledel have publicly backed Blake Lively after she filed her complaint.",
      "Ferrera, Tamblyn and Bledel, who starred with Lively in 2005 film The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants, issued a joint statement on Instagram, on Sunday saying they \"stand with her in solidarity\".",
      "\"Throughout the filming of It Ends with Us, we saw her summon the courage to ask for a safe workplace for herself and colleagues on set, and we are appalled to read the evidence of a premeditated and vindictive effort that ensued to discredit her voice,\" they wrote.",
      "Colleen Hoover, the author of It Ends With Us, also showed her support, describing Ms Lively as \"honest, kind, supportive and patient\".",
      "Baldoni's award rescinded",
      "Earlier in December, Baldoni was awarded a women's solidarity honour by Vital Voices, a global non-profit organisation that focuses on empowering women.",
      "The organisation has now rescinded the award after the legal complaint filed by Lively alleged \"abhorrent conduct\" by the actor, his studio and a crisis public relations team that it said was \"contrary to the values\" it held.",
      "And since the legal complaint, Baldoni's podcast co-host Liz Plank announced she was leaving The Man Enough show.",
      "The podcast bills itself as creating \"a safe environment\" for exploring issues such as how \"masculinity\" shows up in relationships, as well as \"sex, success\" and \"mental health\".",

    "published": "Sun, 22 Dec 2024 00:00:39 GMT",
    "summary": "After dominating culture this summer, Brat tops a \"poll of polls\" to be named the year's best record.",
    "story": [
      "When Charli XCX recorded her sixth album, Brat, she thought her prickly, abrasive dance anthems were \"not going to appeal to a lot of people\".",
      "In the end, the record topped the charts and became a cultural phenomenon. It was nominated for seven Grammys, referenced in the US presidential election, turned into a paint swatch, and named \"word of the year\" by Collins Dictionary.",
      "Now the album has been named the best new release of 2024 in a \"poll of polls\" compiled by BBC News.",
      "In multiple end of year lists, critics called Brat \"brilliant from start to finish\" and \"pop music for the future\", praising the way its \"painfully relatable\" lyrics captured Charli's insecurities, anxieties and obsessions.",
      "In the star's own words, the record is \"chaos and emotional turmoil set to a club soundtrack\".",
      "\"The louder you play it, the more honest it gets,\" said the Los Angeles Times.",
      "The BBC's poll is a \"super-ranking\" compiled from 30 year-end lists published by the world's most influential music magazines - including the NME, Rolling Stone, Spain's Mondo Sonoro and France's Les Inrockuptibles.",
      "Records were assigned points based on their position in each list - with the number one album getting 20 points, the number two album receiving 19 points, and so on.",
      "Brat was the runaway winner with a score of 486 points, nearly twice as many as the number two album, Beyonc\u00e9's Cowboy Carter.",
      "In total, the critics named 184 records among their favourites, from the The Cure's long-awaited comeback, Songs Of A Lost World, to the kaleidoscopic rap of Doechii's Alligator Bites Never Heal.",
      "Here's the top 25 in full.",
      "1) Charli XCX - Brat",
      "Charli was born Emma Aitchison in Essex, UK, and has been chipping away at the coalface of pop for more than a decade.",
      "At the start of her career, she scored hits with shiny pop anthems such as Fancy, I Love It and Boom Clap - but over the years, her music has become more volatile and aggressive.",
      "Underground anthems like Vroom, Vroom and Track 10 turned her into a cult star but, as she confessed on Brat: \"I've started thinking again about whether I deserve commercial success\".",
      "With that in mind, she entered 2024 with a new sense of purpose.",
      "\"Before we'd even done much writing, she had a masterplan of all the stuff she wanted to write about, and all the things she wanted to say,\" producer AG Cook tells the BBC. \"She had a real vision for the album, right from the start.\"",
      "\"Even the name Brat was in play for about two years,\" adds co-producer Finn Keane.",
      "Released in June, Brat became the soundtrack to the summer; and Charli extended her success with a remix album that rewrote many of the songs and added an array of guest stars, from Billie Eilish and Robyn to The 1975 and Lorde.",
      "The remix project was \"really, off-the-cuff and last minute\", says Cook, \"but that's been part of the fun of Brat\".",
      "\"Charli is just incredibly quick and open to ideas,\" adds Keane. \"You can give her kind of any kind of crazy track, and she'll instantly be able to come up with something super hooky, with a twist that's very memorable and elaborate.",
      "\"She's just incredibly musical.\"",
      "Billboard: \"Charli XCX pulled off one of the most exciting and culturally significant album launches in modern memory... And best of all? It was all on Charli's own terms. Drawing inspiration primarily from club culture and hyperpop, Charli pulled once-niche spaces in music into the mainstream.\"",
      "The Forty Five: \"In making a club record to ignite the underground, she's reached the world's biggest stages. Musically, Charli is at her peak.\"",
      "2) Beyonc\u00e9 - Cowboy Carter",
      "Frequently mis-labelled as a country album, Beyonc\u00e9's Cowboy Carter is so much more. A racial reckoning with the black roots of American folk music, its 27 tracks embrace everything from line-dancing to psychedelic rock, with guest appearances from Dolly Parton, Willie Nelson and Post Malone.",
      "The Times: \"The pop hoedown single Texas Hold 'Em remains the best piece, but the acoustic guitar-driven sexy ode Bodyguard is another highlight. Will this finally win Beyonc\u00e9 her best album Grammy?\"",
      "NME: \"A masterclass in creativity from an artist who never forgets her roots.\"",
      "3) Fontaines D.C. - Romance",
      "The fourth album by Dublin's Fontaines DC saw the quintet take their scratchy, sinister sound and run it through a technicolor filter. The results include everything from stadium-sized sing-alongs (Favourite) to panic-inducing punk anthems (Starburster).",
      "Allmusic: \"When all is said and done, they remain fantastic songwriters, able to convey a variety of emotions without relying on the trappings of punk. The corners may have been sanded off, but it has only revealed new and interesting textures underneath.\"",
      "Mojo magazine: \"Fontaines D.C. are now, in terms of risk-taking potential, the Arctic Monkeys' closest rivals.\"",
      "4) Billie Eilish - Hit Me Hard And Soft",
      "The title says it all. None of the songs on Billie Eilish's exquisite third album are content to sit still, moving from hushed intimacy to emotional volatility as the singer navigates the murky waters of her early 20s.",
      "The Telegraph: \"Eilish has made something rich, strange, smart, sad and wise enough to stand comparison with Joni Mitchell's Blue. A heartbreak masterpiece for her generation, and for the ages.\"",
      "The Guardian: \"An album that keeps wrongfooting the listener, Hit Me Hard and Soft is clearly intended as something to gradually unpick: A bold move in a pop world where audiences are usually depicted as suffering from an attention deficit that requires instant gratification.\"",
      "5) MJ Lenderman - Manning Fireworks",
      "Billed by one publication as the \"poet laureate of indie rock\", MJ Lenderman's breakthrough album is tender, melancholy and wryly funny, populated by a cast of flawed, disappointed and disappointing characters he observed around his hometown of Asheville, North Carolina.",
      "New York Times: \"An ace guitarist with a keen ear for jangly tones, he lends even his most pathetic characters a bit of warm-blooded humanity.\"",
      "The Line Of Best Fit: \"How he gets you to care about nobodies from nowhere and their very strange plights is in part to do with his knack for universal empathy, but more importantly, the fact that he sings everything like he was just robbed at gunpoint by his 8th grade bully who he later watched win the lottery. You feel bad for things you don't necessarily even understand.\"",
      "6) The Cure - Songs Of A Lost World",
      "Sixteen years in the making, The Cure's 14th studio album didn't disappoint. Written during a period where frontman Robert Smith lost his mother, father and brother, it is simultaneously dark and fragile.",
      "Speaking to the BBC, Smith said making the record had been \"hugely cathartic\" in escaping the \"doom and gloom\" he felt.",
      "Time magazine: \"It's no exaggeration that this is an album haunted by death, so it's almost ironic that, musically speaking, there hasn't been this much life in The Cure for decades.\"",
      "Pitchfork: \"It feels like a record whose time is right, delivering a concentrated dose of The Cure and cutting the fat that dogged their later albums.\"",
      "7) Cindy Lee - Diamond Jubilee",
      "A sprawling, two-hour opus of dreamy pop and psychedelia, this is one of the year's most mysterious records. You can't buy the CD or vinyl, and it's not available on Spotify or Apple Music. At the time of writing, it's only available as a continuous, ad-free stream on YouTube, or as a download from Bandcamp.",
      "But the seventh album by Cyndi Lee (the drag alter-ego of rock musician Patrick Flegel) is definitely worth your seeking out - like the lost transmissions of a ghostly 1960s pirate radio station.",
      "Uncut: \"Cindy Lee has managed to buck just about every trend, convention and expectation of what releasing music in the digital age is supposed to look and like. And, even more crucially, it sounds just as refreshing.\"",
      "Stereogum: \"Diamond Jubilee is two hours of unrushed wandering through a lo-fi escape, catchy to the point of sticky, tarnishing in its abrasiveness yet sun-baked to perfection.\"",
      "8) Waxahatchee - Tigers Blood",
      "On her sixth album as Waxahatchee, singer-songwriter Katie Crutchfield tackles everything from anxiety and self-doubt, to her ongoing struggle with sobriety, with piercing insight and a laid-back country-rock feel.",
      "Pitchfork: \"Her mind is alive and humming, and her language leaps out at you with its hunger.\"",
      "Consequence of Sound: \"Crutchfield is still growing, both personally and artistically, and we're just glad she's invited us along for the ride.\"",
      "9) Kendrick Lamar - GNX",
      "After landing the decisive blow in his rap beef with Drake, Compton rapper Kendrick Lamar took a victory lap on his surprise sixth album, GNX. Razor sharp and rhythmically complex, it's both a poison pen letter to his detractors, and a love letter to Los Angeles' hip-hop culture.",
      "LA Times: \"Lamar is worked up about liars, about folks doling out backhanded compliments, about other rappers with \"old-ass flows\" wasting space with empty rhymes. Indeed, what seems to make him angriest is the idea that a person could triumph in hip-hop by taking hip-hop less seriously than he does.\"",
      "Complex: \"Even cooler is how much space Kendrick gives to underground rappers from the LA scene\u2014figures who are talented but raw, and would likely struggle to gain national recognition without a boost.\"",
      "10) Sabrina Carpenter - Short N' Sweet",
      "Six albums into her career, former Disney star Sabrina Carpenter landed on a winning formula - one that puts aside the cookie-cutter pop of her teen years, and zeroes in on her sly humour as a USP.",
      "Fleet of foot and packed with memorable one-liners, it produced three number one singles in the UK, including song of the year contender Espresso.",
      "New York Times: \"A smart, funny, cheerfully merciless catalogue of bad boyfriend behaviour.\"",
      "Esquire: \"The range, humour, and sophistication of these 12 songs were a revelation.\"",
      "The next 15",
      "11) Tyler, The Creator - Chromokopia",
      "12) Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds - Wild God",
      "13) Beth Gibbons - Lives Outgrown",
      "=14) Mk.Gee - Two Star & The Dream People",
      "=14) Jessica Pratt - Here In The Pitch",
      "16) Vampire Weekend - Only God Was Above Us",
      "17) Adrianne Lenker - Bright Future",
      "18) Doechii - Alligator Bites Never Heal",
      "19) Clairo - Charm",
      "=20) Taylor Swift - The Tortured Poets Department",

      "22) English Teacher - This Could Be Texas",
      "23) The Last Dinner Party - Prelude To Ecstasy",
      "24) Magdalena Bay - Imaginal Disk",
      "25) Nilufer Yanya - My Method Actor",
      "The chart was compiled from 30 \"best of\" lists in the following publications: Billboard, Complex, Consequence Of Sound, Daily Mail, Dazed Magazine, Double J, Esquire, Entertainment Weekly, The Forty Five, Gorilla Vs Bear, The Guardian, The Independent, LA Times, Les Inrocks, Line Of Best Fit, Mojo, Mondo Sonoro, NME, New York Times, Paste, People, Pitchfork, Pop Matters, The Skinny, Rolling Stone, Stereogum, The Sunday Times, The Telegraph, Time Magazine and Uncut."

      "Prof Jonathan Wilson, a professor of brand strategy and culture at Regent's University London, thinks there is an ulterior motive for people sharing these end-of-year-reviews - especially on apps that people use to track their virtuous activities, like fitness and education.",
      "\"It's like bragging but without the selfie,\" he explains. \"Lots of people don't want to take selfies for various reasons but one of them is that people feel a bit cringe, that it's a bit narcissistic.\"",
      "People share information on social media if it \"enhances the image we wish to portray publicly of who we are and what we want to align ourselves with\", he says.",
      "Apps like Strava will tot up how far you have run or cycled this year, while Duolingo will tell you how many hours you've spent learning another language.",
      "Goodreads provides you with images you can share on social media displaying the books you have read this year, with details about the average page length and your top genres.",
      "\"Data is a really good way to humblebrag, as opposed to actually taking selfies in all of your best clothes surrounded by all of your best people and belongings,\" Prof Wilson adds.",

      "It has led to people boasting online about being the top consumer of paprika, toilet cleaner or pickled gherkins.",
      "Year in review features can raise questions about just how much data companies collect. It is widely understood that the vast majority of apps and websites someone might use are collecting huge reams of data, which they use for marketing purposes.",

      "As the not guilty verdicts were read out by the foreman, the rapper collapsed in tears in the dock - he had just been acquitted of three counts of rape following a three-week-long trial at Oxford Crown Court.",
      "In that moment, most people in that court room, including the rapper's friends and family, were focussed on the relief and joy of those two words - \"not guilty\".",
      "But over the coming weeks, Slowthai - whose real name is Tyron Frampton - will begin to plot a course to overcome his ''cancellation\", and regain his status as one of UK rap music's most celebrated artists.",
      "The rapper released his first album in 2019.",
      "He has since gone on to release two more critically acclaimed albums, including 2023's UGLY - which received a five-star review from the NME's Thomas Smith, who called it the rapper's \"most exhilarating project to date from front to back\".",

      "The musician, who has also released his own solo music since being acquitted, has seen his career climb back to, and even possibly exceed, its previous heights since his trial five years ago.",
      "On the other end of the spectrum is the English singer-songwriter Rex Orange County.",
      "The musician was widely regarded as a darling of modern indie music, and had released critically acclaimed albums that reached the top ten in both the UK and US charts, before being charged with six counts of sexual assault in 2022.",
      "All charges against him were dropped later that year, but the singer decided to take a two-year hiatus from music - which ended earlier this year with the release of his fifth studio album, The Alexander Technique.",
      "The album has failed to garner anywhere near as much interest as his previous efforts though, spending just one week in the UK album chart and only reaching 151 in the US.",
      "Despite seeing off the charges, Rex Orange County thus far appears to have failed to shake-off his \"cancelled\" tag and reignite his career.",
      "The stories of Oritse Williams and Rex Orange County may guide what Slowthai does next with his career - but only the general public will determine the outcome of his comeback.",
      "Marcus Johnstone says he feels there \"may be some hope\" for the Northampton-based rapper.",
      "\"His attraction is to a certain demographic who may not see the need to 'cancel' him,\" he says.",

      "Most of the plants in question are a variety known as succulents, named for their ability to hold water and survive in arid climates.",
      "Many of the world's succulent species are only found in the Succulent Karoo desert, which spans South Africa and Namibia.",
      "Succulent species range in size, shape and colour - some look like small multi-coloured buttons and some look like cacti, sprouting colourful flowers at certain times of the year.",
      "While these varieties can be cultivated in nurseries, global demand is also fuelling the poaching of these plants from the wild which are then smuggled and sold online to buyers in the US, Europe and East Asia.",
      "In Kamieskroon, a small town in the centre of South Africa's Namaqualand region, the rolling hills have become a haven for poachers.",
      "Some of the species are highly localised, and so can be wiped out by just a small amount of poaching.",
      "\"In South Africa, we know already of seven species that has been wiped out completely and there are certainly more species that will go extinct very soon,\" says Pieter van Wyk, a nursery curator at the /Ai /Ais-Richtersveld Transfrontier Park.",
      "It is hard to obtain figures for how many plants are being poached, but the non-governmental organisation Traffic reports that 1.6 million illegally harvested succulents were seized by South Africa's law enforcement agencies between 2019 and 2024. This only represents the contraband that was detected, so the true figure is likely to be far higher.",
      "The South African government is well aware of the problem, and unveiled a  strategy in 2022 to combat poaching. It includes running community programmes about the need to protect the environment.",
      "According to Mr Van Wyk and other conservationists, plant poaching has been booming since the Covid-19 lockdown in 2020.",
      "With international traders unable to travel to South Africa during that time, they turned to local people to collect succulents for them and post them out of the country.",
      "Mr Van Wyk says this coincided with an increase in global demand.",
      "\"People had more time to try to find something to keep busy with, and plants were one of the only things that in your house, could connect you to the outside world.\"",
      "This has been seized upon by organised crime syndicates who hire teams of plant poachers and then market the wild plants on social media and e-commerce platforms.",
      "\"The syndicates saw this as an opportunity of making something viral\u2026 telling a wide as possible public: 'We have this super-strange looking thing that comes from the African continent','\" Mr Van Wyk says.",
      "\"Then the public just loses their heads and they say: 'I want to buy one', and [the syndicates] arrange for the species to be poached,\" he adds.",

      "\"This is a low-income area, people are not rich here, and people will exploit opportunities for income,\" explains Malinda Gardiner from Conservation South Africa.",

      "\"When they get the money, there's more drugs, more alcohol, children are neglected because mummy is drunk, daddy is drunk, there's no food,\" adds the farmer.",
      "Ms Gardiner worries that the tensions will have longer-term effects.",
      "\"Small communities here really need each other\u2026 but this brings distrust. It brings a split in the communities as well,\" she says.",
      "Mr Van Wyk's assessment is starker: \"People are being abused and enslaved by syndicates and buyers.\"",
      "Attempts are being made to raise awareness among buyers about the importance of understanding where a plant might have come from.",
      "China has become a major source of demand for wild succulents in the last few years, but an internet campaign there to educate people about the illegal succulent trade has seen some results.",
      "The Clean Internet for Conophytum campaign was launched in March 2023 by the China Biodiversity Conservation and Green Development Foundation.",
      "According to the foundation's deputy secretary-general Linda Wong, they have seen an 80% reduction in online adverts for conophytum - a type of succulent - with an unknown source, and buyers are starting to ask questions about where plants being sold online have come from.",
      "\"The key is awareness. Once people know, they want to take action. They want to take responsibility to consume those plants and enjoy their beauty in a very responsible way,\" she tells the BBC.",
      "Conservationists advise customers all over the world to ask about the origin of a plant, and under no circumstances should they buy those advertised as wild.",
      "Traffic and the UK's Kew Gardens recently announced that they were teaming up with eBay to develop new ways of preventing the sale of wild succulents on its platform.",
      "In South Africa, Mr Van Wyk says more should be done to promote the cultivation of succulents that can be grown and harvested legally, to reduce the demand for poaching.",
      "\"We as a country need to say that: 'We have this resource, and there are other countries that are majorly benefiting from this, why aren't we?'\" he tells the BBC.",
      "Mr Van Wyk now runs a nursery at the /Ai /Ais-Richtersveld Transfrontier Park which looks after plants that have been confiscated by law enforcement, and he says they have received more than 200,000 so far.",

      "When Mr Musk first acquired Twitter, he emphasised the need to house all political opinions and push back against censorship by social media companies and governments.",
      "Changes - including mass layoffs and alterations to moderation policies on issues like political misinformation - started immediately.",
      "There have also been various alterations to the nature of feeds including the creation of two separate sections: \"Following\", which features accounts you follow, and \"For You\", which is algorithmically curated, as on TikTok.",
      "Over the course of 2024, however, there have been another wave of alterations that appear to have transformed it further. The block function has been changed, meaning that if you block an account you won't be protected from that profile viewing what you post. Likes, meanwhile, have been made private.",
      "The site still features crowd-sourced community notes used to factcheck or rebuff what posts say - and users are able to pay for blue ticks, which were previously given free of charge as a sign authenticating that the person was who they said they were.",

      "What to X-pect from Elon Musk in 2025",
      "Now, though, it is necessary to pay to subscribe to X Premium to receive a checkmark. (There are three tiers of subscription - in the UK, the Premium Tier currently costs around \u00a310 a month).",
      "Premium profiles are entitled to more privileges and prominence - and can make money from the engagement they get from other checkmarked profiles. From October, X changed its rules so that instead of basing revenue for individual accounts around ads, it now takes into account likes, shares and comments from other Premium accounts.",
      "Of course other social media sites allow users to make money from posts and let them share sponsored content - this is not uncommon - but most major sites have rules that allow them to de-monetise or suspend profiles that post misinformation.",
      "X does not have rules to de-monetise accounts over these kinds of posts, although it does allow users to add community notes to misleading or false tweets. And it does not allow \"misleading media\" like manipulated or synthetic videos that \"may result in widespread confusion on public issues, impact public safety or cause serious harm\".",
      "According to Inevitable West, X can now become a job. They told me when they were posting around seven times a day they could accrue a minimum of \"$2,500 a month\".",
      "They say they know of another account making \"$25,000\" each month - that account allegedly has 500,000 followers and posts \"roughly 30\" times a day.",
      "Has the algorithm changed?",
      "Change can sometimes come about when a website alters the algorithms (or recommendation systems) in some way, for example in order to boost and benefit certain posts. What\u2019s unclear is whether or not that may be the case here?",
      "Certainly, I've observed a difference in the variety of posts recommended on the \"For You\" feed compared with that a year ago.",
      "This is something I analysed through an \"Undercover Voter project\", in which I created and ran social media accounts belonging to more than 20 fictional characters, based in the US and UK, which reflect views from across the political spectrum.",
      "These characters have profiles on the main sites including X, allowing me to interrogate what different accounts were recommended on social media. The accounts are private and do not message real people or have friends.",
      "Regardless of the different political views their accounts express, I observed that in the last six months of this year their feeds have become dominated by divisive posts, and tend to feature more in support of Trump or in opposition to politicians and people across the world who are not seen to be aligned with the US president elect.",
      "However, all of this seems to be the consequence of the environment and the various changes to the wider site, rather than solely a simple tweak to the algorithm.",
      "Andrew Kaung, who was previously an analyst on user safety at TikTok and has also worked at Meta, has spent years observing how these recommendation systems can be updated and changed. \"What we've seen on X is not just about algorithms changing, it is also informed by the lack of safety mechanisms in the name of free speech,\" he says.",
      "Nina Jankowicz is former Executive Director on the Disinformation Governance Board of the United States, which was set up in 2022 to advise the Department of Homeland Security on issues including Russian disinformation and later disbanded after public backlash over concerns including around freedom of expression and transparency. She argues that X's algorithms now \"privilege divisive and misleading rhetoric\" and suggests that users who post less controversial content have found a reduction in the views.",
      "\"The consequence is that the platform that touts itself as a public square is an extraordinarily artificial environment, a true black mirror of the most worrying parts of human nature.\"",
      "The unintended influencers",
      "I messaged dozens of other large accounts, who describe the growing influence they're able to have on the site, often unexpectedly.",
      "\"I never really intended to become an influencer,\" admits one profile called Andi, who says he's based in New York. \"But I figure since I have this platform I should try to use it to advance my own causes.\"",
      "He describes how he shared a meme of squirrel - after learning about a squirrel that was euthanised over concerns it could have rabies - which now has 45 million views. Andi compares his reach to that of popular podcaster Joe Rogan, who has 14.5 million followers on X.",
      "\"But I am no Joe Rogan, so it's really special that something I post can get almost as much viewership.\"",
      "Andi and other X accounts I've corresponded with believe that the changes to X are a good thing, as they now have a reach they could have never anticipated.",
      "Allegations of moderation bias",
      "\u200b\u200bEarlier this month, an attack at a German market, which killed five people and injured more than 200, was widely debated on X. Much of the discussion centred around the suspect, a German resident originally from Saudi Arabia. German prosecutors have said the investigation is ongoing, but suggested one potential motive for the attack \"could have been disgruntlement with the way Saudi Arabian refugees are treated in Germany\".",
      "Inevitable West was among those who commented: \"Raid the mosques. Ban the Quran. Carry out mass deportations. Our patience has officially expired.\"",
      "\u200b\u200bThe account has been accused of inflaming hate with posts about issues including immigration and religion. Other users said this could incite violence. But the profile responded by saying that they were \"actually inciting safety\".",
      "When questioned on this, Inevitable West told me that they'd say the same about other religions. Separately, they also said they would never delete their own posts - even when they turn out to be untrue.",
      "Meanwhile, their content is being seen by feeds around the world.",
      "Allegations of bias in moderation methods have long been levelled at Twitter, both before and since Mr Musk acquired the company, alongside questions about whether the site previously limited freedom of expression.",
      "I spoke to Twitter insiders about this for a Panorama investigation which aired in 2023, and they told me that, in their view, the company was going to struggle to protect users from trolling, state-coordinated disinformation and child sexual exploitation, putting this down to, among other things, mass layoffs.",
      "At the time, X did not respond to the points raised. Afterwards, Mr Musk tweeted a BBC article about the Panorama episode with the caption: \"Sorry for turning Twitter from nurturing paradise into a place that has\u2026 trolls\". He also declared, \"trolls are kinda fun\".",
      "Separately, Mr Musk had said he had \"no choice\" but to reduce the company's workforce because of financial losses.",
      "Lisa Jennings Young, former head of content design at X who worked there until 2022, says: \"I feel like we're all living through a vast social experiment [on humanity].\"",
      "It doesn't have a specified goal, she says. Instead, in her view, it is \"not a controlled social science experiment [but one] we're all a part of\". No one really knows what the final result could be, she argues.",
      "Some X users tell me that they have recently decided to migrate to other social media platforms, including Bluesky, which started in 2019 as an experimental \"de-centralised\" social media site created by former Twitter boss Jack Dorsey. It now has more than 20 million users.",
      "It is difficult to determine exactly how many real users have chosen to leave X - or indeed if it has grown.",
      "Elon Musk and X did not respond to the points raised in this article, nor to requests for an interview.",
      "X says that its priority is to protect and defend the user's voice and it has guidelines about hate, which say that users \"may not target others with abuse or harassment or encourage other people to do so\".",
      "An X spokesperson previously told the BBC: \"X has in place a range of policies and features to protect the conversation surrounding elections. We will label content that violates our synthetic and manipulated media policy, and remove accounts engaged in platform manipulation or other serious violations of our rules.\"",
      "The site also told the European Commission in November: \"[X] strives to be the town square of the internet by promoting and protecting freedom of expression.\"",
      "Social media meets political influence",
      "Since the 2024 US presidential election, X has cemented its place as the home of political updates about the new Trump administration.",
      "Mr Musk endorsed Trump as a candidate as far back as July. He has now been offered a government position, leading a new advisory team called the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge).",
      "Sam Freeman, a former Meta employee who now works as an expert in Trust and Safety for a company called Cinder, believes that this will have a broader effect on other social media bosses too. He predicts them \"needing to have a more personal relationship with the incoming administration\", particularly if they feel increasing pressure over regulation and online safety.",
      "Mark Zuckerberg, who founded Facebook (now Meta) and has since acquired Instagram, recently had dinner with Trump at his home in Mar-a-Lago.",
      "The President-elect had taken aim at Mr Zuckerberg on previously occasions, accusing his website and others of bias. \"Facebook, Google and Twitter, not to mention the Corrupt Media, are sooo on the side of the Radical Left Democrats,\" Trump once wrote.",
      "Could the dinner indicate a softening of relations? Certainly it suggests that Mr Zuckerberg considers that being at least somewhat in close proximity to Trump could be in his interest.",
      "So, it seems, does TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew, who was also reported to have met Trump at Mar-a-Lago as the social media company fights plans by US authorities to ban the app.",
      "The US government claims TikTok's parent company ByteDance has links to the Chinese state. Both TikTok and ByteDance deny this. The Supreme Court is due to hear legal arguments from TikTok in January.",
      "In the the UK, the Online Safety Act will soon be enforced, under which companies will have to make commitments to the regulator Ofcom about how they will tackle illegal content and posts that are harmful to children. In Australia, politicians have gone a step further and approved plans to ban children under 16 from using social media.",
      "Ultimately though - given how many social media giants are based in the US - it is the approach of the American government and president that could have the greatest impact.",
      "The France rape trial throws up a difficult question about porn fantasies - and male desire",

      "The question that remains is what Trump's views on this really are - and whether he will demand accountability in a different way from these sites in the future, or not at all.",

    "published": "Thu, 26 Dec 2024 01:44:28 GMT",
    "summary": "How a very popular puzzle that was first invented 50 years ago may have certain wellbeing benefits",
    "story": [
      "On a cold day in November, hundreds of people flocked to an arena in Coventry, which has previously hosted gigs by Oasis, Rihanna, and Harry Styles, for an event of a very different kind.",
      "The 500 people who turned out - some from as far afield as Mongolia and Canada - were taking part in an activity less known for drawing in crowds: the Rubik's UK Championship in \"speedcubing,\" or racing to solve puzzle cubes at terrific speed.",
      "Rows of tables were laid out in the arena and 15 events took place over three days. Some involved solving the puzzle one-handed, others while blindfolded. Teenager James Alonso won the tournament's biggest event - solving the classic 3x3 cube at speed with an average of 6.3 seconds.",
      "Speedcubing has been popular since the 1980s and the world record for a single solve in that event is currently held by Max Park from the US, with a time of just 3.13 seconds. It is a far cry from the initial speed of Ern\u0151 Rubik, an architecture professor, who invented the Rubik's Cube in 1974 and took around a month to solve it.",
      "Flash forward to today and an estimated 412,000 people have taken part in speedcubing competitions worldwide. The popularity has increased too, with reported global sales of Rubik's Cube products recorded as $86.6m (\u00a367m) in 2023, up 13.5% on 2022. (The brand was acquired by a Canadian multinational toy company Spin Master in 2021.)",
      "That's not counting the sales of other types of puzzle cubes by different brands. Some are wooden, others electronic with built-in bluetooth, then there are those with all manner of colourful designs.",
      "But now, scientists have lauded speedcubing, in particular, as not only a popular hobby but one that could have wellbeing benefits too.",
      "\"Speedcubing offers a unique combination of cognitive challenge, [alongside] social connection, and personal achievement that contributes to happiness\", says Polina Beloborodova, research associate at the University of Wisconsin-Madison's Centre for Healthy Minds.",
      "And this is said to run far deeper than a simple momentary rush.",
      "Cubing and happiness: what experts say",
      "\"Speedcubing satisfies the basic psychological need for competence, the feeling of effectiveness and mastery,\" explains Dr Beloborodova. It involves a number of factors including, problem-solving, memory, spatial reasoning and motor coordination.",
      "But solving the cube may also elicit happiness because it taps into other emotions, according to Dr Julia Christensen, a senior research fellow at the Max Planck Institute for Empirical Aesthetics in Germany. \"Awe, beauty, being moved, all these are aesthetic emotions, and experiencing them gives us an extreme sense of happiness,\" she says.",
      "\"For example, when a pattern is the right pattern, when a move is particularly amazing on the cube, these aesthetic emotions can give transformative experiences.\"",
      "Some speedcubers have described the state of mind that the activity can bring as a sense of \"flow\".",
      "\"This state is achieved when the activity's difficulty matches your skill level, distractions are minimal, the goals are clear, and feedback is immediate \u2014 all of which are characteristics of speedcubing,\" says Dr Beloborodova.",
      "Flow can feel \"almost meditative\", according to Ian Scheffler, author of Cracking the Cube, who has experienced this first-hand. \"You enter this state where you are kind of thinking and not thinking at the same time - you are reacting to what the cube is giving you, but in almost an instinctual way.",
      "\"It's a kind of mindfulness that's deeply rewarding\u2026 a peaceful, calm state where you're completely in tune with every twist of the puzzle.\"",
      "There is good reason to seek a flow state regularly, according to Dr Christensen. \"Science shows that people who regularly experience flow have a better mental health, possibly better physical health, and are more in tune.",
      "\"When we repeat movements they become logged or encoded from explicit, effort-full memory systems, and pass into implicit, less effort-full, and procedural memory systems,\" she continues.",
      "Nicholas Archer, a 17-year-old speedcuber from West Yorkshire, who won the one-handed competition in this year's UK Championship with an average time of 8.69 seconds, says that he has experienced this. \"When I'm solving the cube, I'm certainly not having to think too much about what I'm doing. It's all automatic.\"",
      "Speedcubing social benefits",
      "\"Speedcubing or solving a cube on your own may increase your happiness,\" says Dr Adil Khan, a reader in neuroscience at King's College London (KCL) - but when combined with the social aspect, any benefits may be greater.",
      "\"Since speedcubing is a social phenomenon, perhaps the social aspect combines with the puzzle solving to deliver a deeply satisfying experience.\"",
      "Jan Hammer started speedcubing at the age of 44, after being introduced to it by his 13-year-old daughter. He has since solved the cube around 10,000 times but does not think he would have maintained this level of enthusiasm had he been speedcubing alone.",
      "\"The fact that I can do this with my daughter and that we cheer for each other is wonderful. Additionally, being part of the cube community has become a huge motivation.\"",
      "Competitions tend to have more children and teenagers - it is not uncommon for competitors to be as young as six. The activity is also significantly more popular with males. The World Cube Association reports that 221,117 men have competed at their events, compared with 24,311 women.",
      "Regardless of demographic, \"for those who view speedcubing as a significant part of their life - such as participants in tournaments - it can offer eudemonic happiness, fostering a sense of purpose and meaning through dedication, accomplishment, and community of like-minded people,\" argues Dr Beloborodova.",
      "Psychologists differentiate between two aspects of happiness: \"hedonic wellbeing,\" related to emotional experiences, and \"eudemonic wellbeing,\" which concerns meaning and purpose in life.",
      "\"Both are essential for overall happiness and speedcubing can contribute to both types of wellbeing,\" she says. All of this \"contributes to better mental health\".",
      "Puzzles and the brain: the science",
      "The effects of speedcubing on the brain and cognitive function are, however, less clear.",
      "While solving a cube, the brain is trying out different moves, asking \"what might happen if I move the cube in this way?\" explains Dr Toby Wise, senior research fellow in neuroimaging at King's College London.",
      "\"Your brain stores a memory trace for different configurations of the cube, and it can run through different configurations to predict which will have the best outcome.\"",
      "However it doesn't necessarily create long-term benefits, like improvements to memory function. This is because, as Dr Khan explains, the brain is not like a muscle that needs to be flexed to make it grow.",
      "For many years it has been suggested by some that solving puzzles, whether Sudoku or crosswords, can have a hand in slowing cognitive decline or dementia. However this is not necessarily the case.",
      "A study undertaken by Aberdeen Royal Infirmary and the University of Aberdeen, and published in the BMJ in 2018, found that people who regularly do intellectual activities throughout life have higher mental abilities, providing a \"higher cognitive point\" from which to decline, but that they do not decline any slower.",
      "\"Solving puzzles does not improve your brain power in much other than the puzzle itself,\" argues Dr Khan. \"And almost certainly does not prevent age-related decline in brain power.\"",
      "'The school system is broken': Why more parents are home-educating their children",
      "How the internet normalised extreme porn - and shaped male desire",
      "What now for Syria\u2019s \u00a34.5bn illegal drug empire",
      "One further benefit of speedcubing, according to regular players, is its sense of escapism from frenzied modern life.",
      "\"Having a clear goal, something that you can actually realise, is something that we don't necessarily have in everyday life, and that appeases our brain,\" says Dr Christensen.",
      "This perhaps explains why the cube is so popular in an age with myriad computer games and technological activities to choose from. As Mr Hammer puts it: \"When I pick up the cube, I become more alert and focused.\"",
      "He uses it in the workplace too. \"It can help me enter the next meeting with a more structured perspective,\" he says.",
      "Mr Scheffler agrees: \"The process of taking the cube from this chaotic, disordered state, which is always different because there's so many permutations of the puzzle, to the same ordered state is fundamentally something that humans want to be doing.",
      "\"There's a fundamental human need to make order out of disorder, because the universe is a very chaotic place, and most things are not ordered.\"",

    "summary": "The supermarket has been advertising cheap deals, including 10p vegetables, ahead of Christmas.",
    "story": [
      "Morrisons has apologised after tech problems affected discounts and online deliveries across the UK.",
      "Customers were unable to redeem discounts on their loyalty cards and had Christmas deliveries postponed at short notice on Monday morning.",
      "Morrisons said it was investigating the issues in store and online but did not give any information on the causes of the outage. All stores were back to normal by Monday evening, the BBC understands.",
      "In response to the problems at the tills, the supermarket chain has applied some loyalty discounts to all customers.",
      "It is making its top 100 More Card prices the regular price for all shoppers, even if they are not members of the loyalty scheme.",
      "More Card customers will also get an extra 10% off their entire shop \"as an apology\".",
      "Both measures will be in place until the end of Tuesday, Morrisons said.",
      "Customers who shopped on Monday before the 10% discount was introduced can go back in store to redeem the discount, Morrisons said.",
      "Some home deliveries may arrive late, and click and collect customers should wait for an email before going to stores, the company said.",
      "But some customers have told the BBC their online orders - containing their Christmas Day food - have been cancelled altogether.",
      "And others have told the BBC they have experienced similar issues before today, including over the weekend and \"in the last couple of months.\"",
      "'Staff were getting upset'",
      "One customer said he missed out on about \u00a320 of discounts.",
      "\"I added everything up as I went around the shop and it came to \u00a370, which with all my card discounts and vouchers should have cost me nothing at the checkout,\" Steve Weatherby, from Huddersfield, told BBC News.",
      "\"But it came up as \u00a390. None of the discounts and offers around the store, like 50p off, had been applied.",
      "\"So I had to pay it as I was shopping for Christmas lunch and things we needed.\"",
      "He added: \"The staff were getting upset as they weren't aware of what was happening, and it's not their fault.\"",
      "Another customer told the BBC her online order was cancelled on Monday morning.",
      "\"I booked it ages ago, when the delivery slots first came out for Christmas,\" said Moira Gray, from Northumberland.",
      "Unable to leave the house due to illness, she added she was \"really stressed,\" as her order included turkey and trifle for Christmas Day.",
      "\"[Morrisons] said they couldn't do anything... they also said their systems were down,\" she added, saying that Morrisons offered a \u00a310 goodwill voucher.",
      "Another customer, Lorraine Calvo from Northumberland, had her delivery cancelled in the morning and said Morrisons told her this was due to a problem with the IT system.",
      "\"I saw the email at 8.30am and was a bit shocked because they texted me last night confirming the delivery,\" she told the BBC.",
      "\"It was all my weekly shop to get me through Christmas, and cat food and everything.\"",
      "Since this story was published online, Morrisons got in touch with Ms Gray and Ms Calvo, and promised to deliver their orders on Monday, free of charge.",
      "It also disputed the claims that these cancellations were due to the main systems issue, telling the BBC that they were separate problems which were dealt with by customer services.",
      "But it did say in a statement: \"If for any reason there are isolated cancellations, our team will be in touch directly to resolve them.\"",
      "'Stuff of nightmares'",
      "Morrisons had been advertising large discounts ahead of Christmas, including some vegetables for 10p.",
      "\"There's never a good time for a tech glitch, but for it to happen on what is expected to be the busiest day of the year is the stuff of nightmares,\" says retail analyst Natalie Berg.",
      "\"This will further erode shopper trust and impact profitability.\"",
      "Monday was predicted to be the busiest shopping day for supermarkets this year, according to retail analysts Kantar.",
      "Sales at supermarkets are expected to reach over \u00a313bn for the first December ever.",
      "Morrisons is the fifth-largest market supermarket in the UK, according to Kantar, with 8.6% of the grocery market in the 12 weeks leading up to 1 December 2024.",
      "\"Retailers are putting more and more deals through their loyalty cards and if shoppers can't access them, they will feel cheated,\" said Ronan Hegarty, news editor of trade publication The Grocer.",
      "The Morrisons website was also down for a period in the morning, with error messages on some pages suggesting invalid or late responses from servers."

      "It is unclear whether the fatalities were civilians or Houthi rebels.",

      "\"We will need to wait for the damage to the airport to be repaired before we can leave,\" Dr Tedros added.",
      "UN Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres called the strikes \"especially alarming\".",

    "published": "Thu, 26 Dec 2024 20:25:46 GMT",
    "summary": "The Russia-bound passenger plane went down in Kazakhstan with the loss of 38 lives.",
    "story": [
      "The Russian government has cautioned against promoting \"hypotheses\" about the cause of the crash of a Russia-bound passenger plane that killed 38 people in Kazakhstan on Wednesday.",
      "Some aviation experts suggested that the Azerbaijan Airlines plane had been hit by air defence systems over the Russian republic of Chechnya and pro-government media in Azerbaijan quote officials as saying a Russian missile was responsible.",
      "Before it went down near the Kazakh city of Aktau, the plane was diverted across the Caspian Sea, from its destination in Chechnya to western Kazakhstan.",
      "Twenty nine of the 67 people on board survived. Azerbaijan held a national day of mourning on Thursday for the victims of the crash.",
      "\"This is a great tragedy that has become a tremendous sorrow for the Azerbaijani people,\" President Ilham Aliyev said on Thursday.",
      "In Moscow, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: \"It would be wrong to put forward any hypotheses before the investigation's conclusions. We, of course, will not do this, and no-one should do this. We need to wait until the investigation is completed.\"",
      "The chief prosecutor in Kazakhstan said later that the investigation had not yet come to any conclusions.",
      "But some commentators in Azerbaijani media say that Azerbaijan expects Russia to admit shooting down the plane.",
      "Several TV channels, which are under strict control of the Azerbaijani government, on Thursday started broadcasting interviews with experts who have openly spoken about the possibility that Russia was responsible.",
      "AnewZ channel said a preliminary investigation had concluded that the plane had been hit by shrapnel from a surface-to-air missile from Russia's Pantsir-S defence system.",
      "Another pro-government website, Caliber, quoted government sources as saying that no-one was claiming the plane had come under attack intentionally, but that Baku expected an apology from Russia.",
      "When asked about the reports, the chief prosecutor's office in Baku told the BBC that every version was being investigated.",
      "As they try to avoid annoying Russian President Vladimir Putin, it will be very difficult for the Azerbaijani government to blame Russia directly unless it admits to shooting down the plane.",
      "It seems that the investigation committee comprised of Azerbaijani and Kazakh officials possibly already have evidence for this, but they are waiting for Russia to announce it first.",
      "Moscow will then have to answer questions such as why Russia did not close its airspace if there was military activity, and why it did not let the plane land as soon as possible - instead of directing it towards Aktau for landing.",
      "The Embraer 190 aircraft took off from the Azerbaijani capital Baku on Wednesday morning. It was due to fly to Grozny in Chechnya but it was diverted because of fog, the airline said.",
      "A surviving passenger told Russian TV he believed the pilot had tried twice to land in dense fog over Grozny before \"the third time, something exploded... some of the aircraft skin had blown out\".",
      "The plane was redirected to Aktau airport, some 450km (280 miles) to the east. Footage shows the aircraft heading towards the ground at high speed 3km (1.9 miles) short of the runway, before bursting into flames as it lands.",
      "Kazakh authorities have recovered the flight data recorder and an investigation is under way. Shortly after the crash, reports from Russian state-controlled TV said the most likely cause was a strike from a flock of birds.",
      "But that kind of collision typically results in the plane gliding towards the nearest airfield, aviation analyst Richard Aboulafia told Reuters news agency. \"You can lose control of the plane, but you don't fly wildly off course as a consequence,\" he said.",
      "Justin Crump of risk advisory company Sibylline said the pattern of damage inside and outside the plane indicated that Russian air defence active in Grozny may have caused the crash.",
      "\"It looks very much like the detonation of an air defence missile to the rear and to the left of the aircraft, if you look at the pattern of shrapnel that we see,\" he told BBC Radio 4.",
      "Chechnya has already been hit by Ukrainian drone strikes this month and authorities in neighbouring Ingushetia said the Russian region had been targeted for the first time since the war in Ukraine began.",
      "A shopping centre was hit when a drone was shot down in nearby North Ossetia, killing one woman, reports said.",
      "Those on board were mostly Azerbaijani nationals, but there were also some passengers from Russia, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan.",
      "Video footage showed survivors crawling out of the wreckage, some with visible injuries.",
      "The injured were taken to hospital. On Thursday, Azerbaijan's Azertac news agency said seven were in a good enough condition to fly back to Baku.",
      "Azerbaijan Airlines told reporters that the plane had been fully serviced in October and had no technical malfunctions.",
      "Embraer, a Brazilian manufacturer and a smaller rival to Boeing and Airbus, has a strong safety record."

    "published": "Fri, 27 Dec 2024 00:11:08 GMT",
    "summary": "New users? New algorithms? Or something else going on behind the scenes? The story behind the new changes on the social media site",
    "story": [
      "Billionaire Elon Musk has hailed Twitter as a bastion for freedom of expression ever since he acquired the social media site two years ago. But over the course of 2024, X, as it is now called, has evolved from what felt like a communal town square into a polarised hub where views and posts seem even more controversial.",
      "\u200b\u200bCertain profiles that have shared misleading takes on politics and the news, some of which have been accused of triggering hate, have recently shot to prominence.",
      "All of this matters because X might not have as many users as some other major social media sites, but it does seem to have a significant impact on political discussions. Not only is it a place where certain high-profile politicians, governments and police forces share statements and views - but now its owner Mr Musk has directly aligned himself with Donald Trump, a relationship that could redefine how the bosses of other social media giants deal with the next US President.",
      "So, what's behind this new wave of change? Has there been a shift in the demographic of people using X over the last year - or could it be the result of deliberate decisions made by those in charge?",
      "Rise of the Twitter 'media'",
      "Two months ago, Inevitable West didn't exist on X. Now the profile, which calls itself a \"Defender of Western values and culture\", has amassed 131,600 followers (a number that is rapidly growing). It is racking up around 30 million views each day collectively among all of its posts, according to its creator. Mr Musk has even responded to Inevitable West's posts on X.",
      "Their recent posts, which often feature news alert-style captions, include a faked video showing Trump telling the British Prime Minister he is going to \"invade your country and make Britain Great Again\".",
      "There have also been several posts in support of far-right activist Tommy Robinson, as well as some debunked claims about the farmer's protests in the UK and a knife attack in Southport, in which three children were killed during a Taylor Swift-themed dance workshop.",
      "\u200b\u200bInevitable West denies accusations of pushing disinformation and inciting abuse or violence. \"The purpose of my X account is to be the voice for the silent majority of the Western world,\" its creator told me. They refused to share their identity with me when we corresponded, but claim to be \"Gen Z\" and \"not Russian\".",
      "\"Uncensored information and opinions will inevitably lead [to] the US and entire West and Europe moving further right, [which is] proven by Donald Trump getting elected and surges in Europe's far right,\" they argued. \"Globally, it would mean corrupt politicians and leaders would get found out.\"",
      "They appear to see the rise of their account as the \"death\" of what they would call the \"MSM\" or Mainstream Media. That's perhaps no surprise given that, following the US Election, Mr Musk himself told X users: \"You are the Media Now\".",
      "From blue ticks to likes: Changes at X",
      "When Mr Musk first acquired Twitter, he emphasised the need to house all political opinions and push back against censorship by social media companies and governments.",
      "Changes - including mass layoffs and alterations to moderation policies on issues like political misinformation - started immediately.",
      "There have also been various alterations to the nature of feeds including the creation of two separate sections: \"Following\", which features accounts you follow, and \"For You\", which is algorithmically curated, as on TikTok.",
      "Over the course of 2024, however, there have been another wave of alterations that appear to have transformed it further. The block function has been changed, meaning that if you block an account you won't be protected from that profile viewing what you post. Likes, meanwhile, have been made private.",
      "The site still features crowd-sourced community notes used to factcheck or rebuff what posts say - and users are able to pay for blue ticks, which were previously given free of charge as a sign authenticating that the person was who they said they were.",
      "What to X-pect from Elon Musk in 2025",
      "What to X-pect from Elon Musk in 2025",
      "Now, though, it is necessary to pay to subscribe to X Premium to receive a checkmark. (There are three tiers of subscription - in the UK, the Premium Tier currently costs around \u00a310 a month).",
      "Premium profiles are entitled to more privileges and prominence - and can make money from the engagement they get from other checkmarked profiles. From October, X changed its rules so that instead of basing revenue for individual accounts around ads, it now takes into account likes, shares and comments from other Premium accounts.",
      "Of course other social media sites allow users to make money from posts and let them share sponsored content - this is not uncommon - but most major sites have rules that allow them to de-monetise or suspend profiles that post misinformation.",
      "X does not have rules to de-monetise accounts over these kinds of posts, although it does allow users to add community notes to misleading or false tweets. And it does not allow \"misleading media\" like manipulated or synthetic videos that \"may result in widespread confusion on public issues, impact public safety or cause serious harm\".",
      "According to Inevitable West, X can now become a job. They told me when they were posting around seven times a day they could accrue a minimum of \"$2,500 a month\".",
      "They say they know of another account making \"$25,000\" each month - that account allegedly has 500,000 followers and posts \"roughly 30\" times a day.",
      "Has the algorithm changed?",
      "Change can sometimes come about when a website alters the algorithms (or recommendation systems) in some way, for example in order to boost and benefit certain posts. What\u2019s unclear is whether or not that may be the case here?",
      "Certainly, I've observed a difference in the variety of posts recommended on the \"For You\" feed compared with that a year ago.",
      "This is something I analysed through an \"Undercover Voter project\", in which I created and ran social media accounts belonging to more than 20 fictional characters, based in the US and UK, which reflect views from across the political spectrum.",
      "These characters have profiles on the main sites including X, allowing me to interrogate what different accounts were recommended on social media. The accounts are private and do not message real people or have friends.",
      "Regardless of the different political views their accounts express, I observed that in the last six months of this year their feeds have become dominated by divisive posts, and tend to feature more in support of Trump or in opposition to politicians and people across the world who are not seen to be aligned with the US president elect.",
      "However, all of this seems to be the consequence of the environment and the various changes to the wider site, rather than solely a simple tweak to the algorithm.",
      "Andrew Kaung, who was previously an analyst on user safety at TikTok and has also worked at Meta, has spent years observing how these recommendation systems can be updated and changed. \"What we've seen on X is not just about algorithms changing, it is also informed by the lack of safety mechanisms in the name of free speech,\" he says.",
      "Nina Jankowicz is former Executive Director on the Disinformation Governance Board of the United States, which was set up in 2022 to advise the Department of Homeland Security on issues including Russian disinformation and later disbanded after public backlash over concerns including around freedom of expression and transparency. She argues that X's algorithms now \"privilege divisive and misleading rhetoric\" and suggests that users who post less controversial content have found a reduction in the views.",
      "\"The consequence is that the platform that touts itself as a public square is an extraordinarily artificial environment, a true black mirror of the most worrying parts of human nature.\"",
      "The unintended influencers",
      "I messaged dozens of other large accounts, who describe the growing influence they're able to have on the site, often unexpectedly.",
      "\"I never really intended to become an influencer,\" admits one profile called Andi, who says he's based in New York. \"But I figure since I have this platform I should try to use it to advance my own causes.\"",
      "He describes how he shared a meme of squirrel - after learning about a squirrel that was euthanised over concerns it could have rabies - which now has 45 million views. Andi compares his reach to that of popular podcaster Joe Rogan, who has 14.5 million followers on X.",
      "\"But I am no Joe Rogan, so it's really special that something I post can get almost as much viewership.\"",
      "Andi and other X accounts I've corresponded with believe that the changes to X are a good thing, as they now have a reach they could have never anticipated.",
      "Allegations of moderation bias",
      "\u200b\u200bEarlier this month, an attack at a German market, which killed five people and injured more than 200, was widely debated on X. Much of the discussion centred around the suspect, a German resident originally from Saudi Arabia. German prosecutors have said the investigation is ongoing, but suggested one potential motive for the attack \"could have been disgruntlement with the way Saudi Arabian refugees are treated in Germany\".",
      "Inevitable West was among those who commented: \"Raid the mosques. Ban the Quran. Carry out mass deportations. Our patience has officially expired.\"",
      "\u200b\u200bThe account has been accused of inflaming hate with posts about issues including immigration and religion. Other users said this could incite violence. But the profile responded by saying that they were \"actually inciting safety\".",
      "When questioned on this, Inevitable West told me that they'd say the same about other religions. Separately, they also said they would never delete their own posts - even when they turn out to be untrue.",
      "Meanwhile, their content is being seen by feeds around the world.",
      "Allegations of bias in moderation methods have long been levelled at Twitter, both before and since Mr Musk acquired the company, alongside questions about whether the site previously limited freedom of expression.",
      "I spoke to Twitter insiders about this for a Panorama investigation which aired in 2023, and they told me that, in their view, the company was going to struggle to protect users from trolling, state-coordinated disinformation and child sexual exploitation, putting this down to, among other things, mass layoffs.",
      "At the time, X did not respond to the points raised. Afterwards, Mr Musk tweeted a BBC article about the Panorama episode with the caption: \"Sorry for turning Twitter from nurturing paradise into a place that has\u2026 trolls\". He also declared, \"trolls are kinda fun\".",
      "Separately, Mr Musk had said he had \"no choice\" but to reduce the company's workforce because of financial losses.",
      "Lisa Jennings Young, former head of content design at X who worked there until 2022, says: \"I feel like we're all living through a vast social experiment [on humanity].\"",
      "It doesn't have a specified goal, she says. Instead, in her view, it is \"not a controlled social science experiment [but one] we're all a part of\". No one really knows what the final result could be, she argues.",
      "Some X users tell me that they have recently decided to migrate to other social media platforms, including Bluesky, which started in 2019 as an experimental \"de-centralised\" social media site created by former Twitter boss Jack Dorsey. It now has more than 20 million users.",
      "It is difficult to determine exactly how many real users have chosen to leave X - or indeed if it has grown.",
      "Elon Musk and X did not respond to the points raised in this article, nor to requests for an interview.",
      "X says that its priority is to protect and defend the user's voice and it has guidelines about hate, which say that users \"may not target others with abuse or harassment or encourage other people to do so\".",
      "An X spokesperson previously told the BBC: \"X has in place a range of policies and features to protect the conversation surrounding elections. We will label content that violates our synthetic and manipulated media policy, and remove accounts engaged in platform manipulation or other serious violations of our rules.\"",
      "The site also told the European Commission in November: \"[X] strives to be the town square of the internet by promoting and protecting freedom of expression.\"",
      "Social media meets political influence",

    "title": "Manmohan Singh, Indian ex-PM and architect of economic reform, dies at 92",
    "published": "Thu, 26 Dec 2024 17:49:00 GMT",
    "summary": "Manmohan Singh was instrumental in bringing India out of economic and nuclear isolation.",
    "story": [
      "Former Indian prime minister Manmohan Singh has died at the age of 92.",
      "Singh was one of India's longest-serving prime ministers and he was considered the architect of key liberalising economic reforms, as premier from 2004-2014 and before that as finance minister.",
      "He had been admitted to a hospital in the capital Delhi after his health condition deteriorated, reports say.",
      "Among those who paid tribute to Singh on Thursday were Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who wrote on social media that \"India mourns the loss of one of its most distinguished leaders\".",
      "Modi said that Singh's \"wisdom and humility were always visible\" during their interactions and that he had \"made extensive efforts to improve people's lives\" during his time as prime minister.",
      "Priyanka Gandhi, the daughter of former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi and a Congress party member, said that Singh was \"genuinely egalitarian, wise, strong-willed and courageous until the end\".",
      "Her brother Rahul, who leads Congress, said he had \"lost a mentor and guide\".",
      "Singh was the first Indian leader since Jawaharlal Nehru to be re-elected after serving a full first term, and the first Sikh to hold the country's top post. He made a public apology in parliament for the 1984 riots in which some 3,000 Sikhs were killed.",
      "But his second term in office was marred by a string of corruption allegations that dogged his administration. The scandals, many say, were partially responsible for his Congress party's crushing defeat in the 2014 general election.",
      "Singh was born on 26 September 1932, in a desolate village in the Punjab province of undivided India, which lacked both water and electricity.",
      "After attending Panjab University he took a master's degree at the University of Cambridge and then a DPhil at Oxford.",
      "While studying at Cambridge, the lack of funds bothered Singh, his daughter, Daman Singh, wrote in a book on her parents.",
      "\"His tuition and living expenses came to about \u00a3600 a year. The Panjab University scholarship gave him about \u00a3160. For the rest he had to depend on his father. Manmohan was careful to live very stingily. Subsidised meals in the dining hall were relatively cheap at two shillings sixpence.\"",
      "Daman Singh remembered her father as \"completely helpless about the house and could neither boil an egg, nor switch on the television\".",
      "Consensus builder",
      "Singh rose to political prominence as India's finance minister in 1991, taking over as the country was plunging into bankruptcy.",
      "His unexpected appointment capped a long and illustrious career as an academic and civil servant - he served as an economic adviser to the government, and became the governor of India's central bank.",
      "In his maiden speech as finance minister he famously quoted Victor Hugo, saying that \"no power on Earth can stop an idea whose time has come\".",
      "That served as a launchpad for an ambitious and unprecedented economic reform programme: he cut taxes, devalued the rupee, privatised state-run companies and encouraged foreign investment.",
      "The economy revived, industry picked up, inflation was checked and growth rates remained consistently high in the 1990s.",
      "'Accidental PM'",
      "Manmohan Singh was a man acutely aware of his lack of a political base. \"It is nice to be a statesman, but in order to be a statesman in a democracy you first have to win elections,\" he once said.",
      "When he tried to win election to India's lower house in 1999, he was defeated. He sat instead in the upper house, chosen by his own Congress party.",
      "The same happened in 2004, when Singh was first appointed prime minister after Congress president Sonia Gandhi turned down the post - apparently to protect the party from damaging attacks over her Italian origins. Critics however alleged that Sonia Gandhi was the real source of power while he was prime minister, and that he was never truly in charge.",
      "The biggest triumph during his first five-year term was to bring India out of nuclear isolation by signing a landmark deal securing access to American nuclear technology.",
      "But the deal came at a price - the government's Communist allies withdrew support after protesting against it, and Congress had to make up lost numbers by enlisting the support of another party amid charges of vote-buying.",
      "A consensus builder, Singh presided over a coalition of sometimes difficult, assertive and potentially unruly regional coalition allies and supporters.",
      "Although he earned respect for his integrity and intelligence, he also had a reputation for being soft and indecisive. Some critics claimed that the pace of reform slowed and he failed to achieve the same momentum he had while finance minister.",
      "When Singh guided Congress to a second, decisive election victory in 2009, he vowed that the party would \"rise to the occasion\".",
      "But the gloss soon began to wear off and his second term was in the news mostly for all the wrong reasons: several scandals involving his cabinet ministers which allegedly cost the country billions of dollars, a parliament stalled by the opposition, and a huge policy paralysis that resulted in a serious economic downturn.",
      "LK Advani, a senior leader in the rival BJP party, called Singh India's \"weakest prime minister\".",
      "Manmohan Singh defended his record, saying his government had worked with \"utmost commitment and dedication for the country and the welfare of its people\".",
      "Pragmatic foreign policy",
      "Singh adopted the pragmatic foreign policies pursued by his two predecessors.",
      "He continued the peace process with Pakistan - though this process was hampered by attacks blamed on Pakistani militants, culminating in the Mumbai gun and bomb attack of November 2008.",
      "He tried to end the border dispute with China, brokering a deal to reopen the Nathu La pass into Tibet which had been closed for more than 40 years.",
      "Singh increased financial support for Afghanistan and became the first Indian leader to visit the country for nearly 30 years.",
      "He also angered many opposition politicians by appearing to end relations with India's old ally, Iran.",
      "A low-profile leader",
      "A studious former academic and bureaucrat, he was known for being self-effacing and always kept a low profile. His social media account was noted mostly for dull entries and had a limited number of followers.",
      "A man of few words, his calm demeanour nevertheless won him many admirers.",
      "Responding to questions on a coal scandal involving the illegal allocation of licences worth billions of dollars, he defended his silence on the issue by saying it was \"better than thousands of answers\".",
      "In 2015 he was summoned to appear in court to answer allegations of criminal conspiracy, breach of trust and corruption related offences. An upset Singh told reporters that he was \"open for legal scrutiny\" and that the \"truth will prevail\".",
      "After his time as premier, Singh remained deeply engaged with the issues of the day as a senior leader of the main opposition Congress party despite his advancing age.",
      "In August 2020, he told the BBC in a rare interview that India needed to take three steps \"immediately\" to stem the economic damage of the coronavirus pandemic, which had sent the country's economy into a recession.",
      "The government needed to provide direct cash assistance to people, make capital available for businesses, and fix the financial sector, he said.",
      "History will remember Singh for bringing India out of economic and nuclear isolation, although some historians may suggest he should have retired earlier.",
      "\"I honestly believe that history will be kinder to me than the contemporary media, or for that matter, the opposition parties in parliament,\" he told an interviewer in 2014.",
      "Singh is survived by his wife and three daughters."

    "summary": "The motion comes less than two weeks after parliament voted to impeach President Yoon Suk Yeol.",
    "story": [
      "South Korea's opposition lawmakers have filed a motion to impeach the country's prime minister and acting leader Han Duck-soo, less than two weeks after parliament voted to impeach President Yoon Suk Yeol.",
      "This comes after Han refused to appoint constitutional court judges nominated by the main opposition Democratic Party (DP).",
      "\"Han has revealed himself to be an acting insurrectionist, not an acting president\", DP's floor leader Park Chan-dae said on Thursday.",
      "The opposition has also accused Han of aiding Yoon's martial law attempt on 3 Dec. Han earlier apologised for failing to block it.",
      "Han also vetoed several opposition-led bills, including one that proposed a special investigation into Yoon's short-lived martial law declaration.",
      "The impeachment motion is expected to be put to a vote in the next 24 to 72 hours.",
      "For it to succeed, 151 out of 300 MPs must vote for it.",
      "The DP currently holds 170 of the 300 seats in parliament. The opposition bloc together holds 192 seats.",
      "Opposition parties had been hoping Han would not stand in their way while acting as the country's caretaker president, and that he would allow bills to pass.",
      "But instead he has held firm, deepening the political strife.",
      "On Tuesday, Han concluded a cabinet meeting without reviewing the two opposition-sponsored bills that called for special counsel investigations into the martial law declaration and corruption allegations involving first lady Kim Keon Hee.",
      "He said he did not put them on the agenda so as to give the ruling and opposition parties more time to reach a compromise.",
      "But DP's floor leader Park Chan-dae slammed him for \"buying time and prolonging the insurrection\".",
      "\"We've clearly warned that it's totally up to Prime Minister Han Duck-soo whether he would go down in history as a disgraceful figure, as a puppet of rebellion plot leader Yoon Suk Yeol, or a public servant that has faithfully carried out the orders by the public,\" Park said in a televised party meeting.",
      "And on Thursday, Han said he would not appoint the three judges the opposition-dominated National Assembly had nominated to the constitutional court - which is deliberating whether Yoon should be impeached - unless the rival parties reach a consensus.",
      "To this, Park said \"it has become clear that Han Duck-soo is neither qualified nor willing to defend the constitution\", adding that the opposition would \"immediately\" table the impeachment bill.",
      "Han's ruling People Power Party said the opposition's threats have interfered with Han's \"legitimate exercise of authority\", while a senior official at the prime minister's office criticised the threats as \"extremely regrettable\".",
      "Han stepped in as caretaker president after Yoon was ousted from office earlier this month. If lawmakers vote for Han to be impeached, finance minister Choi Sang-mok will be next in line.",
      "This latest development in the country's political turmoil comes as Seoul Constitutional Court is deliberating on whether Yoon should be permanently barred from office.",
      "The court is expected to hold its first public hearing later this week.",
      "It is unclear if Yoon himself will take the stand during the hearings, but protesters have vowed to keep up their calls for Yoon's removal during court proceedings.",
      "Yoon is also under investigation for alleged insurrection over his failed attempt to put the country under martial law.",
      "He has refused to accept several summons delivered to him, and investigators have warned that they may issue an arrest warrant if he continues to be unresponsive.",

      "But for more than 50 years, the boom in watches allowed the family to make a good living.",

      "\"My father was a popular wristwatch repairer and his skill took him to many places. He taught me when I was young and I am proud to have followed his footsteps.\"",
      "Baba Bala started taking a close interest in understanding the intricacies of what the wheels and levers inside a watch do when he was 10 - and was delighted to discover that as he got older it became a good source of pocket money.",
      "\"When my fellow students were broke in secondary school, I had money to spend at the time because I was already repairing wristwatches.\"",
      "He remembers his skill even impressed one of his teachers: \"He had issues with some of his wristwatches and had taken them to several places and they couldn't do them. When he was told about me I was able to fix all three of the watches by next day.\"",

      "\"This is what I love doing, I consider myself a doctor for sick wristwatches - plus I am not getting any younger.\"",

      "A woman dances in the spotlight, the glittering tassels on her dress shivering and swaying in tandem with her moves.",
      "But it's her arms that catch the light; they wave, spin and whip through the air at breath-taking speed, almost like the blades of a fan.",
      "These are the opening visuals of a recently released web series on Amazon Prime Video called Waack Girls, a drama centred around six women who learn a new dance form to become their city's first all-female waacking crew.",
      "Not many know about the dance and so the women have to fight hard - against society and their families - to be taken seriously. But waacking ends up being the gift that keeps on giving.",
      "Directed by Sooni Taraporevala, the series has been released at a time when many Indian cities - big and small - are witnessing a renewed interest in waacking.",
      "\"I was fascinated by the dance style and the importance it gives to self-expression,\" says Taraporevala about why she made the series.",
      "Workshops and underground waacking jams - events where dancers battle it out with their moves - are mushrooming in several cities and international waacking legends are visiting the country to teach the dance.",
      "Recently, Archie Burnett, who was a club dancer in New York in the 1970s and 80s and is a respected figure in the waacking community, visited India for a jam.",
      "Dancers hope that the web series will give waacking more visibility in the country and show people that there's more to dance than classical forms, hip-hop and Bollywood.",
      "Waacking has a history steeped in the LGBTQ+ liberation movement and the freedom championed by disco music.",
      "The dance style emerged in the gay clubs of Los Angeles in the 1970s, when there was a lot of stigma surrounding homosexuality. Gay men used waacking to express themselves on the dance floor and push back against the hate and discrimination they experienced.",
      "Consequently, the dance style developed swift, sharp and forceful movements - much like how action heroes in comic books beat up their villains, accompanied by sound-effects like \"ka-pow\" and \"bam\".",
      "\"Waacking comes from the onomatopoeic word 'whack' and is reminiscent of [the effects] found in comic books,\" says Tejasvi Patil, a Mumbai-based dancer who has been waacking for more than a decade.",
      "The dance style also drew inspiration from the drama of Hollywood and its glamorous leading ladies. Dramatic poses, quick footwork and striking arm movements are characteristic of waacking but dancers have continued to add new moves to the repertoire of steps, as celebrating individuality and self-expression are at the heart of the form.",
      "And because of its core ethos, waacking continues to be a tool of empowerment and self-expression for India's LGBTQ+ community.",
      "\"In fact, many people explore their sexual identity through the dance style because it allows space for introspection and expression,\" says Ayushi Amrute, who has been waacking since 2012 and is a frequent host of Red Bull's Your House Is Waack - a waacking jam for dancers across the country.",
      "\"Another important factor is that the waacking community always strives to be a safe space, so that people feel comfortable expressing themselves,\" she adds.",
      "When Amrute was introduced to waacking by her dance teacher, the style was virtually unknown in India. Her teacher encouraged her to watch videos and reach out to dancers abroad to learn more about the style.",
      "\"We [the handful of Indian dancers who began waacking over a decade ago] learnt waacking the hard way; by doing our own research, learning about the history of the dance and connecting with dancers in countries where waacking was popular,\" says Amrute.",

    "published": "Wed, 25 Dec 2024 23:50:25 GMT",
    "summary": "A BBC reporter looks back to the day in 2004 when the tsunami hit while she was on the Andaman and Nicobar islands.",
    "story": [
      "Boxing Day, 2004.",
      "When the earthquake struck at 06:30 (01:00 GMT), I was on a ferry, headed towards Havelock \u2013 an island in the Indian archipelago of Andaman and Nicobar.",
      "Known for its silver sand and clear blue waters, the Radhanagar beach there had recently been crowned \"Asia's Best Beach\" by Time magazine.",
      "My best friend from college and her family had lived in Port Blair, the capital of the archipelago, for a decade and a half, but this was my first visit to the islands, where I had arrived on Christmas Eve.",
      "We had planned to spend three days in Havelock and in the morning we packed snacks and sandwiches, gathered excited children and headed out to catch the ferry from Phoenix Bay jetty in Port Blair.",
      "Not wanting to miss out on anything, I was standing on the front deck, looking around, when disaster struck.",
      "Just as we pulled out from the harbour, the boat lurched and suddenly the jetty next to where we had boarded crumpled and fell into the sea. It was followed by the watchtower and an electricity pole.",
      "It was an extraordinary sight. Dozens of people standing alongside me watched open-mouthed.",
      "Thankfully, the jetty was deserted at the time so there were no casualties. A boat was due to leave from there in half an hour but the travellers were yet to arrive.",
      "A member of the boat's crew told me it was an earthquake. At the time I didn't know, but the 9.1 magnitude quake was the third most powerful ever recorded in the world - and remains the biggest and most destructive in Asia.",
      "Occurring off the coast of northwest Sumatra under the Indian Ocean, it unleashed a devastating tsunami that killed an estimated 228,000 people across more than a dozen countries and caused massive damage in Indonesia, Sri Lanka, India, Maldives and Thailand.",
      "The Andaman and Nicobar islands, located just about 100km north of the epicentre, suffered extensive damage when a wall of water, as high as 15 metres (49 ft) in places, hit land just about 15 minutes later.",
      "The official death toll was put at 1,310 \u2013 but with more than 5,600 people missing and presumed dead, it's believed that more than 7,000 islanders perished.",
      "While on the boat, however, we were oblivious to the scale of destruction around us. Our mobile phones didn't work on the water and we only got snippets of information from the crew. We heard about damage in Sri Lanka, Thailand and Maldives \u2013 and the southern Indian coastal town of Nagapattinam.",
      "But there was no information about Andaman and Nicobar - a collection of hundreds of islands scattered around in the Bay of Bengal, located about 1,500km (915 miles) east of India's mainland.",
      "Only 38 of them were inhabited. They were home to 400,000 people, including six hunter-gatherer groups who had lived isolated from the outside world for thousands of years.",
      "The only way to get to the islands was by ferries but, as we later learnt, an estimated 94% of the jetties in the region were damaged.",
      "That was also the reason why, on 26 December 2004, we never made it to Havelock. The jetty there was damaged and under water, we were told.",
      "Watch Geeta Pandey speak about her experience here",
      "Watch Geeta Pandey speak about her experience here",
      "So the boat turned around and started on its return journey. For a while, there was speculation that we might not get clearance to dock at Port Blair for safety reasons and might have to spend the night at anchor.",
      "This made the passengers  \u2013 most of them tourists looking forward to sun and sand \u2013 anxious.",
      "After several hours of bobbing along in rough seas, we returned to Port Blair. Because Phoenix Bay had been closed following the morning's damage, we were taken to Chatham, another harbour in Port Blair. The jetty where we were dropped had huge, gaping holes in places.",
      "The signs of devastation were all around us as we headed home \u2013 buildings had turned into rubble, small upturned boats sat in the middle of the streets and roads had great gashes in them. Thousands of people had been turned homeless when the tidal wave flooded their homes in low-lying areas.",
      "I met a traumatised nine-year-old girl whose house was filled with water and she told me she had nearly drowned. A woman told me she had lost her entire life's possessions in the blink of an eye.",
      "Over the next three weeks, I reported extensively on the disaster and its effects on the population.",
      "It was the first time a tsunami had wreaked such havoc in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands and the scale of the tragedy was overwhelming.",
      "Salt water contaminated many sources of fresh water and destroyed large tracts of arable land. Getting vital supplies into the islands was tough with jetties unserviceable.",
      "The authorities mounted a huge relief and rescue effort. The army, navy and air force were deployed, but it took days before they could get to all the islands.",
      "Every day, navy and coast guard ships brought boatloads of people made homeless by the tsunami from other islands to Port Blair where schools and government buildings were turned into temporary shelters.",
      "They brought stories of devastation in their homelands. Many told me they had escaped with nothing but the clothes on their backs.",
      "One woman from Car Nicobar told me that when the earthquake struck, the ground started to spew foamy water at the same time as the waves came in from the sea.",
      "She and hundreds of others from her village had waited for rescuers without food or water for 48 hours. She said it was a \"miracle\" that she and her 20-day-old baby had survived.",
      "Port Blair was almost daily jolted by aftershocks, some of them strong enough to start rumours of fresh tsunamis, making scared people run to get to higher ground.",
      "A few days later, the Indian military flew journalists to Car Nicobar, a flat fertile island known for its enchanting beaches and also home to a large Indian air force colony.",
      "The killer tsunami had completely flattened the base. The water rose by 12 metres here and as most people slept, the ground was pulled away from under their feet. A hundred people died here. More than half were air force officers and their families.",
      "We visited Malacca and Kaakan villages on the island which also bore the brunt of nature's fury, forcing residents to take shelter in tents along the road. Among them were families torn apart by the tidal wave.",
      "A grief-stricken young couple told me they had managed to save their five-month-old baby, but their other children, aged seven and 12, were washed away.",
      "Surrounded by coconut palms on all sides, every house had turned into rubble. Among the personal belongings strewn about were clothes, textbooks, a child's shoe and a music keyboard.",
      "The only thing that stood - surprisingly intact - was a bust of the father of the Indian nation, Mahatma Gandhi, at a traffic roundabout.",
      "A senior army officer told us his team had recovered seven bodies that day and we watched their mass cremation from a distance.",
      "At the air force base, we watched as rescuers pulled a woman's body from the debris.",
      "An official said that for every body found in Car Nicobar, several had been swept away by the waves without leaving a trace.",
      "After all these years, I still sometimes think about the day I hopped on the ferry to go to Havelock.",
      "I wonder what would have happened if the tremors had come a few minutes earlier.",
      "And what would have happened if the wall of water had hit the shore while I waited on the jetty to board our ferry?",
      "On Boxing Day, 2004, I had a close call. Thousands who perished were not so lucky.",

    "published": "Thu, 26 Dec 2024 00:47:23 GMT",
    "summary": "A biodiversity hotspot has become the stomping ground of poachers.",
    "story": [
      "A biodiversity hotspot in a remote part of South Africa has become the hub of an illegal trade in protected plant species, with organised crime groups capitalising on overseas demand.",
      "\"They've not just stolen our land or our plants, they've stolen our heritage as well,\" a livestock farmer angrily tells the BBC, as she expresses dismay at the social and ecological crisis that the poaching has caused.",
      "Most of the plants in question are a variety known as succulents, named for their ability to hold water and survive in arid climates.",
      "Many of the world's succulent species are only found in the Succulent Karoo desert, which spans South Africa and Namibia.",
      "Succulent species range in size, shape and colour - some look like small multi-coloured buttons and some look like cacti, sprouting colourful flowers at certain times of the year.",
      "While these varieties can be cultivated in nurseries, global demand is also fuelling the poaching of these plants from the wild which are then smuggled and sold online to buyers in the US, Europe and East Asia.",
      "In Kamieskroon, a small town in the centre of South Africa's Namaqualand region, the rolling hills have become a haven for poachers.",
      "Some of the species are highly localised, and so can be wiped out by just a small amount of poaching.",
      "\"In South Africa, we know already of seven species that has been wiped out completely and there are certainly more species that will go extinct very soon,\" says Pieter van Wyk, a nursery curator at the /Ai /Ais-Richtersveld Transfrontier Park.",
      "It is hard to obtain figures for how many plants are being poached, but the non-governmental organisation Traffic reports that 1.6 million illegally harvested succulents were seized by South Africa's law enforcement agencies between 2019 and 2024. This only represents the contraband that was detected, so the true figure is likely to be far higher.",
      "The South African government is well aware of the problem, and unveiled a  strategy in 2022 to combat poaching. It includes running community programmes about the need to protect the environment.",
      "According to Mr Van Wyk and other conservationists, plant poaching has been booming since the Covid-19 lockdown in 2020.",
      "With international traders unable to travel to South Africa during that time, they turned to local people to collect succulents for them and post them out of the country.",
      "Mr Van Wyk says this coincided with an increase in global demand.",
      "\"People had more time to try to find something to keep busy with, and plants were one of the only things that in your house, could connect you to the outside world.\"",
      "This has been seized upon by organised crime syndicates who hire teams of plant poachers and then market the wild plants on social media and e-commerce platforms.",
      "\"The syndicates saw this as an opportunity of making something viral\u2026 telling a wide as possible public: 'We have this super-strange looking thing that comes from the African continent','\" Mr Van Wyk says.",
      "\"Then the public just loses their heads and they say: 'I want to buy one', and [the syndicates] arrange for the species to be poached,\" he adds.",
      "The uptick in organised crime activity in the region is having knock-on effects on local communities.",
      "\"This is a low-income area, people are not rich here, and people will exploit opportunities for income,\" explains Malinda Gardiner from Conservation South Africa.",
      "Expressing a similar view, the livestock farmer whom the BBC spoke to says there is always an influx of money in her community when poaching takes place.",
      "\"When we see young men going up in the mountain areas, we know they're poachers,\" adds the farmer, who asks not to be identified for fear of reprisals.",
      "\"They use screwdrivers to uproot the succulents and they carry backpacks and sacks to keep the stolen plants.\"",
      "A few days after that, there is an outbreak of binge drinking and illegal activity.",
      "\"When they get the money, there's more drugs, more alcohol, children are neglected because mummy is drunk, daddy is drunk, there's no food,\" adds the farmer.",
      "Ms Gardiner worries that the tensions will have longer-term effects.",
      "\"Small communities here really need each other\u2026 but this brings distrust. It brings a split in the communities as well,\" she says.",
      "Mr Van Wyk's assessment is starker: \"People are being abused and enslaved by syndicates and buyers.\"",
      "Attempts are being made to raise awareness among buyers about the importance of understanding where a plant might have come from.",
      "China has become a major source of demand for wild succulents in the last few years, but an internet campaign there to educate people about the illegal succulent trade has seen some results.",
      "The Clean Internet for Conophytum campaign was launched in March 2023 by the China Biodiversity Conservation and Green Development Foundation.",
      "According to the foundation's deputy secretary-general Linda Wong, they have seen an 80% reduction in online adverts for conophytum - a type of succulent - with an unknown source, and buyers are starting to ask questions about where plants being sold online have come from.",
      "\"The key is awareness. Once people know, they want to take action. They want to take responsibility to consume those plants and enjoy their beauty in a very responsible way,\" she tells the BBC.",
      "Conservationists advise customers all over the world to ask about the origin of a plant, and under no circumstances should they buy those advertised as wild.",
      "Traffic and the UK's Kew Gardens recently announced that they were teaming up with eBay to develop new ways of preventing the sale of wild succulents on its platform.",
      "In South Africa, Mr Van Wyk says more should be done to promote the cultivation of succulents that can be grown and harvested legally, to reduce the demand for poaching.",
      "\"We as a country need to say that: 'We have this resource, and there are other countries that are majorly benefiting from this, why aren't we?'\" he tells the BBC.",
      "Mr Van Wyk now runs a nursery at the /Ai /Ais-Richtersveld Transfrontier Park which looks after plants that have been confiscated by law enforcement, and he says they have received more than 200,000 so far.",
      "\"It's obviously stressful seeing things disappearing. But if you study these plants, it brings so much joy and pleasure and you just forget about all the nonsense that's happening in the world,\" Mr Van Wyk says.",

    "summary": "It used to be considered treason in France - but now, alcohol-free wine is here to stay.",
    "story": [
      "In the vineyards of Bordeaux, the unspeakable has become the drinkable. Wine without alcohol has arrived.",
      "The heresy of yesterday is now \u2013 thanks to science and economic crisis \u2013 the opportunity of today.",
      "Wine estates which would have torched their grapes rather than submit to such ignominy, are now openly contemplating the booze-free bottle.",
      "And developers are moving ahead fast, creating wines that are deliberately designed to get the best from the de-alcoholisation process.",
      "\"When we started a few years ago, what we were making was frankly rubbish,\" says Bordeaux oenologist Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Brochet, who has helped create the Moderato range of no-alcohol wines.",
      "\"But we have made great progress. And today we are getting nearer and nearer to our goal. I think it is going to be a revolution in the wine world.\"",
      "Bordeaux has just seen the launch of its first ever cave \u2013 wine shop \u2013 dedicated solely to no-alcohol wines, reflecting a shift in perceptions which has taken many in the industry by surprise.",
      "\"We only opened four weeks ago, and already we are getting wine-growers from the area coming in and asking about the non-alcohol market,\" says Alexandre Kettaneh,  who owns Les Belles Grappes with his wife Anne.",
      "\"They don't know anything about how to do it, but they can see it is coming and want to be part of it.\"",
      "Several things have happened to make the moment opportune.",
      "First of all, the French wine world is in deep difficulty. Domestic consumption continues to fall and the Chinese market is not what it was. US President-elect Donald Trump is threatening new levies. Prized ancient vineyards across France are being grubbed up.",
      "Second, consumption habits are shifting, especially among the young. Supermarkets now give more space to beer than they do to wine. Most 20-somethings have never had the habit of wine \u2013 and they are also far more health-conscious than their elders.",
      "The non-alcohol lifestyle is spreading. Currently 10% of the French beer market is alcohol-free. In Spain it is 25%.",
      "And third \u2013 the technology has improved by leaps and bounds.",
      "In the past \u2013 and still today for cheaper brands \u2013 the method has simply been to boil away the alcohol and then add compensatory flavours. The result \u2013 especially for reds \u2013 is at best mediocre. Such drinks cannot even call themselves wine, but \"beverages based on de-alcoholised wine\".",
      "Now though, there are new methods of low-temperature vacuum distillation, and of \"capturing\" aromas for putting back into the de-alcoholised wine. The result is wines that can legally call themselves wines, and are beginning to hold their own among discerning consumers.",
      "\"With reds, you need to be prepared for an experience which will not be the same as a traditional wine with alcohol. We cannot pretend we can replicate, yet, the full mouth-feel,\" says Fabien Marchand-Cassagne of Moderato.",
      "\"But what you will get is a genuine wine moment. Bouquet, tannins, fruits, balance \u2013 it is all there to be enjoyed.\"",
      "At the Clos De Bouard estate near Saint-Emilion, fully a third of sales are now of the chateau's two \u2013 soon to be three \u2013 non-alcoholic brands. Owner Coralie de Bouard first glimpsed the possibilities when she was asked in 2019 to develop a non-alcoholic wine for the Qatari owners of PSG football club.",
      "\"My family wouldn't talk to me for a year, such was my 'treason'. And even today I get hate mail from wine-growers saying I am ruining the market,\" she says.",
      "\"But now my father congratulates me and says I am the locomotive in the wine train. And if we are surviving today in these difficult times, it is because we have shifted towards the no-alcohol market.\"",
      "\"For the purists it's been very difficult to accept,\" says Bernard Rabouy, a wine-grower for the Bordeaux Families cooperative.",
      "\"But we have to evolve. The fact is that the customers aren't where they used to be. So we have to go and get them or they will go somewhere else.\"",
      "Promoters of alcohol-free wine make much of the notion that it allows non-drinkers \u2013 who used to feel excluded \u2013 to join in the wine-banter. And it is true that the rituals of opening, sniffing, describing and comparing are now open to all.",
      "\"What we want to do is try to bring back the France of our youth \u2013 when everyone sat around the dinner table and drank wine, and it was a real moment of sharing,\" says Anne Kattaneh.",
      "\"And these days the only way we are going to be able to do that is if non-alcoholic wines are part of the culture.\"",
      "\"The idea that the wine world was always as it is now, is rubbish,\" says oenologist Brochet.",
      "\"Things evolve. Once upon a time the barrel was an innovation. The cork was an innovation; grape varietals were an innovation. And now this is a new one \u2013 which could help save the industry and the wonderful landscape and culture that goes with it.",

      "But there are few signs of Christmas in the city this year. Just a dusting of snow on deserted streets and skeletal buildings -  and the constant sound of heavy shelling.",

      "Leontovych may not be well known in the West. But the tune he composed is familiar around the world - with its chime-like vocals. It's thought that Leontovych wrote the early scores of the composition, based on a Ukrainian folk chant, while he was living and working in Pokrovsk between 1904 and 1908.",
      "In Ukraine it's known as Shchedryk. To most of the world it became known as the Carol of the Bells, after American composer Peter Wilhousky wrote English lyrics for the song. The tune's use in the Hollywood film Home Alone helped boost its popularity.",

      "The Hasych family fled Pokrovsk this summer. But they're determined not to forget the place they still call home. Anna's mother, Yulia, says she's glad to see her daughters practising  Shchedryk. \"We won't forget the history of our town,\" she says.",
      "For Anna, the tune brings back memories. \"When I played it at home it seemed happy. It reminded me of winter and Christmas,\" she says. \"Now it's more of a sad song to me because it reminds me of home, and I really want to go back.\"",
      "But for one Ukrainian military band, Shchedryk has become a song to inspire resistance. They're even playing it in the trenches \u2013 using weapons as improvised instruments.",
      "They may be musicians, but their commander reminds me that they're soldiers first. All have spent time on the front line. Colonel Bohdan Zadorozhnyy, the head of the band and its conductor, says the song helps lifts soldiers spirits. \"Those beats and rhythms cheer up the guys on the front line and inspire them to fight,\" he says.",
      "22-year-old Roman uses a rocket launcher casing, filled with rice, to shake vigorously in time with the music. Shchedryk, he says, is the \"pride of our country, it's freedom, it's in our souls, I get goosebumps from this song\".",

      "Pokrovsk may well fall into Russian hands. But its people are doing all they can to preserve their culture and identity.",
      "The director of Pokrovsk's History Museum, Angelina Rozhkova, has already salvaged and transferred most of its prized possessions to safety \u2013 including artefacts from Leontovych's life in Pokrovsk.",

      "Angelina says the people of Pokrovsk understand they may never go back, \"but our heart and souls do not accept that\". Hence they're doing everything they can to preserve the past. The new motto is \"keeping and saving, equals winning\".",
      "It's hard to say you're winning when your city's being destroyed. But its people, like Leontovych's music, are displaying extraordinary resilience.",
      "Leontovych's life came to an abrupt end in 1921 when he was shot by a Soviet agent. His composition had become a symbol for the fight for Ukraine's independence. It still is.",

    "summary": "Biden commuted the sentences of 37 of 40 death row inmates, derailing Trump's plan to ramp up executions.",
    "story": [
      "With just weeks left in office, US President Joe Biden has commuted the sentences of 37 of 40 federal death row inmates - potentially thwarting President-elect Donald Trump's plans to expand federal executions during his upcoming administration.",
      "Biden's move was swiftly condemned by Republicans, with some accusing the president of siding with criminals over law-abiding Americans.",
      "Federal executions were relatively rare before Trump's first term in office, which finished with a flurry of executions that ended a 130-year-old precedent of pausing executions amid a presidential transition.",
      "He has vowed to resume the practice when he returns to the White House in January, setting the stage for possible legal battles early in the administration.",
      "Here's what we know.",
      "Biden's decision criticised",
      "On Monday, Biden commuted the sentences of 37 out of 40 death row inmates, switching their penalty to life without parole.",
      "Only three inmates were left to face the death penalty, including convicted Boston marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and Robert Bowers, who was sentenced to death for killing 11 worshippers and wounding seven during a shooting at a the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh in 2018.",
      "The third, Dylann Roof, was sentenced to death in 2017 for a mass shooting that left nine black parishioners dead at the Mother Emanuel AME church in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2015.",
      "While the move was widely praised by human rights groups such as Amnesty International, it was quickly condemned by some Republicans, as well as Trump's transition team and political allies.",
      "In a statement, Trump communications director Steven Cheung said that \"these are among the worst killers in the world and this abhorrent decision by Joe Biden is a slap in the face to the victims, their families, and their loved ones.",
      "\"President Trump stands for the rule of law, which will return when he is back in the White House,\" he added. Trump cannot undo the commutations when he returns to the White House next month.",
      "Texas Republican Chip Roy posted on X that the decision was \"unconscionable\" and an abuse of power \"to carry out a miscarriage of justice\".",
      "Another Republican, Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton, said that \"when given the choice between law-abiding Americans or criminals, Joe Biden and the Democrats choose criminals every time.\"",
      "Some family members also expressed anger.",
      "On Facebook, Heather Turner - whose mother was killed in a 2017 bank robbery - called the commutations a \"gross abuse of power\".",
      "\"At no point did the president consider the victims,\" she wrote. \"He, and his supporters, have blood on their hands.\"",
      "The commutations do not apply to the approximately 2,200 death row inmates convicted by state courts, over which the president holds no authority.",
      "What has Trump said about the death penalty?",
      "Over the course of his election campaign, Trump vowed to resume federal executions and make more people eligible to receive the death penalty, including those convicted of raping children or drug and human-trafficking cases, as well as migrants who kill US citizens or police officers.",
      "\"These are terrible, terrible, horrible people who are responsible for death, carnage and crime all over the country,\" Trump said when he announced his presidential candidacy in 2022.",
      "\"We're going to be asking everyone who sells drugs, gets caught, to receive the death penalty for their heinous acts,\" he added.",
      "There are more than 40 federal laws that can, in theory, result in the death penalty, ranging from murders committed during a drug-related shooting to genocide.",
      "Almost all - with the exception of espionage and treason - explicitly involve the death of a victim.",
      "Trump, however, has provided few details on how he plans to accomplish his campaign pledge.",
      "Despite the lack of clarity, Trump's vows to expand the federal death penalty have elicited strong warnings from human rights advocates.",
      "In an 11 December statement, for example, the American Civil Liberties Union said Trump's \"chilling\" plans amount to an expansion of the \"killing spree he initiated in the final six months of his first presidency\".",
      "\"He's already shown us that he will act on these promises,\" the statement said.",
      "The inmates executed during the waning days of Trump's first administration included Lisa Montgomery, the first woman executed by the federal government since 1953, and Lezmond Mitchell, the only Native American on federal death row.",
      "What can Trump actually do?",
      "US media reported that Trump cannot reverse Biden's commutations.",
      "Trump's efforts to expand the death penalty to crimes that do not involve murder are likely to face legal challenges.",
      "In 2008, for example, the Supreme Court ruled that those convicted of raping children cannot be executed, adding that it's unclear if the death penalty could be applied to crimes in which a victim is not killed.",
      "According to the National Registry of Exonerations, cases with child victims are particularly prone to wrongful convictions, can be \"extremely emotional\" and pit family members against one another.",
      "Any further expansion of crimes that are eligible for the federal death penalty would require Congress to act and change the law.",
      "In 2024, two bills - both sponsored by Florida Republican and Trump ally Anna Paulina Luna - sought to expand the use of capital offences to include possession of child pornography, as well as the trafficking, exploitation and abuse of children.",
      "Both failed to pass in the House of Representatives.",
      "Trump is also unlikely to be able to quickly re-populate the pool of federal death row inmates, as most death penalty cases take years and are subject to lengthy appeals processes.",
      "While he does not have any direct authority over state executions, some experts have warned that Trump's pro-death penalty stance may trigger more executions at a state level.",
      "\"His rhetoric can and has spurred draconian measures and attitudes by leaders in states on several issues, including in the context of the criminal legal system,\" Yasmin Cader, a deputy legal director at the American Civil Liberties Union and director of the Trone Center for Justice and Equality told CNN.",
      "In addition to the federal government and US military, 27 US states still have the death penalty on the books.",
      "A Gallup poll conducted in October found that a slim majority of Americans - 53% - support the death penalty for convicted murderers, up from 50% a year before."

      "After nearly an hour of back-and-forth gunfire, the convoy moves on.",
      "But it is not long before there are signs of more horrific gang violence. A human body burns in the middle of the street.",
      "One of the Kenyan police in our APC says he suspects it was a gang member cornered and killed by a rival group, his body set alight to send a gruesome warning.",
      "The Kenyan officers on our patrol are by now well accustomed to seeing this sort of brutality on the streets of Port-au-Prince, but they also tell us they are exhausted.",
      "Four hundred officers arrived in June - but they are hugely outnumbered. In July, Haiti's government estimated there were 12,000 armed gang members in the country.",
      "The Kenyans were promised additional personnel. When the UN authorised the mission, a force of 2,500 was envisioned, but that support, which was supposed to arrive in November, has yet to materialise.",
      "Despite the situation, the force's leadership remains optimistic. Commander Godfrey Otunge is under pressure from the Kenyan government to make a success of this mission.",
      "The mission commander says there is \"overwhelming support\" for the MSS in Haiti.",
      "\"The population are demanding that our team extend and go to other places and pacify,\" he says.",
      "The uphill struggle they face is clear at a former Haitian police station, which had been occupied by a gang but has now been re-taken by the Kenyan forces.",
      "It is still entirely surrounded by gangs and, as officers head up to the roof, they come under sniper fire.",
      "The Kenyan officers shoot back while urging everyone to remain low.",
      "The Kenyan officers say some of their much-delayed additional forces will arrive by the end of this year, bringing their total to 1,000.",
      "And the support is urgently needed. There are areas in Port-au-Prince which are under such tight gang control they are virtually impenetrable for the police.",
      "In one such area, Wharf J\u00e9r\u00e9mie, almost 200 civilians were killed by a single gang over the space of one weekend earlier in December.",
      "In total, as many as 100 gangs are estimated to be operating in the Port-au-Prince area, with boys as young as nine joining their ranks.",
      "And the problem only appears to be growing. According to the UN children's agency, Unicef, the number of children recruited to the gangs has soared by 70% in a year.",
      "One of the gang leaders to whom they flock is Ti Lapli, whose real name is Renel Destina.",
      "As head of the Gran Ravine gang, he commands more than 1,000 men from his fortified headquarters high above Port-au-Prince.",
      "Gangs like his have exacerbated an already dire situation in Haiti, and are known to slaughter, rape and terrorise civilians.",
      "Gran Ravine is infamous for carrying out kidnappings for ransom, a practice which has earned Ti Lapli a place on the FBI's wanted list.",
      "Ti Lapli tells us that he and his gang members \"love our country a lot\" - but when pressed on the rapes and murders gangs like his inflict on civilians, he claimed his men \"do things they weren't supposed to do [to members of rival gangs] because the same is done to us\".",
      "The reason children join Gran Ravine is simple, he says: \"The government doesn't create any jobs, it's a country with no economic activity whatsoever. We are living on trash, it's basically a failed state.\"",
      "He failed to acknowledge the strangulating impact gangs like his have on Haiti's economy. Often afraid to leave their homes for work, civilians are regularly extorted for money, too.",
      "With 700,000 residents forced to flee their homes due to the violence inflicted by groups such as Gran Ravine, the capital's schools have become camps for internally displaced people.",

    "published": "Tue, 24 Dec 2024 10:41:04 GMT",
    "summary": "The report gives fresh details about the former Florida congressman's alleged payments for sex and drugs.",
    "story": [
      "The House Ethics Committee report on Donald Trump ally Matt Gaetz released on Monday revealed fresh details about the former congressman's alleged behaviour, at least one new accusation and insights into the panel's investigation.",
      "From at least 2017 to 2020, the committee concluded that the former Florida congressman regularly paid women for \"engaging in sexual activity\", had sex with a 17-year-old girl, used or possessed illegal drugs, accepted gifts beyond House limits and helped a woman obtain a passport, according to the report.",
      "The 42-year-old was first elected as a Republican member of the US House of Representatives in 2016.",
      "He resigned in November - days before the report was scheduled to be made public and after Trump announced him as his pick for US attorney general. Gaetz withdrew from consideration a week later.",
      "He denied the committee's findings and has accused it of conducting an unfair investigation.",
      "Here are four parts of the much-anticipated report that stand out.",
      "A winding money trail",
      "House investigators said Gaetz paid more than $90,000 (\u00a371,843) to women for sex and drugs, but created a complicated web of transactions that were hard to trace, according to the report.",
      "\"The committee was unable to determine the full extent to which Representative Gaetz's payments to women were compensation for engaging in sexual activity with him,\" the report found.",
      "He allegedly used his friend Joel Greenberg, currently serving 11 years in prison for crimes he said he committed with Gaetz, as a frequent go-between and logged onto Greenberg's account on SeekingArrangement.com, which bills itself as a \"luxury dating site\", to interact with young women.",
      "Gaetz also paid women directly, sometimes through platforms such as Venmo, according to the report. But the committee said he often used another person's PayPal account or an account linked to an email address with a fake name.",
      "He also obscured payments, the panel wrote. In one example, he gave a college student a cheque made out to \"cash\" with \"tuition reimbursement\" in the memo line. The woman said she received it after a group encounter, which \"could potentially be a form of coercion because I really needed the money\".",
      "Gaetz has posted on social media that he gave money to women he was involved with as gifts, not payments. The committee found that two women, aged 27 and 25, did not consider their relationships transactional.",
      "Another woman who was considered his girlfriend invoked her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination when asked if she was given money for sex or drugs, or to pay others.",
      "The committee attempted to prove Gaetz frequently paid for sex through evidence such as a text message where he reportedly balked at a woman's request that he send her money after he accused her of \"ditching\" him one night. The woman then asserted she was \"treated differently\" than other women he was paying for sex.",
      "In another message, his then-girlfriend said that he and Greenberg were \"a little limited in their cash flow\" and asked a group of women \"if it can be more of a customer appreciation week\".",
      "A few months later, according to the committee, she wrote: \"Btw Matt also mentioned he is going to be a bit generous cause of the 'customer appreciation' thing last time.\"",
      "As a Congressman, Gaetz earned $174,000 (\u00a3138,843) a year.",
      "His net worth is greater: On his most recent federal financial disclosure filed in August, he reported owning assets worth at least $575,000. His father Don Gaetz, who co-founded hospice provider Vitas Healthcare, has a fortune of about $35m, Forbes reported.",
      "Sex, drugs, and a passport application",
      "The committee also said Gaetz bought illegal drugs or reimbursed people for them.",
      "It gives examples of his alleged cocaine and ecstasy/MDMA use, but focused on what appeared to be a heavy marijuana habit. He allegedly asked women to bring marijuana cartridges to meetings and events, and created the fake-name email account to buy marijuana.",
      "A trip he took to the Bahamas \"was paid for by an associate of Representative Gaetz with connections to the medical marijuana industry, who allegedly also paid for female escorts to accompany them\", according to the report.",
      "One woman felt the use of drugs and alcohol at parties had impaired her ability \"to really know what was going on or fully consent\".",
      "\"Indeed, nearly every woman that the committee spoke with could not remember the details of at least one or more of the events they attended with Representative Gaetz and attributed that to drug or alcohol consumption,\" the report said.",
      "His then-girlfriend, who was 21 when they met and \"was paid tens of thousands of dollars\" during their two-year relationship\", often participated in encounters with women and acted as an intermediary, according to the report.",
      "A woman who told the committee she was 17 at the time she had sex with Gaetz twice at a party in 2017 - at least once in front of other people -  while under the influence of ecstasy. The woman, who had just completed her junior year in high school, then received $400 from him.",
      "She also told the panel she did not tell Gaetz she was a minor and the committee did not find any evidence that the former congressman knew she was underage.",
      "The age of consent in Florida is 18, although a 16 or 17 year-old can legally consent to sexual conduct with a person between the ages of 16 and 23. Gaetz turned 35 in 2017.",
      "The Department of Justice investigated an allegation that he had sex with a minor, but ultimately did not file any criminal charges against him.",
      "In 2021, Greenberg pleaded guilty to sex trafficking the girl. According to his plea agreement, Greenberg paid for sex acts with the minor and introduced her to other adult men who engaged in commercial sex acts with her.",
      "Gaetz also allegedly directed his chief of staff to expedite a passport application for a woman he was sleeping with, whom he said was a voter in his district. He also allegedly gave her $1,000.",
      "Gaetz violated House rules that bar using his position for special favours, according to the committee, which wrote: \"The woman was not his constituent, and the case was not handled in the same manner as similar passport assistance cases\".",
      "Accusations of obstruction",
      "The committee dedicated a great deal of the report to detailing how Gaetz allegedly obstructed its investigation, including failing to produce evidence he said would \"exonerate\" him.",
      "The report concluded he \"continuously sought to deflect, deter, or mislead the Committee in order to prevent his actions from being exposed\".",
      "Gaetz, who has accused the committee of being \"weaponised\" against him and leaking information to the press, alleged the panel was working on behalf of former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, according to the report. Last year he helped lead an effort to oust then-Speaker McCarthy from his role.",
      "While Gaetz claimed he had \"voluntarily produced tens of thousands of records,\" he gave the committee \"only a couple hundred records, more than 90% of which was either irrelevant or publicly available,\" the report found.",
      "One sore point was a trip to the Bahamas, where the committee said he withheld information. Ultimately it concluded he violated rules on gifts because the trip was too high in value.",
      "The committee also cited the Justice Department's probe into the allegations against Gaetz as a reason for delays.",
      "Some witnesses asked the committee to use statements they had given to the department, but it refused to share them because they had not issued charges and because it said it could deter future witnesses in other cases from coming forward.",
      "Committee chairman dissents",
      "The report ends with a single-page statement  from Ethics Committee Chairman Michael Guest \"on behalf of dissenting committee members\" who are not named.",
      "Those members do not challenge the committee's findings, but disagree with releasing the report after Gaetz resigned from the House, which has not happened since 2006, they write.",
      "It \"breaks from the Committee's long-standing practice, opens the Committee to undue criticism, and will be viewed by some as an attempt to weaponise the Committee's process\".",
      "Gaetz paid 'tens of thousands' for sex and drugs, ethics report says"

    "published": "Mon, 23 Dec 2024 22:12:51 GMT",
    "summary": "India is fast becoming a major live industry market but poor facilities at concerts have left fans unhappy.",
    "story": [
      "When Amrita Kaur decided to attend Punjabi pop star Diljit Dosanjh's concert in India this month, she was prepared to experience some discomfort.",
      "Having attended several concerts in the past, Ms Kaur was sort of looking forward to the \"exhilarating chaos\" that comes with large crowds at big events in India.",
      "But what awaited her was far worse than she had imagined.",
      "Crowd control was minimal and sanitation non-existent. Overloaded mobile networks stopped working, sparking fears about personal safety. Even using the toilet felt like a gamble, she said, as it meant having to spend the rest of the performance queued up in front of \"unhygienic, smelly cubicles\".",
      "The venue, a massive piece of government-owned land in the northern city of Chandigarh, had no public transport connections or parking space, leaving Ms Kaur with no option but to drive her car to a friend's nearby - and then get stuck in the inevitable, hours-long traffic jam once the concert had ended.",
      "\"You pay so much for a ticket and what do you get in return? A possible urinary infection and a bad headache with some bouts of music,\" she says about her experience.",
      "This year has been big for India's burgeoning concert industry, with major tours by Dua Lipa, Dosanjh and Maroon 5 packing stadiums and grounds already thrilling audiences. Other international acts like Green Day, Coldplay and Ed Sheeran are set to perform in the coming months.",
      "In fact, India's music concerts generated about 8bn rupees ($94.1m; \u00a375.3m) in revenue last year - a figure that is set to increase by 25% by the end of 2025.",
      "Young, well-to-do Indians are not just willing to pay more to see their favourite music stars, but are actively seeking out these events. In 2023, more than 400,000 people in India said they travelled to other Indian cities to attend live events.",
      "But despite the enthusiasm, many concertgoers say their experience has been far from ideal. The issue made headlines earlier this week, when a diabetic patient with incontinence issues said he ended up soiling himself at a Bryan Adams concert due to unavailability of washrooms at the venue.",
      "On the same day, Dosanjh, who has been on a nationwide tour, shocked his fans by announcing that he wouldn't perform in India again until the infrastructure at concert venues got better. The singer later clarified he was referring to only one of the venues.",
      "Since then, social media has been awash with similar complaints from concertgoers. From booking tickets on dodgy scalping websites for astonishingly high prices, to braving hours-long traffic before and after a show, often on a full bladder, fans say they have to pay with more than just money to see their favourite acts.",
      "Those who have the means are now opting to attend shows in other countries for a safer and generally more fun experience. \"At Adele's concert in Munich, the staff continuously cleaned the toilets and it was super clean even after a three-hour concert,\" says Ishika Goon, a Bengaluru-based lawyer. \"If I have to spend so much money, I might as well go for the full experience.\"",
      "Organisers and promoters acknowledge the problems but say they too are hobbled by wider infrastructural challenges.",
      "That's because India does not have enough venues dedicated to live concerts, forcing them to opt for suboptimal spaces or simply avoid certain cities altogether, all of which prevents the industry from scaling up, says Anmol Kukreja, the co-founder of Skillbox, a live entertainment company that has organised more than 300 concerts.",
      "Unlike a lot of western countries where concert venues are plenty, he says that events in India have to be held in places like malls, sports stadiums or on public land - all of which come with their own limitations and many variables.",
      "A mall might have better toilets and designated parking areas, but it won't necessarily be able to accommodate huge crowds the way a large barren ground located in a far-flung corner of the city with bad connectivity might.",
      "Nowadays, a lot of music events are held inside public stadiums to minimise some of the inconveniences - but that comes with its own challenges, such as poor sound quality, crowd management issues and lots of red tape.",
      "Government-owned venues are more suitable for big events, but the process of booking them can often be a complex \"web of permissions and licences, making them less attractive\", Mr Kukreja says.",
      "To address these gaps, organisers end up spending thousands of dollars on building temporary infrastructure at venues - the stage, temporary bathrooms and parking spaces - before each concert which could incur serious losses, adds Tej Brar, founder of Mumbai-based Third Culture and the director of NH7, one of India's biggest music festivals.",
      "And it's not just business that suffers, the live music scene is impacted too, as a whole segment of smaller and independent artists are left out because they are not \"big enough\" to make people want to pay an exorbitant price to watch them.",
      "\"If they can't pull crowds of more than 10,000 people or more, they usually won't get shows because the economics won't work for the organisers.\"",
      "But of late, even major international music festivals with star-studded line-ups and million-dollar budgets have left fans disappointed.",
      "\"Everything is fine but why can't you have clean toilets?\" asks Sreoshi Mukherjee, a Delhi-based journalist.",
      "Ms Mukherjee, who attends music concerts around the country, was particularly aghast by the lack of washrooms at Lollapalooza and Backstreet Boys, tickets for which cost anywhere between 5,000 ($59; \u00a347) and 10,000 ($118; \u00a394) rupees.",
      "\"There was a point when the loos ran out of both toilet paper and water. We had to actually buy water bottles to relieve ourselves,\" she says.",
      "Criticism against inflated ticket prices turning these events into highbrow cultural experiences meant for only a few has been mounting, but there are other accessibility concerns as well.",
      "Most venues have little to no arrangements for people with disabilities - such as wheelchair access and audio description. At Dosanjh's Chandigarh concert, Ms Kaur said they had to carry their wheelchair-using friend into the venue as there was no ramp or accessibility lane.",
      "The BBC has reached out to the organisers of all the events mentioned in the story for comment.",
      "Others in the business say there can't be a one-size-fits all solution for the problems, but they worry about its longer impact on business. Right now, people are still willing to pay. But persistently poor facilities might change their minds.",
      "\"Word-of-mouth plays a crucial role in event attendance, and negative feedback can be damaging to an organiser's reputation,\" Mr Brar says.",
      "But the onus to fix that, he adds, needs to be shared. \"While the company takes charge of choosing the location and setting ticket prices, the venue should provide fundamental amenities. Adequate washroom facilities and dedicated cleaning staff should be a venue standard.\"",
      "As the country gears up to host big names like Sheeran and Green Day, fans are hoping for a better experience.",
      "And for some, huge crowds and the risk of a potential infection still feels like a small price for seeing their favourite star.",
      "\"There's a thrill to the mess and chaos,\" says Mohammad Sami, a student.",
      "\"It's like you're stuck on an island with hundreds of strangers, united by their determination to survive the night.\""

    "story": [
      "An Alabama woman who says she was raped by Jay-Z and Sean \"Diddy\" Combs when she was 13 can proceed anonymously, for now, in her lawsuit against the rap moguls, a New York federal judge ruled Thursday.",
      "In her written order, U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres said the woman can proceed anonymously at this early stage of the litigation, but she may be required to reveal her identity at a later date, if the case proceeds. That would allow defense lawyers to collect facts necessary to prepare for trial. Torres also cited \"substantial interest\" from the public.",
      "The Manhattan jurist also chastised Alex Spiro \u2014 the lawyer representing Jay-Z, whose legal name is Shawn Carter \u2014 for what she described as his \"relentless filing of combative motions containing inflammatory language and ad hominem attacks\" against the plaintiff's lawyer, calling them \"inappropriate, a waste of judicial resources, and a tactic unlikely to benefit his client.\"",

    "summary": "The appeal had asked the court to reinstate charges, including involuntary manslaughter, against Alec Baldwin.",
    "story": [
      "New Mexico prosecutors have dropped their appeal, ending an effort to\u00a0reinstate charges against Alec Baldwin in connection with the fatal shooting on the set of his movie \"Rust.\"",
      "Special prosecutor Kari Morrissey withdrew the state's appeal, originally filed in November, on Monday, according to a statement from the First Judicial District Attorney's Office.",
      "\"The appeal would have challenged the Court's dismissal of criminal charges against Producer and Actor, Alec Baldwin which included involuntary manslaughter in the tragic shooting of Cinematographer, Halyna Hutchins on the set of\u00a0Rust\u00a0on October 21, 2021,\" the statement said.",
      "The district attorney's office commended Morrissey for her work prosecuting \"two cases of such magnitude and national attention, including the successful prosecution against Hannah Gutierrez Reed,\" the film's armorer, who convicted of involuntary manslaughter in March. The DA's office said it \"supports the Hutchins family and their continued fight for justice in civil court.\"",
      "Luke Nikas and Alex Spiro, attorneys representing Baldwin, told CBS News in a statement: \"Today's decision to dismiss the appeal is the final vindication of what Alec Baldwin and his attorneys have said from the beginning \u2014 this was an unspeakable tragedy but Alec Baldwin committed no crime. The rule of law remains intact in New Mexico.\"",
      "The decision to drop the appeal solidifies the decision by Judge Mary Marlowe Sommer halfway through trial to dismiss the case following allegations that police and prosecutors withheld evidence from the defense.",
      "Baldwin's trial was upended by revelations that ammunition was brought into the Santa Fe County sheriff's office in March by a man who said it could be related to Hutchins' killing. Prosecutors said they deemed the ammo unrelated and unimportant, while Baldwin's lawyers say investigators \"buried\" the evidence in a separate case file and filed a successful motion to dismiss.",
      "The district attorney's office said that under state law, the New Mexico attorney general would have carried forward the appeal, but \"did not intend to exhaustively pursue the appeal on behalf of the prosecution.\"",
      "\"As a result, the State's efforts to continue to litigate the case in a fair and comprehensive manner have been met with multiple barriers that have compromised its ability to prosecute to the fullest extent of the law,\" the local prosecutors said.",
      "At a news conference Tuesday, attorney Gloria Allred, representing Halyna Hutchins' parents and sister, who live in Ukraine, condemned the decision to drop the appeal.",
      "\"Even though the criminal justice system and case has now concluded, and Halyna's parents were denied justice in the criminal case, we will continue to fight for justice in our civil lawsuit in New Mexico against Alec Baldwin and the Rust Productions and we will vigorously continue to litigate our case in the civil court in New Mexico,\" she said.",
      "\"We have confidence that a New Mexico jury, if allowed to decide our civil case, would do the right thing and we as their lawyers will do anything and everything that is legally possible and appropriate to win justice for Halyna and her family,\" Allred said.",
      "Hutchins' sister, in a statement read by Allred in a news conference Tuesday, said, \"Mr. Baldwin must be held accountable for my sister's death. He has never contacted our family to apologize or accept any responsibility for my sister's death. We will press forward for a civil lawsuit until there is justice for her loss caused by Mr. Baldwin.\"",
      "Allred said the dismissal of the criminal case shouldn't hurt the family in civil court, noting the different burdens of proof required in criminal and civil trials. She also noted the civil case is focused on \"negligence against Baldwin and the executive producers and crew members involved in the death, which was not part of the criminal case.\"",
      "\"Alec Baldwin said recently that he's looking forward to the truth coming out, so they're looking forward to his testimony under oath as to what his truth fully is,\" Allred said. \"He has not done a deposition under oath and now is able to since what he will testify to now will not criminalize him in New Mexico.\"",
      "The shooting occurred during a rehearsal on the set of the Western film \"Rust,\" in which Baldwin stars and also served as a producer. Baldwin was holding a prop gun that had been loaded with a live round when it discharged, killing Hutchens and wounding director Joel Souza. Baldwin has maintained he never pulled the gun's trigger and did not know it was loaded with a live round, which is prohibited by both industry and union guidelines.",
      "Armorer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, who was accused of loading the gun, was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in March. She appealed her conviction after the charges against Baldwin were dismissed, but it was upheld by a judge in September.",
      "Prosecutors had also accused Gutierrez-Reed of bringing the live rounds onto the set, but defense lawyers argued the film's ammunition supplier was not properly investigated. Guttierez-Reed maintained she did not know how the gun was loaded with live rounds. She was acquitted of evidence tampering in her trial.",
      "David Halls, the film's safety coordinator, pleaded no contest last year to negligent use of a firearm. He completed six months of unsupervised parole."

      "The complaint lays out the 37-year-old actress' allegations against her co-star, including that after a meeting in which she and her husband Ryan Reynolds addressed \"repeated sexual harassment and other disturbing behavior\" by Baldoni and a producer on the movie, he and the studio \"embarked on a 'multi-tiered plan' to damage her reputation following the meeting.\"",
      "In a statement to The New York Times, Lively said she hopes her legal action \"helps pull back the curtain on these sinister retaliatory actions to harm people who speak up about misconduct and helps protect others who may be targeted.\" A representative for Lively referred CBS News to the Times report, in which Lively denied planting or spreading negative information about Baldoni or the studio.",
      "According to The New York Times, the lawsuit also included alleged texts from Baldoni's publicist to the studio publicist which says the actor \"wants to feel like she can be buried,\" and \"We can't write we will destroy her.\"",

      "The film, which was released in August, is based on Colleen Hoover's best-selling novel of the same name. The book has spent 164 weeks on the New York Times bestseller list, and its devoted fans waited for the movie's release.",
      "However, in the days and weeks leading up to the release, rumors swirled regarding the alleged on-set feud between Lively and Baldoni. During promotion for the film, Baldoni did most of his press solo and did not pose with the cast during the film's New York premiere.",
      "Lively played the movie's main character, Lily, while Baldoni played a neurosurgeon who seems like a nice guy but becomes abusive.",

Both of them in Atlas and Ryle have had past trauma,\" he said. \"One handles it very different than the other and my other hope is the men who have not done the work, who have not done the work to heal, if they see bits of themselves in Ryle, have a chance to step back and say, 'You know what, I don't want to blow up my life. I don't want to hurt the person I love the most.'\"",

    "published": "Sun, 22 Dec 2024 12:17:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The visionary director talks about his recent memoir, \"Every Man for Himself and God Against All\"; the epic making of his 1982 classic, \"Fitzcarraldo\"; and why he likes playing villains.",
    "story": [
      "Asked if he'd turned his cellphone off, writer-director Werner Herzog said, \"I do not have a cellphone. I don't have to turn off anything. I just want to live and have a real conversation with a real person.\"",
      "Herzog got his wish: An authentic conversation not long ago at his home in the Hollywood Hills.",
      "He is a legitimate filmmaking visionary, in Hollywood and around the world, having directed more than 20 feature films and better than 30 documentaries \u2013 from a journey to the heart of darkness in the Amazon, to a life among grizzlies in the Arctic.",
      "He's put it all into a memoir with a title that's vintage Werner: \"Every Man for Himself and God Against All\" (Penguin Press).",
      "\"A title has to somehow jump at you,\" Herzog said. \"When you walk by some books and you see this, you stop: 'Man, what is this?'\"",
      "What it is, is the story of a filmmaker unlike any other. \"Yes, I have experienced a lot, as if I had lived ten times over already,\" he said. \"And that's the beauty of the memoir, is that it's so condensed. When you read it, you will not be bored.\"",
      "Born in Munich, Germany during World War II, Herzog started making films as a teen. He was drawn to characters with impossible dreams: you see it in his 1982 film \"Fitzcarraldo,\" with a longtime collaborator, Klaus Kinski. The character of Fitzcarraldo wants to build an opera house in the middle of the Amazon rainforest. To do it, he needs to haul a steamship up, then down, a mountain.",
      "Herzog said, \"20th Century Fox was interested to finance and produce a film. But they wanted to produce it with a small, plastic replica of a ship in a jungle, a 'good' jungle. And they thought, 'We should do it in the botanic garden in San Diego.' And I said, 'No, it has to be really shot in a big jungle, and big rivers, and everything.'\"",
      "Without the benefit of CGI, Herzog found his big jungle, his big river. He made the astonishing decision to pull a real 320-ton riverboat over a real mountain to the Amazon River on the other side.",
      "I asked, \"It sounds to me like there were moments in 'Fitzcarraldo' where maybe for the first time, and maybe for the only time, that you at least feared that maybe the crew stopped believing in you. Is that true?\"",
      "\"It is true,\" Herzog replied. \"There were moments where it was very precarious. And only my fire within somehow carried us. The strength of my vision carried everyone along, even though many of them did not believe I could move the ship over the mountain.\"",
      "To watch a trailer for \"Fitzcarraldo\" starring Klaus Kinski, click on the video player below:",
      "The finished film made believers out of the crew, and the critics. Herzog won best director at Cannes, though \"Fitzcarraldo\" was nearly a very different movie. Jason Robards originally led the cast, with Mick Jagger playing his assistant. Then, with nearly half the movie shot, Robards got sick and had to be evacuated back to the U.S. The delay cost them Jagger, too \u2013 The Rolling Stones were going on tour.",
      "So, Herzog hired Kinski.",
      "He said if Kinski had been unable to do the film, he would have played the character himself: \"I would have done it. Because the main task, moving a ship over the mountain, was not cinema anymore. It was the task that I had to deliver. I had to do it. And I was struggling. I wouldn't have been half as good as Kinski, and not half as good as Jason Robards or Mick Jagger. 'Thanks, God, on my knees,' that I didn't have to play it.\"",
      "That's not to say Herzog isn't a good actor; he was born to play bad. He's starred as the villain in \"Jack Reacher,\" and a sinister figure in \"The Mandalorian.\" \"Well, I was dragged into acting,\" he said, \"but I enjoy it tremendously, and I do it well. I know I do it well, but only for very specific parts. and I can deliver. But I swear to God, it's a performance.\"",
      "His greatest performance, though, is a love story: his own. Werner Herzog is a hopeless romantic. He fell for photographer Elena Pisetski in the late '90s. To seal the deal, he sold everything he owned and flew from Germany to the U.S. with nothing but a toothbrush in his pocket and passion in his heart.",
      "\"It's only me; it's me, only me, the man, the person, and that's it,\" he said of his arrival on Pisetski's doorstep. \"So, I have nothing to offer, only me, myself. And I am in America and I'm in Los Angeles because I fell in love very deeply. And I have been very lucky. I'm not here because of Hollywood. I'm here because I'm in love.\"",
      "It's Herzog's third marriage; he and Elena have been together now for 28 years. \"I'm a very lucky bastard,\" he said.",
      "It's been 63 years since his first film, and Herzog is still at it. And, he promises, there is more to come. \"I am working on two feature films,\" he said.",
      "\"You're not saturated?\" I asked.",
      "\"Well, who knows?\" Herzog replied. \"Ultimately, you'll have to carry me out from a set feet first. That's what hopefully is gonna happen.\"",

    "story": [
      "Thirty-seven-year-old Darren Criss is a star on Broadway, and a regular at piano bars. \"Keep the music going, you know?\" he said. \"I think the expression goes, 'Life is a cabaret!'\"",

      "One rule in a piano bar? Play the hits.  Criss had his first hit at the University of Michigan. He starred as Harry Potter in an unauthorized student show based on the books that became a YouTube sensation in 2009.",
      "\"This was a very interesting moment in time,\" he said, of \"A Very Potter Musical.\" \"That really did kind of change my life. That would kind of set me on the path to where I am now.\"",
      "From 2009: The unofficial parody show \"A Very Potter Musical\":",
      "I asked if \"A Very Potter Musical\" was the first musical to go viral. \"I don't know; I guess we'll let the YouTube historians sort of decide the validity of that,\" Criss said.",
      "But Criss took a detour on his way to Broadway, by becoming a TV star. \"'Glee' was happening at the time,\" he said. \"And I went out for it, like hundreds of thousands of other people in my situation at that time. And I happened to book it.\"",
      "He played Blaine Anderson, and quickly became a fan favorite. \"I owe my tenure on that show to the sub-cultural fan base army that we had gathered from the Potter stuff,\" he said.",

      "Criss said, \"This show begins with a song which is the question the show posits: Why love? Why do we do it? If we know that loving something enters you in a contract that has an inexorable back end \u2013 which is the loss of something \u2013 why do we do that, if we know that that's gonna happen?\"",
      "According to Criss, this show came along at the perfect time. He and his wife, Mia, have a two-and-a-half year-old daughter, and earlier this year they welcomed a baby son.",
      "I asked, \"Does this feel like the best year of your life?\"",
      "\"Well, it certainly is a blessed one,\" Criss laughed. \"I've had some extraordinary years of my life, and I think this has been a certainly exciting time.\"",
      "He's had some hard years, too. In 2020, his father, Bill, died at 78 from a heart condition. In 2022, his brother, Chuck, died at 36 by suicide.",
      "Criss said, \"I don't necessarily think of my own experience with those people specifically in my life that I have lost. But I do think about the feeling of loss, the sadness and emptiness and loneliness that that yields, because we all feel it. But the things that move me, in life and in [\"Maybe Happy Ending\"], are not the darkness of the loss, but the Herculean grace that it takes to be resilient in the inevitable truth of that.\"",
      "When he thinks about that, Darren Criss can't help but sing.",

    "published": "Sun, 22 Dec 2024 10:00:14 -0500",
    "summary": "The iconic singer-songwriter has long been a silver screen presence \u2013 as an actor, a subject of documentaries, and the figure in biopics. But Bob Dylan's love of movies has been a recurring theme in his art and his persona.",
    "story": [
      "A new Bob Dylan biopic, \"A Complete Unknown,\" starring Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, arrives in theaters Christmas Day. As historian Douglas Brinkley tells us, it's just the latest chapter in a lengthy love affair between Dylan and the movies.",
      "Growing up in the iron-rich mining town of Hibbing, Minnesota, in the 1940s and '50s, Bob Dylan was not exposed to much non-conformity or social upheaval. Except, that is, at the movies.",
      "It was at the local theaters, one of which was owned by his relatives, that he first set eyes on Brigitte Bardot, an early crush and muse for some of his first songs.",
      "\"Well, my telephone rang it would not stop It's President Kennedy callin' me up He said, 'My friend, Bob, what do we need to make the country grow?'\u00a0I said, 'My friend, John, Brigitte BardotAnita Ekberg, Sophia Loren ...' \"",
      "-- \"I Shall Be Free\" by Bob Dylan",
      "Young Bob sported a leather jacket after seeing Marlon Brando in \"The Wild One.\" When he saw the juvenile melodrama \"Blackboard Jungle,\" with its innovative rock 'n' roll soundtrack, he reportedly said to a friend, \"This is exactly what we've been trying to tell people about ourselves.\"",
      "Seeing James Dean in \"Rebel Without a Cause\" inspired him to stand up against the shackles of Cold War conformity in his music.",
      "Once Dylan made it to New York's Greenwich Village, it was the art-house international films that caught his eye: Truffaut's \"Shoot the Piano Player\" \u2026 Fellini's \"La dolce vita.\" That film, about a tabloid journalist searching in vain for fulfillment in a hedonistic Rome, looked, Dylan later said, \"like life in a carnival mirror.\"",
      "Dylan's first major film appearance, however, was a cameo in director Sam Peckinpah's \"Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid.\" The film spawned the classic song \"Knockin' on Heaven's Door,\" now the Nobel laureate's most-streamed song.",
      "His music has enhanced scores of movie scores, from \"The Big Lebowski,\" to more recently \"St. Vincent.\"",
      "One film stuck with Dylan for decades: \"The Gunfighter,\" starring Gregory Peck. When Peck heard his name in Dylan's epic 1986 ballad \"Brownsville Girl,\" he phoned him up to thank him. Peck would reiterate his gratitude in 1997, when he presented Dylan with the Kennedy Center Honor.",
      "The new biopic \"A Complete Unknown,\" starring an astounding Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, is hardly the first cinematic depiction of Dylan.

    "title": "The story of Handel's \"Messiah\"",
    "published": "Sun, 22 Dec 2024 09:13:17 -0500",
    "summary": "Since its premiere in 1742, George Frideric Handel's 3.5-hour oratorio for chorus, soloists and orchestra has become a timeless message of hope, and a Christmas tradition.",
    "story": [
      "It's probably the most-heard piece of classical music on Earth, the most sung, and the most recorded. It's \"Messiah,\" by German-British opera composer George Frideric Handel.",
      "\"It has been in near continuous performance from 1742, when it premiered, all the way up to the present,\" said author Charles King. \"It's absolutely everywhere. And you can't say that about really any other piece of serious music.\"",
      "King's new book, \"Every Valley\" (Doubleday), gives us the backstory of \"Messiah\" and its \"Hallelujah Chorus,\" which comes about two-thirds of the way through Handel's oratorio. \"It's not the finale!\" King said. \"People start getting ready to leave, you know, grabbing their keys and their parking validation, and then it's like, 'Nope, sit down. There's a third more of this thing left to go!'\"",
      "\"Messiah\" wasn't actually Handel's idea. The words came from a friend named Charles Jennens. King suggests it should really be called Handel's and Jennens' \"Messiah.\"",
      "\"Charles Jennens was a wealthy landowner, but he also suffered from this kind of encasing sense of doom and despair \u2013 we might now call it chronic depression or even bipolar disorder,\" King said. \"He starts to pull down books from the shelves, and he starts to copy down bits of scripture. He was also working out, I think, a kind of philosophy of living.\"",
      "Conductor and writer Jane Glover has conducted \"Messiah\" more than 100 times (most recently, this month at Trinity Church in New York City). \"I never fail to doff my hat, actually, at Charles Jennens for putting that together,\" she said. \"'Messiah'\" is in three parts. The first part is the Christmas story, which is why everybody does it at Christmas. The second part is the crucifixion, but then also the resurrection; and then Part III is about redemption. So, there's a tremendous shape to this three-part oratorio.\"",
      "In the 1720s and '30s, Handel's popular Italian-style operas had made him a musical megastar. But in his 50s, his popularity was waning. So, when he was invited to stage a series of concerts in Dublin, King said, Handel thought he could restart his career: \"And so, he sits down with this text that he's received from Charles Jennens and decides to try to make something of it. You can imagine him thinking, 'Hmpf, what am I gonna do with these? I got a bunch of Bible verses in the wrong order that I'm supposed to set to Italian opera music?' But he does it.\"",
      "In his book, King describes the final product as \"weird.\" \"It is weird,\" he laughed. \"It's the strangest thing that Handel ever composed.\"",
      "Handel wrote the three-hour piece (for chorus, soloists, and nine-piece orchestra) in 24 days \u2026 260 pages of music!",
      "At the Morgan Library & Museum in New York, music curator Robin McClellan showed me a replica of Handel's original score. \"It shows the speed that he wrote. It's so messy!\" McClellan laughed. \"He really was concerned with getting his ideas onto paper as fast as possible.\"",
      "For the \"Hallelujah Chorus,\" Handel wrote the word \"Hallelujah\" once \u2026 and then used the standard jazz repeat sign that we still use today! \"He's writing down the musical equivalent of 'et cetera, et cetera, et cetera,'\" said King. \"In that era, there was really no assumption that anything would ever be performed again.\"",
      "\"Messiah\" was a huge hit in Dublin, and, eventually, in London. It seems to offer a sense of hope and light at a time when they were in short supply.",
      "King said, \"'Messiah' was born in the kind of dark shadows of the Enlightenment. Britain was at war. The infant mortality rate in London at the time was 75%. And so, 'Messiah' is a kind of piece of art that is grappling with what basis, what possible basis for hope could there be when you have all of this evidence around you to suggest otherwise?\"",
      "Just about everyone loved it \u2013 except Charles Jennens! \"He was worried that Handel had done a kind of cheap job,\" said King. \"He says, 'I am never going to offer my words to Handel again to be so abused!'\"",
      "Handel agreed to make some changes, and Jennens softened. \"In the end, he wrote to a friend of his that he thought it was 'in the main, a fine composition,'\" King said.",
      "\"Messiah\" came to the American colonies in 1770, six years before this was even a country. It was performed in Trinity Church in New York City, sounding much as it did this month in exactly the same hall.",
      "Hear the Trinity Choir and Trinity Baroque Orchestra's 2024 performance of \"Messiah\" conducted by Jane Glover",
      "Hear the Trinity Choir and Trinity Baroque Orchestra's 2024 performance of \"Messiah\" conducted by Jane Glover",
      "Over time, \"Messiah\" has changed in all kinds of different ways. Handel's nine-piece orchestra gave way to thunderous musical forces; various trims were implemented. Glover said, \"People sitting in a church on hard pews don't want to sit here for three-and-a-half hours.\"",
      "And whole sections were dropped. \"Some people just do Part I at Christmas; that's a very good way of doing it,\" Glover said.",
      "Still, in all its versions, Handel and Jennens's masterpiece has offered the same message for nearly 300 years: That there is always hope.",
      "\"Every single generation that has heard this thing, has felt that this music is kind of a message in a bottle for them,\" said King. \"It's a piece of music that does stuff to us.\"",
      "Its message? \"Have the possibility of hope; problems are solvable; the world is gonna be okay. And then, take that and put it into action.\"",

      "Federal officials are urging people not to eat recalled cucumbers, as well as salads, wraps, party trays and meal kits that could contain the product, amid an investigation into an outbreak of salmonella that has now sickened at least 100 people in 23 U.S. states and sent 25 to the hospital.",
      "The tally by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention involved illnesses that started on dates ranging from October 12, 2024, to November 23, 2024, with the true number of sick people likely much higher, given many recover without being treated or tested.",
      "The state hardest hit in the outbreak appeared to be Montana, where 17 were reported sickened, followed by Wisconsin, with 12 cases, and Colorado, Oregon and Wyoming each reporting eight cases. Massachusetts, Texas and Washington accounted for six cases, followed by five in South Dakota and three each in California, Illinois and Iowa. Alaska, Michigan, New Jersey and Utah all called in two cases, and eight states reported one: Arizona, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, Ohio and Pennsylvania.",
      "Many companies have recalled whole fresh cucumbers grown by Agrotato, S.A. de C.V. in Sonora, Mexico, and sold by importers between October 12 and November 26, according to the Food and Drug Administration. Additionally, companies have recalled sliced cucubers or foods that contain them, it said.",
      "SunFed Produce, Baloian Farms of Arizona Co. and Russ Davis Wholesale\u00a0have all recalled cucumbers, with the latter also recalling multiple products containing them, including ready-to-eat salads and wraps, the FDA noted.",
      "The latest recall involves Gyro Family Kits sold at Sprouts Farmers Market stores in 24 states, with use-by dates running through Jan. 7, 2025, announced Reser's Fine Foods in a notice published December 10. The tzatziki sauce in the kits was made with cucumbers potentially contaminated with the bacteria, the company said.",
      "Beef & Lamb Gyro Sandwich Express Meal Kits with use-by dates of Dec. 24, 2024 to Jan. 6, 2025 were distributed to Sam's Club warehouses nationwide and are being recalled as the products contain tzatziki sauce with possibly tainted cucumbers, according to a notice posted by the agency December 6.",
      "Cucumbers from SunFed Produce and supplied to Dairyland Produce are being recalled after being sold at Costco locations in Houston and Dallas, according to a notice published by the FDA on December 7. Mediterranean-inspired party trays with sell-by dates running to December 11 and sold at Ralph's stores in California and Smith's stores in Arizona, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Utah and Wyoming are being recalled as the Grecian Delight Tzatziki sauce contains potentially contaminated cucumbers from SunFed.",
      "The recalls include one announced on December 5 involving vegetable trays and salads sold at Kroger and King Soopers retail stores in Colorado and Texas, with best-by dates running to December 6, as well as\u00a0 a\u00a0recall\u00a0of grab-n-go Yummi Sushi sold at Kroger stores in Texas.

      "Consumers should check their refrigerators and freezers for recalled cucumbers from SunFed Produce, Baloian Farms and Russ Davis. The produce may have a sticker that reads \"SunFed Mexico\" or are packaged in a clear PamPak branded bag of six individual cucumbers with universal product code 8 2540107010 6, the FDA stated.",
      "Products containing the recalled cucumbers include Crazy Fresh Garden Salad with Ranch Dressing, Quick & Easy Garden Salad with Ranch Dressing, Crazy Fresh Turkey Havarti Wrap, Quick & Easy Bacon Avocado Wrap, Crazy Fresh Bacon Avocado Wrap and Kowalski's Market Garden Salad.",
      "People who purchased whole, fresh American/slicer cucumbers on or after October 12 and who aren't sure of their origin should ask the seller if they are part of the recall or throw them out.",
      "Most people infected with salmonella experience diarrhea, fever and stomach cramps, with symptoms usually starting six hours to six days after swallowing the bacteria, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Although most recover without treatment within a week, some people, especially the young and the old, may experience more severe illnesses that require treatment or hospitalization.",

      "Richard Parsons, one of corporate America's most prominent Black executives who held top posts at Time Warner and Citigroup, died Thursday, the financial services company Lazard, where Parsons was a longtime board member, announced. He was 76.",
      "\"Dick was the leader to whom other leaders turned for advice and a steady, sure set of hands during their most consequential moments,\" Lazard said in a statement.",
      "Parsons, who died at his Manhattan home, was diagnosed with multiple myeloma in 2015 and cited \"unanticipated complications\" from the disease for cutting back on work a few years later.",
      "The NBA, where Parsons was interim CEO of the Los Angeles Clippers in 2014, was among organizations offering condolences.",
      "\"Dick Parsons was a brilliant and transformational leader and a giant of the media industry who led with integrity and never shied away from a challenge,\" NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said.",
      "Parsons' friend Ronald Lauder told The New York Times that the cause of death was cancer. Parsons stepped down Dec. 3 from the boards of Lazard and Lauder's company, Est\u00e9e Lauder, citing health reasons. He had been on Est\u00e9e Lauder's board for 25 years.",
      "Parsons, a Brooklyn native who started college at 16, was named chairman of Citigroup in 2009, one month after leaving Time Warner Inc., where he helped restore the company's stature following its much-maligned acquisition by internet provider America Online Inc.",
      "He steered Citigroup back to profit after financial turmoil from the subprime mortgage crisis, which upended the economy in 2007 and 2008.",
      "Parsons was named interim chairman of CBS' board of directors in September 2018 but resigned a month later because of illness.",
      "Parsons said in a statement at the time that he was already dealing with multiple myeloma when he joined the board, but \"unanticipated complications have created additional new challenges.\" He said his doctors advised him to cut back on his commitments to ensure recovery.",
      "\"Dick's storied career embodied the finest traditions of American business leadership,\" Lazard said in a statement. The company, where Parsons was a board member from 2012 until this month, praised his \"unmistakable intelligence and his irresistible warmth.\"",
      "\"Dick was more than an iconic leader in Lazard's history \u2014 he was a testament to how wisdom, warmth, and unwavering judgment could shape not just companies, but people's lives,\" the company said. \"His legacy lives on in the countless leaders he counseled, the institutions he renewed, and the doors he opened for others.\"",
      "Parsons was known as a skilled negotiator, a diplomat and a crisis manager.",
      "Although he was with Time Warner through its difficulties with AOL, he earned respect for the company and rebuilt its relations with Wall Street. He streamlined Time Warner's structure, pared debt and sold Warner Music Group and a book publishing division.",
      "He also fended off a challenge from activist investor Carl Icahn in 2006 to break up the company and helped Time Warner reach settlements with investors and regulators over questionable accounting practices at AOL.",
      "Parsons joined Time Warner as president in 1995 after serving as chairman and chief executive of Dime Bancorp Inc., one of the largest U.S. thrift institutions.",
      "In 2001, after AOL used its fortunes as the leading provider of Internet access in the U.S. to buy Time Warner for $106 billion in stock, Parsons became co-chief operating officer with AOL executive Robert Pittman. In that role, he was in charge of the company's content businesses, including movie studios and recorded music.",
      "He became CEO in 2002 with the retirement of Gerald Levin, one of the key architects of that merger. Parsons was named Time Warner chairman the following year, replacing AOL founder Steve Case, who had also championed the combination.",
      "The newly formed company's internet division quickly became a drag on Time Warner. The promised synergies between traditional and new media never materialized. AOL began seeing a reduction in subscribers in 2002 as Americans replaced dial-up connections with broadband from cable TV and phone companies.",
      "Parsons stepped down as CEO in 2007 and as chairman in 2008. A year later AOL split from Time Warner and began trading as a separate company, following years of struggles to reinvent itself as a business focused on advertising and content. Time Warner is now owned by AT&T Inc.",
      "A board member of Citigroup and its predecessor, Citibank, since 1996, Parsons was named chairman in 2009 at a time of turmoil for the financial institution. Citigroup had suffered five straight quarters of losses and received $45 billion in government aid. Its board had been criticized for allowing the bank to invest so heavily in the risky housing market.",
      "Citigroup returned to profit under Parsons, starting in 2010, and would not have a quarterly loss again until the fourth quarter of 2017. Parsons retired from that job in 2012.",
      "In 2014 he stepped in as interim CEO of the Clippers until Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer took over later that year.",
      "Parsons, a Republican, previously worked as a lawyer for Nelson Rockefeller, a former Republican governor of New York, and in Gerald Ford's White House. Those early stints gave him grounding in politics and negotiations. He also was an economic adviser on President Barack Obama's transition team.",
      "Parsons, who loved jazz and co-owned a Harlem jazz club, also served as chairman of the Apollo Theater and the Jazz Foundation of America. And he held positions on the boards of the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture, the American Museum of Natural History and the Museum of Modern Art in New York City.",

    "story": [
      "An anti-money laundering law called the Corporate Transparency Act, or CTA, is now back in action after a Dec. 23 court ruling that will require millions of small business owners to register with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or FinCEN, by mid-January, or potentially pay fines of up to $10,000.",
      "The registration rule had been on hold since Dec. 3, when a federal court in Texas issued a preliminary injunction prohibiting its enforcement. But on Monday, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals lifted the order, ruling that the decision is in the \"public's urgent interest in combating financial crime and protecting our country's national security.\"",
      "The CTA requires that the owners and part-owners of an estimated 32.6 million small businesses must register personal information with FinCEN, such as a photo ID and home address, by Jan. 1. With the court ruling that enforcement can proceed, many small business owners may scramble to register ahead of deadline, although FinCEN said on Dec. 23 that it is extending the deadline until Jan. 13 due to the late December court ruling.",
      "\"Reporting companies that were created or registered prior to Jan. 1, 2024 have until Jan. 13, 2025 to file their initial beneficial ownership information reports with FinCEN,\" the agency said in a statement. \"These companies would otherwise have been required to report by Jan. 1, 2025.\"",
      "Some business associations say the extension still doesn't give business owners enough time to meet the deadline.",
      "\"We are greatly concerned that a mere two-week extension does not provide enough time for millions of American businesses to comply with the law,\" Mark Eisele, president of the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, wrote to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen in a Dec. 24 letter. \"At minimum, we request Treasury provide a one-year delay to allow for greater education and outreach to small businesses across rural America.\"",
      "And some civil liberties groups decried the ruling, saying that the regulation represents governmental overreach.",
      "\"The government cannot be allowed to maintain this unconstitutional statute, which stretches beyond Congress's proper authority to regulate Americans,\" said the New Civil Liberties Alliance, a civil rights group, said in a statement emailed to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "In an email to CBS MoneyWatch, a FinCEN spokesperson said the appeals court ruling \"underscores the importance and urgency of the Corporate Transparency Act for national security.\"",
      "\"The Corporate Transparency Act levels the playing field for tens of millions of law-abiding small businesses across the United States and makes it harder for bad actors to exploit loopholes in order to gain an unfair advantage,\" the spokesperson added.",
      "Here's what to know about the ruling and the CTA.",
      "What is the Corporate Transparency Act, or CTA?",
      "The CTA, an anti-money laundering statute passed in 2021, was intended to get a look inside shell companies and crack down on attempts by \"criminals, organized crime rings, and other illicit actors to hide their identities and launder their money through the financial system,\" Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in 2022.",
      "The rules first became effective in 2024, but gave existing businesses until Jan.1, 2025, to register, while businesses that began this year have 90 days to register.",
      "FinCEN is a bureau within the U.S. Department of the Treasury that investigates money laundering and other illegal financial activities.",
      "What is the CTA's beneficial ownership information rule, or BOI?",

      "Your company's full legal name.Its business address (P.O. boxes or lawyers' offices aren't accepted, the Chamber of Commerce says).\u00a0The state where the company was formed or first registered.A\u00a0taxpayer identification number\u00a0and an identity document, such as a filed Articles of Incorporation.Beneficial owners' full legal names and birth dates.Beneficial owners' home addresses.A photocopy of beneficial owners' U.S. driver's license or passport.",

    "summary": "Toy stores and the toy industry are warning that Trump's pledge to add tariffs to Chinese imports could harm their businesses.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump is pledging to slap new tariffs on imports after he's inaugurated next month \u2014 a vow that's prompting the toy industry to warn about the impact.",
      "Even if toys are designed in Europe or the U.S., they are frequently manufactured in China, a nation whose exports Trump last month threatened to target with a new 10% tariff as soon as he takes office. On the campaign trail, he floated the idea of a tariff of up to 60% on all Chinese goods. Nearly 80% of U.S. toys are manufactured in China, according to The Toy Association, an industry group.",
      "If Trump carries through with his tariff plan, toy prices would rise \"probably instantly,\" Jennifer Bergman, the owner of New York City's West Side Kids told CBS News. She estimates that about 90% of the toys she sells are made in China.",
      "To be sure, the toy industry isn't alone in fretting about the impact of Trump's promised tariffs, as higher prices on a broad range of imports would likely be passed onto consumers. After more than four decades serving the neighborhood, Bergman fears that higher prices may threaten her shop's survival and impact her customers.",
      "\"It would be heartbreaking,\" she said. \"It would be a real loss for the community. It would be a real loss for me. I can't really imagine not being here.\"",
      "If Trump follows through on his tariff plans, American consumers stand to lose as much as $78 billion in spending power annually on products, including apparel, toys, furniture, household appliances, footwear and travel goods, the National Retail Federation stated in findings released last month.",
      "The toy industry is also sounding the alarm, with the Toy Association calling the potential tariffs \"significantly harmful\" and urging its members to contact their Congressional delegates to express their concern.",
      "Tariffs are essentially a tax on imports, but rather than being paid by the exporting country or company, the levy is paid by the importer \u2014 and much of that is handed off to consumers in the form of higher prices.",
      "\"A tariff of 60% on China would be a major shock to international goods markets,\" experts at the Peterson Institute for International Economics wrote in a Dec. 12 blog post.",
      "The toy industry would be one of the U.S. industries facing the worst impacts because China is the dominant supplier to the U.S., they added.",
      "\"While toys seem like products for which substitute sellers would be readily available, China maintains a dominant position in toy production for several reasons, including its not-easily-reproduced capacity to produce materials that meet US product safety standards,\" they noted.",
      "Still, some economists say Trump could use the threat of tariffs as a bargaining tool, without actually implementing the import duties. And tariffs could also encourage more U.S. manufacturing of toys and other products, although that would likely take time for new factories to ramp up.",

      "Northwest Naturals issued a voluntary recall for a batch of pet food after a cat died of bird flu in Oregon, officials said.",

      "\"We are confident that this cat contracted H5N1 by eating the Northwest Naturals raw and frozen pet food,\" Oregon Department of Agriculture State Veterinarian Dr. Ryan Scholz said in a Tuesday release. \"This cat was strictly an indoor cat; it was not exposed to the virus in its environment, and results from the genome sequencing confirmed that the virus recovered from the raw pet food and infected cat were exact matches to each other.\"",
      "Can pets transmit bird flu to owners?",
      "Oregon officials are monitoring household members who had contact with the cat to see if they develop any flu symptoms, but no human cases of bird flu were identified as of Tuesday and the risk of transmission to humans remains low in the state.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that it's unlikely for a pet owner to get sick with bird flu through direct contact with an infected pet, but it is possible. The health agency noted that in 2016, the spread of bird flu from a cat to a person was reported in New York City. The infected individual, a veterinarian, had mild flu symptoms after prolonged exposure to sick cats without using personal protective equipment.",
      "Oregon's Department of Agriculture said the cat death is a reminder that giving raw meat products to pets can lead to illness.",

      "The pet food was sold through distributors in Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Washington. The food was also sold in British Columbia in Canada.",

A U.S. official familiar with the matter, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the private report, said some federal agencies represented on the panel were skeptical that allowing a Japanese company to buy an American-owned steelmaker would create national security risks.",

It would become a subsidiary of Nippon Steel, and the combined company would be among the top three steel-producing companies in the world, according to 2023 figures from the World Steel Association.",
      "Mr. Biden, backed by the United Steelworkers, said earlier this year that it was \"vital for (U.S. Steel) to remain an American steel company that is domestically owned and operated.\"",
      "Trump has also opposed the acquisition and vowed earlier this month on his Truth Social platform to \"block this deal from happening.\" Trump proposed to revive U.S. Steel's flagging fortunes \"through a series of Tax Incentives and Tariffs.\"",
      "The steelworkers union has said it doesn't believe Nippon Steel would keep jobs at unionized plants, make good on collectively bargained benefits or protect American steel production from cheap foreign imports.",
      "\"Our union has been calling for strict government scrutiny of the sale since it was announced. Now it's up to President Biden to determine the best path forward,\" David McCall, the steelworkers' president, said in a statement Monday. \"We continue to believe that means keeping U.S. Steel domestically owned and operated.\"",
      "In the face of political opposition, Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel had waged a public relations campaign to win over skeptics.",
      "U.S. Steel said in a statement Monday that the deal \"is the best way, by far, to ensure that U.S. Steel, including its employees, communities, and customers, will thrive well into the future.\"",
      "A growing number of conservatives had publicly backed the deal, as Nippon Steel began to win over some steelworkers union members and local officials around its blast furnaces in Pennsylvania and Indiana. Many backers said Nippon Steel has a stronger financial balance sheet than rival Cleveland-Cliffs to invest the necessary cash to upgrade aging U.S. Steel blast furnaces.",
      "Nippon Steel pledged to invest $2.7 billion in United Steelworkers-represented facilities, including U.S. Steel's blast furnaces, and promised not to import steel slabs that would compete with the blast furnaces.",
      "It also pledged to protect U.S. Steel in trade matters and to not lay off employees or close plants during the term of the basic labor agreement. Earlier this month, it offered $5,000 in closing bonuses to U.S. Steel employees, a nearly $100 million expense.",
      "Nippon Steel also said it was best positioned to help American steel compete in an industry dominated by the Chinese.",
      "In a statement Tuesday to CBS News, the company urged the president \"to reflect on the great lengths that we have gone to address any national security concerns that have been raised and the significant commitments we have made to grow U.S. Steel, protect American jobs, and strengthen the entire American steel industry, which will enhance American national security.\"",
      "The proposed sale came during a tide of renewed political support for rebuilding America's manufacturing sector, a presidential campaign in which Pennsylvania was a prime battleground, and a long stretch of protectionist U.S. tariffs that analysts say has helped reinvigorate domestic steel.",
      "Chaired by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, CFIUS screens business deals between U.S. firms and foreign investors and can block sales or force parties to change the terms of an agreement for the purpose of protecting national security.",
      "The committee's powers were significantly expanded in 2018 through an act of Congress called the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act, known as FIRRMA.",
      "In September, Mr. Biden issued an executive order that expands the factors that the committee should consider when reviewing deals \u2014 such as how the deal impacts the U.S. supply chain or puts Americans' sensitive personal data at risk.",
      "Nippon Steel already has manufacturing operations in the U.S., Mexico, China and Southeast Asia. It supplies the world's top automakers, including Toyota Motor Corp., and makes steel for railways, pipes, appliances and skyscrapers.",

      "The streaming giant agreed to a three-year contract in May to carry Christmas Day games.",
      "Netflix's 282.3 million subscribers in over 190 countries will be able to stream the games, marking the first time one outlet has distributed an NFL game globally. Netflix will have the games available in five languages - English, French, Spanish, Portuguese, and German.",

NFL policy dictates that games on cable or being exclusively streamed must also be on an over-the-air station in the competing teams' markets. It will also be available on mobile devices in the U.S. for those who have NFL+.",
      "The biggest reason is money. The league is getting $150 million from Netflix for the two games this season. It also continues the NFL's moves into streaming - Thursday night games are in their third season on Amazon Prime Video and the \"Sunday Ticket\" package moved to YouTube TV last year.",

      "All four have clinched playoff spots in the AFC, but seeding remains up for grabs.",
      "Kansas City (14-1) can clinch the top seed - which would mean a first-round bye and home field throughout the playoffs - with a win over the Steelers. Pittsburgh and Baltimore are tied atop the AFC North at 10-5, with the Steelers holding the tiebreaker due to a better conference record.",
      "Houston (9-6) has wrapped up the AFC South and holds the fourth seed.",

Brandon Riegg, Netflix's vice president of nonfiction series and sports, said the system was stress-tested, and then some, during the Nov. 14 bout between Mike Tyson and Jake Paul, along with internet service providers who reported they were also overwhelmed by the surge that occurred before and during the fight.",

    "story": [
      "Nearly 3 million Americans will receive full Social Security benefits under legislation passed in the waning hours of the current Congress and now headed to President Biden, who is expected to sign into law.",
      "Senators voted 76-20 for the\u00a0Social Security Fairness Act, which would\u00a0eliminate two federal policies\u00a0that prevent nearly 3 million people, including police officers, firefighters, postal workers, teachers and others with a public pension, from collecting their full Social Security benefits. The legislation has been decades in the making, as the Senate held its first hearings into the policies in 2003.",
      "\"The Senate finally corrects a 50-year mistake,\" proclaimed Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat from New York, after senators approved the legislation at 12:15 a.m. Saturday.",
      "Democrats uniformly voted for the measure, while Republicans in the Senate were split, with 20 voting to pass it and 20 voting against it. Four senators did not vote, including California's Adam Schiff, a Democrat; Joe Manchin, an independent from West Virginia; and two Republicans \u2014 Marco Rubio of Florida and Vice President-Elect J.D. Vance of Ohio.",
      "Congressional passage came down to the wire. After garnering bipartisan approval in the U.S. House in November, Senate approval came at about 12:15 a.m. on Saturday, just ahead of a continuing resolution to keep the government\u00a0from shutting down. The votes marked the final ones cast by senators in the 118th Congress before the next Congress is sworn in on January 3.",
      "\"Social Security is a bedrock of our middle class. You pay into it for 40 quarters, you earned it, it should be there when you retire,\" Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat who lost his seat in the November election, told the chamber Wednesday ahead of one of multiple votes to advance the bill. \"All these workers are asking for is for what they earned.\"",
      "Senators rejected four amendments and a budgetary point of order that would have derailed the measure, given the small window of time left to pass it.",
      "Republicans who spoke against the bill largely objected to its cost, noting that the measure would accelerate the Social Security trust fund's projected insolvency by about six months, now estimated to be roughly a decade away. Senate supporters of the bill, including Louisiana Republican Bill Cassidy, argued that while Social Security's funding shortfall needs to be addressed, that shouldn't be done at the expense of retirees with public pensions.",
      "When will the Social Security Fairness Act go into effect",
      "Once signed into law, the legislation's effective date involves Social Security payments for months after December 2023, according to the text of the bill.\u00a0Still, calculating what folks are due, not to mention retroactive payments, may not be simple or quick.",
      "The new law would come at a time when the Social Security Administration is operating with its lowest staffing level in more than 50 years, or since 1972, with a hiring freeze recently put in place, a spokesperson noted. Congress rejected the White House budget office's request to increase its funding, first in September and again last week, leaving it flat.",
      "The bill's passage is \"a monumental victory for millions of public service workers who have been denied the full benefits they've rightfully earned,\" said Shannon Benton, executive director for the Senior Citizens League, which advocates for retirees and which has long pushed for the expansion of Social Security benefits. \"This legislation finally restores fairness to the system and ensures the hard work of teachers, first responders and countless public employees is truly recognized.\"",
      "What is the Social Security Fairness Act?",
      "The Social Security Fairness Act would repeal two federal policies \u2014 the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) and the Government Pension Offset (GPO) \u2014 that reduce Social Security payments to nearly 3 million retirees.",
      "That includes those who also collect pensions from state and federal jobs that aren't covered by Social Security, including teachers, police officers and U.S. postal workers. The bill would also end a second provision that reduces Social Security benefits for those workers' surviving spouses and family members. The WEP impacts about\u00a02 million\u00a0Social Security beneficiaries and the GPO nearly\u00a0800,000\u00a0retirees.",
      "The measure, which passed the House in November, had 62 cosponsors when it was introduced in the Senate last year. Yet the bill's bipartisan support eroded in recent days, with some Republican lawmakers voicing doubts due to its cost. According\u00a0to\u00a0the Congressional Budget Office, the proposed legislation would add a projected $195 billion to federal deficits over a decade.",
      "Vice President-elect JD Vance of Ohio was among the 24 Republican senators to join 49 Democrats to advance the measure in an initial procedural vote that took place Wednesday.",

Butter consumption, for example, grew 16% last November and December compared to the rest of 2023, according to USDA data. On average, Americans consumed 6.5 pounds of butter last year, a number that's been on the rise.",

Egg prices have skyrocketed 160% since 2019, due in part to shortages linked to several outbreaks of bird flu. Butter is more expensive by 29%, about in line with all grocery increases over the same period.",

      "Nate Chittenden starts his day taking care of nearly a thousand cows on his family's dairy farm, Dutch Hollow, in New York's Hudson Valley. His herd of Jersey cows, known for high-fat milk that goes into products like cheese, butter and ice cream, requires round-the-clock maintenance to stay healthy and maximize productivity.",
      "Chittenden, who runs the farm with his brothers and extended family, is able to pool resources with other farms as part of Cabot Creamery's co-op. Still, it can be a grueling business.",

      "How milk is priced",
      "Farmers often sell milk at a federally mandated price to producers who process it into fluid milk, butter, cheese or other dairy products. Around 15 cents of every retail dollar go to farms, and to keep things equitable the government sets the price from farms.",
      "\"When you spend a dollar [at the store], 85 cents of it is beyond the farm,\" said Michael Swanson, an agricultural economist at Wells Fargo's Agricultural Food Institute. Another 15% goes to processors, who turn milk into consumer products, and the remainder is spent on wholesaling, advertising and other costs.",
      "\"Milk doesn't stay good for very long. You have to eat it, sell it that day or get rid of it. So [the government] wants to make sure that everybody who sends milk to a processor buyer in a district gets the same price back,\" Swanson explained.",
      "Farmers can't directly charge more money for their product if their expenses climb, and many cite increased animal feed and labor costs as hits to their margins.",
      "\"It's a struggle every year,\" Chittenden said. \"We are one big mistake away from being bankrupted.\"",
      "Hope for the future",
      "Swanson said the tide may be turning for some farmers. Dairy retail prices for consumers have been stable for the past several months, though they are elevated from 2019 levels. Other key expenses are easing as well, with lower feed costs for the past year only now getting passed down to farmers.",
      "\"This year, the dairymen actually have, year to date, 10% more revenue,\" compared to in 2023, Swanson said. Although labor \"never gets cheaper,\" he added that many farmers could be set up for a strong 2025. \"They're in a much better position right now in early December than they were a year ago,\" Swanson said.",
      "Still, for small family farms like Chittenden's, every day is a challenge \u2014 one that requires grit and a determination to keep marching forward.",
      "\"No matter how rough a day we have, you get to the end of the day, you get home with your family and you say, we're gonna do better tomorrow,\" Chittenden said. \"I don't need a pat on the back to do this job, you know, but I need people to understand what it takes to do this job.\""

    "published": "Mon, 23 Dec 2024 12:45:42 -0500",
    "summary": "Starbucks baristas and Amazon delivery drivers are on strike in handful of U.S. cities as they seek wage increases.",
    "story": [
      "Starbucks workers' strikes expanded on Saturday to include stores in Denver; Philadelphia; Pittsburgh and Columbus, Ohio, Union leaders said.",
      "Starbucks Workers United, the union that has organized workers at 535 company-owned U.S. stores since 2021, launched strikes that started Friday in Chicago, Los Angeles and Seattle, to protest a lack of progress in contract negotiations with the company.",
      "According to the union, the company has failed to honor a commitment made in February to reach a labor agreement this year. Workers United has said the latest strikes could spread to hundreds of stores across the country by Christmas Eve.",
      "Starbucks proposed an economic package with no new wage increases for unionized baristas now and a 1.5% increase in future years, the union said Friday.",
      "In a post Sunday on X, the union said that picket lines had expanded to Brooklyn and Long Island in New York, St. Louis and Pittsburgh. Without providing a specific number, labor leaders said dozens of Starbucks stores are now affected by the strike. On Monday, baristas at several Philadelphia Starbucks locations joined the nationwide strike\u00a0against the company as well.",
      "\"We were ready to bring the foundational framework home this year, but Starbucks wasn't,\" Lynne Fox, president of Workers United said in a statement. \"After all Starbucks has said about how they value partners throughout the system, we refuse to accept zero immediate investment in baristas' wages and no resolution of the hundreds of outstanding unfair labor practices.\"",
      "Starbucks said Workers United prematurely ended a bargaining session this week. The company also says it already offers pay and benefits worth $30 per hour for baristas who work at least 20 hours per week.",
      "Strikes at Starbucks and Amazon",
      "The union also wants Starbucks to resolve outstanding legal issues, including hundreds of unfair labor practice charges that workers have filed with the National Labor Relations Board. The agency also has opened or settled hundreds of charges against Amazon. On Thursday, a day before the Starbucks walkouts, the Teamsters union\u00a0announced strikes\u00a0at seven Amazon delivery hubs.",
      "Amazon delivery drivers and Starbucks baristas are on strike in a handful of U.S. cities as they seek to exert pressure on the two major companies to recognize them as unionized employees or to meet demands for an inaugural labor contract.",
      "The strikes that started Thursday and Friday followed other recent standoffs between corporate America and organized labor. Large and established labor unions secured meaningful employer concessions this year following strikes by Boeing factory workers, dockworkers at East and Gulf coast ports, video game performers, and hotel and casino workers on the Las Vegas Strip.",
      "But workers at Starbucks, Amazon and some other prominent consumer brands still are fighting for their first contracts. Amazon refuses to acknowledge the organizing efforts of drivers and warehouse workers \u2014 many of whom have voted to unionize \u2014 even though the powerful Teamsters union says it represents them.",
      "The e-commerce giant says the delivery drivers, which the Teamsters have organized for more than a year, aren't its employees. Under its business model, the drivers work for third-party businesses, called Delivery Service Partners, who drop off millions of packages to customers every day.",
      "\"For more than a year now, the Teamsters have continued to intentionally mislead the public \u2014 claiming that they represent 'thousands of Amazon employees and drivers.' They don't, and this is another attempt to push a false narrative,\" Amazon spokesperson Kelly Nantel recently said in a statement.",
      "Meanwhile, Starbucks has long resisted the unionization of its stores, but had agreed to negotiate a contract by the end of the year.",
      "Strikes \u2014 particularly ones that happen during the holidays, a time of high economic activity \u2014 can help unions exercise leverage during negotiations or flex their muscles by garnering support from workers and sympathetic consumers.",
      "Wave of union efforts following COVID-19",
      "Both Amazon and Starbucks saw a wave of organizing efforts following the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic focused attention on front-line workers and the impact of economic inequality on the lives of wage-earning Americans.",
      "Employees organized at bookstores, where unions are rare, and were successful with campaigns at some stores run by Apple, Trader Joe's and the outdoor equipment company REI.",
      "But turning those wins into contracts can be a challenge. At Amazon and Starbucks, which were not unionized before the pandemic, workers have yet to secure an agreement with the e-commerce and coffee giants, which both have their headquarters in Seattle.",
      "Unions' last effort before Trump",
      "John Logan, director of labor and employment studies at San Francisco State University, said he thinks the Amazon and Starbucks workers are \"desperate\" to make progress before President-elect Donald Trump gets to appoint a Republican majority to the National Labor Relations Board, which is expected to be less friendly to unions during his administration.",
      "\"The unions want to make these disputes public and bring political pressures on the companies,\" Logan said in a written statement. \"If these disputes drag on until next year, and if they are fought largely through the labor board and the courts, the unions and workers will almost certainly lose. This might be their last, best chance to pressure the companies in public before Trump comes into office.\"",
      "However, Trump has also given some signs that he might be friendlier to labor during his second term compared to his first term. Last month, he picked Oregon Rep. Lori Chavez-DeRemer to lead the Department of Labor in his new administration, elevating a Republican congresswoman who has strong support from unions, including the Teamsters. Teamsters President Sean O'Brien also spoke at the Republican National Convention this past summer.",
      "The Teamsters say workers at Amazon are striking at seven delivery stations in Southern California, San Francisco, New York City, Atlanta and Skokie, Illinois, because the company ignored a Sunday deadline the union had set for contract negotiations. At midnight on Saturday, the Teamsters say workers will also strike at a prominent warehouse in New York, which voted to join the fledgling Amazon Labor Union in 2022 and have since elected to affiliate with the Teamsters.",
      "Union demands",
      "The prominent labor group says it's fighting for higher wages, better benefits and safer working conditions for Amazon employees, many of whom experience economic insecurity while working for a company worth $2.3 trillion. It has not said how many Amazon warehouse workers or drivers are joining the striking.",
      "The union has mainly focused on organizing delivery drivers, which the company says are not its workers because they are directly employed by contractors Amazon recruited to handle package deliveries.",
      "That type of setup gives the Amazon more cover from unionization attempts in an industry \u2014 transportation and trucking \u2014 that's dominated by the Teamsters. However, the union has argued before the National Labor Relations Board that the drivers, who wear Amazon's ubiquitous gray-blue vests and drive similarly colored vans, should be classified as company employees.",
      "Meanwhile, the online retailer has accused the union of pushing a \"false narrative\" about the thousands of workers it claims to represent. Amazon has also touted its pay, saying it provides warehouse and transportation employees a base wage of $22 per hour plus benefits. It also recently boosted hourly pay for the subcontracted delivery drivers.",
      "NLRB under Biden",
      "In September, the NLRB, which has taken a more pro-labor stance under President Joe Biden, filed a complaint that found the drivers to be joint employees of Amazon. The agency also accused Amazon of unlawfully failing to bargain with the Teamsters on a contract for drivers at a California delivery hub.",
      "The Teamsters union says it also represents Amazon warehouse workers, including thousands of employees at the major New York City fulfillment center who voted to be represented by the Amazon Labor Union.",
      "Amazon objected to the 2022 warehouse election results, alleging the Amazon Labor Union and the federal labor board had tainted the vote. A regional NLRB director issued a complaint last year that accused Amazon of violating the law by refusing to bargain with the union.",
      "Amazon, in turn, is challenging the constitutionality of the NLRB in federal court along with Elon Musk's SpaceX. In June, the Supreme Court made it harder for the agency to win court orders in labor disputes, siding with Starbucks in a case brought by the company.",
      "Unlike Amazon, contract negotiation have been underway at Starbucks. The coffee chain's workers walked off the job on two occasions last year.",
      "Patricia Campos-Medina, who recently ran for the U.S. Senate as a Democrat in New Jersey and leads Cornell University's Worker Institute at the School of Industrial and Labor Relations, said she expects there to be more union activity before Trump takes office.",
      "Trump's reactions will give the public a chance to see what his \"commitments are to the working class,\" Campos-Medina said.",

    "story": [
      "Century-old department store Nordstrom has agreed to be acquired and taken private by Nordstrom family members and a Mexican retail group in a $6.25 billion deal that comes as department stores are facing pressure from discount chains and other competition.",
      "Nordstrom shareholders will receive $24.25 in cash for each share of Nordstrom common stock they own, or about $4 billion in all, representing a 42% premium on the company's stock as of March 18, which is the day before media reports of a potential transaction began to circulate. The Nordstroms will also pick up more than $2 billion in debt.",
      "As a private business, the Nordstroms may have more leeway in reviving a department store chain that, like others, has looked to revive lackluster sales for years. Other publicly traded retailers, including Macy's and Kohl's, have faced pressure from major investors in order to provide bigger returns to investors, while also attempting to fend off competition from lower-cost rivals such as Walmart and Amazon.com.",
      "\"While a change in ownership does not automatically remedy all of the problems with the department store operation, it will allow the family and their backers to take a long term view of the business and make necessary investments and changes away from the short term scrutiny of public markets,\" noted GlobalData analyst Neil Saunders in a Monday research note.",
      "He added, \"The [Nordstrom] family have the talent and ability to enact change as does El Puerto de Liverpool. They will likely run the business as a retailer rather than as some kind of financial play thing which, in our view, is a very positive thing for the long term health of the brand.\"",
      "Shares of Nordstrom fell 36 cents, or 1.5%, to $24.17 in late morning trading.",
      "Nordstrom family, El Puerto de Liverpool's offer",
      "That offer announced Monday tops the previous $23-per-share bid that the Nordstrom family and Mexican retail group, El Puerto de Liverpool, made in September.",
      "The board also plans to authorize a special dividend of up to 25 cents per share, based on Nordstrom's cash on hand immediately prior to and contingent on the close of the transaction.",
      "The deal is expected to close in the first half of 2025, at which time the company's shares will no longer trade publicly.",
      "Nordstrom's board of directors unanimously approved the the proposed transaction, with members Erik and Pete Nordstrom, part of the Nordstrom family taking over the company \u2014 recusing themselves from that vote.",
      "Following the close of the transaction, the Nordstrom family will have a majority ownership stake in the company. Erik and Pete Nordstrom are the fourth-generation leadership at the Seattle retailer, which was founded in 1901 as a shoe store. Erik is the company's chief executive and Peter is president.",
      "After opening 23 new stores so far this year, the company now operates a combined 381 Nordstrom and Nordstrom Rack stores in the U.S."

      "Tokyo \u2014 Japanese automakers Honda and Nissan have announced plans to join forces, forming world's third-largest automaker by sales as the industry undergoes dramatic changes in its transition away from fossil fuels.",
      "The two companies said they had signed a memorandum of understanding on Monday and that smaller Nissan alliance member Mitsubishi Motors also had agreed to join the talks on integrating their businesses.",
      "\"We anticipate that if this integration comes to fruition, we will be able to deliver even greater value to a wider customer base,\" Nissan's CEO Makoto Uchida said in a statement.",
      "Automakers in Japan have lagged behind their big rivals in electric vehicles and are trying to cut costs and make up for lost time.",
      "News of a possible merger surfaced earlier this month, with unconfirmed reports saying that the talks on closer collaboration partly were driven by aspirations of Taiwan iPhone maker Foxconn to tie up with Nissan, which has an alliance with Renault SA of France and Mitsubishi.",
      "A merger could result in a behemoth worth more than $50 billion based on the market capitalization of all three automakers. Together, Honda and the Nissan alliance with Renault SA of France and smaller automaker Mitsubishi Motors Corp. would gain scale to compete with Toyota Motor Corp. and with Germany's Volkswagen AG. Toyota has technology partnerships with Japan's Mazda Motor Corp. and Subaru Corp.",
      "Even after a merger Toyota, which rolled out 11.5 million vehicles in 2023, would remain the leading Japanese automaker. If they join, the three smaller companies would make about 8 million vehicles. In 2023, Honda made 4 million and Nissan produced 3.4 million. Mitsubishi Motors made just over 1 million.",
      "Nissan, Honda and Mitsubishi announced in August that they would share components for electric vehicles like batteries and jointly research software for autonomous driving to adapt better to dramatic changes centered around electrification, following a preliminary agreement between Nissan and Honda set in March.",
      "Honda, Japan's second-largest automaker, is widely viewed as the only likely Japanese partner able to effect a rescue of Nissan, which has struggled following a scandal that began with the arrest of its former chairman Carlos Ghosn in late 2018 on charges of fraud and misuse of company assets, allegations that he denies. He eventually was released on bail and fled to Lebanon.",
      "Speaking Monday to reporters in Tokyo via a video link, Ghosn derided the planned merger as a \"desperate move.\"",
      "From Nissan, Honda could get truck-based body-on-frame large SUVs such as the Armada and Infiniti QX80 that Honda doesn't have, with large towing capacities and good off-road performance, Sam Fiorani, vice president of AutoForecast Solutions, told The Associated Press.",
      "Nissan also has years of experience building batteries and electric vehicles, and gas-electric hybird powertrains that could help Honda in developing its own EVs and next generation of hybrids, he said.",
      "But the company said in November that it was slashing 9,000 jobs, or about 6% of its global work force, and reducing its global production capacity by 20% after reporting a quarterly loss of 9.3 billion yen ($61 million).",
      "It recently reshuffled its management and Makoto Uchida, its chief executive, took a 50% pay cut to take responsibility for the financial woes, saying Nissan needed to become more efficient and respond better to market tastes, rising costs and other global changes.",
      "Fitch Ratings recently downgraded Nissan's credit outlook to \"negative,\" citing worsening profitability, partly due to price cuts in the North American market. But it noted that it has a strong financial structure and solid cash reserves that amounted to 1.44 trillion yen ($9.4 billion).",
      "Nissan's share price also has fallen to the point where it is considered something of a bargain.",
      "On Monday, its Tokyo-traded shares gained 1.6%. They jumped more than 20% after news of the possible merger broke last week.",
      "Honda's shares surged 3.8%. Honda's net profit slipped nearly 20% in the first half of the April-March fiscal year from a year earlier, as sales suffered in China.",

    "published": "Thu, 26 Dec 2024 10:59:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Here's what to know about the United States' involvement with building and operating the Panama Canal.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump has repeatedly suggested the United States take over the Panama Canal, a shipping waterway that cuts across Central America, unless fees for using the canal are lowered.",
      "Panama's leader shot back in a recent statement, saying the waterway is not for sale. Since then, Trump has posted repeatedly about the canal.",
      "It's the latest in a series of similar statements from Trump, who recently suggested the United States take over Greenland, an idea he also floated during his first presidency. He's also joked about Canada\u00a0being a U.S. state.",
      "Here's what to know about the history of the Panama Canal and the United States' involvement with the shipping lane.",
      "History of the Panama Canal",
      "The Panama Canal was built by the United States between 1904 and 1913, and opened in 1917. Building the canal cost about $375 million, making it the most expensive construction project in U.S. history at that time, according to the Panama Canal Authority. Thousands of laborers died during the grueling construction process.",
      "The canal connects the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, offering ships a shortcut to avoid going around the tip of South America. The canal revolutionized shipping traffic in the region.",
      "The U.S. acquired the rights to build and operate the canal in the early 20th century, but at the time, Panama was in the process of seceding from Colombia, whose senate was refusing to ratify a treaty that would allow the canal to be built, according to the\u00a0State Department's Office of the Historian.",
      "To ensure the canal could be built, then-President Theodore Roosevelt supported Panamanian independence, and in 1903, the U.S. and Panama signed a treaty that established permanent U.S. rights to a \"Panama Canal Zone\" that stretched across the nation. However, the person who negotiated on Panama's behalf did not have formal consent from the nation's government and had not lived in the country for 17 years, causing many Panamanians to question the treaty's validity, according to the Office of the Historian.",
      "Throughout the 20th century, the U.S. and Panama dealt with tensions surrounding the canal, including a riot in the 1960s that led to a brief disruption in diplomatic relations between the countries. In 1967, the U.S. and Panama began negotiating a new treaty, eventually reaching an agreement, but a change in elected leaders and a coup in Panama led to the establishment of a new government in the Central American nation, according to the Office of the Historian. Because of that, the negotiations \"suffered a major setback.\"",
      "Negotiations continued through the '70s. When Jimmy Carter was elected president, he made concluding the negotiation process a priority, and in 1977, two treaties were submitted to the U.S. Senate: the Neutrality Treaty, which said the U.S. could use its military to defend the canal, allowing \"perpetual U.S. usage\" of the waterway, and the Panama Canal Treaty, which would end the existence of the Panama Canal Zone and allow the canal to be turned over to Panama in December 1999. As part of the second treaty, Panama would also become primarily responsible for defending the canal.",
      "The treaties, collectively known as the Torrijos-Carter Treaties, were signed on Sept. 7, 1977. In the spring of 1978, the U.S. Senate voted to ratify the treaties, and Carter signed them into law on Sept. 27, 1979. The canal was transferred to Panama on Dec. 31, 1999, during the Clinton administration.",
      "Who operates the Panama Canal?",
      "The Panama Canal has been owned and operated by the Panama Canal Authority, a government-owned agency, since 1999. The agency was established shortly before the canal was returned to Panama.",
      "Since taking control of the waterway, the Panama Canal Authority has invested billions in expanding the canal. A $5.25 billion expansion of the canal opened in 2016, doubling the waterway's capacity and cutting global maritime costs by an estimated $8 billion a year, CBS News previously reported. The expansion also allowed larger ships to pass.",
      "Who uses the Panama Canal?",
      "About 40% of the world's cargo ship traffic moves through the Panama Canal, CBS News previously reported, though recent droughts have forced operators to reduce ship crossings.",
      "About two-thirds of the traffic in the canal is either headed for or leaving the United States, though ships from all over the world use the waterway each day, according to the Panama Canal Authority.",
      "Between 13,000 and 14,000 ships use the canal each year, the agency said.",
      "Trump and Panamanian president clash",
      "Trump first seemed to suggest the United States should take over the Panama Canal in a TruthSocial post on December 21.",
      "He also raised the issue to a crowd of supporters at Turning Point's\u00a0AmericaFest\u00a0on Sunday, where he said Panama is charging \"exorbitant prices\" and said the \"complete ripoff of our country will immediately stop.\"",
      "\"If the principles, both moral and legal, of this magnanimous gesture of giving, are not followed, then we will demand that the Panama Canal be returned to the United States of America, in full, quickly and without question,\" Trump said.",
      "On Wednesday, Trump said he would nominate Miami-Dade International Trade Consortium member Kevin Marino Cabrera to be the U.S. ambassador to Panama. In that\u00a0announcement, he accused Panama of \"ripping us off on the Panama Canal, far beyond their wildest dream.\"",
      "Trump continued to post online about the U.S. regaining ownership of the canal, and referenced the canal in a Christmas Day message shared on TruthSocial. He warned of potential influence from China at the shipping waterway, though there is no Chinese presence at the canal, according to\u00a0Reuters. A Hong Kong-based company manages two ports along the canal, Reuters said.",
      "Panama President Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino said in a statement shared on social media that \"every square meter\" of the canal \"belongs to Panama and will continue belonging to Panama.\"",
      "\"We'll see about that!\" Trump wrote online in response.",
      "Mulino responded to Trump again in a news conference on Thursday, saying that \"anyone in the world is free to visit the canal\" and adding that \"there is not a single Chinese soldier in the canal, and on the other hand, there will not be, and we maintain a respectful, well-managed relationship with China.\" Mulino hosts weekly news conferences.",
      "Mulino said that while there are \"delicate problems such as immigration\" that both he and Trump \"are concerned about as presidents,\" the two leaders have \"nothing to discuss\" as far as ownership of the Panama Canal.",
      "\"The specific approach, the Canal is Panamanian and belongs to Panamanians, there is no possibility of opening any kind of conversation about this reality that has cost the country tears, sweat and blood to achieve,\" Mulino said.",

      "Washington \u2014 Marianne Williamson, a self-help author who twice ran for president, announced Thursday that she is running for chair of the Democratic National Committee.",
      "In an open letter to DNC members posted online, Williamson laid out her plan for the party as it seeks to move forward after losing the White House and Senate in November. She urged Democrats to sign a petition to allow her to participate in candidate forums that will be held in January.",
      "DNC members will elect the party's new chair and other officers at its winter meeting Feb. 1. There will also be a series of four forums to allow those running for DNC chair to speak with party members and lay out their vision for the Democratic Party.",
      "\"As chairwoman, I will work to reinvent the party from the inside out,\" Williamson wrote in her pitch to DNC members. \"For if we want a new president in four years, and a new Congress in two, then we must immediately get about the task of creating a new party.\"",
      "She said under her plan, the Democratic Party will be one that \"listens more, and makes people feel that their thoughts and feelings are as important as their wallets\" and \"advocates unequivocally for the working people of the United States.\" Williamson said the party will have \"the humility to recognize we need to look in the mirror, and be willing to reinvent ourselves.\"",
      "\"We won't just fight; we will inspire. We will create a surge of patriotic fervor, and a connectedness of the American heart to the great historical legacy of this country,\" she wrote. \"Our ultimate success will be creating in people's minds a sense that in order to further that legacy, your smartest move is to vote for Democrats.\"",

      "Ryan Wesley Routh's trial will begin Sept. 8, 2025 instead of the previously scheduled Feb. 10, 2025 start date, U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon said in an order released on Monday.",
      "Routh, 58, a Hawaii resident, has pleaded not guilty.",
      "Routh's attorneys had asked the judge to delay the trial until no earlier than next December, saying they needed more time to review the evidence against him and decide whether to mount an insanity defense.",
      "Routh owned 17 cellphones and numerous other electronic devices, and there are hundreds of hours of police body camera and surveillance videos that have been provided to the defense, Routh's attorneys argued during a hearing two weeks ago in Fort Pierce, Florida.",
      "In her order, Cannon said she wanted to err on the side of providing more time given the seriousness of the allegations, but that starting the trial no earlier than December would be an excessive amount. A September trial date didn't amount to an \"unreasonable delay,\" she said.",
      "The judge said that any insanity defense or any request related to Routh's mental competency must be made by early February. Any visit to the scene of the assassination attempt must be made by the end of February.",
      "Prosecutors say Routh methodically plotted to kill Trump for weeks before aiming a rifle through the shrubbery as Trump played golf on Sept. 15, 2024 at his West Palm Beach country club. Before Trump came into view, Routh was spotted by a Secret Service agent. Routh allegedly aimed his rifle at the agent, who opened fire, causing Routh to drop his weapon and flee without firing a shot. Prosecutors say he left behind a note describing his intentions.",

    "summary": "President Biden signed legislation Christmas Eve to make the bald eagle officially the U.S. national bird.",
    "story": [
      "The bald eagle is emblematic of America. It's on coins and bills, graces the Great Seal and inspired conservation efforts that brought the species back from the brink of extinction. Though it was first used as the national symbol more than 240 years ago, Congress had never made it official.",
      "That changed earlier this year. And on Christmas Eve,\u00a0President Biden signed\u00a0the legislation declaring the bald eagle the official national bird.",
      "\"For nearly 250 years, we called the bald eagle the national bird when it wasn't,\" said Jack Davis, co-chair of the National Bird Initiative for the National Eagle Center, in a release. \"But now the title is official, and no bird is more deserving.\"",
      "It's been a long road for Haliaeetus leucocephalus, the bald eagle's scientific name, known for its striking white head and yellow beak atop its brown body. Native to the U.S., populations of the bird \u2014 which eats fish and carrion, but was also known to prey on livestock, according to the Fish and Wildlife Service \u2014 first declined due to habitat and prey loss.",
      "But it was the introduction of the pesticide DDT that contributed to the birds' near-disappearance in the 20th century. When the birds ate fish that had been exposed to the chemical, they laid eggs with weak shells. Those eggs didn't survive incubation, and populations declined to a mere 417 nesting pairs by 1963, according to the Fish and Wildlife Service.",
      "The U.S. banned DDT in 1972 and, a few years later, declared bald eagles endangered. Over the next few decades, the bald eagle\u00a0populations recovered. By 2007, there were nearly 10,000 nesting pairs in the U.S. and bald eagles were removed from the endangered species list.",
      "The Fish and Wildlife Service puts the number of bald eagles in recent years in the hundreds of thousands. In recent years, bald eagles have charmed\u00a0birdwatchers in the heart of New York City, and eagle cams have popped up at the National Arboretum in Washington, D.C., at U.S. Steel in Pennsylvania and in California's Big Bear Valley.",
      "The legislation\u00a0designating the bald eagle as the U.S. national bird was spearheaded by Minnesota legislators. The state is home to what Sen. Amy Klobuchar described as one of the nation's largest bald eagle populations.",

      "Mr. Biden said his administration strongly opposes the provision because it targets a group based on gender identity and \"interferes with parents' roles to determine the best care for their children.\" He said it also undermines the all-volunteer military's ability to recruit and retain talent.",

      "The legislation also directs resources towards a more confrontational approach to China, including establishing a fund that could be used to send military resources to Taiwan in much the same way that the U.S. has backed Ukraine.

    "summary": "A government panel has failed to reach consensus on the possible national security risks of a nearly $15 billion proposed deal for Nippon Steel to purchase U.S. Steel.",
    "story": [
      "A powerful government panel on Monday failed to reach consensus on the possible national security risks of a nearly $15 billion proposed deal for Nippon Steel of Japan to purchase U.S. Steel, leaving a decision to President Joe Biden, a longtime opponent of the deal.",
      "The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, known as CFIUS, sent its long-awaited report on the merger to Mr. Biden, who formally came out against the deal in March of this year and now has 15 days to reach a final decision, the White House said. A U.S. official familiar with the matter, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the private report, said some federal agencies represented on the panel were skeptical that allowing a Japanese company to buy an American-owned steelmaker would create national security risks.",
      "Both Mr. Biden and President-elect Donald Trump courted unionized workers at U.S. Steel and vowed to block the acquisition amid concerns about foreign ownership of a flagship American company. The economic risk, however, is that Nippon Steel also has the financial resources to invest in the mills and upgrade them, possibly helping to preserve steel production within the United States.",
      "The interagency committee reviews such deals with an eye toward potential national security risks. Monday was the deadline to approve the deal, recommend that Mr. Biden block it or extend the review process.",
      "The Washington Post earlier reported CFIUS' submission of its report.",
      "Under the terms of the approximately\u00a0$14.9 billion all-cash deal, U.S. Steel would keep its name and its headquarters in Pittsburgh, where it was founded in 1901 by J.P. Morgan and Andrew Carnegie. It would become a subsidiary of Nippon Steel, and the combined company would be among the top three steel-producing companies in the world, according to 2023 figures from the World Steel Association.",
      "Mr. Biden, backed by the United Steelworkers, said earlier this year that it was \"vital for (U.S. Steel) to remain an American steel company that is domestically owned and operated.\"",
      "Trump has also opposed the acquisition and vowed earlier this month on his Truth Social platform to \"block this deal from happening.\" Trump proposed to revive U.S. Steel's flagging fortunes \"through a series of Tax Incentives and Tariffs.\"",
      "The steelworkers union has said it doesn't believe Nippon Steel would keep jobs at unionized plants, make good on collectively bargained benefits or protect American steel production from cheap foreign imports.",
      "\"Our union has been calling for strict government scrutiny of the sale since it was announced. Now it's up to President Biden to determine the best path forward,\" David McCall, the steelworkers' president, said in a statement Monday. \"We continue to believe that means keeping U.S. Steel domestically owned and operated.\"",
      "In the face of political opposition, Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel had waged a public relations campaign to win over skeptics.",
      "U.S. Steel said in a statement Monday that the deal \"is the best way, by far, to ensure that U.S. Steel, including its employees, communities, and customers, will thrive well into the future.\"",
      "A growing number of conservatives had publicly backed the deal, as Nippon Steel began to win over some steelworkers union members and local officials around its blast furnaces in Pennsylvania and Indiana. Many backers said Nippon Steel has a stronger financial balance sheet than rival Cleveland-Cliffs to invest the necessary cash to upgrade aging U.S. Steel blast furnaces.",
      "Nippon Steel pledged to invest $2.7 billion in United Steelworkers-represented facilities, including U.S. Steel's blast furnaces, and promised not to import steel slabs that would compete with the blast furnaces.",
      "It also pledged to protect U.S. Steel in trade matters and to not lay off employees or close plants during the term of the basic labor agreement. Earlier this month, it offered $5,000 in closing bonuses to U.S. Steel employees, a nearly $100 million expense.",
      "Nippon Steel also said it was best positioned to help American steel compete in an industry dominated by the Chinese.",
      "In a statement Tuesday to CBS News, the company urged the president \"to reflect on the great lengths that we have gone to address any national security concerns that have been raised and the significant commitments we have made to grow U.S. Steel, protect American jobs, and strengthen the entire American steel industry, which will enhance American national security.\"",
      "The proposed sale came during a tide of renewed political support for rebuilding America's manufacturing sector, a presidential campaign in which Pennsylvania was a prime battleground, and a long stretch of protectionist U.S. tariffs that analysts say has helped reinvigorate domestic steel.",
      "Chaired by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, CFIUS screens business deals between U.S. firms and foreign investors and can block sales or force parties to change the terms of an agreement for the purpose of protecting national security.",
      "The committee's powers were significantly expanded in 2018 through an act of Congress called the Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernization Act, known as FIRRMA.",
      "In September, Mr. Biden issued an executive order that expands the factors that the committee should consider when reviewing deals \u2014 such as how the deal impacts the U.S. supply chain or puts Americans' sensitive personal data at risk.",
      "Nippon Steel already has manufacturing operations in the U.S., Mexico, China and Southeast Asia. It supplies the world's top automakers, including Toyota Motor Corp., and makes steel for railways, pipes, appliances and skyscrapers.",

    "summary": "President Biden vetoed an effort to add 66 federal district judgeships, saying \"hurried action\" by the House left important questions unanswered.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Biden on Monday vetoed a once-bipartisan effort to add 66 federal district judgeships, saying \"hurried action\" by the House left important questions unanswered about the life-tenured positions.",
      "The legislation would have spread the establishment of the new trial court judgeships over more than a decade to give three presidential administrations and six Congresses the chance to appoint the new judges. The bipartisan effort was carefully designed so that lawmakers wouldn't knowingly give an advantage to either political party in shaping the federal judiciary.",
      "The Democratic-controlled Senate passed the measure unanimously in August. But the Republican-led House brought it to the floor only after Republican Donald Trump was reelected to a second term as president in November, adding the veneer of political gamesmanship to the process.",
      "The White House had said at the time that Mr. Biden would veto the bill.",
      "\"The House of Representative's hurried action fails to resolve key questions in the legislation, especially regarding how the new judgeships are allocated, and neither the House of Representatives nor the Senate explored fully how the work of senior status judges and magistrate judges affects the need for new judgeships,\" the president said in a statement.",
      "\"The efficient and effective administration of justice requires that these questions about need and allocation be further studied and answered before we create permanent judgeships for life-tenured judges,\" Mr. Biden said.",
      "He said the bill would also have created new judgeships in states where senators haven't filled existing judicial vacancies and that those efforts \"suggest that concerns about judicial economy and caseload are not the true motivating force behind passage of this bill now.",
      "\"Therefore, I am vetoing this bill,\" Mr. Biden said, essentially dooming the legislation for the current Congress. Overturning his veto would require a two-thirds majority in both the House and Senate, and the House vote fell well short of that margin.",
      "Organizations representing judges and attorneys had urged Congress to vote for the bill. They argued that the lack of new federal judgeships had contributed to profound delays in the resolution of cases and serious concerns about access to justice.",
      "Sen. Todd Young, R-Ind., reacted swiftly, calling the veto a \"misguided decision\" and \"another example of why Americans are counting down the days until President Biden leaves the White House.\" He alluded to a full pardon Mr. Biden recently granted his son Hunter on federal gun and tax charges.",
      "\"The President is more enthusiastic about using his office to provide relief to his family members who received due process than he is about giving relief to the millions of regular Americans who are waiting years for their due process,\" Young asserted. \"Biden's legacy will be 'pardons for me, no justice for thee.'\"",
      "The Senate confirmed two more of Mr. Biden's nominees to the federal judiciary on Friday \u2014 giving him a total of 235 since he took office and surpassing\u00a0the number of federal judges\u00a0approved during President-elect Donald Trump's first term.",
      "Mr. Biden said in a statement at that time: \"Judges matter. They shape the everyday lives of Americans, preserving our freedoms and defending our liberties. They hear cases and issue rulings on whether Americans can cast their ballots, whether workers can unionize and make a living wage for their families, and whether children can breathe clean air and drink clean water. I am proud of the legacy I will leave with our nation's judges.\"",

      "\"The law deputizes librarians and booksellers as the agents of censorship; when motivated by the fear of jail time, it is likely they will shelve only books fit for young children and segregate or discard the rest,\" Brooks wrote in his ruling.",
      "A coalition that included the Central Arkansas Library System in Little Rock had challenged the law, saying fear of prosecution under the measure could prompt libraries and booksellers to no longer carry titles that could be challenged.",
      "\"This was an attempt to 'thought police,' and this victory over totalitarianism is a testament to the courage of librarians, booksellers, and readers who refused to bow to intimidation,\" said Holly Dickson, executive director of the ACLU of Arkansas.",

Victim A had just completed her junior year of high school when the encounter occurred, the report says.",

    "published": "Mon, 23 Dec 2024 19:38:36 -0500",
    "summary": "A report by the House Ethics Committee found former Rep. Matt Gaetz paid multiple women, including a 17-year-old girl, for sex.",
    "story": [
      "Former Rep. Matt Gaetz, a Florida Republican who briefly stood to become President-elect Donald Trump's nominee to be attorney general, was found by congressional ethics investigators to have paid numerous women \u2014 including a 17-year-old girl \u2014 for sex, and to have purchased and used illegal drugs, including from his Capitol Hill office.",
      "Those are among the findings of the long-running investigation by the House Ethics Committee into Gaetz, which concluded the former Florida congressman violated multiple state laws related to sexual misconduct while in office. The\u00a0full report was released by the committee Monday.",
      "\"The Committee determined there is substantial evidence that Representative Gaetz violated House Rules and other standards of conduct prohibiting prostitution, statutory rape, illicit drug use, impermissible gifts, special favors or privileges, and obstruction of Congress,\" the 37-page report concludes.",
      "On Monday, Gaetz filed a lawsuit in federal court seeking to block the release of the report, saying that he is now a private citizen and not subject to the jurisdiction of the committee. The committee\u00a0released it a short time later.",
      "Gaetz resigned from Congress in November after Trump announced plans to nominate him for attorney general. But facing opposition from some fellow Republicans, Gaetz withdrew from consideration a week later. The release of the ethics report brings to a close \u2014 at least for now \u2014 Gaetz's incendiary tenure on Capitol Hill, where he became one of the most vocal and provocative members of the pro-Trump faction in Congress.",
      "Gaetz has denied any improper conduct and asserted the claims were a \"smear\" invented by his political enemies. The committee said the congressman refused to sit for sworn testimony, though he did submit written answers to some of the committee's questions.",
      "The report gives fresh voice to allegations of misconduct that have circulated around Gaetz for years, in spite of his firm denials. It draws on testimony from witnesses who told the committee they were paid to have sex with Gaetz, text messages discussing the transactions, and Venmo and PayPal receipts.",
      "Among the report's most lurid findings were the allegations of sex- and drug-fueled parties and travel, including a 2018 trip to the Bahamas where witnesses say he took ecstasy and had sex with four women.",
      "\"From 2017 to 2020, Representative Gaetz made tens of thousands of dollars in payments to women that the Committee determined were likely in connection with sexual activity and/or drug use,\" noted the report, which lists payments totaling more than $90,000 to 12 different women.",
      "The committee said it also received testimony that at a 2017 party, Gaetz twice had sex with \"Victim A,\" who was 17 years old at the time and had just completed her junior year in high school.",
      "\"Victim A recalled receiving $400 in cash from Representative Gaetz that evening, which she understood to be payment for sex,\" the committee wrote. \"Victim A said that she did not inform Representative Gaetz that she was under 18 at the time, nor did he ask her age.\"",
      "In his written responses to the committee, Gaetz denied having sex with a minor. The Department of Justice previously investigated Gaetz for violating sex trafficking laws but did not bring charges. The committee said it did not find sufficient evidence Gaetz violated the federal sex trafficking statute because although he transported women across state lines for the purpose of sex, those women were all 18 or older at the time.",
      "The report noted that while all the women who testified said the sexual encounters with Gaetz were consensual, one woman told the committee the use of drugs at the parties and events they attended may have \"impair[ed their] ability to really know what was going on or fully consent.\"",
      "Another woman told the committee, \"When I look back on certain moments, I feel violated.\"",
      "The report also found \"substantial evidence\" Gaetz engaged in rampant illicit drug use. The committee said it obtained text messages he sent where he referred to drugs as \"party favors,\" \"rolls\" or \"vitamins.\" It also said he created a fake email from his Capitol Hill office \"for the purpose of purchasing marijuana.\" The report noted that Gaetz had denied using illicit drugs in his written answers to the committee.",
      "In a statement\u00a0posted on X last week,\u00a0 Gaetz said: \"In my single days, I often sent funds to women I dated - even some I never dated but who asked. I dated several of these women for years. It's embarrassing, though not criminal, that I probably partied, womanized, drank and smoked more than I should have earlier in life. I live a different life now.\"",
      "In addition to sexual misconduct and illicit drug use, the report also accused Gaetz of accepting gifts of luxury travel in excess of permissible limits with the 2018 trip to the Bahamas. And it said he arranged for his chief of staff to assist a woman with whom he had engaged in sexual activity in obtaining a passport, falsely indicating to the State Department that she was one of his constituents.",
      "In his lawsuit Monday, Gaetz argued: \"The Committee's apparent intention to release its report after explicitly acknowledging it lacks jurisdiction over former members, its failure to follow constitutional notions of due process, and failure to adhere to its own procedural rules and precedent represents an unprecedented overreach that threatens fundamental constitutional rights and established procedural protections.\"",
      "Gaetz told conservative personality Charlie Kirk last month that he plans to spend the coming years \"fighting for President Trump.\"",
      "\"I think that eight years is probably enough time in the United States Congress,\" Gaetz said, though last week, he floated in a post on X the idea of returning to participate in the election for House speaker.",
      "The House Ethics Committee had initially voted to keep the report under wraps, but reversed course in a secret vote earlier this month. Two Republican members of the committee were among those who voted for its release, according to two sources familiar with the vote. The committee has 10 members, evenly split between Republicans and Democrats.",

      "A retired Washington, D.C., police officer\u00a0was convicted Monday of lying to authorities about leaking confidential information to the leader of the far-right Proud Boys.",
      "U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson convicted former Metropolitan Police Department Lt. Shane Lamond, who used to supervise the intelligence branch of the police department's Homeland Security Bureau, of obstructing justice and making false statements after a trial without a jury.",
      "Sentencing was scheduled for April 3 after Lamond was convicted on all four counts. He was charged with leaking information to then-Proud Boys national chairman Enrique Tarrio, who was under investigation in the burning of a Black Lives Matter banner.",
      "At his bench trial, Lamond testified that he had never provided Tarrio with sensitive police information. Tarrio testified as a witness for Lamond's defense and said he did not confess to Lamond about burning the banner and didn't receive any confidential information from him.",
      "But the judge did not find the testimony of either Lamond or Tarrio to be credible. Jackson said the evidence indicated that Lamond was not using Tarrio as a source after the banner burning.",
      "\"It was the other way around,\" she said.",
      "The judge said the string of messages that Lamond and Tarrio exchanged over the course of months revealed a pattern: \"Lamond and Tarrio talk, and Tarrio immediately disseminates what he learns,\" Jackson said.",
      "She referred to Tarrio as an \"awful witness\" who was \"flippant, grandiose and obnoxious\" on the stand.",
      "\"He was one of the worst I've had the opportunity to sit next to during my tenure on the bench,\" Jackson said.",
      "After the verdict, defense attorney Mark Schamel said it was premature to say if there would be an appeal.",
      "\"It's unbelievably disappointing to see every single thing that Lt. Lamond did viewed through a lens to make it appear to be something other than it was,\" Schamel said outside the courtroom. \"There is nothing disloyal about him at all, and it's a sad day for him.\"",
      "Tarrio eventually pleaded guilty to burning the banner stolen from a historic Black church in downtown Washington in December 2020.",
      "He was later sentenced to 22 years in prison for his role in the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol, part of what prosecutors called a plot to use force keep Donald Trump in the White House after the 2020 election.",
      "Lamond, who met Tarrio in 2019, had supervised the intelligence branch of the police department's Homeland Security Bureau. He was responsible for monitoring groups like the Proud Boys when they came to Washington.",
      "Tarrio was arrested in Washington two days before the Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol. The Miami resident wasn't at the Capitol when a mob of Trump supporters stormed the building and interrupted the congressional count of the electoral votes finalizing\u00a0Joe Biden's 2020 electoral victory.",
      "Prosecutors said the trial evidence proved Lamond tipped off Tarrio that a warrant for his arrest had been signed.",
      "\"Similarly, the defendant affirmatively advised Mr. Tarrio in a written message that he was being asked to identify him for a warrant, a warning obviously in contemplation of the subsequent prosecution and with obvious ramifications for it,\" prosecutors wrote.",
      "Lamond's indictment says he and Tarrio exchanged messages about the Jan. 6 riot and discussed whether Proud Boys members were in danger of being charged in the attack.",
      "\"Of course I can't say it officially, but personally I support you all and don't want to see your group's name and reputation dragged through the mud,\" Lamond wrote.",
      "Lamond said he was upset that a prosecutor labeled him as a Proud Boys \"sympathizer\" who acted as a \"double agent\" for the group after Tarrio burned a stolen Black Lives Matter banner in December 2020.",
      "\"I don't support the Proud Boys, and I'm not a Proud Boys sympathizer,\" Lamond testified.",

      "Washington \u2014 Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said as his time at the helm of the nation's immigration enforcement comes to a close that \"a really terrific solution was killed by irresponsible politics\" when the bipartisan border deal fell apart earlier this year.",
      "Mayorkas pointed to the\u00a0agreement on a border package\u00a0reached by a bipartisan group of Senate negotiators in February reached after months of deliberations that would have marked the first comprehensive border security policy overhaul in decades \u2014 and give the president far-reaching powers to clamp down on unlawful border crossings. But the bill was quickly rejected by Republicans after President-elect Donald Trump expressed his opposition.",

      "\"So now with this interview, I'm hoping, I'm asking President Trump to truly look at this permitting bill, because it is basically a good piece of legislation that we've never moved this far in a bipartisan way, with John Barrasso, going to be the No. 2 man in the Republican Senate, a good person, a good friend of mine,\" Manchin told Brennan. \"We worked hard and negotiated hard, and have a good bill. It's ready to go. We have the bill ready. He could just drop it in.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 Republican Rep. Tony Gonzales of Texas compared Elon Musk to an unelected prime minister after the Tesla CEO got involved in a tumultuous funding fight on Capitol Hill this week that prompted concern over a possible government shutdown \u2014 and previewed dynamics under a GOP-controlled Washington.",
      "\"We have a president, we have a vice president, we have a speaker. It feels as if Elon Musk is our prime minister,\" Gonzales said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "After days of uncertainty, Congress approved a measure to keep the government funded until mid March, which President Biden signed Saturday to avert a shutdown. But the resolution came after multiple dashed attempts to fund the government, including a bipartisan deal scuttled following intense pushback from Musk, who President-elect Donald Trump has selected to lead a new agency called the Department of Government Efficiency or\u00a0DOGE. After's Musk's criticism, Trump ultimately delievered the final blow.",
      "Musk, who spent $277 million to help Trump win the election and has since become a key member of the president-elect's brain trust, posted dozens of times on his social media platform X opposing the initial government funding measure following its release. Hours later, after Trump intervened, the deal was dead.",
      "Gonzales, who was among 34 Republicans who opposed the final measure to keep the government funded, said he did so because his constituents were against the continuing resolution, or CR, \"just as much as I was against the CR.\"",
      "\"It was a vote on my end to say, let's do our job,\" he said, arguing that there's a \"sickness in DC\" that won't be cured by \"big, long pork-filled bills.\"",
      "The Texas Republicans said he spoke with Musk a couple times during the week. And Gonzales argued that, although unelected, Musk has a voice that is in large part \"a reflection of the voice of the people.\" He also argued that Trump deserves credit for whittling the bill down from its initial form.",
      "Meanwhile, the spending legislation, along with the ensuing chaos in the House, prompted intense criticism of House Speaker Mike Johnson for his handling of the situation. At least one Republican, Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, said he wouldn't support Johnson for speaker in the new Congress, while questions swirled about his ability to retain enough support to hold onto the gavel.",
      "Despite his opposition to the legislation, Gonzales said he supports Johnson as speaker, arguing that \"he's done a fantastic job keeping us all together\" and noting that \"it's like feral cats in the House.\"",
      "Gonzales said Johnson has \"a tough job to begin with,\" while adding that the speaker's ability to work with the president-elect and Musk to find a solution \"just goes to prove that he's found a way.\"",

    "story": [
      "An orca who made headlines in 2018 after she carried her dead calf on her head for more than two weeks and a distance of 1,000 miles has given birth again, according to the Center for Whale Research.",
      "The killer whale calf was spotted in the Puget Sound area off Washington state several days ago. On Tuesday, the center determined J35, also known as Tahlequah, was the baby's mother. The calf, a girl, was given the designation J61.",
      "It's not all good news for the mom and baby though.",
      "\"The team, including multiple experienced killer whale researchers, have expressed concern about the calf's health based on the behavior of both J35 and J61,\" the Center for Whale Research wrote in a Facebook post. \"Early life is always dangerous for new calves, with a very high mortality rate in the first year. J35 is an experienced mother, and we hope that she is able to keep J61 alive through these difficult early days.\"",
      "The organization, which tracks southern resident orca populations in the Pacific Northwest, did not specify what sparked the concern. Seattle-based Orca Conservancy wrote on social media that researchers believe the calf was born prematurely. Orca Conservancy said the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has been able to spend time on the water with the calf and they observed the baby \"remaining underwater for extended amounts of time indicating nursing or attempts to nurse.\"",
      "\"The calf had also been observed being pushed around on J35's head and was not looking lively, which is a concern, but also added calf behavior is not fully understood,\" Orca Conservancy wrote.",
      "Tahlequah also\u00a0gave birth to a calf in 2020. Experts at the time described it as big news, because up to 70% of orca pregnancies end with a either a miscarriage or a calf that dies shortly after birth.",
      "Southern resident killer whales, like Tahlequah, are the only endangered population of killer whales in the U.S., according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The summer population census for 2020 counted only 72 southern resident killer whales, though several calves have been born since the census. Though a recovery plan was completed in 2008, the population continues to struggle and has declined over 10% since 2005.",
      "\"The Southern Resident killer whale population needs ample access to their food supply, mainly salmon, to survive and thrive,\" the Center for Whale Research wrote in a Facebook post. \"Every single birth counts and these whales need enough fish to be able to support themselves and their calves.

      "Now called the Mazarr\u00f3n II, this shipwreck was one of two located in that same general area. The first, called Mazarr\u00f3n I, was initially located in 1993, lifted from the water in June 1995, and put on display at Spain's National Museum of Underwater Archaeology in 2005 after undergoing years of conservation treatments, the museum said.",
      "Mazarr\u00f3n II is of particular interest to archaeologists and researchers because it is one of only a few Phoenician-era shipwrecks discovered largely intact, said Carlos de Juan, the director of the excavation project, in a video shared by the University of Valencia. The university partnered with the regional culture ministry in Murcia to carry out the excavation.",
      "A team of 14 specialists worked with de Juan to lift the shipwreck from the sea in less than two months, beginning the project Sept. 13 and finishing Nov. 7. Video shows divers carrying wooden fragments of the wreck to the surface in pieces.",
      "Phoenicia was an ancient civilization along the eastern Mediterranean coast, in the area of modern-day Lebanon, Syria and Israel, which existed from about 1500 to 300 B.C.E. Although historians say Phoenicians thrived for a time on trade and developed an alphabet that formed the basis for the ones later produced by ancient Greece and Rome, many traces of the civilization were considered lost until the 20th century.",
      "Artifacts like Mazarr\u00f3n II can help shed light on Phoenician culture, said de Juan. He noted in his comments to the University of Valencia that little is known about Phoenician naval construction, even now, despite the wealth of information about ships built nearby in the Mediterranean by the ancient Greeks.",
      "\"Therefore, this wreck is a very important contribution to this area of study,\" de Juan said. He noted that elements of the Mazarr\u00f3n II are similar to construction designs seen in cultures throughout the surrounding region, but some are distinctive and mysterious, at least for now.",

    "summary": "The 2024 winter solstice, the shortest day of the year, happens on Saturday, Dec. 21, and is marked with traditions and celebrations around the world.",
    "story": [
      "The 2024 winter solstice, the shortest day of the year, happens on Saturday, Dec. 21, in the Northern Hemisphere. The celestial event signifies the first day of winter, astronomically.",
      "What is the winter solstice?",
      "The winter solstice is the day each year that has the shortest period of daylight between sunrise and sunset, and therefore the longest night. It happens when the sun is directly above the Tropic of Capricorn, a line of latitude that circles the globe south of the equator, the National Weather Service explains.",
      "The farther north you are, the shorter the day will be, and in the Arctic Circle, the sun won't rise at all.",
      "How is the day of the winter solstice determined?",
      "The winter solstice occurs because of the Earth's tilt as it rotates around the sun.",
      "When the Northern Hemisphere tilts away from the sun, the nights last longer. The longest night happens on the solstice because the hemisphere is in its furthest position from the sun. That occurs each year on Dec. 21 or 22.",
      "This year, it falls on Dec. 21 at 4:21 a.m ET, to be precise.",
      "On the summer solstice, when the northern tilt is closest to the sun, we have the longest day, usually June 20 or 21.",
      "The solstices are not always exactly on the 21st every year because the earth's rotation around the sun is 365.25 days, instead of 365 even.",
      "Will days start getting longer after the winter solstice?",
      "Yes. Each day after the solstice, we get one minute more of sunlight. It doesn't sound like much, but after just two months, or around 60 days, we'll be seeing about an hour more of sunlight.",
      "When will winter officially be over in 2025?",
      "The meteorological winter ends on March 20, 2025. Then, spring will last until June 20, when the summer solstice arrives.",
      "How is the winter solstice celebrated around the world?",
      "Nations and cultures around the world have celebrated the solstice since ancient times with varying rituals and traditions. The influence of those solstice traditions can still be seen in our celebrations of holidays like Christmas and Hanukkah, Britannica notes.",
      "The ancient Roman Saturnalia festival celebrated the end of the planting season and has close ties with modern-day Christmas. It honored Saturn, the god of harvest and farming. The multiple-day affair had lots of food, games and celebrations. Presents were given to children and the poor, and slaves were allowed to stop working.",
      "Gatherings are held every year at Stonehenge, a monumental circle of massive stones in England that dates back about 5,000 years. The origins of Stonehenge are shrouded in mystery, but it was built to align with the sun on solstice days.",
      "The Hopi, a Native American tribe in the northern Arizona area, celebrate the winter solstice with dancing, purification and sometimes gift-giving. A sacred ritual known as the Soyal Ceremony marks the annual milestone.",
      "In Peru, people honor the return of the sun god on the winter solstice. The ancient tradition would be to hold sacrificial ceremonies, but today, people hold mock sacrifices to celebrate. Because Peru is in the Southern Hemisphere, their winter solstice happens in June, when the Northern Hemisphere is marking its summer solstice.",
      "Scandinavia celebrates St. Lucia's Day, a festival of lights.",
      "The \"arrival of winter,\" or Dong Zhi, is a Chinese festival where family gathers to celebrate the year so far. Traditional foods include tang yuan, sweet rice balls with a black sesame filling. It's believed to have its origins in post-harvest celebrations.",
      "Researchers stationed in in Antarctica even have their own traditions, which may include an icy plunge into the polar waters. They celebrate \"midwinter\" with festive meals, movies and sometimes homemade gifts.",

      "Investigating an asteroid with Tianwen-2",
      "China's Tianwen-2 mission is an ambitious asteroid sample return and comet probe mission. Scheduled for launch in May 2025, Tianwen-2 aims to collect samples from a near-Earth asteroid and study a comet. This mission will advance scientists' understanding of the solar system's formation and evolution, building on the success of China's previous lunar and Mars missions.",
      "The mission's first target is the near-Earth asteroid 469219 Kamo\u02bboalewa. This asteroid is a quasi-satellite of Earth, meaning it orbits the Sun but stays close to Earth. Kamo\u02bboalewa is roughly 131-328 feet (40-100 meters) in diameter and may be a fragment of the ,oon, ejected into space by a past impact event.",
      "By studying this asteroid, scientists hope to learn about the early solar system and the processes that shaped it. The spacecraft will use both touch-and-go and anchor-and-attach techniques to collect samples from the asteroid's surface.",
      "After collecting samples from Kamo\u02bboalewa, Tianwen-2 will return them to Earth and then set course for its second target, the main-belt comet 311P/PANSTARRS. This comet is located in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter.",
      "By analyzing the comet's materials, researchers hope to learn more about the conditions that existed in the early solar system and possibly the origins of water and organic molecules on Earth.",
      "Solar system flybys",
      "Besides the above planned launch missions, several space agencies plan to perform exciting deep-space flyby missions in 2025.",
      "A flyby, or gravity assist, is when a spacecraft passes close enough to a planet or moon to use its gravity for a speed boost. As the spacecraft approaches, it gets pulled in by the planet's gravity, which helps it accelerate.",
      "After swinging around the planet, the spacecraft is flung back out into space, allowing it to change direction and continue on its intended path using less fuel.",
      "BepiColombo, a joint mission by ESA and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, JAXA, will make its sixth flyby of Mercury in January 2025. This maneuver will help the spacecraft enter orbit around Mercury by November 2026. BepiColombo aims to study Mercury's composition, atmosphere and surface geology.",
      "NASA's Europa Clipper mission, which launched in October 2024, will make significant progress on its journey to Jupiter's moon Europa. In March 2025, the spacecraft will perform a flyby maneuver at Mars.",
      "This maneuver will help the spacecraft gain the necessary speed and trajectory for its long voyage. Later in December 2026, Europa Clipper will perform a flyby of Earth, using Earth's gravity to further increase its momentum so it can arrive at Europa in April 2030.",
      "The ESA's Hera mission will also perform a flyby of Mars in March 2025. Hera is part of the Asteroid Impact and Deflection Assessment mission, which plans to study the Didymos binary asteroid system. The mission will provide valuable data on asteroid deflection techniques and contribute to planetary defense strategies.",
      "NASA's Lucy mission will continue its journey to explore the Jupiter Trojan asteroids, which share Jupiter's orbit around the Sun, in 2025. One key event for Lucy is its flyby of the inner main-belt asteroid 52246 Donaldjohanson, scheduled for April 20, 2025.",
      "This flyby will provide valuable data on this ancient asteroid's composition and surface features, which can help researchers gain insights into the early solar system. The asteroid is named after the paleoanthropologist who discovered the famous \"Lucy\" fossil.",
      "ESA's Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer, or JUICE, mission will perform a Venus flyby in August 2025. This maneuver will help JUICE gain the necessary speed and trajectory for its journey to Jupiter. Once it arrives, JUICE will study Jupiter's icy moons to understand their potential for harboring life.",
      "2025 promises to be a groundbreaking year for space exploration. With NASA's ambitious missions and significant contributions from other countries, we are set to make remarkable strides in humanity's understanding of the universe. These missions will not only advance scientific knowledge but also inspire future generations to look to the stars.",

    "story": [
      "Preparing cancer patients for difficult decisions is an oncologist's job. They don't always remember to do it, however. At the University of Pennsylvania Health System, doctors are nudged to talk about a patient's treatment and end-of-life preferences by an artificially intelligent algorithm that predicts the chances of death.",
      "But it's far from being a set-it-and-forget-it tool. A routine tech checkup revealed the algorithm decayed during the covid-19 pandemic, getting 7 percentage points worse at predicting who would die, according to a 2022 study.",
      "There were likely real-life impacts. Ravi Parikh, an Emory University oncologist who was the study's lead author, told KFF Health News the tool failed hundreds of times to prompt doctors to initiate that important discussion \u2014 possibly heading off unnecessary chemotherapy \u2014 with patients who needed it.",
      "He believes several algorithms designed to enhance medical care weakened during the pandemic, not just the one at Penn Medicine. \"Many institutions are not routinely monitoring the performance\" of their products, Parikh said.",
      "Algorithm glitches are one facet of a dilemma that computer scientists and doctors have long acknowledged but that is starting to puzzle hospital executives and researchers: Artificial intelligence systems require consistent monitoring and staffing to put in place and to keep them working well.",
      "In essence: You need people, and more machines, to make sure the new tools don't mess up.",
      "\"Everybody thinks that AI will help us with our access and capacity and improve care and so on,\" said Nigam Shah, chief data scientist at Stanford Health Care. \"All of that is nice and good, but if it increases the cost of care by 20%, is that viable?\"",
      "Government officials worry hospitals lack the resources to put these technologies through their paces. \"I have looked far and wide,\" FDA Commissioner Robert Califf said at a recent agency panel on AI. \"I do not believe there's a single health system, in the United States, that's capable of validating an AI algorithm that's put into place in a clinical care system.\"",
      "AI is already widespread in health care. Algorithms are used to predict patients' risk of death or deterioration, to suggest diagnoses or triage patients, to record and summarize visits to save doctors work and to approve insurance claims.",
      "If tech evangelists are right, the technology will become ubiquitous \u2014 and profitable. The investment firm Bessemer Venture Partners has identified some 20 health-focused AI startups on track to make $10 million in revenue each in a year. The FDA has approved nearly a thousand artificially intelligent products.",
      "Evaluating whether these products work is challenging. Evaluating whether they continue to work \u2014 or have developed the software equivalent of a blown gasket or leaky engine \u2014 is even trickier.",
      "Take a recent study at Yale Medicine evaluating six \"early warning systems,\" which alert clinicians when patients are likely to deteriorate rapidly. A supercomputer ran the data for several days, said Dana Edelson, a doctor at the University of Chicago and co-founder of a company that provided one algorithm for the study. The process was fruitful, showing huge differences in performance among the six products.",
      "It's not easy for hospitals and providers to select the best algorithms for their needs. The average doctor doesn't have a supercomputer sitting around, and there is no Consumer Reports for AI.",
      "\"We have no standards,\" said Jesse Ehrenfeld, immediate past president of the American Medical Association. \"There is nothing I can point you to today that is a standard around how you evaluate, monitor, look at the performance of a model of an algorithm, AI-enabled or not, when it's deployed.\"",
      "Perhaps the most common AI product in doctors' offices is called ambient documentation, a tech-enabled assistant that listens to and summarizes patient visits. So far this year, investors at Rock Health have tracked $353 million flowing into these documentation companies. But, Ehrenfeld said, \"There is no standard right now for comparing the output of these tools.\"",
      "And that's a problem, when even small errors can be devastating. A team at Stanford University tried using large language models \u2014 the technology underlying popular AI tools like ChatGPT \u2014 to summarize patients' medical history. They compared the results with what a physician would write.",
      "\"Even in the best case, the models had a 35% error rate,\" said Stanford's Shah. In medicine, \"when you're writing a summary and you forget one word, like 'fever' \u2014 I mean, that's a problem, right?\"",
      "Sometimes the reasons algorithms fail are fairly logical. For example, changes to underlying data can erode their effectiveness, like when hospitals switch lab providers.",
      "Sometimes, however, the pitfalls yawn open for no apparent reason.",
      "Sandy Aronson, a tech executive at Mass General Brigham's personalized medicine program in Boston, said that when his team tested one application meant to help genetic counselors locate relevant literature about DNA variants, the product suffered \"nondeterminism\" \u2014 that is, when asked the same question multiple times in a short period, it gave different results.",
      "Aronson is excited about the potential for large language models to summarize knowledge for overburdened genetic counselors, but \"the technology needs to improve.\"",
      "If metrics and standards are sparse and errors can crop up for strange reasons, what are institutions to do? Invest lots of resources. At Stanford, Shah said, it took eight to 10 months and 115 man-hours just to audit two models for fairness and reliability.",
      "Experts interviewed by KFF Health News floated the idea of artificial intelligence monitoring artificial intelligence, with some (human) data whiz monitoring both. All acknowledged that would require organizations to spend even more money \u2014 a tough ask given the realities of hospital budgets and the limited supply of AI tech specialists.",
      "\"It's great to have a vision where we're melting icebergs in order to have a model monitoring their model,\" Shah said. \"But is that really what I wanted? How many more people are we going to need?\"",

      "Although he was with Time Warner through its difficulties with AOL, he earned respect for the company and rebuilt its relations with Wall Street. He streamlined Time Warner's structure, pared debt and sold Warner Music Group and a book publishing division.",
      "He also fended off a challenge from activist investor Carl Icahn in 2006 to break up the company and helped Time Warner reach settlements with investors and regulators over questionable accounting practices at AOL.",
      "Parsons joined Time Warner as president in 1995 after serving as chairman and chief executive of Dime Bancorp Inc., one of the largest U.S. thrift institutions.",
      "In 2001, after AOL used its fortunes as the leading provider of Internet access in the U.S. to buy Time Warner for $106 billion in stock, Parsons became co-chief operating officer with AOL executive Robert Pittman. In that role, he was in charge of the company's content businesses, including movie studios and recorded music.",
      "He became CEO in 2002 with the retirement of Gerald Levin, one of the key architects of that merger. Parsons was named Time Warner chairman the following year, replacing AOL founder Steve Case, who had also championed the combination.",
      "The newly formed company's internet division quickly became a drag on Time Warner. The promised synergies between traditional and new media never materialized. AOL began seeing a reduction in subscribers in 2002 as Americans replaced dial-up connections with broadband from cable TV and phone companies.",
      "Parsons stepped down as CEO in 2007 and as chairman in 2008. A year later AOL split from Time Warner and began trading as a separate company, following years of struggles to reinvent itself as a business focused on advertising and content. Time Warner is now owned by AT&T Inc.",
      "A board member of Citigroup and its predecessor, Citibank, since 1996, Parsons was named chairman in 2009 at a time of turmoil for the financial institution. Citigroup had suffered five straight quarters of losses and received $45 billion in government aid. Its board had been criticized for allowing the bank to invest so heavily in the risky housing market.",
      "Citigroup returned to profit under Parsons, starting in 2010, and would not have a quarterly loss again until the fourth quarter of 2017. Parsons retired from that job in 2012.",
      "In 2014 he stepped in as interim CEO of the Clippers until Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer took over later that year.",
      "Parsons, a Republican, previously worked as a lawyer for Nelson Rockefeller, a former Republican governor of New York, and in Gerald Ford's White House. Those early stints gave him grounding in politics and negotiations. He also was an economic adviser on President Barack Obama's transition team.",
      "Parsons, who loved jazz and co-owned a Harlem jazz club, also served as chairman of the Apollo Theater and the Jazz Foundation of America. And he held positions on the boards of the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture, the American Museum of Natural History and the Museum of Modern Art in New York City.",
      "Parsons played basketball at the University of Hawaii at Manoa and received his law degree from Albany Law School in 1971. He is survived by his wife, Laura, and their family.",

      "An Alabama woman who says she was raped by Jay-Z and Sean \"Diddy\" Combs when she was 13 can proceed anonymously, for now, in her lawsuit against the rap moguls, a New York federal judge ruled Thursday.",
      "In her written order, U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres said the woman can proceed anonymously at this early stage of the litigation, but she may be required to reveal her identity at a later date, if the case proceeds. That would allow defense lawyers to collect facts necessary to prepare for trial. Torres also cited \"substantial interest\" from the public.",
      "The Manhattan jurist also chastised Alex Spiro \u2014 the lawyer representing Jay-Z, whose legal name is Shawn Carter \u2014 for what she described as his \"relentless filing of combative motions containing inflammatory language and ad hominem attacks\" against the plaintiff's lawyer, calling them \"inappropriate, a waste of judicial resources, and a tactic unlikely to benefit his client.\"",
      "Torres wrote in her order Thursday that Spiro, who has been on the case less than three weeks, has submitted a \"litany of letters and motions attempting to impugn the character of Plaintiff's lawyer, many of them expounding on the purported 'urgency' of this case.\"",
      "In response to the ruling, Tony Buzbee, the plaintiff's attorney, told CBS News in an email Thursday evening that he doesn't \"typically comment on court rulings,\" but alleged that \"the coordinated and desperate efforts to attack me as counsel for alleged victims are falling flat.\"",

      "In her lawsuit, the woman who says she was raped at 13 identifies herself as \"Jane Doe.\" She said she was living in Rochester in 2000 when she made her way to New York City and befriended a limousine driver who drove her to an after-party for the MTV Music Awards, where she says she was eventually attacked by Jay-Z and Combs.",
      "Spiro asked the judge to dismiss the entertainer from the woman's lawsuit and he requested a hearing on the case for the day after he made his requests in writing on Dec. 18.",
      "Citing an interview the plaintiff did with NBC News, Spiro wrote that the broadcast revealed \"glaring inconsistencies and outright impossibilities\" in the plaintiff's story. For one thing, the woman said she traveled for five hours from Rochester to watch the music awards show on a jumbotron outside the VMAs even though permits and pictures show there was no jumbotron at the event.",

    "story": [
      "Boxing Day, the traditionally British holiday recognized the day after Christmas, offers an extension of the festivities. People in countries like Canada, the U.K. and South Africa spend an extra day with friends, shopping or watching sports.",
      "Andrew McLean and his wife moved to the U.S. from Manchester almost 25 years ago. They brought the holiday celebration across the pond with them and host a Boxing Day party every year.",
      "\"We've enjoyed America. We love being here,\" he told CBS News. \"But there are lots of things about Britain that we miss. Boxing Day is probably in that top 10.\"",
      "What is Boxing Day?",
      "Boxing Day is celebrated on Dec. 26 by the United Kingdom, its commonwealth countries and some former colonies.",
      "Stores run shopping deals, similar to Black Friday, and fans cheer on sporting events such as soccer, cricket, rugby, horse racing and hunting.",
      "McLean said that hosting a Boxing Day party is also a great way to finish off some of the Christmas food. Turkey is a traditional British Christmas meal and on Boxing Day, many enjoy a turkey curry. Another classic Boxing Day dish is bubble and squeak, or fried leftover potato and greens like cabbage or Brussels sprouts.",
      "Why is it called Boxing Day and what are its origins?",
      "There are two major theories for where the holiday began.",
      "Some believe that Boxing Day began with churches collecting alms boxes of parishioners' donated money, according to Britannica. The church would give these boxes of donations to the poor the day after Christmas.",
      "The name has stuck, but now, people typically donate to charity in the weeks leading up to the holidays.",
      "Others believe that the day was observed because servants had to work at Christmas dinners and festivities, so they celebrated the holiday on Dec. 26. According to History.com, the lords and aristocrats would give their servants \"Christmas boxes\" filled with leftovers and small gifts after the parties, leading to the name \"Boxing Day.\"",
      "Employers still give service workers bonuses around the holidays, just as leftovers still are a part of celebrations today.",
      "A third theory, according to TimeOut, is that British naval ships would seal a box of money at the start of a long voyage, and at the end, priests would open the boxes and donate the money to those in need.",
      "McLean said other theories about the name include bare-knuckle boxing matches that occurred the day after Christmas, or that many people return their boxes of unwanted gifts that day.",
      "Is Boxing Day an official holiday?",
      "Yes, Boxing Day is a public or bank holiday recognized in the U.K. and other countries. It was made an official U.K. holiday in the 1800s. If Dec. 26 falls on a weekend, it is recognized on the following Monday. In 2024, it falls on a Thursday and in 2025, it will fall on a Friday.",
      "Where is it celebrated?",

      "Not necessarily, because St. Stephen's Day is a religious holiday, but the two are linked and are recognized on the same day.

    "story": [
      "This holiday shopping season saw Americans stepping up their purchases at retail stores, with many chains luring shoppers with big Black Friday discounts. But with the holiday now over, retailers are beginning to roll out their post-Christmas sales, aiming to entice shoppers to spend more.",
      "Shoppers spent between $979.5 billion and $989 billion last month and in December, with retail sales up 2.5% to 3.5%\u00a0from a year ago, according to an estimate from the National Retail Federation, the nation's biggest retail trade group.",
      "Retailers are now looking to encourage more of the same in wrapping up the holidays with additional post-Christmas promotions. This year's shorter holiday shopping period placed pressure on some retailers, some of which also struggled to attract inflation-weary consumers through their doors.",
      "\"So far, post-Christmas discounts seem to be slightly bigger than last year,\" GlobalData retail analyst Neil Saunders told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Retailers are working hard to stimulate demand and nudging consumers into spending.\"",
      "He added, \"That said, there is not a dramatic difference. A lot of retailers managed inventory well this year so they don't have loads of stuff left over that they need to shift.\"",
      "Budget-conscious shoppers have also found bargains during a particularly tough year\u00a0for some retailers, with store closures surging 69% versus a year earlier, according to research firm CoreSight.",
      "The industry's woes include the recent bankruptcy of popular chain Party City, now holding an \"All Stores Closing Sale!\" with everything going at a discount and up to 50% off. Along the same vein, Big Lots plans to host \"going out of business\" sales as its more than 900 locations after the company's sale to a private equity firm fell through earlier this month.",
      "Other national retailers are also holding sales, but tying them to the season. Here's a sampling.",
      "Do products usually go on sale after Christmas?",
      "Yes, retailers typically offer post-holiday sales to reduce inventory after Christmas. But this year, American shoppers have another reason to head to the malls or the computer in search of deals: the potential threat of higher prices on many goods if President-elect Donald Trump enacts tariffs on imports.",
      "Sticker-shocked consumers have in recent months seen some relief as inflation abated, but Trump's pledge to impose\u00a0new tariffs\u00a0on imports once back in the White House has some experts warning that prices could increase on a slew of goods in 2025, including made-in-China toys,\u00a0electronics\u00a0and even crude\u00a0oil imported\u00a0from Canada.",

    "summary": "Here's what to know about the United States' involvement with building and operating the Panama Canal.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump has repeatedly suggested the United States take over the Panama Canal, a shipping waterway that cuts across Central America, unless fees for using the canal are lowered.",
      "Panama's leader shot back in a recent statement, saying the waterway is not for sale. Since then, Trump has posted repeatedly about the canal.",
      "It's the latest in a series of similar statements from Trump, who recently suggested the United States take over Greenland, an idea he also floated during his first presidency. He's also joked about Canada\u00a0being a U.S. state.",
      "Here's what to know about the history of the Panama Canal and the United States' involvement with the shipping lane.",
      "History of the Panama Canal",
      "The Panama Canal was built by the United States between 1904 and 1913, and opened in 1917. Building the canal cost about $375 million, making it the most expensive construction project in U.S. history at that time, according to the Panama Canal Authority. Thousands of laborers died during the grueling construction process.",
      "The canal connects the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, offering ships a shortcut to avoid going around the tip of South America. The canal revolutionized shipping traffic in the region.",
      "The U.S. acquired the rights to build and operate the canal in the early 20th century, but at the time, Panama was in the process of seceding from Colombia, whose senate was refusing to ratify a treaty that would allow the canal to be built, according to the\u00a0State Department's Office of the Historian.",
      "To ensure the canal could be built, then-President Theodore Roosevelt supported Panamanian independence, and in 1903, the U.S. and Panama signed a treaty that established permanent U.S. rights to a \"Panama Canal Zone\" that stretched across the nation. However, the person who negotiated on Panama's behalf did not have formal consent from the nation's government and had not lived in the country for 17 years, causing many Panamanians to question the treaty's validity, according to the Office of the Historian.",
      "Throughout the 20th century, the U.S. and Panama dealt with tensions surrounding the canal, including a riot in the 1960s that led to a brief disruption in diplomatic relations between the countries. In 1967, the U.S. and Panama began negotiating a new treaty, eventually reaching an agreement, but a change in elected leaders and a coup in Panama led to the establishment of a new government in the Central American nation, according to the Office of the Historian. Because of that, the negotiations \"suffered a major setback.\"",
      "Negotiations continued through the '70s. When Jimmy Carter was elected president, he made concluding the negotiation process a priority, and in 1977, two treaties were submitted to the U.S. Senate: the Neutrality Treaty, which said the U.S. could use its military to defend the canal, allowing \"perpetual U.S. usage\" of the waterway, and the Panama Canal Treaty, which would end the existence of the Panama Canal Zone and allow the canal to be turned over to Panama in December 1999. As part of the second treaty, Panama would also become primarily responsible for defending the canal.",
      "The treaties, collectively known as the Torrijos-Carter Treaties, were signed on Sept. 7, 1977. In the spring of 1978, the U.S. Senate voted to ratify the treaties, and Carter signed them into law on Sept. 27, 1979. The canal was transferred to Panama on Dec. 31, 1999, during the Clinton administration.",
      "Who operates the Panama Canal?",
      "The Panama Canal has been owned and operated by the Panama Canal Authority, a government-owned agency, since 1999. The agency was established shortly before the canal was returned to Panama.",
      "Since taking control of the waterway, the Panama Canal Authority has invested billions in expanding the canal. A $5.25 billion expansion of the canal opened in 2016, doubling the waterway's capacity and cutting global maritime costs by an estimated $8 billion a year, CBS News previously reported. The expansion also allowed larger ships to pass.",
      "Who uses the Panama Canal?",
      "About 40% of the world's cargo ship traffic moves through the Panama Canal, CBS News previously reported, though recent droughts have forced operators to reduce ship crossings.",
      "About two-thirds of the traffic in the canal is either headed for or leaving the United States, though ships from all over the world use the waterway each day, according to the Panama Canal Authority.",
      "Between 13,000 and 14,000 ships use the canal each year, the agency said.",
      "Trump and Panamanian president clash",
      "Trump first seemed to suggest the United States should take over the Panama Canal in a TruthSocial post on December 21.",
      "He also raised the issue to a crowd of supporters at Turning Point's\u00a0AmericaFest\u00a0on Sunday, where he said Panama is charging \"exorbitant prices\" and said the \"complete ripoff of our country will immediately stop.\"",
      "\"If the principles, both moral and legal, of this magnanimous gesture of giving, are not followed, then we will demand that the Panama Canal be returned to the United States of America, in full, quickly and without question,\" Trump said.",
      "On Wednesday, Trump said he would nominate Miami-Dade International Trade Consortium member Kevin Marino Cabrera to be the U.S. ambassador to Panama. In that\u00a0announcement, he accused Panama of \"ripping us off on the Panama Canal, far beyond their wildest dream.\"",
      "Trump continued to post online about the U.S. regaining ownership of the canal, and referenced the canal in a Christmas Day message shared on TruthSocial. He warned of potential influence from China at the shipping waterway, though there is no Chinese presence at the canal, according to\u00a0Reuters. A Hong Kong-based company manages two ports along the canal, Reuters said.",
      "Panama President Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino said in a statement shared on social media that \"every square meter\" of the canal \"belongs to Panama and will continue belonging to Panama.\"",
      "\"We'll see about that!\" Trump wrote online in response.",
      "Mulino responded to Trump again in a news conference on Thursday, saying that \"anyone in the world is free to visit the canal\" and adding that \"there is not a single Chinese soldier in the canal, and on the other hand, there will not be, and we maintain a respectful, well-managed relationship with China.\" Mulino hosts weekly news conferences.",
      "Mulino said that while there are \"delicate problems such as immigration\" that both he and Trump \"are concerned about as presidents,\" the two leaders have \"nothing to discuss\" as far as ownership of the Panama Canal.",
      "\"The specific approach, the Canal is Panamanian and belongs to Panamanians, there is no possibility of opening any kind of conversation about this reality that has cost the country tears, sweat and blood to achieve,\" Mulino said.",

    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump is pledging to slap new tariffs on imports after he's inaugurated next month \u2014 a vow that's prompting the toy industry to warn about the impact.",
      "Even if toys are designed in Europe or the U.S., they are frequently manufactured in China, a nation whose exports Trump last month threatened to target with a new 10% tariff as soon as he takes office. On the campaign trail, he floated the idea of a tariff of up to 60% on all Chinese goods. Nearly 80% of U.S. toys are manufactured in China, according to The Toy Association, an industry group.",
      "If Trump carries through with his tariff plan, toy prices would rise \"probably instantly,\" Jennifer Bergman, the owner of New York City's West Side Kids told CBS News. She estimates that about 90% of the toys she sells are made in China.",
      "To be sure, the toy industry isn't alone in fretting about the impact of Trump's promised tariffs, as higher prices on a broad range of imports would likely be passed onto consumers. After more than four decades serving the neighborhood, Bergman fears that higher prices may threaten her shop's survival and impact her customers.",
      "\"It would be heartbreaking,\" she said. \"It would be a real loss for the community. It would be a real loss for me. I can't really imagine not being here.\"",
      "If Trump follows through on his tariff plans, American consumers stand to lose as much as $78 billion in spending power annually on products, including apparel, toys, furniture, household appliances, footwear and travel goods, the National Retail Federation stated in findings released last month.",
      "The toy industry is also sounding the alarm, with the Toy Association calling the potential tariffs \"significantly harmful\" and urging its members to contact their Congressional delegates to express their concern.",
      "Tariffs are essentially a tax on imports, but rather than being paid by the exporting country or company, the levy is paid by the importer \u2014 and much of that is handed off to consumers in the form of higher prices.",
      "\"A tariff of 60% on China would be a major shock to international goods markets,\" experts at the Peterson Institute for International Economics wrote in a Dec. 12 blog post.",
      "The toy industry would be one of the U.S. industries facing the worst impacts because China is the dominant supplier to the U.S., they added.",
      "\"While toys seem like products for which substitute sellers would be readily available, China maintains a dominant position in toy production for several reasons, including its not-easily-reproduced capacity to produce materials that meet US product safety standards,\" they noted.",
      "Still, some economists say Trump could use the threat of tariffs as a bargaining tool, without actually implementing the import duties. And tariffs could also encourage more U.S. manufacturing of toys and other products, although that would likely take time for new factories to ramp up.",

      "An orca who made headlines in 2018 after she carried her dead calf on her head for more than two weeks and a distance of 1,000 miles has given birth again, according to the Center for Whale Research.",
      "The killer whale calf was spotted in the Puget Sound area off Washington state several days ago. On Tuesday, the center determined J35, also known as Tahlequah, was the baby's mother. The calf, a girl, was given the designation J61.",
      "It's not all good news for the mom and baby though.",
      "\"The team, including multiple experienced killer whale researchers, have expressed concern about the calf's health based on the behavior of both J35 and J61,\" the Center for Whale Research wrote in a Facebook post. \"Early life is always dangerous for new calves, with a very high mortality rate in the first year. J35 is an experienced mother, and we hope that she is able to keep J61 alive through these difficult early days.\"",
      "The organization, which tracks southern resident orca populations in the Pacific Northwest, did not specify what sparked the concern. Seattle-based Orca Conservancy wrote on social media that researchers believe the calf was born prematurely. Orca Conservancy said the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has been able to spend time on the water with the calf and they observed the baby \"remaining underwater for extended amounts of time indicating nursing or attempts to nurse.\"",
      "\"The calf had also been observed being pushed around on J35's head and was not looking lively, which is a concern, but also added calf behavior is not fully understood,\" Orca Conservancy wrote.",
      "Tahlequah also\u00a0gave birth to a calf in 2020. Experts at the time described it as big news, because up to 70% of orca pregnancies end with a either a miscarriage or a calf that dies shortly after birth.",
      "Southern resident killer whales, like Tahlequah, are the only endangered population of killer whales in the U.S., according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The summer population census for 2020 counted only 72 southern resident killer whales, though several calves have been born since the census. Though a recovery plan was completed in 2008, the population continues to struggle and has declined over 10% since 2005.",
      "\"The Southern Resident killer whale population needs ample access to their food supply, mainly salmon, to survive and thrive,\" the Center for Whale Research wrote in a Facebook post. \"Every single birth counts and these whales need enough fish to be able to support themselves and their calves. We continue to advocate for salmon recovery through habitat restoration, removal of dams, and rational management of fisheries in the Pacific Northwest.\"",

      "India's former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, widely regarded as the architect of India's economic reform program and a landmark nuclear deal with the United States, has died. He was 92.",
      "Singh was admitted to New Delhi's All India Institute of Medical Sciences late Thursday after his health deteriorated due to a \"sudden loss of consciousness at home,\" the hospital said in a statement.",
      "\"Resuscitative measures were started immediately at home. He was brought to the Medical Emergency\" at 8:06 p.m., the hospital said, but \"despite all efforts, he could not be revived and was declared dead at 9:51 p.m.\"",
      "Singh was being treated for \"age-related medical conditions,\" the statement said.",
      "A mild-mannered technocrat, Singh became one of India's longest-serving prime ministers for 10 years and leader of the Congress Party in the Parliament's Upper House, earning a reputation as a man of great personal integrity. He was chosen to fill the role in 2004 by Sonia Gandhi, the widow of assassinated Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi.",
      "But his sterling image was tainted by allegations of corruption against his ministers.",
      "Singh was reelected in 2009, but his second term as prime minister was clouded by financial scandals and corruption charges over the organization of the 2010 Commonwealth Games. This led to the Congress Party's crushing defeat in the 2014 national election by the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party under the leadership of Narendra Modi.",
      "Singh adopted a low profile after relinquishing the post of prime minister.",
      "Prime Minister Modi, who succeeded Singh in 2014, called him one of India's \"most distinguished leaders\" who rose from humble origins and left \"a strong imprint on our economic policy over the years.\"",
      "\"As our Prime Minister, he made extensive efforts to improve people's lives,\" Modi said in a post on the social platform X. He called Singh's interventions in Parliament as a lawmaker \"insightful\" and said \"his wisdom and humility were always visible.\"",
      "Rahul Gandhi, from the same party as Singh and the opposition leader in the lower house of the Indian Parliament, said Singh's \"deep understanding of economics inspired the nation\" and that he \"led India with immense wisdom and integrity.\"",

      "\"We mourn Dr. Singh's passing and will always remember his dedication to bringing the United States and India closer together,\" Blinken said.",
      "Born on Sept. 26, 1932, in a village in the Punjab province of undivided India, Singh's brilliant academic career took him to Cambridge University in Britain, where he earned a degree in economics in 1957. He then got his doctorate in economics from Nuffield College at Oxford University in 1962.",
      "Singh taught at Panjab University and the prestigious Delhi School of Economics before joining the Indian government in 1971 as economic advisor in the Commerce Ministry. In 1982, he became chief economic adviser to the Finance Ministry. He also served as deputy chair of the Planning Commission and governor of the Reserve Bank of India.",
      "As finance minister, Singh in 1991 instituted reforms that opened up the economy and moved India away from a socialist-patterned economy and toward a capitalist model in the face of a huge balance of payments deficit, skirting a potential economic crisis.",
      "His accolades include the 1987 Padma Vibhushan Award, India's second-highest civilian honor; the Jawaharlal Nehru Birth Centenary Award of the Indian Science Congress in 1995; and the Asia Money Award for Finance Minister of the Year in 1993 and 1994.",
      "Singh was a member of India's Upper House of Parliament and was leader of the opposition from 1998 to 2004 before he was named prime minister. He was the first Sikh to hold the country's top post and made a public apology in Parliament for the 1984 Sikh Massacre in which some 3,000 Sikhs were killed after then-Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was assassinated by Sikh bodyguards.",
      "Under Singh, India adopted a Right to Information Act in 2005 to promote accountability and transparency from government officials and bureaucrats. He was also instrumental in implementing a welfare scheme that guaranteed at least 100 paid workdays for Indian rural citizens.",
      "The coalition government he headed for a decade brought together politicians and parties with differing ideologies that were rivals in the country's various states.",
      "In a move hailed as one of his biggest achievements apart from economic reforms, Singh ended India's nuclear isolation by signing a deal with the U.S. that gave India access to American nuclear technology.",
      "But the deal hit his government adversely, with Communist allies withdrawing support and criticism of the agreement growing within India in 2008 when it was finalized.",
      "Singh adopted a pragmatic foreign policy approach, pursuing a peace process with nuclear rival and neighbor Pakistan. But his efforts suffered a major setback after Pakistani militants carried out a massive gun and bomb attack in Mumbai in November 2008.",
      "He also tried to end the border dispute with China, brokering a deal to reopen the Nathu La pass into Tibet, which had been closed for more than 40 years.",
      "His 1965 book, \"India's Export Trends and Prospects for Self-Sustained Growth,\" dealt with India's inward-oriented trade policy.",

      "Azerbaijan on Thursday observed a nationwide day of mourning for the victims of the plane crash that killed 38 people and left 29 survivors injured, as speculation mounted about the cause of the disaster \u2014 including whether possible Russian air defense operations may have played a role.",
      "Azerbaijan Airlines' Embraer 190 was en route from Azerbaijan's capital of Baku to the Russian city of Grozny in the North Caucasus on Wednesday when it was diverted, for reasons that are still unclear, and crashed while trying to land in Aktau, in western Kazakhstan, after flying east across the Caspian Sea. The plane went down about 2 miles from Aktau.",
      "A U.S. official told CBS News there are early indications a Russian anti-aircraft system may have struck the plane. The official, who asked not to be publicly identified, said that if these indications prove true, it would further underscore Russian recklessness in its invasion of Ukraine.",
      "Cellphone footage circulating online appeared to show the aircraft making a steep descent before smashing into the ground in a fireball. Other footage and photos showed part of its fuselage ripped away from the wings and the rear half of the aircraft lying upside down in the grass.",
      "Speaking at a news conference Wednesday, Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev said it was too soon to speculate on the reasons behind the crash but said the weather had forced the plane to change from its planned course.",

      "Russian anti-aircraft systems eyed in investigation",
      "As the official crash investigation started, theories abounded about a possible cause, with some analysts alleging that holes seen in the plane's tail section possibly indicate it could have come under fire from Russian air defense systems, like those used for fending off Ukrainian drone attacks.",
      "Ukrainian drones had previously attacked Grozny, the provincial capital of the Russian republic of Chechnya, and other regions in the country's North Caucasus. Some Russian media claimed there was another drone attack on Chechnya Wednesday, though it wasn't officially confirmed.",
      "Yan Matveyev, an independent Russian military expert, noted that images of the crashed plane's tail reveal the damage compatible with shrapnel from a small surface-to-air missiles, such as the Pantsyr-S1 air defense system.",
      "\"It looks like the tail section of the plane was damaged by some missile fragments,\" he said.",
      "Osprey Flight Solutions, an aviation security firm based in the United Kingdom, warned its clients that the \"Azerbaijan Airlines flight was likely shot down by a Russian military air-defense system.\" Osprey provides analysis for carriers still flying into Russia after Western airlines halted their flights during the war in Ukraine.",
      "Osprey CEO Andrew Nicholson said the company had issued more than 200 alerts regarding drone attacks and air defense systems in Russia during the war.",
      "\"This incident is a stark reminder of why we do what we do,\" Nicholson wrote online. \"It is painful to know that despite our efforts, lives were lost in a way that could have been avoided.\"",
      "Russian military expert Yury Podolyaka was cited by Agence France-Presse as saying holes seen in the plane's wreckage were similar to those an \"anti-aircraft missile system\" would leave. \"Everything points to that,\" he wrote.",
      "And Gerard Legauffre, a former expert at France's BEA air accident investigation agency, also said there appeared to be \"a lot of shrapnel\" damage to the wreckage, according to AFP.",
      "He depicted it as \"reminiscent\" of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17, a passenger jet that was downed with a surface-to-air missile by Russia-backed rebels over eastern Ukraine in 2014.",
      "But when asked about the claims that the plane had been fired upon by air defense assets, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters, \"It would be wrong to make hypotheses before investigators make their verdict.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 26 Dec 2024 15:27:52 -0500",
    "summary": "Boxing Day 2024 is here, but not all Americans understand the meaning of the holiday celebrated in countries like the U.K. and Canada.",
    "story": [
      "Boxing Day, the traditionally British holiday recognized the day after Christmas, offers an extension of the festivities. People in countries like Canada, the U.K. and South Africa spend an extra day with friends, shopping or watching sports.",
      "Andrew McLean and his wife moved to the U.S. from Manchester almost 25 years ago. They brought the holiday celebration across the pond with them and host a Boxing Day party every year.",
      "\"We've enjoyed America. We love being here,\" he told CBS News. \"But there are lots of things about Britain that we miss. Boxing Day is probably in that top 10.\"",
      "What is Boxing Day?",
      "Boxing Day is celebrated on Dec. 26 by the United Kingdom, its commonwealth countries and some former colonies.",
      "Stores run shopping deals, similar to Black Friday, and fans cheer on sporting events such as soccer, cricket, rugby, horse racing and hunting.",
      "McLean said that hosting a Boxing Day party is also a great way to finish off some of the Christmas food. Turkey is a traditional British Christmas meal and on Boxing Day, many enjoy a turkey curry. Another classic Boxing Day dish is bubble and squeak, or fried leftover potato and greens like cabbage or Brussels sprouts.",
      "Why is it called Boxing Day and what are its origins?",
      "There are two major theories for where the holiday began.",
      "Some believe that Boxing Day began with churches collecting alms boxes of parishioners' donated money, according to Britannica. The church would give these boxes of donations to the poor the day after Christmas.",
      "The name has stuck, but now, people typically donate to charity in the weeks leading up to the holidays.",
      "Others believe that the day was observed because servants had to work at Christmas dinners and festivities, so they celebrated the holiday on Dec. 26. According to History.com, the lords and aristocrats would give their servants \"Christmas boxes\" filled with leftovers and small gifts after the parties, leading to the name \"Boxing Day.\"",
      "Employers still give service workers bonuses around the holidays, just as leftovers still are a part of celebrations today.",
      "A third theory, according to TimeOut, is that British naval ships would seal a box of money at the start of a long voyage, and at the end, priests would open the boxes and donate the money to those in need.",
      "McLean said other theories about the name include bare-knuckle boxing matches that occurred the day after Christmas, or that many people return their boxes of unwanted gifts that day.",
      "Is Boxing Day an official holiday?",
      "Yes, Boxing Day is a public or bank holiday recognized in the U.K. and other countries. It was made an official U.K. holiday in the 1800s. If Dec. 26 falls on a weekend, it is recognized on the following Monday. In 2024, it falls on a Thursday and in 2025, it will fall on a Friday.",
      "Where is it celebrated?",
      "Countries that are a part of the British Commonwealth like Australia, Canada and New Zealand celebrate but some former colonies like South Africa and Hong Kong also recognize the holiday.",
      "However, people can celebrate anywhere, as demonstrated by the McLeans' party. Even though some of their American friends work on the 26th, people gather at their house in the evening for a spirited pub quiz, yummy leftovers and mulled wine.",
      "Is Boxing Day the same as St. Stephen's Day?",
      "Not necessarily, because St. Stephen's Day is a religious holiday, but the two are linked and are recognized on the same day. Christians observe St. Stephen's Day in celebration of the first Christian martyr who was known for helping the poor and for his charitable work. St. Stephen's Day is more widely recognized in Ireland and other European countries.",
      "Why don't Americans recognize Boxing Day?",
      "The U.S. is one of the few English-speaking countries that does not recognize Boxing Day. Americans don't celebrate mainly because the country is not part of the British Commonwealth and the holiday did not become officially recognized until 1871, almost a century after the U.S. gained independence.",
      "What sporting events are happening on Boxing Day this year?",
      "Unlike in the U.S., where Americans can expect an NBA game on Christmas, Boxing Day is where U.K. competition goes down.",
      "Eight Premiere League soccer games are set to compete on Dec. 26. In GMT, the games are:",
      "Manchester City vs Everton at 12:30Bournemouth vs Crystal Palace at 15:00Chelsea vs Fulham at 15:00Newcastle vs Aston Villa at 15:00Nottingham Forest vs Tottenham at 15:00Southampton vs West Ham at 15:00Wolves vs Manchester United at 17:30Liverpool vs Leicester at 20:00",

      "11 horse races are also lined up for Boxing Day.",
      "McLean emphasized the joy of sharing British culture with American friends.",
      "\"It's just, it's a great thing to be able to bring people together, not just on the days that everyone celebrates.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 26 Dec 2024 10:59:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Here's what to know about the United States' involvement with building and operating the Panama Canal.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump has repeatedly suggested the United States take over the Panama Canal, a shipping waterway that cuts across Central America, unless fees for using the canal are lowered.",
      "Panama's leader shot back in a recent statement, saying the waterway is not for sale. Since then, Trump has posted repeatedly about the canal.",
      "It's the latest in a series of similar statements from Trump, who recently suggested the United States take over Greenland, an idea he also floated during his first presidency. He's also joked about Canada\u00a0being a U.S. state.",
      "Here's what to know about the history of the Panama Canal and the United States' involvement with the shipping lane.",
      "History of the Panama Canal",
      "The Panama Canal was built by the United States between 1904 and 1913, and opened in 1917. Building the canal cost about $375 million, making it the most expensive construction project in U.S. history at that time, according to the Panama Canal Authority. Thousands of laborers died during the grueling construction process.",
      "The canal connects the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, offering ships a shortcut to avoid going around the tip of South America. The canal revolutionized shipping traffic in the region.",
      "The U.S. acquired the rights to build and operate the canal in the early 20th century, but at the time, Panama was in the process of seceding from Colombia, whose senate was refusing to ratify a treaty that would allow the canal to be built, according to the\u00a0State Department's Office of the Historian.",
      "To ensure the canal could be built, then-President Theodore Roosevelt supported Panamanian independence, and in 1903, the U.S. and Panama signed a treaty that established permanent U.S. rights to a \"Panama Canal Zone\" that stretched across the nation. However, the person who negotiated on Panama's behalf did not have formal consent from the nation's government and had not lived in the country for 17 years, causing many Panamanians to question the treaty's validity, according to the Office of the Historian.",
      "Throughout the 20th century, the U.S. and Panama dealt with tensions surrounding the canal, including a riot in the 1960s that led to a brief disruption in diplomatic relations between the countries. In 1967, the U.S. and Panama began negotiating a new treaty, eventually reaching an agreement, but a change in elected leaders and a coup in Panama led to the establishment of a new government in the Central American nation, according to the Office of the Historian. Because of that, the negotiations \"suffered a major setback.\"",
      "Negotiations continued through the '70s. When Jimmy Carter was elected president, he made concluding the negotiation process a priority, and in 1977, two treaties were submitted to the U.S. Senate: the Neutrality Treaty, which said the U.S. could use its military to defend the canal, allowing \"perpetual U.S. usage\" of the waterway, and the Panama Canal Treaty, which would end the existence of the Panama Canal Zone and allow the canal to be turned over to Panama in December 1999. As part of the second treaty, Panama would also become primarily responsible for defending the canal.",
      "The treaties, collectively known as the Torrijos-Carter Treaties, were signed on Sept. 7, 1977. In the spring of 1978, the U.S. Senate voted to ratify the treaties, and Carter signed them into law on Sept. 27, 1979. The canal was transferred to Panama on Dec. 31, 1999, during the Clinton administration.",
      "Who operates the Panama Canal?",
      "The Panama Canal has been owned and operated by the Panama Canal Authority, a government-owned agency, since 1999. The agency was established shortly before the canal was returned to Panama.",
      "Since taking control of the waterway, the Panama Canal Authority has invested billions in expanding the canal. A $5.25 billion expansion of the canal opened in 2016, doubling the waterway's capacity and cutting global maritime costs by an estimated $8 billion a year, CBS News previously reported. The expansion also allowed larger ships to pass.",
      "Who uses the Panama Canal?",
      "About 40% of the world's cargo ship traffic moves through the Panama Canal, CBS News previously reported, though recent droughts have forced operators to reduce ship crossings.",
      "About two-thirds of the traffic in the canal is either headed for or leaving the United States, though ships from all over the world use the waterway each day, according to the Panama Canal Authority.",
      "Between 13,000 and 14,000 ships use the canal each year, the agency said.",
      "Trump and Panamanian president clash",
      "Trump first seemed to suggest the United States should take over the Panama Canal in a TruthSocial post on December 21.",
      "He also raised the issue to a crowd of supporters at Turning Point's\u00a0AmericaFest\u00a0on Sunday, where he said Panama is charging \"exorbitant prices\" and said the \"complete ripoff of our country will immediately stop.\"",
      "\"If the principles, both moral and legal, of this magnanimous gesture of giving, are not followed, then we will demand that the Panama Canal be returned to the United States of America, in full, quickly and without question,\" Trump said.",
      "On Wednesday, Trump said he would nominate Miami-Dade International Trade Consortium member Kevin Marino Cabrera to be the U.S. ambassador to Panama. In that\u00a0announcement, he accused Panama of \"ripping us off on the Panama Canal, far beyond their wildest dream.\"",
      "Trump continued to post online about the U.S. regaining ownership of the canal, and referenced the canal in a Christmas Day message shared on TruthSocial. He warned of potential influence from China at the shipping waterway, though there is no Chinese presence at the canal, according to\u00a0Reuters. A Hong Kong-based company manages two ports along the canal, Reuters said.",
      "Panama President Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino said in a statement shared on social media that \"every square meter\" of the canal \"belongs to Panama and will continue belonging to Panama.\"",
      "\"We'll see about that!\" Trump wrote online in response.",
      "Mulino responded to Trump again in a news conference on Thursday, saying that \"anyone in the world is free to visit the canal\" and adding that \"there is not a single Chinese soldier in the canal, and on the other hand, there will not be, and we maintain a respectful, well-managed relationship with China.\" Mulino hosts weekly news conferences.",
      "Mulino said that while there are \"delicate problems such as immigration\" that both he and Trump \"are concerned about as presidents,\" the two leaders have \"nothing to discuss\" as far as ownership of the Panama Canal.",
      "\"The specific approach, the Canal is Panamanian and belongs to Panamanians, there is no possibility of opening any kind of conversation about this reality that has cost the country tears, sweat and blood to achieve,\" Mulino said.",

      "Many wept as they placed flowers at a mass grave in Ulee Lheue village, where more than 14,000 unidentified tsunami victims are buried. It is one of several mass graves in Banda Aceh, the capital of Indonesia's northernmost province, which was one of the areas worst hit by a magnitude 9.1 earthquake and the massive tsunami it triggered.",
      "\"We miss them and we still don't know where they are. All we know is that every year we visit the mass grave in Ulee Lhue and Siron,\" said Muhamad Amirudin, who lost two of his children 20 years ago and has never found their bodies.",

      "The powerful earthquake off the coast of the Indonesian island of Sumatra on Dec. 26, 2004, triggered a tsunami that killed around 230,000 people across a dozen countries, reaching as far as East Africa. Waves towering up to 100 feet high swept away nearly everything \u2014 and everyone \u2014 in their path.",
      "Some 1.7 million people were displaced, mostly in the four worst-affected countries: Indonesia, Sri Lanka, India and Thailand.",
      "More than 170,000 people died in Indonesia alone.",
      "Even though 20 years have passed, survivors in Indonesia are still grieving the loved ones they lost to the giant wave that flattened buildings all the way to the provincial capital of Banda Aceh.",

      "Indonesia, which is located along the fault lines that make up the\u00a0Pacific \"Ring of Fire,\" is particularly vulnerable to earthquakes and tsunamis. It suffered another disaster in 2018 when huge waves were triggered by an earthquake in Sulawesi, killing thousands.",
      "In the years since 2004, infrastructure in Aceh has been rebuilt and is now more resilient than before the tsunami struck. Early warning systems have been installed in coastal areas to alert residents of incoming tsunamis, providing crucial time to seek safety.",
      "The rebuilding efforts were made possible by the support of international donors and organizations, which contributed significant funds to help the region recover. Schools, hospitals, and essential infrastructure destroyed by the disaster have been reconstructed.",
      "In Thailand, people gathered at a memorial ceremony in Ban Nam Khem, a small fishing village in Phang Nga province that bore the brunt of the devastating wave in the country.",
      "The tsunami claimed the lives of over 8,000 people in Thailand, including many who remain missing, leaving a deep scar in the nation's history. Nearly 400 bodies remain unclaimed.",
      "Mourners shed tears and comforted each other as they laid flowers at the village's tsunami memorial. Around 300 people joined a modest ceremony with Muslim, Christian and Buddhist prayers.",
      "Urai Sirisuk said she avoids the seaside memorial park the rest of the year because the loss of her 4-year-old daughter still cuts deep every time she's reminded of it.",
      "\"I have this feeling that the sea has taken my child. I'm very angry with it. I can't even put my foot in the water,\" she said.",

Only a few dozen people are believed to have survived.",
      "Anura Ranjith joined the mourners to pay respects to his younger sister, Anula Ranjani, and her 9-year-old daughter who were passengers on the train. Ranjith never heard from them after that day.",

      "There was little to no warning at the time, but in the years since the 2004 disaster, a tsunami warning system has been put into place to help protect the region. A network of seismometers to detect undersea earthquakes, along with tidal gauges and ocean buoys, can pick up early signals of the tremors that generate tsunamis, and improved communication networks help get those warnings to officials around the globe.",

      "Moscow \u2014 An Azerbaijani airliner with 67 people on board crashed Wednesday in western Kazakhstan, near the city of Aktau, killing 38 people and leaving 29 survivors, a Kazakh official said.",
      "Kazakh    Deputy Prime Minister Kanat Bozumbaev disclosed the figures while meeting with Azerbaijani officials, the Russian news agency Interfax reported.",
      "Azerbaijan Airlines said 67 people were on board \u2014 62 passengers and five crew members. Interfax quoted emergency workers at the scene as saying a preliminary assessment showed both pilots died in the crash.",
      "The Embraer 190 aircraft attempted to make an emergency landing roughly two miles from Aktau, Azerbaijan Airlines said. Russia's civil aviation authority, Rosaviatsia, said that preliminary information showed that the pilots diverted to Aktau after a bird strike led to an emergency on board.",
      "The plane was originally scheduled to travel from the Azerbaijani capital of Baku to the Russian city of Grozny in the North Caucasus. Russian news agencies said the plane had been rerouted due to fog in Grozny, Reuters reported.",
      "Speaking at a news conference, Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev said that it was too soon to speculate on the reasons behind the crash, but said that the weather had forced the plane to change from its planned course.",
      "\"The information provided to me is that the plane changed its course between Baku and Grozny due to worsening weather conditions and headed to Aktau airport, where it crashed upon landing,\" he said.",

      "According to Kazakh officials, those aboard the plane included 42 Azerbaijani citizens, 16 Russian nationals, six Kazakhs and three Kyrgyzstan nationals. Azerbaijan's prosecutor general's office previously said that 32 of the 67 people on board had survived the crash, but told journalists that the number wasn't final.",

      "Other footage showed part of its fuselage ripped away from the wings and the rest of the aircraft lying upside in the grass. The footage corresponded to the plane's colors and its registration number.",
      "Some of the videos posted on social media showed survivors dragging fellow passengers away from the plane's wreckage.",
      "Unverified video showed people stumbling from a piece of the fuselage that remained intact, Reuters reported.",
      "Flight-tracking data from FlightRadar24.com showed the aircraft making what appeared to be a figure-eight as it neared the airport in Aktau, its altitude moving up and down substantially over the last minutes of the flight before impacting the ground.",
      "FlightRadar24 separately said in an online post that the aircraft had faced \"strong GPS jamming\" which \" made the aircraft transmit bad ADS-B data,\" referring to the information that enables flight-tracking websites to follow planes in flight. Russia has been blamed in the past for jamming GPS transmissions in the wider region.",
      "Embraer told The Associated Press in a statement that the company is \"ready to assist all relevant authorities.\"",
      "In a statement, Azerbaijan Airlines said it would keep members of the public updated and changed its social media banners to solid black.

    "story": [
      "Pope Francis delivered a plea for peace in a world torn by conflict in his 2024 Christmas Day \"Urbi et Orbi\" (\"To the City and the World\") address. It came as Christmas marked the start of the 2025 Holy Year celebration that is expected to bring some 32 million Catholic faithful to Rome.",
      "\"I invite every individual, and all people of all nations ... to become pilgrims of hope, to silence the sounds of arms and overcome divisions,\" the pontiff said, speaking from the balcony of St. Peter's Basilica to a crowd of thousands of people in the square below.",
      "He urged negotiations between\u00a0Ukraine and Russia\u00a0to \"achieve a just and lasting peace\" and end the war that has killed tens of thousands since Moscow's full-scale invasion more than two years ago. The conflict did not pause for the holiday, as Russia carried out what it called a\u00a0\"massive strike\" targeting energy facilities\u00a0in Ukraine on Christmas Day.",
      "Pope Francis also renewed his call for a ceasefire in the\u00a0Israel-Hamas war, calling\u00a0 the\u00a0humanitarian crisis in Gaza\u00a0\"extremely grave,\" and urged the release of the remaining Israeli hostages held by Hamas.",
      "He encouraged people around the world \"to tear down all walls of separation,\" and remembered children suffering from war and hunger, the elderly living in solitude, those fleeing their homelands, and those persecuted for their faith.",
      "Pilgrims lined up early Wednesday to walk through the great Holy Door at the entrance of St. Peter's Basilica for Christmas observances. On Christmas Eve, Pope Francis knocked on the door and was the first to enter through it, inaugurating the 2025 Jubilee that he dedicated to hope.",
      "Traversing the Holy Door is one way that the faithful can obtain indulgences, or forgiveness for sins during a Jubilee, a once-every-quarter-century tradition that dates from 1300.",
      "\"You feel so humble when you go through the door that once you go through is almost like a release, a release of emotions,'' said Blanca Martin, a pilgrim from San Diego. \"... It's almost like a release of emotions, you feel like now you are able to let go and put everything in the hands of God. See I am getting emotional. It's just a beautiful experience.\"",
      "Visitors submitted to security controls before entering the Holy Door, amid new security fears following a deadly Christmas market attack in Germany. Many paused to touch the door as they passed and made the sign of the cross upon entering the basilica dedicated to St. Peter, founder of the Roman Catholic Church.",
      "Inside, the beauty of a\u00a0newly restored St. Peter's Basilica was revealed after extensive restoration work was undertaken in preparation for the Jubilee Year.",
      "One of the most significant restorations is of\u00a0Bernini's Baldachin, a canopy that sits atop\u00a0the tomb of St. Peter, removing centuries of grime to showcase its gleaming gold finish.

      "While Hanukkah is intended as an upbeat, celebratory holiday, rabbis note that it's taking place this year as wars rage in the Middle East and fears rise over widespread incidents of antisemitism. The holidays overlap infrequently because the Jewish calendar is based on lunar cycles and is not in sync with the Gregorian calendar, which sets Christmas on Dec. 25. The last time Hanukkah began on Christmas Day was in 2005.",
      "Germany's celebrations muted after market attack",

      "The king, who was diagnosed with cancer earlier this year, waved to a large crowd of onlookers as he walked alongside his wife, Queen Camilla. They were joined by Prince William, Prince of Wales, and his wife Catherine, Princess of Wales, the king's daughter-in-law, who has been slowly returning\u00a0to public duties after her own cancer diagnosis and a course of chemotherapy.",
      "In a reflection of the medical treatments they have received, Charles used his annual Christmas message to highlight health workers.",
      "\"From a personal point of view, I offer special heartfelt thanks to the selfless doctors and nurses who this year have supported me and other members of my family through the uncertainties and anxieties of illness, and have helped provide the strength, care and comfort we have needed,\" Charles said in his remarks, broadcast to millions of viewers in the United Kingdom and across the Commonwealth.",

      "This is the king's third Christmas speech since he ascended the throne after his mother, Queen Elizabeth, died in September 2022. It is the first since he was diagnosed with an undisclosed form of cancer in February.",
      "Charles' speech was recorded on Dec. 11 at Fitzrovia Chapel in London, which was part of the now-demolished Middlesex Hospital where his first wife, Diana, opened London's first dedicated ward for those with AIDS. The building is richly decorated in a Gothic Revival style featuring more than 500 stars in a gold leaf ceiling.",

      "\"The Christmas story encourages us to consider the experiences and feelings of others,\" she said. \"It also reflects our own vulnerabilities and reminds us of the importance of giving and receiving empathy, as well as just how much we need each other in spite of our differences.\"",
      "Prince Andrew absent at Christmas event",
      "One familiar face was absent from the traditional scene outside St. Mary Magdalene Church: Prince Andrew. The king's 64-year-old brother has retreated further into the shadows amid news that a Chinese businessman had been barred from the U.K. because of concerns he cultivated links with Andrew on behalf of the Chinese Communist Party.",
      "Andrew, once second in line to the British throne, has become a constant source of tabloid fodder because of his money woes and links to questionable characters, including the late American financier and convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "Even though Andrew had stepped back from public duties, he has continued to appear at family events and his absence from Sandringham suggests a further retreat from the public eye. The king has been under pressure to put more distance between Andrew and the royal family to avoid further embarrassment to the monarchy.",
      "While Andrew has said he never discussed anything sensitive with the suspected Chinese spy and that he ceased contact with the man as soon as concerns were raised, the scandal raises further questions about his judgment and distracts from the work of the royal family, said Ed Owens, author of \"After Elizabeth: Can the Monarchy Save Itself?''",
      "\"The reason why this is a problem for the king is simply that the king is trying to rebrand the monarchy at the moment, centering its focus around him, but also around William, Catherine, what they are trying to do,\" Owens said.",
      "\"It's been a very difficult year for the monarchy, not least because of the two cancer diagnoses.

      "A team of 14 specialists worked with de Juan to lift the shipwreck from the sea in less than two months, beginning the project Sept. 13 and finishing Nov. 7. Video shows divers carrying wooden fragments of the wreck to the surface in pieces.",
      "Phoenicia was an ancient civilization along the eastern Mediterranean coast, in the area of modern-day Lebanon, Syria and Israel, which existed from about 1500 to 300 B.C.E. Although historians say Phoenicians thrived for a time on trade and developed an alphabet that formed the basis for the ones later produced by ancient Greece and Rome, many traces of the civilization were considered lost until the 20th century.",
      "Artifacts like Mazarr\u00f3n II can help shed light on Phoenician culture, said de Juan. He noted in his comments to the University of Valencia that little is known about Phoenician naval construction, even now, despite the wealth of information about ships built nearby in the Mediterranean by the ancient Greeks.",
      "\"Therefore, this wreck is a very important contribution to this area of study,\" de Juan said. He noted that elements of the Mazarr\u00f3n II are similar to construction designs seen in cultures throughout the surrounding region, but some are distinctive and mysterious, at least for now.",
      "Each piece of the shipwreck has been transferred to a laboratory at the Museum of Underwater Archaeology, in southern Spain. The lab will work carefully to conserve its remains, in a process that will likely take several more years.",

      "During a recent interview on The Hollywood Reporter's \"Awards Chatter\" podcast, the film's director, Chris Columbus, answered one of the internet's most burning questions: What did the McCallister parents do for a living?",
      "In the film, not only does the family live in a mansion in Chicago, but the parents, played by Catherine O'Hara and John Heard, are able to pay for a trip to Paris, for 15 people, including both their immediate and extended family members. Many fans of the film have been wondering, since the movie's 1990 release, how the couple were able to afford everything.",
      "\"Back then, John and I had a conversation about it, and we decided on what the jobs were,\" Columbus said. \"We thought the mother, at the time, because we used mannequins in the basement \u2014 I do remember having a conversation \u2014 she was a very successful fashion designer. The father could have, based on John Hughes' own experience, worked in advertising, but I don\u2019t remember what the father did.\"",

      "How is beef tallow made?",

      "From suggested scripts that sound more like hostage negotiations to icebreakers better suited for therapy sessions than a festive family gathering, here are five of the most over-the-top ideas mainstream media is dishing out to keep your Christmas \"Trump-proof.\"",
      "1. Cancel Christmas altogether",
      "For one HuffPost contributor, the election of Trump wasn't just a political turning point \u2014 it was a holiday deal-breaker. Faced with the knowledge that her husband and his family voted for the former president, she decided to cancel both Thanksgiving and Christmas altogether. No lights, no carols, no awkward family dinners.",

I will not sit by a Christmas tree celebrating the birth of Jesus and sipping eggnog when I know how many people may now find themselves in grave \u2013 even deadly \u2014 danger because they cannot get the reproductive care they need. I will not unwrap gifts given to me by people who voted for a party that has talked about building internment camps and mass deportation.\"",

      "After a psychologist made headlines last month arguing people should avoid Trump-supporting relatives this holiday season, \"The View\" co-host Sunny Hostin agreed, saying many people feel \"someone voted not only against their families but against them.\"",
      "Shortly after the election, Yale University chief psychiatry resident Dr. Amanda Calhoun spoke to MSNBC host Joy Reid about how liberals who are devastated by Trump\u2019s re-election can cope with the news, including separating from loved ones.",
      "\"There is a push, I think just a societal norm that if somebody is your family, that they are entitled to your time, and I think the answer is absolutely not,\" Calhoun told the talk show host. \"So if you are going to a situation where you have family members, where you have close friends who you know have voted in ways that are against you, like what you said, against your livelihood, it\u2019s completely fine to not be around those people and to tell them why, you know, to say, \u2018I have a problem with the way that you voted, because it went against my very livelihood and I\u2019m not going to be around you this holiday.\u2019\"",
      "3. Use therapy techniques to divert the conversation",
      "If your holiday feast feels more like a political debate than a festive gathering, Time magazine has your back with a list of 11 carefully crafted phrases to defuse family tension.",
      "The top pick? A simple yet stern declaration: \"I won\u2019t be talking about politics today.\" Framed as a way to create a politics-free safe zone, the advice encourages setting boundaries with relatives whose views you loathe \u2014 so you can focus on what really matters.",

If the conversation still ends up turning in that direction, shut it down: \u2018OK, that\u2019s enough of that,\u2019 or, \u2018We\u2019re not talking about that here today,\u2019\" the Time article states.",

      "The Associated Press has a simple solution: take a breather. Whether the conversation veers into a political minefield or Uncle Bob just won\u2019t stop, the AP suggests calmly excusing yourself from the fray. No need for a dramatic exit \u2014 just a composed stroll to the kitchen, the porch, or anywhere that isn\u2019t the battlefield of your family table.",

Sometimes, it\u2019s about clarity, and the difficult choices that come with it.",

According to a July 2024 warning from the\u00a0FBI and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, these scams are part of the cartel's efforts to diversify their revenue streams and finance other criminal activities, including drug trafficking.",
      "Since at least 2012, the cartel and other Mexico-based transnational criminal organizations have increasingly targeted U.S. owners of timeshare properties in Mexico, particularly older adults who are often more vulnerable to such scams. The proceeds from these fraudulent activities not only support the cartel's operations but also contribute to the manufacturing and trafficking of dangerous substances like fentanyl into the United States.",

      "How these scams work",
      "The Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG) has expanded its criminal activities beyond traditional drug trafficking into sophisticated scams, including timeshare fraud targeting unsuspecting individuals, particularly Americans. Here are some of the methods employed by the cartel in executing these scams:",
      "Impersonation of legitimate entities: Scammers often pose as legitimate real estate agents, escrow companies or even officials from U.S. government agencies like the Treasury Department. This tactic is designed to instill a sense of trust and urgency in potential victims, making them more susceptible to fraud.",
      "Targeting vulnerable populations: The cartel primarily targets elderly Americans who own timeshares in Mexico. These individuals are often contacted with offers to buy their timeshares at inflated values, but they are required to pay various fees upfront, such as taxes or closing costs, before any transaction can be completed. Once these payments are made, the scammers disappear, leaving victims with significant financial losses.",
      "Use of call centers: The CJNG operates illegal call centers where employees, often unaware of the cartel's true nature, engage in telemarketing schemes. These centers are strategically located in regions with high unemployment rates, providing a pool of workers who may be desperate for jobs. The call centers not only facilitate scams but also serve as a means for the cartel to exert control over local populations through intimidation and violence.",
      "Complex fraud schemes: The scams can involve multiple layers of deception. For instance, victims may be contacted multiple times by different scammers posing as various professionals (e.g., lawyers or real estate agents) who claim they can assist with selling their timeshares or recovering lost funds. This re-victimization often leads to further financial exploitation.",
      "Violence and intimidation: The cartel employs extreme measures to maintain control over its operations and silence potential whistleblowers. Reports indicate that workers attempting to quit these call centers have faced dire consequences, including murder, which serves as a chilling message to others considering leaving the cartel's employment. This brutal enforcement mechanism not only protects their operations but also instills fear within communities.",
      "Digital infrastructure: The CJNG utilizes a network of fraudulent websites and domains that appear legitimate at first glance. These websites often mimic real escrow and real estate firms, making it difficult for victims to discern the authenticity of their interactions. Many of these domains have been linked back to a central hub that manages multiple scam operations simultaneously.",
      "By understanding these operational tactics, you can better appreciate the complexities and dangers associated with scams perpetrated by organized crime groups like the Jalisco New Generation Cartel. This knowledge is crucial for potentially preventing future victimization.",

      "To avoid falling victim to similar scams, it is crucial to take proactive steps to safeguard your financial interests:",
      "1) Verify the buyer's identity and offer legitimacy: Always confirm the identity of any potential buyer and the authenticity of their offer. Contact the timeshare company directly to validate any claims made by the buyer.",
      "2) Research any company that contacts you: Conduct thorough research on any business reaching out to you. Look for reviews, complaints and verify their credentials through reliable sources.",
      "3) Be wary of upfront fees: Legitimate transactions typically do not require upfront fees for administrative or processing purposes. If a company requests such payments, exercise caution.",
      "4) Use secure communication channels: Avoid sharing personal or financial information over unsecured methods such as phone calls or emails. Opt for secure communication channels whenever possible.",
      "5) Do not click on links: Avoid clicking on any links or downloading attachments from unsolicited emails. Scammers often use these tactics to steal your personal information. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "6) Consult with professionals before proceeding with transactions: Seek advice from a real estate attorney or a trusted financial advisor before engaging in any transactions. Their expertise can help you navigate potential pitfalls.",
      "7) Report suspicious activity to authorities: If you suspect you've been targeted by a timeshare scam, don't hesitate to promptly report it to local authorities, the\u00a0FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center at ic3.gov or the Federal Trade Commission. Reporting can help protect others from falling victim to similar schemes.",
      "8) Invest in personal data removal services: While the advice provided is valuable, the most crucial step in protecting yourself from such scams is to minimize your online presence. By reducing the amount of personal information available on the web, you make it significantly harder for scammers to target you. No service promises to remove all your data from the internet. However, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

Over half of respondents (52%) admitted they have never adjusted their router\u2019s factory settings. Even more concerning, 86% of users have never changed their router administrator password. Leaving the default admin password unchanged is like leaving your front door unlocked. It\u2019s an open invitation for hackers to exploit.",
      "Similarly, 72% of respondents have never changed their Wi-Fi password. Default passwords are often easily accessible and can be exploited in seconds by knowledgeable attackers. Firmware updates, essential for patching vulnerabilities and enhancing router functionality, are also largely ignored. An overwhelming 89% of users have never updated their router\u2019s firmware. While newer routers often handle updates automatically, user awareness and action remain vital for those with older devices.",
      "Another glaring issue is the failure to change default network names, such as \"SKY12345\" or \"Linksys-7890.\" These identifiers can provide hackers with crucial information about the router model, making it easier to exploit known vulnerabilities. Yet, 89% of respondents have never changed their network name.",

      "\"Most concerning is the very high percentage of broadband subscribers who don\u2019t even know why they should be making any of these changes. This exposes a clear knowledge gap, and users need to be educated more about the simple steps they can take to help prevent cyberattacks.\"",

      "6 ways to protect your Wi-Fi router from hackers",
      "Keeping your home network secure is essential to prevent unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Follow these steps to safeguard your Wi-Fi router:",
      "1) Change default passwords:\u00a0Most routers come with default passwords that hackers can easily find online. To secure your router, change both the admin password (used to access settings) and the Wi-Fi network password. Use a strong password with at least 12 characters, combining uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers and symbols. Avoid simple options like \"password123\" or personal details such as your name or birth date.",
      "2) Rename your network (SSID):\u00a0The default network name, or SSID, often includes the router\u2019s brand or model, making it easier for hackers to identify vulnerabilities. Rename your network to something unique that doesn\u2019t reveal personal information. Avoid using names, addresses or other identifiers. Instead, opt for a neutral or creative name that\u2019s easy for you to recognize but hard for others to associate with you.",
      "3) Keep your router\u2019s firmware updated:\u00a0Router manufacturers release firmware updates to patch security flaws and enhance performance. Check your router\u2019s admin panel regularly for updates or enable automatic updates, if supported. Keeping your firmware up to date ensures you\u2019re protected against the latest threats. If your router is too old to receive updates, it might be time to upgrade to a newer, more secure model.",
      "4) Monitor network activity regularly:\u00a0Unauthorized devices on your network can slow it down and expose you to risks. Log into your router\u2019s admin settings to view all connected devices. If you see anything suspicious, disconnect it and immediately change your Wi-Fi password. You can also enable MAC address filtering to control which devices can access your network or disable features like WPS (Wi-Fi Protected Setup) that may leave you vulnerable.",
      "5) Enable network encryption: Use the strongest encryption protocol available for your router, preferably WPA3 or at least WPA2. Encryption scrambles the data transmitted over your network, making it much harder for hackers to intercept and decipher your information.",
      "6) Regularly reboot your router: Schedule routine reboots to clear the system memory and refresh all connections, which may disrupt potential malware.",
      "TOP ROUTERS FOR BEST SECURITY 2024",
      "Pro tip: Use strong antivirus software: To further protect your devices from malware and other threats, consider using reputable antivirus software. Antivirus programs can detect and remove malicious software, provide real-time protection and alert you to potential threats. Keeping your devices secure helps ensure your entire network remains safe from cyberattacks.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices.

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "Cybercriminals are constantly evolving the ways they target us, which means securing just your phone or laptop isn\u2019t enough anymore. You need to be cautious with anything connected to the internet, whether it's your router, smart cameras or doorbell. However, the Broadband Genie survey reveals that only a small number of people are aware of the best cybersecurity practices when it comes to protecting their routers. As a basic rule, always remember to change default passwords and rename your router\u2019s network to ensure better security.",

      "Health care software provider Phreesia has revealed that its ConnectOnCall service was hit by a data breach that lasted from Feb. 16 to May 12, 2024. During this time, an unknown hacker gained access to the platform and pulled data from provider-patient communications. ConnectOnCall helps health care providers handle after-hours communication and automate patient call tracking.",
      "Phreesia, which bought ConnectOnCall in October 2023, discovered the breach on May 12 and says it jumped into action right away. The company brought in external cybersecurity pros to lock down the platform and reported the breach to federal law enforcement.",
      "\"On May 12, 2024, ConnectOnCall learned of an issue impacting ConnectOnCall and immediately began an investigation and took steps to secure the product and ensure the overall security of its environment,\" the company\u00a0revealed in a press release.",
      "According to a report filed with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the breach impacted 914,138 patients (via\u00a0Bleeping Computer). The stolen data includes names, phone numbers, medical record numbers, dates of birth and details about health conditions, treatments or prescriptions. In a few cases, Social Security numbers were also compromised.",
      "Phreesia claims its other services, like the patient intake platform, were not affected. The company has since taken ConnectOnCall offline and is working on bringing it back in a more secure setup.",

      "The risks associated with the ConnectOnCall data breach",
      "The impact of this breach is significant due to the sensitive nature of health care data. Unlike financial breaches, where compromised accounts can be frozen or replaced, health information is permanent and highly sought after on the dark web. Cybercriminals may exploit this data to commit\u00a0identity theft, including obtaining prescription drugs fraudulently or filing false insurance claims.",
      "Plus, the detailed health information exposed \u2013 such as diagnoses, treatments and medications \u2013 can be used for targeted\u00a0phishing attacks. Scammers could exploit victims\u2019 medical histories to create highly convincing schemes, increasing the likelihood of success.",

      "1) Regularly monitor your financial and medical accounts:\u00a0Periodically review your medical records and health insurance statements for any unusual or unauthorized activity. This can help you quickly identify and address any discrepancies or fraudulent activities.",
      "Use patient portals provided by health care providers to access your medical records online. These portals often have features that allow you to track your medical history and appointments.",
      "2) Use strong passwords and two-factor authentication (2FA): Create strong, unique passwords for your online accounts, including health care portals. Avoid using easily guessable information like birthdays or common words. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords.",
      "3) Enable\u00a0two-factor authentication wherever possible:\u00a02FA adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as a text message code or authentication app, in addition to your password.",
      "4) Don\u2019t fall for phishing scams; use strong antivirus software: Be mindful of the information you share online and with whom you share it. Avoid providing sensitive personal information, such as Social Security numbers or medical details, unless absolutely necessary. Verify the legitimacy of any requests for personal information. Scammers often pose as health care providers or insurance companies to trick you into revealing sensitive data by asking you to click on links in emails or messages.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "5) Use identity theft protection services: Consider enrolling in identity theft protection services that monitor your personal information and alert you to potential threats. These services can help you detect and respond to identity theft more quickly. Some identity theft protection services also offer insurance and assistance with recovering from identity theft, providing additional peace of mind.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "6) Freeze your credit:\u00a0A credit freeze prevents anyone from opening new credit accounts in your name without your authorization, reducing the risk of identity theft. Contact the major credit bureaus (Experian, Equifax and TransUnion) to request a credit freeze. This is often free and can be temporarily lifted when you need to apply for credit.",
      "7) Remove your personal data from the internet: After being part of a data breach, it\u2019s crucial to minimize your online presence to reduce the risk of future scams. Consider using a personal data removal service that can help you delete your information from various websites and data brokers. This can greatly diminish the chances of your data being used maliciously.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "DON\u2019T LET SNOOPS NEARBY LISTEN TO YOUR VOICEMAIL WITH THIS QUICK TIP",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The ConnectOnCall health data breach highlights the critical need for robust cybersecurity measures within the health care sector, where the stakes are often much higher than in other industries. With over 910,000 patients affected, this incident shows the serious risks posed by cyberattacks on health care platforms. Sensitive data like medical records and Social Security numbers are permanent and can be misused for identity theft and fraud.

    "published": "Sat, 21 Dec 2024 10:00:19 -0500",
    "summary": "A virtual private network can help ensure your information remains security and your privacy remains intact. Kurt the CyberGuy explains.",
    "story": [
      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson says a VPN enhances online banking security by encrypting data and protecting privacy.",
      "Have you ever felt a little uneasy while browsing the internet, wondering who might be watching your online activities?",
      "Well, let me introduce you to a handy tool that can put your mind at ease: the virtual private network, or VPN.",
      "Whether you're working from home, streaming your favorite shows or just exploring the web, a VPN can help ensure that your data stays secure and your privacy intact. So, let\u2019s dive into why having a VPN at home is a smart move.",
      "GET SECURITY ALERTS, EXPERT TIPS \u2014 SIGN UP FOR KURT\u2019S NEWSLETTER \u2014 THE CYBERGUY REPORT HERE",
      "A VPN on a laptop. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What is a VPN?",
      "A virtual private network, or VPN, encrypts your internet traffic and reroutes it through a server in a different location than your own. VPNs make it appear that you are connecting to the internet from whichever location the server is hosted in rather than your actual location.",
      "When you first connect to a network using a VPN, your device will establish a secure connection with the VPN server, and your device's IP address will appear as the VPN server, meaning that only your internet service provider will see that you're connecting to a VPN server. Normally, when you connect to a website, the website or any online services you visit can see your device's technical information, including location-sensitive data such as IP addresses.",
      "THE BEST VPNS FOR BROWSING THE WEB IN 2024",
      "Why would you want a VPN at home?",
      "While your home internet connection is more secure than a\u00a0public Wi-Fi connection, VPNs still provide a greater sense of privacy and access to content that might be restricted due to location. Here are 10 reasons I have for getting a home VPN.",
      "Online communication can be hit or miss when it comes to security. Some messaging services, such as Whatsapp, use end-to-end device encryption, which helps keep your messages secure, but other messaging services, such as Skype, don't use end-to-end encryption. If you use a VPN with any communication apps, then all your connection and messaging data between your device and the VPN server is fully encrypted.",
      "A VPN on a smartphone. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Online content and services like Netflix are restricted to specific geographic regions. This content can range from news websites to video streaming platforms and social media apps. Using a VPN at home can appear to be using the internet from another location, allowing you to access restricted services.",
      "Sometimes, an internet service provider (ISP) will slow down bandwidth or certain online activities. One of the most common reasons networks do this is to manage network congestion, especially during peak hours. You might notice that your home internet connection slows down at night, when everyone is home from work, or it might slow down when summer vacation starts. Using a VPN will prevent your service provider from identifying the type of web content you are accessing, making it impossible for your ISP to slow down your traffic.",
      "A VPN also keeps your internet activity private from Wi-Fi network admins, who, if technically skilled enough, can figure out which websites you've visited. If you're worried about the Wi-Fi admin of your office, hotel, school or other public place having access to your browsing history, a VPN is the perfect solution for you. When it comes to your own home Wi-Fi network, a VPN will keep your browsing history private from other household members.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Hackers deploy large-scale cyberattacks to observe network activity and steal your information. These attacks are particularly prevalent on public Wi-Fi networks, which often have minimal security measures, but they can also target secured networks. Using a VPN can significantly enhance your security by providing encryption for your internet traffic, making it difficult for hackers to intercept and read your data. This encryption is especially crucial when using public Wi-Fi, as it secures your information from potential eavesdroppers.",
      "Additionally, a VPN masks your real IP address with that of the VPN server, helping to protect your identity online and making it harder for attackers to target you directly. However, it is essential to understand that while a VPN adds a layer of security,\u00a0it is not a comprehensive solution against all cyber threats.",
      "A VPN does not prevent malware infections or\u00a0phishing attacks, so you must still employ\u00a0strong antivirus software and exercise caution when clicking on links or downloading files.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "Furthermore, not all VPNs are created equal; some may have vulnerabilities or questionable privacy practices. It is crucial to choose a\u00a0reputable provider that uses strong encryption and has a clear no-logging policy.",
      "There's a myriad of reasons, ranging from political to economic, that countries use to justify censoring certain apps and websites. It can be incredibly frustrating for citizens and anyone traveling to that country to lose access to email, social media, news websites and other tools that keep us connected to the world around us. I've used VPNs extensively while traveling to ensure that I can always view my most important websites, no matter where I actually am. As I've mentioned, a VPN can mask your IP address and make it appear as traffic from a different country, allowing you to bypass online geographic restrictions.",
      "One of the best reasons to have a VPN at home is that it can help you save money and find better deals while online shopping. Some online retailers change their prices depending on users' locations. However, when using a VPN while shopping for plane tickets, hotels or gifts, it's possible to\u00a0find cheaper prices just by changing your location.",
      "It's no longer the work of sci-fi. We do know that governments, nearly all of them, surveil their citizens. A VPN will add a layer of privacy, making it significantly more difficult for governments to detect your web traffic. Even if you feel that you have nothing to hide, online privacy is something you should feel free to exercise.",
      "Much like governments, your ISP can surveil your online activity with ease. While most ISPs claim that they don't sell your browsing data, they are often allowed through contracts with marketing agencies to give your data away for free to advertise to you. The simplest way to hide your online activity from your ISP is to use a VPN. When using a VPN, your ISP won't be able to see which websites you visit or which apps you use.",
      "Image of a Google search on a laptop\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "HOW VPNS SHIELD YOUR IDENTITY AND SECURE YOUR FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS FROM THEFT",
      "While it may seem counterintuitive, a VPN can offer faster connection speeds for online gaming. It can also help prevent your ISP from throttling bandwidth directly from gaming servers. By changing your VPN's location, you can connect to a server closer to your gaming server, which will give you better latency. This is also called ping, which determines how fast the server responds to your inputs.",
      "CAN YOU BE TRACKED WHEN USING A VPN?",
      "Tips for maximizing your VPN security",
      "To fully leverage the benefits of your VPN and enhance your online security, consider these important tips that will help protect your personal information and ensure safe browsing.",
      "1. Choose a reliable VPN:\u00a0Select a reputable VPN service with strong encryption protocols.\u00a0For best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2. Always use VPN on public Wi-Fi:\u00a0Never access financial accounts on\u00a0public networks without activating your VPN first.",
      "3. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA): Add an extra layer of security to your accounts by\u00a0enabling 2FA.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "4. Use strong, unique passwords:\u00a0Create complex passwords for each of your accounts and consider using a password manager. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords.",
      "5. Regularly monitor your accounts: Check your retirement accounts frequently for any suspicious activity.",
      "6. Keep software updated: Ensure your devices and apps are always\u00a0up-to-date with the latest security patches.",
      "7. Be cautious of phishing scams while using a VPN:\u00a0Even with a VPN securing your connection, phishing scams remain a significant threat to your online safety. These scams often use deceptive emails or links to steal sensitive information like passwords or credit card numbers. To protect yourself, combine the use of a VPN with\u00a0strong antivirus software that detects and blocks phishing attempts. Additionally, always scrutinize unsolicited emails, avoid clicking on suspicious links, and never provide personal information without verifying the source.\u00a0For the best protection, check out my expert reviews of the top 2024 antivirus solutions for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices. Together with a VPN, this approach helps keep your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "If you want to start taking your online privacy seriously, it's worth getting a VPN. There are a wide range of options available. You can pick up a router with a VPN or install a software VPN on your devices. I prefer to have a VPN on my laptop and smartphone, and I especially find it useful when traveling internationally.",

A transgender person, Carroll was housed in a women's correctional facility by request and transferred to a men's facility following the indictment for rape.\u00a0 (CDCR)",
      "Moreno believes that Carroll abused California law SB 132, the Transgender Respect, Agency and Dignity Act, which allows transgender prisoners to be housed in a facility consistent with their gender identity systematically rather than on a case-by-case basis.",
      "\"This is a person who is not a woman in any sense of the word,\" Moreno told ABC30.",
      "\"There's no psychological evaluation that needs to be done,\" Moreno said of the 2021 bill. \"This person does not need to be on cross-gender hormones, they don't need to be signed up for transgender surgery, they don't need to [have] a psychological evaluation regarding gender confusion, the mere statement is enough.\"",
      "The recent ruling regarding Carroll's pronouns impacts Moreno's ability to prosecute the case, she said.",
      "\"This is a particular issue in this case because it's confusing to the jury. In California, rape is a crime that has to be accomplished by a man,\" said Moreno.",

At all our institutions, CDCR thoroughly investigates all allegations of sexual abuse, sexual misconduct, and sexual harassment pursuant to our zero-tolerance policy and as mandated by the federal Prison Rape Elimination Act,\" read the statement to ABC 7.",

      "\"The committee that's reviewing these requests to transfer can't use someone's criminal history, physical attributes, sexual orientation, anything like that,\" she continued. \"Anything that you would think would be a factor that should be taken into consideration before transferring someone to a women's prison is not allowed and deemed discriminatory.\"",

      "In 1990, Carroll was charged as an adult with three counts of kidnapping for ransom, two counts of robbery, and three counts of \"oral copulation in concert by force,\" according to records. However, some of the counts were dismissed on technicalities and the case ended with a hung jury and mistrial. Rather than be retried, Carroll pleaded guilty to two counts of kidnapping and was sentenced to prison for 10 years and eight months.",
      "Carroll's third strike under California's three-strike law came in 1998 when he was the getaway driver in a jewelry store robbery, leading to a 25-to-life sentence as a three-strike offender. While awaiting trial in 1999, sheriff's deputies, acting on a tip from a confidential informant, found him to be in possession of a metal wire shank. He was given an additional four years to be run consecutively with his 25-to-life term.",
      "In prison, Carroll committed various serious rule violations between 2001 and 2015. His offenses included fighting with other inmates, refusing to obey orders, drug possession, filing a false report against a peace officer and \"behavior that could lead to violence,\" according to court records. He also filed various complaints alleging racial discrimination and sexual misconduct by CDCR employees.",

      "The next year, Carroll was interviewed by MindSiteNews for an article that described him as \"an incarcerated transgender woman instrumental in several prison lawsuits.\" Carroll told the interviewer he \"never felt the need\" to outwardly identify as anything or \"wear lipstick or wear tight clothing or try to change my voice\" because doing so would \"put me in a box.\"",

      "Hillel Neuer, Executive Director of U.N. Watch, told Fox News Digital that aside from UNRWA, there \"are several agencies on the ground who are doing significant work in distributing humanitarian aid.\"",
      "\"Around the world, when there is a crisis of some kind,\" Neuer said that \"you get a whole cluster of U.N. agencies,\" including the World Health Organization, World Food Programme, UNICEF \u2026 and UNDP, which combine forces to \"distribute aid to millions of people.\" Neuer said that \"the notion that is put forward that for some reason a tiny strip of land on the Gaza Strip is the only place in the world where those agencies cannot operate\" is \"absurd and false.\"",

      "UN Watch has raised the ire of UNRWA by beginning to release a 150-page dossier showing URNWA leaders meeting with representatives of terror groups. Though UNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini referred to the reports as \"disinformation,\" Neuer explained that UNRWA simply \"cannot handle the truth.\" Neuer said that UN Watch assembled its dossier by screenshotting data and photographs that were \"hidden in plain sight\" on the internet and social media.\" He added that more of UN Watch\u2019s dossier is set to emerge the coming week.",

      "Ambassador Robert Wood, the alternative representative for special political affairs, explained the dissension on Dec. 11, both noting that while URNWA is a \"critical lifeline,\" the \"resolution on UNRWA operations also has serious flaws.\" Wood cited how the proposal fails \"to create a path forward for restoring trust between Israel and UNRWA,\" and that the resolution \"denigrates Israel\u2019s actions in Gaza without addressing the central reason for them, namely Hamas\u2019 unprovoked October 7 attack and the terrorist group\u2019s deplorable behavior in the interim.\"",
      "Photos released by the Israeli Defense Force show three individuals the Israeli military claims are Hamas combatants inside the UNRWA compound in Rafah. (IDF)",
      "\"More than 14 months into this conflict, some delegations here in New York cannot bring themselves to acknowledge \u2014 let alone condemn \u2014 Hamas\u2019 role in instigating a conflict that has visited so much pain, suffering, and anguish on the people of Gaza,\" Wood wrote, adding that \"we deeply regret that the drafters chose to try to score political points, rather than pursue a resolution which could have provided unanimous support to UNRWA, addressed credible allegations about the activities of some of its personnel, and ultimately bolsters UNRWA\u2019s vital humanitarian mission.\"",

      "The General Assembly also emphasized that it \"strongly warns against any attempts to dismantle or diminish the operations and mandate of the Agency,\" noting the humanitarian consequences that millions of Palestinians would face if its work were interrupted or suspended.",
      "In an effort to assert the primacy of his organization despite snowballing evidence that its members have hindered efforts to create peace in the region, UNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini penned an op-ed imagining the possibly \"dystopian\" outcome of a decision to dismantle UNRWA. Supposing that a two-state solution hinges on the agency's continued operations, Lazzarini urged that \"we still have a\u00a0window of opportunity to avert a cataclysmic future where firepower and propaganda construct the global order.\"",
      "U.N. Watch's Neuer disagreed, noting \"UNRWA is an arsonist masquerading as a firefighter,\" he said. \"Only by ending this terror-infested agency with the pathological aim of perpetuating hatred, resentment and dependency, can Palestinians move forward to a future of hope and peace.\"",

    "summary": "\"Uncommitted\" leaders say they felt Harris didn\u2019t do enough to distance herself from Biden or outline how she\u2019d handle the war differently. Now, they\u2019re closely watching Donald Trump\u2019s early moves to see what comes next.",
    "story": [
      "Vice President Kamala Harris had just 107 days as a presidential candidate to change the minds of hundreds of thousands of \u201cuncommitted\u201d Democratic primary voters nationwide, many of whom voted in protest against President Joe Biden and his administration\u2019s handling of Israel's war in the Gaza Strip.",
      "But leaders from the Uncommitted National Movement and the \u201cAbandon Harris\u201d campaign say they felt Harris didn\u2019t do enough to distance herself from Biden or outline how she\u2019d handle the war differently.",
      "And now, they\u2019re closely watching President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s early moves on the Middle East and specifically on Gaza to see what comes next.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s been many ways in which Harris chose the path of Liz Cheney and the donor class on a range of issues, and abandoning working families in places like Dearborn, who make up the people Democrats claim to be fighting for,\u201d said Uncommitted National Movement co-founder Layla Elabed, a Palestinian American activist and the sister of Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich. \u201cAnd I think at the same time, Trump came in and fed a community that was grieving and in despair with lies and false promises.\u201d",
      "Trump ultimately ended up carrying Dearborn, a majority Arab American city in Michigan, by more than 6 percentage points \u2014 a massive swing from Biden\u2019s nearly 40 point win there in 2020. But most Dearborn voters also voted against Trump, who got about 43% support in a deeply split field.",
      "Elabed decided not to vote at the top of the ticket this year and focused instead on downballot races.",
      "\u201cWe provided Democrats with a pathway for victory and a way to unite the party and they spent 10 months ignoring us and berating us,\u201d Elabed said.",
      "When Elabed and other leaders from the Uncommitted National Movement briefly met Harris in person last summer, she told the candidate that she wanted to be able to vote for her and asked Harris to talk with activists about how to change her policy toward the Middle East. She said Harris seemed receptive in that moment, but another official meeting never panned out.",
      "\u201cShe never came to Dearborn. She never came to speak to families that were first-hand impacted by our U.S. policy decisions that ultimately killed their family members,\u201d Elabed said.",
      "About a month before the election, Harris met with Muslim and Arab American community leaders in Flint, Michigan, ahead of a rally there. Also in October, her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, held a virtual meeting with a Muslim organizing group called Emgage Action.",
      "A former Harris campaign official, who was granted anonymity to speak candidly about internal campaign deliberations, said that after Oct. 7, 2023, the vice president spoke with Palestinian Americans who were in Gaza when the war started and who had to be evacuated, as well as with doctors who had returned from Gaza. Harris herself described speaking with those who lost loved ones in Gaza during remarks in December 2023.",
      "Elabed said she feels crushed by the reality of four years of the Trump administration\u2019s policies toward Israel.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m absolutely devastated. I\u2019m devastated for our country. It makes me so angry and frustrated that it didn\u2019t have to be this way, because all of \u2014 we provided the warning signs on a silver platter,\u201d Elabed said.",
      "Bryarr Misner, who grew up Christian, converted to Judaism and later to Islam, worked as a campaign manager for the Abandon Harris campaign in Pittsburgh. Unlike Elabed, he ultimately voted for Trump. And he expressed similar frustration about a lack of access to members of Harris\u2019 team, which he said felt demeaning.",
      "\u201cWe tried negotiations. We tried to reach out, to no avail. You know, they never reached out,\u201d he said, adding later, \u201cWe went through multiple avenues to try to be heard, and instead we were ridiculed.\u201d",
      "Misner said it was a difficult decision to vote for Trump. He said the point of the Abandon Harris campaign was to punish the Democrats for supporting Israel during its war in Gaza, which the campaigners view as a genocide, and he hopes the Trump campaign will be more willing to negotiate with group leaders. (Israel\u2019s government and the U.S. government have rejected accusations of genocide.)",
      "\u201cPresident Trump, he continuously came and he was in the community. While I don\u2019t believe that he\u2019s going to enact policies that will benefit the community, he at least showed that he was willing to show up for the community,\u201d Misner said.",
      "The former Harris campaign official said groups like the Abandon Harris movement demanded that she call for an immediate arms embargo and her campaign wasn\u2019t willing to do so.",
      "Palestinian American policy analyst and writer Abdelhalim Abdelrahman said there were similar feelings of inaccessibility and unresponsiveness in Michigan.",
      "\u201cI think the most insulting aspect of it is that the Uncommitted movement and other grassroots movements here in Michigan did all they could to extend an olive branch to Kamala Harris and the Democrats, to have Kamala Harris sit down with them, listen to their pain and advocate for an arms embargo,\u201d Abdelrahman said. \u201cAnd just it was a simple request of enforcing U.S. law, and they were rebuffed, and they were treated as criminals, and they were alienated from the supposed 'big tent' party of the Democratic Party.\u201d",
      "Abdelrahman said Harris never managed to proactively present policy positions about ending the war or advocating for Palestinians to satisfy a critical part of her constituency, and that her overall strategy often seemed reactionary to Trump.",
      "\u201cI think the biggest problem is that your messaging to Arab Americans can\u2019t just be \u2018Trump\u2019s a fascist, Trump is Hitler. Big, scary orange man, vote for me.\u2019 Part of being a part of the American political system is being able to separate yourself from your opponent and lay out a better vision. And she did not do that,\u201d Abdelrahman said.",
      "He expressed tempered optimism about Massad Boulos, Trump\u2019s pick for Middle East adviser (and the father-in-law of Trump\u2019s daughter Tiffany Trump).",
      "\u201cIt really seems like Massad Boulos, the Lebanese Christian who facilitated his Arab American outreach in Michigan, is going to have a little bit more of operational freedom than people realize in this administration and I think that could help offset the likes of Mike Huckabee,\u201d Abdelrahman said, referring to Trump\u2019s pick for ambassador to Israel. \u201cIt\u2019s scary, but I\u2019m not ready to jump the gun just yet.\u201d",
      "\u201cI expect to see a lot of pro-Israel rhetoric, but seeing a little bit more diplomacy,\u201d he said of Trump\u2019s overall strategy in the Middle East.",
      "Farah Khan, a co-chair of the Abandon Harris campaign in Michigan, said she\u2019s been a lifelong Democrat but not anymore. She viewed voting against Harris as a moral issue as the war continues to unfold.",
      "\u201cAnybody with their right mind would not go back to the Democrats, because they have not shown any change, and they\u2019re going to have to work really, really hard to win their votes back,\u201d Khan said.",
      "Khan said Harris didn\u2019t do enough to reverse course in terms of messaging or policy from the Biden administration\u2019s handling of the war. Ultimately, she voted for Jill Stein of the Green Party.",
      "\u201c[Harris] says, \u2018Oh, yeah, I feel bad.\u2019 And the next day, they send billions of dollars again in weapons. I mean, you can\u2019t even fool kids like this nowadays, let alone grown people who are your constituents, your voters,\u201d Khan said.",
      "\u201cShe could have at least called for a ceasefire,\u201d Khan said. (Harris repeatedly called for a ceasefire during her campaign, including during her Democratic convention speech.) \u201cShe could have sent aid, she could have pressured Israel to let the aid in \u2014 she did not. She did nothing of that sort. And yet she kept saying that, you know, we\u2019re working around the clock. If you\u2019re working around the clock and this is the outcome, then we definitely don\u2019t want you in the office.\u201d",
      "The former Harris campaign official pointed to Harris\u2019 December 2023 trip to Dubai, where Harris said international humanitarian law must be respected and advocated for a two-state solution. Inside the administration, the official said, Harris pushed on humanitarian and civilian casualty issues.",
      "The official argued that there was alignment between what Harris and the Muslim and Arab American communities were fighting for, but not enough time for people to fully understand her stance.",
      "Khan believes many Muslim and Arab American voters picked Trump in protest \u2014 not because they liked him, but because they wanted to defeat Harris and punish the Democrats.",
      "\u201cEven in politics, humanity should be the first and the foremost thing to to be respected, to be valued, right? And [the] Democratic Party clearly, clearly, for an entire year showed us they do not care about human life,\u201d Khan said. \u201cThey do not care about their constituents, how they feel about the massacre.\u201d",
      "Khan said Trump\u2019s rhetoric about bringing the war to an end was a winning message for many Muslim and Arab American voters.",
      "\u201cHe at least, at least came and spoke to the Muslims. He heard them and said, \u2018OK, I will finish. I will end the war in Middle East,\u2019 even if he didn\u2019t say, you know, a genocide, but he said he will bring peace,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what the people wanted to hear, and that\u2019s why he got the votes.\u201d",
      "But she\u2019s concerned about the possibility of Huckabee serving as ambassador to Israel.",
      "\u201cIt is very troubling. It\u2019s worrisome. And some of his Cabinet picks, like Tulsi Gabbard and then Mike Huckabee, have made Muslims anxious, but we still have to wait and see how things pan out, because it\u2019s too early to say anything about Trump, and we all know that Trump only listens [to] Trump,\u201d Khan said."

      "This season, 36% of American consumers took on holiday debt, according to a\u00a0new survey\u00a0from LendingTree.",
      "Those who racked up balances this season took on an average of $1,181 in debt, up\u00a0from $1,028 in 2023. However, that is still down from $1,549 in 2022, LendingTree found.",
      "Less than half \u2014 44% \u2014 of the people who took on debt expected to acquire those balances, a sign that this holiday season is still financially challenging for many people, according to Matt Schulz, chief credit analyst at LendingTree.",
      "Higher prices caused by inflation remain an issue for many individuals and families this holiday season, he said.",
      "\u201cSome of it is people just wanting to wrap up what\u2019s been a difficult year by spreading a little joy, and maybe they ended up taking on a little bit of extra debt to do so,\u201d Schulz said.",
      "Those most likely to take on debt this season include parents of young children, with 48%; millennials ages 28 to 43, with 42%; and individuals who earn $30,000 to $49,999, with 39%, according to LendingTree.",
      "Consumers who went into debt over the holidays run the risk of still carrying those balances when next year\u2019s holiday season comes around. Almost half of Americans still have debt from last year\u2019s holidays,\u00a0WalletHub recently found.",
      "Meanwhile, paying down debt is a top financial resolution for 2025, according to a recent\u00a0Bankrate survey.",
      "For those who want to get out of debt, it helps to get started as soon as possible, Schulz said.",
      "Successfully knocking off those balances has its own reward in the way of freedom, said Laura Mattia, a certified financial planner and senior vice president at Wealth Enhancement Group in Sarasota, Florida, who works with clients at all levels of wealth.",
      "\u201cPeople love to be debt free,\u201d Mattia said. \u201cThe idea of not owing anybody any money is extremely comforting.\u201d",
      "Negotiate your interest rates",
      "For those who took on holiday debt, 42% said they are paying interest rates of 20% or higher, typically through credit cards or store cards, LendingTree found.",
      "The good news is that it\u2019s possible to get better interest rates \u2014 and therefore lower the total amount it takes to pay off your debt \u2014 by pursuing either a 0% balance transfer credit card or a debt consolidation loan.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s really no better weapon against credit card debt than a 0% balance transfer credit card,\u201d Schulz said.",
      "Most offers provide either 12 or 15 months without accruing interest on the transferred balance, he said. However, a fee for transferring the balance may apply.",
      "Pick a debt pay-down strategy you can stick with",
      "Those people in debt may want to pick from different strategies to tackle their balances.",
      "That includes the avalanche method \u2014 which prioritizes high interest rate debts first \u2014 or the snowball method \u2014 which puts the smallest balances first.",
      "\u201cWhat really matters more is finding the one that works best for you and that will keep you motivated,\u201d Schulz said.",
      "Mattia said she often advises clients to start with the smallest balances first, so they immediately feel their situation improving.",
      "\u201cWhat deters people the most is when they feel like they\u2019re not making progress and they give up,\u201d Mattia said.",
      "Try to increase your savings",
      "While paying down debt balances may be the primary goal, it also helps to set aside some cash for emergencies.",
      "That way, when an unexpected expense comes up \u2014 or next holiday season rolls around \u2014 you may not have to lean quite so much on credit cards, Schulz said.",
      "\u201cOne of the best ways to break out of the cycle of debt that so many people find themselves in is to save while you\u2019re paying down your debts,\u201d Schulz said.",
      "Still, it\u2019s important to keep in mind that the best interest rates available on savings are around 5%, while credit cards are charging north of 20% and prioritize accordingly, Mattia said.",
      "Celebrate small wins",
      "In the aftermath of the holidays, give yourself grace if you spent more than you intended, said CFP Jesse Sell, managing principal at Prevail Financial Partners in Stillwater, Minnesota.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not terribly uncommon to kind of let otherwise good discipline go for a few weeks over the holidays,\u201d Sell said.",
      "As you work to pay down your overall debt, it helps to break it down into smaller goals that you can celebrate along the way, he said.",
      "Once you hit a smaller milestone, celebrate that victory with a small reward.",
      "Admittedly, paying down debt is not really fun, Sell said.",

During an internship at the New York state legislature, he developed ties to moderate Republican Gov. Nelson Rockefeller, who became vice president under Gerald Ford in 1974 in the wake of President Richard Nixon\u2019s resignation. Parsons became associate director of President Ford\u2019s domestic policy council.",

      "After Ford\u2019s defeat by Jimmy Carter in the 1976 election, Parsons returned to New York and joined the law firm of Patterson, Belknap, Webb & Tyler in 1977, as did his friend Rudy Giuliani. Parsons and his wife and three children moved to Rockefeller country, Briarcliff Manor in Westchester County. Coincidentally, his maternal grandfather had been a groundskeeper on John D. Rockefeller\u2019s nearby estate, Kykuit.",
      "Parson\u2019s clients included Rockefeller\u2019s widow, Happy, and the Dime Savings Bank of New York. In 1988, he accepted an offer to head Dime Bancorp, which had been struggling through the savings & loan crisis after aggressively approving high-risk mortgages as housing prices crashed. In 1989, it posted a $92.3 million loss. By the end of 1993, after ordering massive layoffs, Parsons helped the bank complete a $300 million recapitalization. In 1995, he helped engineer Dime\u2019s merger with Anchor Savings, creating one of the nation\u2019s largest thrift institutions.",
      "Parsons joined the Time Warner board on the recommendation of Rockefeller\u2019s brother Laurance. He became president of Time Warner in 1995.",
      "As a Rockefeller Republican, Parsons considered himself a fiscal conservative and a social liberal. Parsons worked for Giuliani\u2019s campaign for New York mayor but kept a behind-the-scenes profile. \u2033I didn\u2019t want to be positioned as the Mayor\u2019s Black guy,\u2033\u2063 he told the Times a few years later.",
      "Giuliani put him in charge of the mayoral transition team in 1993 but Parsons\u00a0turned down an offer\u00a0to become deputy mayor for fiscal affairs. His relationship with Giuliani later soured after the mayor tried to pressure Time Warner Cable to carry the then-fledgling Fox News Channel in New York.",
      "Two years after stepping down from Time Warner, Parsons became chairman of\u00a0Citigroup\u00a0in 2009, helping to stabilize the banking giant in the wake of the financial crisis. In May 2014, he was named\u00a0interim CEO of the Los Angeles Clippers\u00a0after the NBA banned owner Donald Sterling for life because he had made racist remarks.",
      "\u201cLike most Americans, I have been deeply troubled by the pain the Clippers\u2019 team, fans and partners have endured,\u201d Parsons said.",
      "Parsons played down race as a factor of his success.",
      "\u201cFor a lot of people, race is a defining issue. It just isn\u2019t for me,\u201d he told the Times in 1997. \u201cIt is \u2026 like air. It\u2019s like height. I have other things that I\u2019m focused on.\u2033",
      "He later came out of retirement to briefly serve as CBS chairman in the wake of\u00a0Les Moonves\u2019 ouster following sexual harassment and assault allegations during the #MeToo movement.",
      "After only a month as CBS\u2019 interim chairman,\u00a0Parsons\u00a0stepped down suddenly in October 2018, citing health concerns.",
      "\u201cWhen I agreed to join the board and serve as the interim chair, I was already dealing with a serious health challenge \u2014 multiple myeloma \u2014 but I felt that the situation was manageable,\u201d Parsons said in a CBS statement announcing he had been replaced by Strauss Zelnick. \u201cUnfortunately, unanticipated complications have created additional new challenges, and my doctors have advised that cutting back on my current commitments is essential to my overall recovery.\u201d",
      "Parsons was active in many charities, including playing leading roles for the Jazz Foundation of America, the Apollo Theater Foundation and the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture. During his years on the Apollo Theater board, he helped the historic\u00a0Harlem entertainment venue\u00a0raise nearly $100 million. Parsons and his wife also donated 40 works of art to the\u00a0American Folk Art Museum\u00a0in July 2021 to help celebrate its 60th anniversary.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. Treasury Department has delayed the deadline for millions of small businesses to Jan. 13, 2025, to file a new form, known as a Beneficial Ownership Information report.",
      "The Treasury had initially required many businesses to file the report to the agency\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, known as FinCEN, by Jan. 1. Noncompliance carries potential fines that could exceed $10,000.",
      "This delay comes as a result of legal challenges to the new reporting requirement under the Corporate Transparency Act.",
      "The rule applies to about 32.6 million businesses, including certain corporations, limited liability companies and\u00a0others, according to federal\u00a0estimates.",
      "Businesses and owners that didn\u2019t comply would potentially face civil penalties of up to $591 a day, adjusted for inflation, according to FinCEN. They could also face up to $10,000 in criminal fines and up to two years in prison.",
      "However, many small businesses are exempt. For example, those with over $5 million in gross sales and more than 20 full-time employees may not need to file a report.",
      "Why Treasury delayed the BOI reporting requirement",
      "The Treasury delayed the compliance deadline following a recent court ruling.",
      "A federal court in Texas on Dec. 3 had issued a nationwide preliminary injunction that temporarily blocked FinCEN from enforcing the rule. However, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed that injunction on Monday.",
      "\u201cBecause the Department of the Treasury recognizes that reporting companies may need additional time to comply given the period when the preliminary injunction had been in effect, we have extended the reporting deadline,\u201d according to the FinCEN\u00a0website.",
      "FinCEN didn\u2019t return a request from CNBC for comment about the number of businesses that have filed a BOI report to date.",
      "Some data, however, suggests few have done so.",
      "The federal government had received about 9.5 million filings as of Dec. 1, according to statistics that FinCEN provided to the office of Rep. French Hill, R-Ark. That figure is about 30% of the estimated total.",
      "Hill has called for the repeal of the Corporate Transparency Act, passed in 2021, which created the BOI requirement. Hill\u2019s office provided the data to CNBC.",
      "\u201cMost non-exempt reporting companies have not filed their initial reports, presumably because they are unaware of the requirement,\u201d Daniel Stipano, a partner at law firm Davis Polk & Wardwell, wrote in an e-mail.",
      "There\u2019s a potential silver lining for businesses: It\u2019s \u201cunlikely\u201d FinCEN would impose financial penalties \u201cexcept in cases of bad faith or intentional violations,\u201d Stipano said.",
      "\u201cIn its public statements, FinCEN has made clear that its primary goal at this point is to educate the public about the requirement, as opposed to taking enforcement actions against noncompliant companies,\u201d he said.",
      "Certain businesses are exempt from BOI filing",
      "The BOI filing isn\u2019t an annual requirement. Businesses only need to resubmit the form to update or correct information.",
      "Many exempt businesses \u2014 such as large companies, banks, credit unions, tax-exempt entities and public utilities \u2014\u00a0already furnish\u00a0similar data.",
      "Businesses have different compliance deadlines depending on when they were formed.",
      "For example, those created or registered before 2024 have until Jan. 13, 2025, to file their initial BOI reports, according to FinCEN. Those that do so on or after Jan. 1, 2025, have 30 days to file a report.",
      "There will likely be additional court rulings that could impact reporting, Stipano said.",
      "For one, litigation is ongoing in the 5th Circuit, which hasn\u2019t formally ruled on the constitutionality of the Corporate Transparency Act.",
      "\u201cJudicial actions challenging the law have been brought in multiple jurisdictions, and these actions may eventually reach the Supreme Court,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAs of now, it is unclear whether the incoming Trump administration will continue to support the Government\u2019s position in these cases.\u201d",

      "The clock is ticking for American creators who say they are both nervous and frustrated as they prepare for a potential nationwide ban of TikTok next month.",
      "A bipartisan bill President Joe Biden signed this year requires TikTok\u2019s Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to sell the platform to an American company or face a ban \u2014 which is set to take effect Jan. 19, the day before President-elect Donald Trump takes office. The Supreme Court said it will take up TikTok\u2019s appeal on Jan. 10.",
      "\u201cSo many people have found connection, communities, and people\u2019s livelihoods now have been built from TikTok,\u201d said Jenn Ficarra, a Los Angeles-based writer who used TikTok to help launch a baby-name consulting business as a side hustle. \u201cI\u2019m just really dismayed and annoyed and angry that something that is instrumental to so many people\u2019s livelihoods is being stripped away.\u201d",
      "Lawmakers who pushed for a ban argue that TikTok\u2019s Chinese owner poses a national security threat to the United States. But for many American creators who\u2019ve come to rely on it as their main source of income, losing it would mean scrambling for new ways to sustain their careers and rebuild their personal brands.",
      "In recent weeks, hundreds of TikTok users like Ficcarra have lamented the looming ban, posting videos showcasing their anxiety, anger and grief as they prepare to lose access to it.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s going to have to be sacrifices made, and it obviously does make me worry about everyday life, like groceries, rent, all those sorts of stuff,\u201d said Jonathan Miller, a songwriter and music commentator who has been a full-time creator since 2010.",
      "Creators like Miller \u2014 who have amassed followings on TikTok but aren\u2019t necessarily considered household names \u2014 hope to pivot to other platforms to make up for the income they expect to lose from the potential ends of their TikTok careers.",
      "In a court filing this month, TikTok claimed U.S. small businesses and social media creators would lose $1.3 billion in earnings within just a month of a shutdown.",
      "TikTok is the most commonly used platform by brands that engage in influencer marketing, according to a recent report by the Influencer Marketing Hub, which also found that 50% of influencer marketers believe TikTok delivers the best return on investment for short-form video content. It has become a giant in the evolving creator economy, which includes millions of social media personalities who make money through brand deals, platform monetization and audience subscriptions. Research from Goldman Sachs last year predicted that the total market opportunity of the creator economy could reach $480 billion by 2027.",
      "Cole Mason, a co-founder of the creator marketing company Pearpop, said he\u2019s optimistic creators will adapt should there be a ban.",
      "\u201cCreators will be a powerful force behind our culture, with or without TikTok,\u201d he said in an email. \u201cUltimately, where creatives go, audiences and brands follow.\u201d",
      "As they gear up for the reality of losing part of their regular incomes, some TikTok creators have already gotten started on building their followings elsewhere.",
      "Miller, who has around 230,000 TikTok followers, said he makes the majority of his income through TikTok\u2019s Creator Fund (which pays based on views and engagement) and livestreams. Anticipating a ban, he has been using his TikTok page to cross-promote his YouTube and Instagram accounts. He plans to test new types of content to better cater to those platforms.",
      "Fashion and beauty creator Kalita Hon, who said about 70% of her income comes from TikTok, mainly through brand deals, has a similar strategy. She said she plans to shift her focus to Instagram Reels, with the hope that fashion brands are more likely to move there, as well, in the wake of a ban.",
      "But she said she doesn\u2019t expect to bring her 245,000 TikTok followers with her, because the audience is \u201cvery specific\u201d to that platform.",
      "\u201cTikTok has so much culture that\u2019s so specific to the app, because there are certain videos that will go insanely viral and then that will become, like, the next inside joke,\u201d Hon said.",
      "Some creators, like Taylor Pare, argue that if a ban does go into effect, creators whose income came primarily from TikTok should be entitled to unemployment benefits. The app accounts for roughly 90% to 95% of her income, she said.",
      "\u201cPerhaps if you\u2019re making millions of dollars you\u2019re probably set, but I think there\u2019s people that really rely on this and they\u2019ve made this their job,\u201d said Pare, a full-time TikTok creator who has built an audience of more than 90,000 followers talking about dating in New York City. \u201cAnd if the government feels that we\u2019re not allowed to have this, I feel like there needs to be some compensation or stimulus financially.\u201d",
      "There has also been early buzz around possible replacements for TikTok. Some creators and users have mentioned several emerging apps \u2014 such as Clapper and a yet-to-launch app called Neptune \u2014 as options.",
      "Though Neptune has been in the works only since May, its CEO, Ashley Darling, said the sudden \u201cmass panic and hysteria\u201d over TikTok\u2019s looming ban injected so much user interest in the new app that her team is pushing up its release date to next spring, with beta testing to begin as early as January.",
      "Mason, of Pearpop, said that \u201cthe creator economy rewards versatile talent.\u201d",
      "If the government feels that we\u2019re not allowed to have this, I feel like there needs to be some compensation or stimulus financially.",
      "\u2014 Tiktok creator Taylor Pare",
      "\u201cThe TikTok ban, should it go into effect, will only be the latest in a long history of reinvention by creators and digital marketers,\u201d he said, adding later in his email that \u201cbefore the rise of TikTok, we saw the rise and fall of Dubsmash, Vine, and countless other platforms, without any U.S. regulatory action. The same community that weathers sudden algorithm changes, the switch from long-form to short-form video, and a trend cycle that transforms by the minute can navigate a TikTok ban.\u201d",
      "Still, some, like Hon, are skeptical of any TikTok copycats.",
      "\u201cI think, if anything, people will just migrate to apps that are already established and have that notoriety,\u201d she said.",
      "Because a ban would primarily affect American TikTok users, the only people who\u2019d have incentives to join a new app would be Americans, Hon said, with the possible addition of non-American users who hope to re-follow their favorite creators there.",
      "Others, like Ficarra, anticipate the challenges they\u2019d have shifting gears \u2014 but said they feel it would open up fresh opportunities for smaller creators.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not afraid of the hard work that it\u2019s going to take, because I obviously did that with my business,\u201d Ficarra said. \u201cAnd I think there\u2019s something exciting about a new platform coming along.\u201d",
      "For Miller, joining a new app would feel like d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu of the years before TikTok, when other platforms like Vine were the go-tos.",
      "\u201cWe all moved to TikTok. We all moved to YouTube. We all moved to Instagram. ... I joined BlueSky, which is kind of slowly replacing Twitter, maybe,\u201d Miller said. \u201cSo if the right platform comes around, why not?\u201d"

    "published": "Fri, 27 Dec 2024 03:45:49 GMT",
    "summary": "Tom Homan, whom Donald Trump has chosen to oversee immigration and border security, said using detention centers for migrant families is still being discussed.",
    "story": [
      "President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s \"border czar\" said Thursday that the use of family detention centers for migrants is \u201con the table,\u201d raising the possibility that the practice ended by the Biden administration could return as early as next year.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s something we\u2019re considering,\" Tom Homan, who was acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement during the first Trump administration, said in an interview.",
      "\"Look, we\u2019ve got to end catch-and-release \u2014 and that includes family units, too,\u201d he added, using a phrase sometimes used to describe migrants\u2019 being released from detention while they await immigration court proceedings.",
      "ICE stopped detaining families who enter the country illegally with their children not long after President Joe Biden took office, though administration officials last year considered reviving the practice.",
      "Homan, whom Trump announced as his border czar on Nov. 10, less than a week after he won a second term, said plans are still being discussed.",
      "He said that if the Trump administration chooses to go with family detention, \u201cwe\u2019re going to try and surge immigration judges to these locations.\u201d",
      "During the first Trump administration, Homan backed the\u00a0\u201czero tolerance\u201d policy that sparked bipartisan outcry. The policy allowed young children to be separated from their parents.",
      "Homan said Thursday that he does not foresee migrant children being separated from their parents on a large scale in Trump's deportation effort.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t envision that at all,\u201d he said.",
      "A federal court ruling known as the Flores Settlement Agreement limits the time migrant children can be held in detention to 20 days.",
      "Homan said Thursday that he is in favor of challenging that legal framework, which would complicate using any family detention centers.",
      "\"We're looking at what the law currently says, but then again I think we need to litigate some of the decision,\" he said. \"I think the Flores Settlement Agreement is something that was the wrong decision.",
      "\u201cRight now, we know what the rules say. And this is something that we\u2019ll work within until we get another decision or a better decision from the courts,\u201d he said.",
      "Homan said the number of detention facilities would depend on the data. At the start of the Biden administration, ICE operated three facilities.",
      "\"I've got to get the data, which we're now getting access to, to find out how many do we need,\" Homan said. \"And again, based on the data, how are we going to do it.\"",
      "He said detention facilities would be not jails but \"open-air campuses\" designed for families.",
      "Homan suggested that the Trump administration would not consider whether people who are in the country without authorization have children who are U.S. citizens.",
      "He said parents who lose their immigration cases \"are going to have to make a decision what you want to do: You can either take your child with you or leave the child here in the United States with a relative.\"",
      "Homan also criticized local governments, like San Diego County and Los Angeles, that have taken steps they say will protect undocumented immigrants, and which prevent or restrict local resources available to federal immigration authorities.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to do this operation, with or without,\u201d Homan said of the deportation plan. \u201cIf they want to sit back and watch \u2014 disappointing, but we\u2019re going to do it.\u201d",
      "Lee Gelernt, an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer who headed lawsuits to reunite migrant children during Trump\u2019s first term, said the ACLU is prepared to challenge any aspects of the deportation plan they see as unconstitutional.",
      "\u201cWe have challenged family detention in the past. We\u2019ll have to see what they actually do,\u201d Gelernt told NBC News on Thursday. \u201cBut I'm hopeful the American public will not want little children spending days, weeks, potentially months, in a detention center.\u201d",
      "Gelernt said a court order prohibits the government from directly taking children away from their parents, but Homan\u2019s comments suggest the new administration plans to go after families by indirect means, by forcing parents to make awful decisions about whether to leave their children in the U.S.",
      "\u201cWe would have thought they would have learned the lesson the first time around \u2014 that even if the public wants the immigration laws changed, they don\u2019t want children and families to be targeted,\u201d he said.",
      "Trump campaigned on a pledge to deport people who are in the country without authorization. Details of his plan have not been made clear; he has said his administration will start with those who have committed crimes.",
      "On the campaign trail, he referred to migrants as an \"invasion.\u201d Some Republicans have tried to tone down Trump's threats of mass deportations after his election victory."

      "Richard Parsons, who helped Time Warner divorce from AOL after what was considered one of the worst takeovers in history, has died. He was 76.",
      "His death was confirmed by\u00a0Lazard, where he was a longtime board member.",
      "Parsons became CEO of AOL Time Warner in 2002, replacing Gerald Levin, who stepped aside two years after the media giant\u2019s disastrous $165 billion merger with the upstart internet company.",
      "As CEO and later chairman, he led Time Warner\u2019s turnaround, dropping \u201cAOL\u201d from the corporation\u2019s name and shrinking the company\u2019s $30 billion in debt to $16.8 billion by selling Warner Music and other properties.",
      "\u201cThe merger did not work out quite the way many of us expected. The internet bubble burst and we had to fix the leaks,\u201d Parsons told\u00a0The Independent\u00a0in 2004. \u201cIt was not as monumental a task as many people thought, as the fundamental businesses of the old Time Warner \u2014 like publishing, the cable networks and movies \u2014 was running well.\u201d",
      "He said that after the merger, AOL\u2019s business had collapsed and Warner Music Group was declining, along with the entire music industry. \u201cSo we sold our music business, as well as other nonstrategic assets, to strengthen our balance sheet and put in new management.\u201d",
      "Parsons stepped down from Time Warner in 2007.",
      "The Rockefeller connection",
      "Richard Dean \u201cDick\u201d Parsons was born into a working-class family on April 4, 1948, in Brooklyn\u2019s Bedford-Stuyvesant section and grew up in South Ozone Park in Queens, New York. He was a middle child among five siblings.",
      "He attended public school, skipping two grades, and at age 16, the 6-foot-4 Parsons enrolled at the University of Hawaii, where he played basketball and met his future wife, Laura Ann Bush, whom he married in 1968.",
      "After graduation, he returned to New York state to attend Albany Law School, moonlighting as a part-time janitor to help pay his tuition and finishing at the top of his class. During an internship at the New York state legislature, he developed ties to moderate Republican Gov. Nelson Rockefeller, who became vice president under Gerald Ford in 1974 in the wake of President Richard Nixon\u2019s resignation. Parsons became associate director of President Ford\u2019s domestic policy council.",
      "\u201cThe old-boy network lives,\u201d Parsons told\u00a0The New York Times\u00a0in a 1994 interview. \u201cI didn\u2019t grow up with any of the old boys. I didn\u2019t go to school with any of the old boys. But by becoming a part of that Rockefeller entourage, that created for me a group of people who\u2019ve looked out for me ever since.\u201d",
      "After Ford\u2019s defeat by Jimmy Carter in the 1976 election, Parsons returned to New York and joined the law firm of Patterson, Belknap, Webb & Tyler in 1977, as did his friend Rudy Giuliani. Parsons and his wife and three children moved to Rockefeller country, Briarcliff Manor in Westchester County. Coincidentally, his maternal grandfather had been a groundskeeper on John D. Rockefeller\u2019s nearby estate, Kykuit.",
      "Parson\u2019s clients included Rockefeller\u2019s widow, Happy, and the Dime Savings Bank of New York. In 1988, he accepted an offer to head Dime Bancorp, which had been struggling through the savings & loan crisis after aggressively approving high-risk mortgages as housing prices crashed. In 1989, it posted a $92.3 million loss. By the end of 1993, after ordering massive layoffs, Parsons helped the bank complete a $300 million recapitalization. In 1995, he helped engineer Dime\u2019s merger with Anchor Savings, creating one of the nation\u2019s largest thrift institutions.",
      "Parsons joined the Time Warner board on the recommendation of Rockefeller\u2019s brother Laurance. He became president of Time Warner in 1995.",
      "As a Rockefeller Republican, Parsons considered himself a fiscal conservative and a social liberal. Parsons worked for Giuliani\u2019s campaign for New York mayor but kept a behind-the-scenes profile. \u2033I didn\u2019t want to be positioned as the Mayor\u2019s Black guy,\u2033\u2063 he told the Times a few years later.",
      "Giuliani put him in charge of the mayoral transition team in 1993 but Parsons\u00a0turned down an offer\u00a0to become deputy mayor for fiscal affairs. His relationship with Giuliani later soured after the mayor tried to pressure Time Warner Cable to carry the then-fledgling Fox News Channel in New York.",
      "Two years after stepping down from Time Warner, Parsons became chairman of\u00a0Citigroup\u00a0in 2009, helping to stabilize the banking giant in the wake of the financial crisis. In May 2014, he was named\u00a0interim CEO of the Los Angeles Clippers\u00a0after the NBA banned owner Donald Sterling for life because he had made racist remarks.",
      "\u201cLike most Americans, I have been deeply troubled by the pain the Clippers\u2019 team, fans and partners have endured,\u201d Parsons said.",
      "Parsons played down race as a factor of his success.",
      "\u201cFor a lot of people, race is a defining issue. It just isn\u2019t for me,\u201d he told the Times in 1997. \u201cIt is \u2026 like air. It\u2019s like height. I have other things that I\u2019m focused on.\u2033",
      "He later came out of retirement to briefly serve as CBS chairman in the wake of\u00a0Les Moonves\u2019 ouster following sexual harassment and assault allegations during the #MeToo movement.",
      "After only a month as CBS\u2019 interim chairman,\u00a0Parsons\u00a0stepped down suddenly in October 2018, citing health concerns.",
      "\u201cWhen I agreed to join the board and serve as the interim chair, I was already dealing with a serious health challenge \u2014 multiple myeloma \u2014 but I felt that the situation was manageable,\u201d Parsons said in a CBS statement announcing he had been replaced by Strauss Zelnick. \u201cUnfortunately, unanticipated complications have created additional new challenges, and my doctors have advised that cutting back on my current commitments is essential to my overall recovery.\u201d",
      "Parsons was active in many charities, including playing leading roles for the Jazz Foundation of America, the Apollo Theater Foundation and the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture. During his years on the Apollo Theater board, he helped the historic\u00a0Harlem entertainment venue\u00a0raise nearly $100 million. Parsons and his wife also donated 40 works of art to the\u00a0American Folk Art Museum\u00a0in July 2021 to help celebrate its 60th anniversary.",

And Blue joined her famous mom in the spotlight on Christmas Day during a halftime performance at a game between the Baltimore Ravens and Beyonc\u00e9's hometown team, the Houston Texans.",
      "In September 2024, Beyonc\u00e9 spoke to GQ about the delicate balance of being a global star and mother.",
      "\"I build my work schedule around my family,\" she told GQ. \"I try to only tour when my kids are out of school.\"",

      "\"One thing I\u2019ve worked extremely hard on is making sure my kids can have as much normalcy and privacy as possible, ensuring my personal life isn\u2019t turned into a brand,\" she said. \"It\u2019s very easy for celebrities to turn our lives into performance art. I have made an extreme effort to stay true to my boundaries and protect myself and my family. No amount of money is worth my peace.\"",
      "While parenting and sustaining a high-profile career has its challenges, she's also described it as deeply rewarding.",
      "\"Raising three kids isn\u2019t easy,\" she said. \"Parenting constantly teaches you about yourself. It takes a lot of prayer and patience. I love it. It\u2019s grounding and fulfilling.\"",

      "\"She\u2019s a natural, but I did not want Blue onstage,\" she said. \"Blue wanted it for herself. She took it seriously and she earned it. And most importantly, she had fun! We all watched her grow more and more every night before our eyes.\u201d",
      "On Dec. 25, 2024, Blue joined Beyonc\u00e9's halftime performance at the Ravens and Texans game in Houston. She stood alongside her mom during \"Texas Hold 'Em\" to close out the set of songs from \"Cowboy Carter.\"",
      "Beyonc\u00e9 honored her daughter's guest appearance by sneaking in a small lyric change, adding: \"Then spin me in the middle, Blue, I can\u2019t read your mind.\"",
      "While Blue is the most public of Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z\u2019s three children, she has managed to maintain a balance between her public appearances and private life.\u00a0On Feb. 20, 2024, she was seen supporting her mom at the launch of Beyonc\u00e9's new hair care line, C\u00e9cred, in LA. Then, at the 2024 Grammys, Jay-Z brought his daughter onstage to accept the second annual\u00a0Dr. Dre\u00a0Global Impact Award that he received at the event.",
      "In his acceptance speech, he gave Blue a shoutout, saying, \u201cThank you very much. I used to say it was a sippy cup for Blue, but Blue\u2019s grown up now. She doesn\u2019t take sippy cups, and she has her own Grammys.\u201d",
      "Carter's eldest has been involved with voice work at a young age. In November 2020, Blue narrated Matthew A. Cherry\u2019s audiobook \u201cHair Love.\u201d In April 2024, Disney announced that she would voice cub Kiara, the daughter of King Simba and Queen Nala, in Disney's new live-action prequel \u201cMufasa: The Lion King.\u201d Beyonc\u00e9 will also star in the project, voicing Nala.",
      "Tina Knowles spoke to E! News in August 2024 and praised her granddaughter's many talents.",
      "\"She\u2019s self-taught and she sounds like a concert pianist,\u201d Knowles said of Blue. \u201cShe paints, she draws, she does poetry. She\u2019s just an artistic soul.\"",
      "\"I\u2019m really, really proud of her. I can\u2019t wait until the world gets to really hear.\u201d",
      "One of the highlights of Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s massive \u201cRenaissance\u201d tour was having her daughter join her onstage as a dancer during her performance.",
      "Rumi Carter, 6",
      "Rumi Carter is the elder of Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z's twins, according to a 2017 Vogue article. Like her twin brother, Sir Carter, Rumi was born on June 13, 2017.",
      "In Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s 2019 Netflix documentary,\u00a0\"Homecoming,\" she opened up about the \u201cextremely difficult pregnancy\" that she went through when she had Rumi and Sir.",
      "\"My body went through more than I knew it could,\u201d she said in the documentary.",

      "\"To this day my arms, shoulders, breasts, and thighs are fuller. I have a little mommy pouch, and I\u2019m in no rush to get rid of it,\" she said at the time. \"I think it\u2019s real.\"",
      "Beyonc\u00e9's twins have since been featured in a few projects that she's worked on like her\u00a0\"Black is King\"\u00a0visual album, where they made an appearance. Rumi was also in the music video for \u201cBrown Skin Girl,\" along with her sister.",
      "Rumi also took center stage in Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u201cCowboy Carter\u201d album. In the singer\u2019s song \u201cProtector,\u201d Rumi is heard asking her mom, \u201cCan I hear the lullaby please?\u201d at the beginning.",
      "The song appears to be a tribute to her children, with Beyonc\u00e9 singing about motherhood.",
      "She says, \u201cI first saw your face in your father\u2019s gaze/ There\u2019s a long line of hands carryin\u2019 your name, mm/ Liftin\u2019 you up, so you will be raised/ Even though I know someday you\u2019re going to shine on your own/ I will be your projector, yeah.\u201d",
      "Sir Carter, 6",
      "Sir Carter is Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z\u2019s youngest, though only by a minute, according to a 2017 Vogue article. Sir was born on  June 13, 2017, with his twin sister Rumi.",
      "Beyonc\u00e9 revealed in an August 2018 interview with Vogue that she suffered from preeclampsia, a \u201cserious blood pressure condition that develops during pregnancy,\u201d according to the Cleveland Clinic. On the day she gave birth to her twins, she weighed 218 pounds.",
      "\u201cI was swollen from toxemia and had been on bed rest for over a month,\u201d she said. \u201cMy health and my babies\u2019 health were in danger, so I had an emergency C-section. We spent many weeks in the NICU. My husband was a soldier and such a strong support system for me.\u201d",
      "\u201cAfter the C-section, my core felt different. It had been major surgery. Some of your organs are shifted temporarily and, in rare cases, removed temporarily during delivery,\u201d she added.",
      "In October 2023, the \u201c16 Carriages\u201d singer shared a rare glimpse of her twins when she released a video announcing her 2023 movie \u201cRenaissance: A Film by Beyonc\u00e9.\u201d At one point in the short, 2-minute trailer, the mom of three can be seen kissing her son, Sir. Another clip shows Beyonc\u00e9 holding Sir while on a golf cart.",
      "Why did Jay-Z name his daughters Blue Ivy and Rumi? And why Sir?",
      "In an interview that Jay-Z did with \u201cRap Radar\u201d hosts Elliott Wilson and Brian Miller that was posted on his streaming service,\u00a0Tidal, he explained how he and Beyonc\u00e9 came up with the names Rumi and Sir.",
      "\u201cRumi is our favorite poet, so it was for our daughter,\u201d\u00a0he said, per ABC News. As for Sir? \u201cSir was like, man, come out the gate. He carries himself like that. He just came out, like, Sir,\" he said.",
      "While the Carters have never explained the significance of Blue Ivy's name, fans think her middle name, Ivy, may be a reference to the couple's\u00a0favorite number, four \u2014 in Roman numerals, IV.",
      "The number is significant in their lives: Beyonc\u00e9 was born on Sept. 4, Jay-Z was born on Dec. 4 and they were married on April 4.",
      "CORRECTION: (Dec. 26, 2024, 11:17 a.m.): An earlier version of this story misstated the age of Blue Ivy Carter when she won her first Grammy Award. She was 9 years old, not 10."

      "Fans first noticed inklings of a rift between the film\u2019s two stars in early August when Lively and Baldoni began promoting \u201cIt Ends with Us\u201d separately ahead of the film\u2019s release. Speculation about a potential feud reached a fever pitch by mid-August, when backlash began against Lively for the way she was marketing and talking about the film.",
      "Lively\u2019s complaint, filed with the California Civil Rights Department months after the film\u2019s premiere, accused Baldoni of sexual harassment while filming and then retaliating and participating in a PR campaign to ruin her reputation before the film was released.",

      "Jamey Heath, the lead producer on \u201cIt Ends with Us\u201d and the CEO of the film\u2019s production company, Wayfarer Studios, were also named in the complaint, which is a precursor to a lawsuit.",

      "\u201cOur Lily is going to be played by Blake Lively,\u201d Hoover said. \u201cBlake Lively, y\u2019all. She\u2019s my dream Lily. And then when I first met Justin Baldoni, who is directing the film for \u2018It Ends with Us,\u2019 I immediately wanted him to be Ryle. I just thought that he had what it takes to play that character, and the good news is he\u2019s gonna be Ryle.\u201d",
      "Baldoni was also tapped to direct the film, and Lively was credited as a producer.",
      "Hoover\u2019s novel follows Lily as she opens a floral shop in Boston. She meets Ryle, a neurosurgeon, and has a chance encounter in which she reconnects with her high school sweetheart, Atlas Corrigan, while she\u2019s falling for Ryle.",

      "The movie began filming on May 5, 2023, and photos from the set immediately sparked debate amongst the book's most devoted fans.",
      "Lively was photographed with red hair for the part, and readers quickly pointed our that Lily\u2019s outfits seen in the photos didn\u2019t match scenes from the book. Fans also noted that Lively, then 35, didn\u2019t match Lily\u2019s age of 23 in the book.",
      "Hoover addressed the ages of her characters during a panel with TODAY\u2019s Jenna Bush Hager in Texas in June 2023.",
      "\u201cBack when I wrote \u2018It Ends with Us,\u2019 the new adult (genre) was very popular. You were writing college-age characters. That\u2019s what I was contracted to do. I made Lily very young. I didn\u2019t know that neurosurgeons went to school for 50 years. There\u2019s not a 20-something neurosurgeon,\u201d Hoover said.",
      "To correct her own mistake, Hoover said she met with the film\u2019s production team to tell them she wanted to use the film to make the characters more age appropriate.",
      "\u201cAs I started making this movie, I\u2019m like, we need to age them out, because I messed up,\u201d she said. \u201cSo that\u2019s my fault.\u201d",
      "Hoover also spoke about the outfits seen in photos from the set during the interview.",
      "\u201cWhen I wrote the book, it wasn\u2019t about the age of the characters. It wasn\u2019t about what they were wearing. I don\u2019t even think I described any clothing in the book,\u201d Hoover said.",
      "\u201cYeah, you\u2019ve seen a few outfits that Lily has worn, but she looks so phenomenal on screen,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd some of the outfits that she\u2019s worn indoors that no one\u2019s gotten pictures of yet are phenomenal.\u201d",
      "Aug. 6, 2024: 'It Ends With Us' premieres in New York",

      "Baldoni took photos alone and with his wife, Emily Baldoni.",
      "Around that time, fans also started to speculate about possible tension between members of the cast when they noticed that Lively and Hoover did not follow Baldoni on Instagram, though they followed each other and other members of the cast.",
      "During the film\u2019s press cycle before the release of the film, Lively appeared with other members of the cast, but not Baldoni, while Baldoni did many of his interviews for the film solo.",

      "\u201cI don\u2019t know if you know how smart and creative she really is,\u201d he told TODAY\u2019s Sheinelle Jones. \u201cI think she\u2019s best known as an actress, and of course, she\u2019s a fashion icon, but she is so much more than that. She is a dynamic creative \u2014 she had her hands in every part of this production and everything she touched she made better.\u201d",
      "After his show segment, Baldoni continued to speak about Lively in an interview with TODAY.com.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t summarize Blake\u2019s contribution in a sentence, because her energy and imprint is all over the movie and really, really made the film better, and from beginning to end,\u201d he said. \u201cRyan (Reynolds) was so generous ... he\u2019s a creative genius, that guy. So, you know, his gift is levity, and her gift is levity.\u201d",

      "In a promo clip for the film posted on social media, Lively says, \u201c\u2018It Ends with Us\u2019 is in theaters now, so grab your friends, wear your florals, and head out to see it,\u201d leading social media users to question the levity of her remarks in contract with the film\u2019s themes.",
      "But it was on Aug. 10, when Norwegian journalist Kjersti Flaa uploaded an interview with Lively from 2016 titled, \u201cThe Blake Lively interview that made me want to quit my job,\u201d that criticism around the actor escalated.",
      "The clip begins Flaa telling Lively, who was pregnant at the time, \u201cCongrats on your little bump.\u201d Lively then replies back with the same, \u201cCongrats on your little bump.\u201d (Flaa was not pregnant.)",
      "When Flaa asked about the wardrobes in the film, Lively said, \u201cEveryone wants to talk about the clothes, but I wonder if they would ask the men about the clothes?\u201d Flaa replied that she would.",
      "The YouTube video, which has been viewed over 5 million times, led some commenters to call Lively \u201crude\u201d and \u201cpassive aggressive.\u201d Lively did not comment on Flaa\u2019s video.",

      "\u201cI wanted to take a minute and address all this stuff swirling online,\u201d Sklenar wrote. \u201cColleen and the women of this cast stand for hope, perseverance, and for women choosing a better life for themselves. Vilifying the women who put so much of their heart and soul into making this film because they believe so strongly in its message seems counterproductive and detracts from what this film is about. It is, in fact, the opposite of the point.\u201d",
      "He wrote that whatever \u201cmay or may not have happened behind the scenes\u201d during shooting of the movie, \u201cshould not detract from what our intentions were in making this film.\u201d",

      "Freedman, the attorney representing Baldoni, Wayfarer Studios and all its representatives, issued a statement to TODAY.com on Dec. 21. The statement reads in full:",
      "\u201cIt is shameful that Ms. Lively and her representatives would make such serious and categorically false accusations against Mr. Baldoni, Wayfarer Studios and its representatives, as yet another desperate attempt to \u2018fix\u2019 her negative reputation which was garnered from her own remarks and actions during the campaign for the film; interviews and press activities that were observed publicly, in real time and unedited, which allowed for the internet to generate their own views and opinions. These claims are completely false, outrageous and intentionally salacious with an intent to publicly hurt and rehash a narrative in the media. Wayfarer Studios made the decision to proactively hire a crisis manager prior to the marketing campaign of the film, to work alongside their own representative with Jonesworks employed by Stephanie Jones, due to the multiple demands and threats made by Ms. Lively during production which included her threatening to not showing up to set, threatening to not promote the film, ultimately leading to its demise during release, if her demands were not met.\u00a0It was also discovered that Ms. Lively enlisted her own representative, Leslie Sloan with Vision PR, who also represents Mr. Reynolds, to plant negative and completely fabricated and false stories with media, even prior to any marketing had commenced for the film, which was another reason why Wayfarer Studios made the decision to hire a crisis professional to commence internal scenario planning in the case they needed to address.\u00a0The representatives of Wayfarer Studios still did nothing proactive nor retaliated, and only responded to incoming media inquiries to ensure balanced and factual reporting and monitored social activity.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What is pointedly missing from the cherry-picked correspondence is the evidence that there were no proactive measures taken with media or otherwise; just internal scenario planning and private correspondence to strategize which is standard operating procedure with public relations professionals.\u201d",
      "Lively said in a statement, \u201cI hope that my legal action helps pull back the curtain on these sinister retaliatory tactics to harm people who speak up about misconduct and helps protect others who may be targeted.\u201d",

      "But school was just one way she hoped to lead them to their callings.",
      "\u201cI took them to see many different plays and musicals when they were growing up, and I think seeing certain performances influenced them,\u201d she told The Guardian. \u201cThe productions they\u2019ve seen, and even growing up in New York, has informed who they are today.\u201d",

In the complaint, Lively accuses Baldoni of sexual harassment and partaking in a smear campaign with intention to harm her reputation.",
      "In a statement provided exclusively to TODAY.com, Slate said she stands by her \u201cloyal friend\u201d and \u201ctrusted source of emotional support.\u201d",
      "\u201cAs Blake Lively\u2019s castmate and friend, I voice my support as she takes action against those reported to have planned and carried out an attack on her reputation,\u201d Slate said. \u201cBlake is a leader, loyal friend and a trusted source of emotional support for me and so many who know and love her.\u201d",
      "She continued: \u201cWhat has been revealed about the attack on Blake is terribly dark, disturbing, and wholly threatening. I commend my friend, I admire her bravery, and I stand by her side.\u201d",

      "In the complaint filed Dec. 20, Lively accused Baldoni of sexual harassment while filming \u201cIt Ends with Us.\u201d She also said Baldoni retaliated and participated in a PR campaign to ruin her reputation ahead of the film\u2019s Aug. 9 release. Lively was the focus of a swell of criticism on social media around the time \u201cIt Ends with Us\u201d released.",
      "Also named in the complaint is Jamey Heath, the lead producer on \u201cIt Ends with Us\u201d and the CEO of the film\u2019s production company, Wayfarer Studios, which was co-founded by Baldoni. Lively accused him and Baldoni of \u201crepeated sexual harassment and other disturbing behavior,\u201d according to the complaint.\u00a0Public relations executive Jennifer Abel, crisis management expert Melissa Nathan and Nathan\u2019s company, The Agency Group, are also named. They are accused by Lively of envisioning and executing the PR campaign.",
      "\u201cI hope that my legal action helps pull back the curtain on these sinister retaliatory tactics to harm people who speak up about misconduct and helps protect others who may be targeted,\u201d Lively said in a Dec. 21 statement to TODAY.com.",
      "Bryan Freedman, an attorney for Baldoni, Wayfarer Studios and all its representatives, said in a statement to TODAY.com on Dec. 21 that Lively\u2019s allegations are \u201ccompletely false, outrageous and intentionally salacious\u201d and \u201cyet another desperate attempt to \u2018fix\u2019 her negative reputation.\u201d",
      "Freedman also issued a statement on behalf of The Agency Group, saying in part: \u201cThe standard scenario planning TAG PR drafted proved unnecessary as audiences found Lively\u2019s own actions, interviews and marketing during the promotional tour distasteful, and responded organically to that which the media themselves picked up on.\u201d",
      "TODAY.com has reached out to Abel for comment.",
      "\u201cIt Ends with Us,\u201d based on Colleen Hoover\u2019s bestselling 2016 book of the same name, follows a woman named Lily (Lively), who finds that her relationship with husband Ryle (Baldoni) is repeating a cycle of domestic abuse that she witnessed with her own parents.",
      "Hoover shared her support for Lively on her Instagram story Dec. 21, saying: \u201c@blakelively, you have been nothing but honest, kind, supportive and patience since the day we met. Thank you for being exactly the human that you are. Never change. Never wilt.\u201d",
      "The book and film have both been enveloped in controversy after some said the plot romanticized domestic abuse. Also, ahead of the film\u2019s release, fans started to speculate about possible tension between Lively and Baldoni when they didn\u2019t appear together to promote the movie."

    "summary": "Netflix\u2019s new film, \u201cThe Fire Inside\u201d starring Ryan Destiny, is based on the story of professional boxer Claressa Shields. Here's what to know about the true story.",
    "story": [
      "Amazon MGM Studios' new film, \u201cThe Fire Inside\u201d starring Ryan Destiny, tells the story of professional boxer Claressa Shields and how she overcame all odds to be one of the greatest female boxers alive.",
      "Though Shields accomplished much in her life, including becoming the \"first American boxer (male or female) ever to win gold in back-to-back Olympic Games,\" her road to victory was anything but easy.",
      "She grew up in poverty in Flint, Michigan to a mother who battled alcoholism and a father who was in jail during the early years of her life. At age 11, Shields started boxing with the help of her coach Jason Crutchfield, played by Brian Tyree Henry in the film, and that helped her deal with a lot of anger she had while growing up.",
      "\"I was molested and raped. But I channeled all the anger from that into boxing, and I think that\u2019s why I\u2019m so successful at it,\" she told ESPN of her childhood. \"Boxing really helped with that. It calmed me down a lot and gave me discipline and structure.\"",
      "Thanks to boxing, Shields found a way out of her tumultuous home life and was able to create a name for herself in the sports world.",
      "Scroll below to learn all about Shields and how close the film, \"The Fire Inside,\" is to her real life.",
      "Who is Claressa \u2018T-Rex\u2019 Shields?",
      "Claressa Shields, aka T-Rex, is an American professional boxer from Flint, Michigan. In 2012, Shields headed to the Olympics at 17 years old and became the first American woman to win gold in boxing. Then, four years later at the 2016 Olympics, she did it again when she secured her second gold medal.",
      "Now at age 29, Shields holds the title as being the first American boxer ever to win gold in back-to-back Olympic Games.",
      "Not to mention, she's also a three-time undisputed champ. The only fight that Shields ever lost in her boxing career was against British World Champion Savannah Marshall just months before the 2012 Olympic Games, per the Olympics. However, she avenged herself in 2022 when the two went head-to-head in London for the middleweight champion title.",
      "In an interview with ESPN, Shields explained how she got her nickname \"T-Rex.\" She said she got the moniker as a child when she was \"very skinny\" and had \"short arms.\"",
      "What happened to Claressa Shields after the Olympics?",
      "Shields' life did not change much after she brought home a gold medal in boxing at the 2012 Olympics. That was the same year that women\u2019s boxing became an official Olympic sport.",
      "The self-proclaimed GWOAT (Greatest Woman of All Time) returned home to Flint, Michigan, with no endorsement deals whatsoever.",
      "In the movie, it's said that Shields was still living on her coach's couch after she had just made history at the Olympics.",
      "In an interview with NPR, Shields said that the public wasn't comfortable with her image and she was advised to stop boasting about how she likes to beat people up in her interviews.",
      "\u201cThey had this weird definition of what a strong woman was. For some reason, that definition was pretty, non-sweaty and not as muscular. And one, I\u2019m very pretty. I think I\u2019m fine! I\u2019m gorgeous!\u201d said with a grin.",
      "\u201cBut the fact of it is,\u201d she continued, \u201cwhen [I\u2019m] boxing, I look so strong and I\u2019m punching so hard and I\u2019m punching so fast, and [I] make people feel intimidated. I think that now people are starting to embrace that. The definition of a strong woman is\u00a0Laila Ali.\u00a0Lucia Rijker. Serena Williams. Claressa Shields.\u201d",
      "Shields told Entertainment Weekly that it was hard for her to see other people get brand deals who didn't win gold medals. She explained that it was also difficult to see brands flock to her friends like Simone Biles and Katie Ledecky and then offer her nothing.",
      "\"I felt like my gold medal weighed less than theirs. So to be a 17-year-old going through that and also be in Flint where everybody\u2019s saying, 'They played you, they dissed you, your gold medal didn\u2019t mean anything, you\u2019re not getting what you deserve' \u2014 to hear that for so many years and then go back and do it again was like, 'Oh, man,'\" she said.",
      "How accurate is \u2018The Fire Inside\u2019?",
      "\"The Fire Inside\" is loosely based on Shields' life so all events in the film are not exactly true. For instance, the movie portrays Shields as a fighter who wanted to win gold at the 2012 Olympics. However, in an interview with ESPN, she said she heavily contemplated whether or not she wanted to come in first.",
      "After she lost her fight against Marshall at the 2012 AIBA world championships in China, Shields said she noticed that the dynamic around her started to change from people believing in her to having doubts about her talents. She said they didn't change their tune until she made it all the way to the finals in the 2012 Olympics.",
      "\"I really hated the fake vibes. I felt it from my Olympic teammates, some of the coaches and from people at home also,\" she said.",
      "Shields couldn't help but think about what her life would be like if she took home silver instead of gold.",
      "\"As I was walking to the ring for my final fight at the Olympics, I was telling myself, 'If you get silver, maybe you won\u2019t have so many fakers and doubters and all this weird stuff around that you don\u2019t want. But if you get gold, it\u2019s going to be all of these people that are gonna come into your life. All these new cousins and all this new stuff,\" she said.",
      "\"I had to make a decision on whether or not I wanted to get gold or silver because the power was in my hands,\" Shields continued. \"Then right before I got into the ring, I took a deep breath and I was like, 'You know what? I\u2019m gonna go ahead and get this gold medal, and however my life changes after this, I\u2019m just going to accept it and deal with it the best way I can. There is no way I\u2019m about to miss out on this opportunity because I\u2019m scared of how many fake people will come around.\u201d",
      "Shields added that people still walk up to her to this day and tell her that they lost money betting against her in the finals.",
      "Was Claressa Shields involved in the \u2018The Fire Inside\u2019?",
      "Yes, Shields served as an executive producer in \"The Fire Inside\" and she told Entertainment Weekly that she had \"a lot of input\" in how the film was made.",
      "\"Before Barry (Jenkins) wrote the script, we met in person and talked for almost five hours. I let him speak first about what he thought my story was, and when he got done talking, I said, 'Well, you had a few key parts, but this is what I want to tell, what I want them to understand about me,\" she said. \"When he wrote his script a few months later and sent it to me, he got it just right.\"",
      "Shields also hailed Destiny's acting in the film and said she did a \"great job\" playing her in \"The Fire Inside.\"",
      "\"I cry every time I watch the movie,\" Shields said.",
      "What is Claressa Shields doing now?",
      "After the 2016 Olympics, Shields went pro and became a five weight world champion. She reminded ESPN of her accolades when it left her off a list of \"trailblazing\" female athletes that aired on the channel.",
      "In response, Shields took to X to share the ESPN graphic along with a picture of herself holding her championship belts.",
      "In the caption, she wrote, \"Wow @espn. Y\u2019all have really lost yall mind!!!!! Do I have to run my resume down to y\u2019all!!! 2x Olympic champ, 3x Undisputed champ, 5 weight world champion, 15x world champ. WOMENS BOXING TRAIL BLAZER.\"",
      "Shields has since gotten involved in the Mixed Martial Arts scene. In 2021, she made her MMA debut in a fight that she won against Brittney Elkin.",
      "When asked why she wanted to do MMA, Shields told Yahoo Sports in 2021 that she felt like she \"never got her just due in boxing.\" At the time, Shields was a 12-time world champion. She is now a 15-time world champ.",
      "\"You think about becoming a 22-time world champion. It's very easy for myself to do, but it was like, 'What would that do for me? Would that make me a bigger star? Would that make me a household name? Or would that make me a millionaire?'\" she said. \"And the truth is no. It wouldn't open up any more doors to me than what has already been opened.\"",
      "\"I would have to keep fighting this war of equal pay and equal opportunity and getting women equal fight time,\" she continued. \"It just got to a place where I was like, you know what, I've been working so hard and boxing for so many years that if I'm going to work hard at something then at least let me reap what I sow.\""

    "story": [
      "There\u2019s one dessert that\u2019s the talk of Tinseltown around the holidays: the so-called \u201cTom Cruise cake.\u201d",
      "The white chocolate coconut Bundt cake from the family-owned Doan\u2019s Bakery in Woodland Hills, California got its nickname because the \u201cMission Impossible\u201d star famously gifts the dessert to his Hollywood friends at the end of every year.",
      "In 2018, Cruise said on \u201cThe Late Late Show with James Corden\u201c that he likes to send cakes to people because he doesn\u2019t consume sugar while training.",
      "So, instead of treating himself during the holidays, he treats his costars and colleagues to the coconut cake with chunks of white chocolate covered in cream cheese frosting and toasted coconut shavings.",
      "Who has received the Tom Cruise cake?",
      "Cruise\u2019s gift list reads like an awards show roll call: Renee Zellweger, Graham Norton, Rosie O\u2019Donnell, Henry Cavill, Kirsten Dunst, Cobie Smulders, Jimmy Fallon, Jon Hamm and Angela Bassett are just a small selection of folks who have spoken publicly about receiving the cake.",
      "Brooke Shields famously spoke about being removed from the list for reasons unknown to her, and Tom Hanks said his ideal \u201clast meal\u201d would include the cake.",
      "This year is no different: On Dec. 13, Cruise\u2019s \u201cTop Gun: Maverick\u201d costar Glen Powell shared a photo of the cake on his Instagram story, writing, \u201cThe Cruise Cake has arrived.\u201d",
      "On Dec. 19, Mindy Kaling shared a photo of the cake on her Instagram story with the caption \u201cIykyk\u201d (an abbreviation for the phrase \u201cIf you know, you know\u201d).",
      "Singer Victoria Canal also got a Cruise cake this year and tried a bite of it on Instagram.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s so rich,\u201d Canal says in the video. \u201cLike Tom Cruise.\u201d",
      "The pastry is so famous, it was immortalized in HBO comedy series \u201cHacks.\u201d\u00a0 In the Season 3 premiere, fictional superstar comedian Deborah Vance (played by Jean Smart) is lucky enough to be sent one of the cakes, which is immediately clocked by her protege Ava (Hannah Einbinder).",
      "Where does the Tom Cruise cake come from?",
      "The cake was invented by Karen Doan, who established Doan\u2019s Bakery in 1983 by baking desserts for restaurants, coffee houses, caterers and private events. According to the bakery\u2019s website, 25 years ago, Karen, her son Eric and his wife Carrie opened the bakery to the public. Karen died in 2023, and Eric now runs the bakery.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s amazing seeing it go from my grandma renting out kitchens, making wholesale cakes for her friend\u2019s restaurant in \u201883 to now,\u201d Alexis Doan, Eric\u2019s daughter, tells TODAY.com. Alexis acts as the store manager and assists during the busy holiday season.",
      "Alexis says that Cruise orders around 300 to 400 cakes from the bakery every year, adding that the bakery doesn\u2019t ship them out, so they\u2019re unaware who in Hollywood is actually receiving them.",
      "How to get the cake for yourself",
      "Doan\u2019s Bakery also sells the dessert through Goldbelly for $129.95 including shipping. Alexis says if you pick it up in person, the cake, which has 12 to 16 servings, costs $59.",
      "The bakery also sells a medium size that serves six to eight people for $39 and an individual portion for $9.",
      "Although there\u2019s a markup on Goldbelly, it\u2019s proven super popular there and is sold out through late-February. The bakery ships out roughly 50 cakes per day, five days a week through the online marketplace.",
      "\u201cAnd that\u2019s not including storefront, which totally varies, depending on the holiday,\u201d Alexis says.",
      "Goldbelly says it\u2019s been working with Doan\u2019s for more than five years.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s one of the most loved cakes on our site and we\u2019re thrilled to bring the magic of their white chocolate coconut cake to the world,\u201d Joe Ariel, founder and CEO of Goldbelly, tells TODAY.com. \u201cNow you no longer need to be a celebrity to order or gift someone the famous \u2018Tom Cruise Cake.\u2019\u201d",
      "If you want a celebrity coconut cake and can\u2019t wait until after Valentine\u2019s Day, Ina Garten has a get-it-sooner alternative on Goldbelly. Her coconut layer cake has a hint of almond and is layered with cream cheese icing and coated in shredded coconut, and will arrive at your door before the ball drops, for $99.95.",
      "Why does Tom Cruise love this cake?",
      "In a 2021 interview with Spectrum News, Karen recounts the story of how Cruise came to order so many cakes from their family-run business. As the story goes, Diane Keaton introduced the cake to Katie Holmes during the filming of \u201cMad Money\u201d in 2008. Holmes was married to Cruise at the time.",

      "The Kremlin on Thursday warned against speculating about what may have caused an Azerbaijan Airlines flight to crash, killing 38 of the 67 people on board, after an aviation expert said evidence indicated that a Russian anti-missile battery may have brought down the passenger plane.",
      "The Embraer 190 crashed Wednesday near the Kazakh city of Aktau while en route from Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, to Grozny, the capital of Chechnya, Russia. The flight attempted to make an emergency landing about 1.8 miles from Aktau, according to Azerbaijan Airlines, but instead hit the ground, erupted into a fiery ball and split in two.",
      "President Vladimir Putin\u2019s spokesperson Dmitry\u00a0Peskov\u00a0said the investigation into the cause of the crash was underway.",

      "Borie said another potential theory, that the plane collided with a bird or birds, would have probably led to reports of more than one explosion and the damage to the aircraft appearing differently.",

      "A U.S. official on Thursday echoed that there are indications a Russian anti-aircraft system may have struck the Azerbaijan Airlines flight, and said if that proves to be the case, it would be more evidence of Russia's recklessness in its war with Ukraine.",
      "Borie said that, at the time of the incident, Russian air defense forces were defending against a Ukrainian military-grade weaponized drone attack that involved Russia shooting down drones. At least one drone was hit east of Grozny, while others were shot down over Chechnya, he added.",
      "Earlier, the head of Ukraine\u2019s Center for Countering Disinformation, Andriy Kovalenko, said that the Azerbaijan Airlines plane \u201cwas shot down by a Russian air-defense system,\u201d citing visible damage to the plane.",

      "Azerbaijani\u00a0President\u00a0Ilham Aliyev echoed Peskov's caution. \"There are various theories, but I believe it is premature to discuss them. The matter must be thoroughly investigated,\u201d he said at a meeting dedicated to the incident Wednesday.",
      "\u201cThe reasons for the crash are not yet known,\u201d he said, adding that Azerbaijan has launched its own investigation.",
      "Aliyev said that the flight changed course because of \u201cworsening weather conditions\u201d and that the \u201ccrash occurred during landing\u201d as the plane descended toward Aktau airport.",
      "He declared Thursday a national day of mourning in Azerbaijan.",
      "The flight had 62 passengers and five crew members on board, according to the Kazakh Emergencies Ministry. Later, the Kazakh Health Ministry published a list of 29 survivors, including two children.",
      "At least one airline said it is altering its flights in the region in light of the Kazakhstan air crash. El Al, Israel's national carrier, announced Thursday it is suspending its operations on its Tel Aviv-Moscow route for the coming week and will assess when they may resume."

      "Hong Kong has struggled to attract tourists in their previous numbers after three years of pandemic border restrictions and a crackdown on dissent following 2019 antigovernment protests tarnished the city\u2019s international image.",
      "Hong Kong currently has six pandas. Its reigning pair, Ying Ying and Le Le, had twins in August, when Ying Ying become the world\u2019s oldest first-time panda mother after years of failed breeding efforts. The cubs could make their public debut in February.",
      "In September, Hong Kong also welcomed a pair of 5-year-old pandas that were sent by Beijing, giving it the largest population of giant pandas outside mainland China.",

      "Hong Kong\u2019s economy is closely intertwined with China\u2019s, and the recent slowdown in the mainland has been strongly felt here. Last month, Hong Kong\u2019s economic growth forecast for 2024 was downgraded to 2.5%, down from 3.2% last year.",
      "That is partly because tourism, a pillar of the Hong Kong economy, has failed to rebound.",
      "From January through October of this year, the city received almost 37 million visitors, according to the Hong Kong Tourism Board, an increase of 37% compared with the same period last year.

      "Mainland China continues to be the main source of tourists, accounting for more than 75% in October. But China\u2019s economic malaise has curtailed spending in Hong Kong by mainland Chinese visitors, many of whom make day trips from the city of Shenzhen across the border.",
      "Other ideas for revitalizing Hong Kong, such as the \u201cmega-event economy,\u201d have hit roadblocks as political sensitivities remain high. In February, the public was outraged when soccer star Lionel Messi failed to play in a heavily promoted exhibition game. Though Messi said he was too injured to play, fans and even government officials accused him of having \u201cpolitical motives.\u201d",

      "Hong Kong should be trying to differentiate itself from other Chinese cities, Low said, and focusing on what makes it unique.",

      "However, it later emerged that the suspect was a fan of Wilders, having previously called him \u201ca true hero\u201d on X. Wilders has not posted about it since, as of 7 a.m. ET Monday.",
      "AfD co-leader Alice Weidel, meanwhile, did continue to comment but instead focused on the suspect\u2019s immigrant background rather than his political and religious beliefs. On Monday night during a rally in Magdeburg\u2019s cathedral square she called for change \u201cso we can finally live once again in security,\u201d Reuters reported.\u00a0 Members of the crowd shouted \u201cdeport them\u201d punctuated her speech.",
      "Al-Abdulmohsen entered Germany in 2006 \u2014 almost a decade before then-Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s \u201copen-door policy\u201d that saw 1 million asylum-seekers enter the country and, critics say, foment much of the political disquiet experienced today.",
      "\u201cWhen everyone, including myself, thought this was an Islamic State attack, these accounts were all posting Islamophobic stuff, then a couple of hours later, when it turned out this guy is Islamophobic himself, these right-wing social media feeds seamlessly switched to migration,\u201d Schindler said.",
      "Other organizations the suspect previously interacted with are now trying to distance themselves.",
      "An ultra-conservative American blog called the RAIR Foundation USA interviewed al-Abdulmohsen just eight days beforehand, profiling him as a former Muslim whistleblower \u201cexposing\u201d Germany\u2019s attempts to \u201cIslamize the West.\u201d",
      "After the attack, the foundation updated its interview page.",
      "\u201cIf these reports are accurate, it appears we and other media outlets \u2026 were misled regarding his true intentions,\u201d it stated.",
      "Meanwhile, far-right X account Radio Genoa shared a video of his arrest and described him as an \u201cArab Islamic terrorist.\u201d This, despite some commenters noting that al-Abdulmohsen himself had regularly reposted Radio Genoa\u2019s own racially charged criticisms of Islam and immigration.",
      "Musk\u2019s comment deriding the media\u2019s reporting of the suspect\u2019s past and beliefs came just hours after the South African-born billionaire doubled down on his support for the AfD party. This support comes amid a series of other positive comments from Musk boosting parties on the populist and nationalist right, having successfully backed President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s win in the United States last month.",
      "It\u2019s not only this that\u2019s alarming more mainstream European officials, but also what they see as a lack of regulation on Musk\u2019s X platform, which the suspect allegedly used to issue threats ahead of Friday.",

      "He said this does not absolve German authorities, who were given an unspecified warning about al-Abdulmohsen last year. Musk posted that he \u201cshould never have been allowed to enter Germany\u201d and \u201cshould have been extradited.\u201d",
      "NBC News emailed X requesting comment about the criticism of Musk\u2019s remarks, as well as accusations that X failed to act on violent posts from the suspect, but the company did not respond.",
      "The competing narratives over al-Abdulmohsen\u2019s acts and beliefs look set to continue this week, with the AfD holding a memorial service for the victims, which some critics have derided as insensitive political opportunism.",

      "\u201cI invite every individual, and all people of all nations ... to become pilgrims of hope, to silence the sounds of arms and overcome divisions,\u2019\u2019 the pope said from the loggia of St. Peter\u2019s Basilica to throngs of people below.",
      "The pope invoked the Holy Door of St. Peter\u2019s Basilica, which he opened on Christmas Eve to launch the 2025 Jubilee, as representing God\u2019s mercy, which \u201cunties every knot; it tears down every wall of division; it dispels hatred and the spirit of revenge.\u201d",
      "He called for arms to be silenced in war-torn Ukraine and in the Middle East, singling out Christian communities in Israel and the Palestinian territories, \u201cparticularly in Gaza where the humanitarian situation is extremely grave,\u201d as well as Lebanon and Syria \u201cat this most delicate time.\u201d",
      "Francis repeated his calls for the release of hostages taken from Israel by Hamas on Oct. 7, 2023.",
      "He cited a deadly outbreak of measles in the Democratic Republic of Congo, and the suffering of the people of Myanmar, forced to flee their homes by \u201cthe ongoing clash of arms.\u201d The pope likewise remembered children suffering from war and hunger, the elderly living in solitude, those fleeing their homelands, who have lost their jobs, and are persecuted for their faith.",
      "Pilgrims were lined up on Christmas Day to walk through the great Holy Door at the entrance of St. Peter\u2019s Basilica, as the Jubilee is expected to bring some\u00a032 million Catholic faithful\u00a0to Rome.",
      "Traversing the Holy Door is one way that the faithful can obtain indulgences, or forgiveness for sins during a Jubilee, a once-every-quarter-century tradition that dates from 1300.",
      "Pilgrims submitted to security controls before entering the Holy Door, amid new security fears following\u00a0a deadly Christmas market attack in Germany.\u00a0Many paused to touch the door as they passed and made the sign of the cross upon entering the basilica dedicated to St. Peter, the founder of the Roman Catholic Church.",
      "\u201cYou feel so humble when you go through the door that once you go through is almost like a release, a release of emotions,\u2019\u2019 said Blanca Martin, a pilgrim from San Diego. \u201c... It\u2019s almost like a release of emotions, you feel like now you are able to let go and put everything in the hands of God. See I am getting emotional. It\u2019s just a beautiful experience.\u201d",
      "A Chrismukkah miracle as Hanukkah and Christmas coincide",
      "Hanukkah,\u00a0Judaism\u2019s eight-day Festival of Lights, begins this year on Christmas Day,\u00a0which has only happened four times since 1900.",
      "The calendar confluence has inspired some religious leaders to host interfaith gatherings, such as a Hanukkah party hosted last week by several Jewish organizations in Houston, Texas, bringing together members of the city\u2019s Latino and Jewish communities for latkes, the traditional potato pancake eaten on Hanukkah, topped with guacamole and salsa.",
      "While Hanukkah is intended as an upbeat, celebratory holiday, rabbis note that it\u2019s taking place this year as wars rage in the Middle East and fears rise over widespread\u00a0incidents of antisemitism. The holidays overlap infrequently because the Jewish calendar is based on lunar cycles and is not in sync with the Gregorian calendar, which sets Christmas on Dec. 25. The last time Hanukkah began on Christmas Day was in 2005.",
      "Iraqi Christians persist in their faith",
      "Christians in Nineveh Plains attended Christmas Mass on Tuesday at the Mar Georgis church in the center of Telaskaf, Iraq, with security concerns about the future. \u201cWe feel that they will pull the rug out from under our feet at any time. Our fate is unknown here,\u201d said Bayda Nadhim, a resident of Telaskaf.",
      "Iraq\u2019s Christians, whose presence there goes back nearly to the time of Christ, belong to a number of rites and denominations. They once constituted a sizeable minority in Iraq, estimated at around 1.4 million.",
      "But the community has steadily dwindled since the 2003 US-led invasion and further in 2014 when the Islamic State militant group swept through the area. The exact number of Christians left in Iraq is unclear, but they are thought to number several hundred thousand.",
      "German celebrations muted by market attack",
      "German celebrations were darkened by a car attack on a Christmas market in Magdeburg on Friday that left five people dead, including a 9-year-old boy, and 200 people injured. President Frank-Walter Steinmeier rewrote his recorded Christmas Day speech to address the attack, saying that \u201cthere is grief, pain, horror and incomprehension over what took place in Magdeburg.\u201d He urged Germans to \u201cstand together\u201d and that \u201chate and violence must not have the last word.\u201d",
      "A 50-year-old Saudi doctor who had practiced medicine in Germany since 2006 was arrested on suspicion of murder, attempted murder and bodily harm. The suspect\u2019s X account describes him as a former Muslim and is filled with anti-Islamic themes. He criticized authorities for failing to combat \u201cthe Islamification of Germany\u201d and voiced support for the anti-immigration Alternative for Germany (AfD) party."

      "BETHLEHEM, West Bank \u2014 In the little town of Bethlehem, Christmas this year is barely a whisper.",
      "Palestinian scouts paraded through the streets but without their traditional instruments of drums, horns and bagpipes. There was no jubilant countdown to the lighting of the Christmas tree in the main square. In fact, there is no Christmas tree at all.",
      "Bethlehem is facing its second bleak Christmas since the outbreak of the war in Gaza \u2014 leaving faith leaders and residents grappling with how to mark the festive holiday while fellow Palestinians continue to be killed.",
      "\u201cBethlehem is the capital of Christmas. It\u2019s supposed to be the best time of the year. None of that is happening because we\u2019re mourning,\u201d Rev. Munther Isaac, the pastor of Bethlehem\u2019s Evangelical Lutheran Christmas Church, told NBC News.",
      "Next to the altar where Isaac delivers sermons is an unusual Nativity scene: For the second Christmas in a row, the baby Jesus is wrapped in a keffiyeh, the traditional Palestinian scarf, and nestled on a pile of rubble. It serves as a reminder of the thousands of Palestinian children killed in Israeli strikes during the war, Isaac said. \u201cWe see Jesus in every child pulled from under the rubble in Gaza.\u201d",
      "Aside from the suffering in Gaza, Bethlehem faces its own challenges.",
      "Its economy is heavily dependent on tourism but few foreign visitors are coming to the city in the occupied West Bank amid the war sparked by Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel. That is compounding economic misery that began with the Covid pandemic, which also devastated the tourism industry.",
      "\u201cHonestly, it\u2019s a desert,\u201d said Rony Tabash, whose family has run a gift store near the Church of the Nativity for nearly a century. \u201cThere are no pilgrims, there are no tourists.\u201d At the worst points, he said, he had gone two months without making a single sale.",
      "Meanwhile, an Israeli-built wall partially encircles Bethlehem, cutting it off from Jerusalem and stifling homebuilding and urban growth. Israel says the wall is a necessary security measure to stop suicide bombings. But in 2004, the International Court of Justice determined it was illegal under international law.",
      "The hardship means many young people are leaving Bethlehem and moving abroad in search of a better future \u2014 raising fears that the Christian community in the city where the faith was born will dwindle and might one day disappear.",
      "\u201cWe are very, very concerned,\u201d Isaac said. \u201cThis is beyond the dangerous point.\u201d",
      "Life is no easier for elderly Christians. At the home of 79-year-old Nuha Tarazi, her landline phone beeps harshly as an attempted call to her relatives in Gaza once again fails to connect.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s why I didn\u2019t put up the Christmas tree,\u201d the widowed grandmother said. \u201cI would not feel well if I did that while they\u2019re suffering there.\u201d",
      "Tarazi was born in Gaza City but has lived in Bethlehem for nearly 40 years. Four of her siblings were still alive in the Strip when the war broke out more than a year ago. But she said one of her sisters had been killed in an Israeli strike and a brother had died of untreated kidney disease as Gaza\u2019s health care system collapsed.",
      "Her two surviving siblings \u2014 sister, Samhiaa Azzam, and brother, Atallah Tarazi \u2014 are among hundreds of Christians sheltering at the Holy Family, a Catholic church in the ruins of Gaza City. Families fall asleep to the thump of nearby airstrikes and the constant whine of an Israeli drone overhead.",
      "\u201cWe constantly ask God to protect us and safeguard us from all evil,\u201d said Atallah, 77, a retired surgeon who once traveled the world but now rarely leaves the church compound and sleeps in a cot in a crowded storage room.",
      "During a visit in Gaza by NBC News, Samhiaa and Atallah placed a call to their sister Nuha in Bethlehem. This time the call connected.",
      "\u201cHappy New Year, may you be in peace,\u201d Samhiaa, 74, told her sister over the crackly line, urging her to celebrate Christmas despite everything. \u201cMy greetings to everyone, rejoice as much as you can. Rejoice.\u201d"

      "A video circulating on social media and verified by NBC News showed crowds in Damascus chanting \u201cRaise your cross, raise it!\u201d and \u201cWe are with you to death, Suqalabiyah!\u201d",
      "Syria\u2019s de facto new leader Ahmed al-Sharaa has been trying to cast his leadership as one that will protect minorities in the Sunni-majority country, just two weeks after his rebel group led a quickfire offensive that ousted Assad.",

      "\"That night, and under the rain, they set up a new tree in the same spot, decorated it, and arrested the attackers,\" he said, saying that the official promise to support the community \"in fighting against such unacceptable actions.\u201d",

      "Because of its roots in radical Islamist movements, HTS remains a globally designated terrorist group. Al-Sharaa, however, has vowed to lead Syria into an era of change, promising an inclusive vision where all religious and ethnic groups are represented.",
      "On Tuesday, the Syrian Presidency of the Council of Ministers granted a public holiday to \"all employees in government institutions\" on Christmas Day and December 26.",
      "Al-Sharaa has also attempted to move away from his past as a jihadist leader with links to both the\u00a0Islamic State\u00a0terrorist group and\u00a0Al Qaeda.",
