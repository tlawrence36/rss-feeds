      "The composer who wrote the endlessly catchy theme for \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d and more than 100 other arrangements for film and television, Lalo Schifrin has died",
      "Lalo Schifrin, the composer who wrote the endlessly catchy theme for \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d and more than 100 other arrangements for film and television, died Thursday. He was 93.",
      "Schifrin\u2019s sons William and Ryan confirmed his death to trade outlets. The Associated Press\u2019 messages to Schifrin\u2019s publicist and representatives for either brother were not immediately returned.",
      "The Argentine won four Grammys and was nominated for six Oscars, including five for original score for \u201cCool Hand Luke,\u201d \u201cThe Fox,\u201d \u201cVoyage of the Damned,\u201d \u201cThe Amityville Horror\u201d and \u201cThe Sting II.\u201d",
      "\u201cEvery movie has its own personality. There are no rules to write music for movies,\u201d Schifrin told The Associated Press in 2018. \u201cThe movie dictates what the music will be.\u201d",
      "He also wrote the grand finale musical performance for the World Cup championship in Italy in 1990, in which the Three Tenors \u2014 Pl\u00e1cido Domingo, Luciano Pavarotti and Jos\u00e9 Carreras \u2014 sang together for the first time. The work became one of the biggest sellers in the history of classical music.",
      "Schifrin, also a jazz pianist and classical conductor, had a remarkable career in music that included working with Dizzy Gillespie and recording with Count Basie and Sarah Vaughan. But perhaps his biggest contribution was the instantly recognizable score to television\u2019s \u201cMission: Impossible,\u201d which fueled the just-wrapped, decades-spanning feature film franchise led by Tom Cruise.",
      "Written in the unusual 5/4 time signature, the theme \u2014 Dum-dum DUM DUM dum-dum DUM DUM \u2014 was married to an on-screen self-destruct clock that kicked off the TV show, which ran from 1966 to 1973. It was described as \u201conly the most contagious tune ever heard by mortal ears\u201d by New Yorker film critic Anthony Lane and even hit No. 41 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1968.",
      "Schifrin originally wrote a different piece of music for the theme song but series creator Bruce Geller liked another arrangement Schifrin had composed for an action sequence.",
      "\u201cThe producer called me and told me, \u2018You\u2019re going to have to write something exciting, almost like a logo, something that will be a signature, and it\u2019s going to start with a fuse,\u2019\u201d Schifrin told the AP in 2006. \u201cSo I did it and there was nothing on the screen. And maybe the fact that I was so free and I had no images to catch, maybe that\u2019s why this thing has become so successful \u2014 because I wrote something that came from inside me.\u201d",
      "When director Brian De Palma was asked to take the series to the silver screen, he wanted to bring the theme along with him, leading to a creative conflict with composer John Williams, who wanted to work with a new theme of his own. Out went Williams and in came Danny Elfman, who agreed to retain Schifrin\u2019s music.",
      "Hans Zimmer took over scoring for the second film, and Michael Giacchino scored the next two. Giacchino told NPR he was a hesitant to take it on, because Schifrin\u2019s music was one of his favorite themes of all time.",
      "\u201cI remember calling Lalo and asking if we could meet for lunch,\u201d Giacchino told NPR. \u201cAnd I was very nervous \u2014 I felt like someone asking a father if I could marry their daughter or something. And he said, \u2018Just have fun with it.\u2019 And I did.\u201d",
      "\u201cMission: Impossible\u201d won Grammys for best instrumental theme and best original score from a motion picture or a TV show. In 2017, the theme was entered into the Grammy Hall of Fame.",
      "U2 members Adam Clayton and Larry Mullen Jr. covered the theme while making the soundtrack to 1996\u2019s first installment; that version peaked at No. 16 on the Billboard 200 with a Grammy nomination.",
      "A 2010 commercial for Lipton tea depicted a young Schifrin composing the theme at his piano while gaining inspiration through sips of the brand\u2019s Lipton Yellow Label. Musicians dropped from the sky as he added elements.",
      "Born Boris Claudio Schifrin to a Jewish family in Buenos Aires \u2014 where his father was the concertmaster of the philharmonic orchestra \u2014 Schifrin was classically trained in music, in addition to studying law.",
      "After studying at the Paris Conservatory \u2014 where he learned about harmony and composition from the legendary Olivier Messiaen \u2014 Schifrin returned to Argentina and formed a concert band. Gillespie heard Schifrin perform and asked him to become his pianist, arranger and composer. In 1958, Schifrin moved to the United States, playing in Gillespie\u2019s quintet in 1960-62 and composing the acclaimed \u201cGillespiana.\u201d",
      "The long list of luminaries he performed and recorded with includes Ella Fitzgerald, Stan Getz, Dee Dee Bridgewater and George Benson. He also worked with such classical stars as Zubin Mehta, Mstislav Rostropovich, Daniel Barenboim and others.",
      "Schifrin moved easily between genres, winning a Grammy for 1965\u2019s \u201cJazz Suite on the Mass Texts\u201d while also earning a nod that same year for the score of TV\u2019s \u201cThe Man From U.N.C.L.E.\u201d In 2018, he was given an honorary Oscar statuette and, in 2017, the Latin Recording Academy bestowed on him one of its special trustee awards.",
      "Later film scores included \u201cTango,\u201d \u201cRush Hour\u201d and its two sequels, \u201cBringing Down The House,\u201d \u201cThe Bridge of San Luis Rey,\u201d \u201cAfter the Sunset\u201d and the horror film \u201cAbominable.\u201d",
      "Writing the arrangements for \u201cDirty Harry,\u201d Schifrin decided that the main character wasn\u2019t in fact Clint Eastwood\u2019s hero, Harry Callahan, but the villain, Scorpio.",
      "\u201cYou would think the composer would pay more attention to the hero. But in this case, no, I did it to Scorpio, the bad guy, the evil guy,\u201d he told the AP. \u201cI wrote a theme for Scorpio.\u201d",
      "It was Eastwood who handed him his honorary Oscar.",
      "\u201cReceiving this honorary Oscar is the culmination of a dream,\u201d Schifrin said at the time. \u201cIt is mission accomplished.\u201d",
      "Among Schifrin\u2019s conducting credits include the London Symphony Orchestra, the Vienna Symphony Orchestra, the Israel Philharmonic, the Mexico Philharmonic, the Houston Symphony Orchestra, the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra and the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra. He was appointed music director of Southern California\u2019s Glendale Symphony Orchestra and served in that capacity from 1989-1995. Schifrin also wrote and adapted the music for \u201cChristmas in Vienna\u201d in 1992, a concert featuring Diana Ross, Carreras and Domingo.",
      "He also combined tango, folk and classical genres when he recorded \u201cLetters from Argentina,\u201d nominated for a Latin Grammy for best tango album in 2006.",
      "Schifrin was also commissioned to write the overture for the 1987 Pan American Games, and composed and conducted the event\u2019s 1995 final performance in Argentina.",
      "And for perhaps one of the only operas performed in the ancient Indigenous language of Nahuatl, in 1988 Schifrin wrote and conducted the choral symphony \u201cSongs of the Aztecs.\u201d The work premiered at Mexico\u2019s Teotihuacan pyramids with Domingo as part of a campaign to raise money to restore the site\u2019s Aztec temple.",
      "\u201cI found it to be a very sweet, musical language, one in which the sounds of the words dictated interesting melodies,\u201d Schifrin told The Associated Press at the time. \u201cBut the real answer is that there\u2019s something magic about it. ... There\u2019s something magic in the art of music anyway.\u201d",
      "In addition to his sons, he\u2019s survived by his daughter, Frances, and wife, Donna.",

    "story": [
      "Bill Moyers, the former White House press secretary who became one of television\u2019s most honored journalists, has died at 91",
      "NEW YORK -- Bill Moyers, the former White House press secretary who became one of television\u2019s most honored journalists, masterfully using a visual medium to illuminate a world of ideas, died Thursday at age 91.",
      "Moyer died in a New York City hospital, according to longtime friend Tom Johnson, the former CEO of CNN and an assistant to Moyers during Lyndon B. Johnson's administration. He did not cite Moyers' cause of death.",
      "Moyer\u2019s career ranged from youthful Baptist minister to deputy director of the Peace Corps, from Johnson\u2019s press secretary to newspaper publisher, senior news analyst for \u201cThe CBS Evening News\u201d and chief correspondent for \u201cCBS Reports.\u201d",
      "But it was for public television that Moyers produced some of TV\u2019s most cerebral and provocative series. In hundreds of hours of PBS programs, he proved at home with subjects ranging from government corruption to modern dance, from drug addiction to media consolidation, from religion to environmental abuse.",
      "In 1988, Moyers produced \u201cThe Secret Government\u201d about the Iran-Contra scandal during the Reagan administration and simultaneously published a book under the same name. Around that time, he galvanized viewers with \u201cJoseph Campbell and the Power of Myth,\u201d a series of six one-hour interviews with the prominent religious scholar. The accompanying book became a best-seller.",
      "His televised chats with poet Robert Bly almost single-handedly launched the 1990s Men\u2019s Movement, and his 1993 series \u201cHealing and the Mind\u201d had a profound impact on the medical community and on medical education.",
      "In a medium that supposedly abhors \u201ctalking heads\u201d \u2014 shots of subject and interviewer talking \u2014 Moyers came to specialize in just that. He once explained why: \u201cThe question is, are the talking heads thinking minds and thinking people? Are they interesting to watch? I think the most fascinating production value is the human face.\u201d",
      "Demonstrating what someone called \u201ca soft, probing style\u201d in the native Texas accent he never lost, Moyers was a humanist who investigated the world with a calm, reasoned perspective, whatever the subject.",
      "From some quarters, he was blasted as a liberal thanks to his links with Johnson and public television, as well as his no-holds-barred approach to investigative journalism. It was a label he didn\u2019t necessarily deny.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m an old-fashion liberal when it comes to being open and being interested in other people\u2019s ideas,\u201d he said during a 2004 radio interview. But Moyers preferred to term himself a \u201ccitizen journalist\u201d operating independently, outside the establishment.",
      "Public television (and his self-financed production company) gave him free rein to throw \u201cthe conversation of democracy open to all comers,\u201d he said in a 2007 interview with The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cI think my peers in commercial television are talented and devoted journalists,\u201d he said another time, \u201cbut they\u2019ve chosen to work in a corporate mainstream that trims their talent to fit the corporate nature of American life. And you do not get rewarded for telling the hard truths about America in a profit-seeking environment.\u201d",
      "Over the years, Moyers was showered with honors, including more than 30 Emmys, 11 George Foster Peabody awards, three George Polks and, twice, the Alfred I. duPont-Columbia University Gold Baton Award for career excellence in broadcast journalism. In 1995, he was inducted into the Television Hall of Fame.",

      "Bruce Springsteen isn't the only musician to complete or launch anticipated album projects, then to see it never see the light of day",
      "NEW YORK -- The idea that Bruce Springsteen wrote, recorded and ultimately shelved entire albums of music may seem odd to the casual listener. Why put yourself through all that work for nothing?",
      "Yet \u201clost albums\u201d are embedded in music industry lore. Some were literally lost. Some remained unfinished or unreleased because of tragedy, shortsighted executives or creators who were perfectionist \u2014 or had short attention spans.",
      "Often, the music is eventually made public, like Springsteen is doing now, although out of context from the times in which it was originally made.",
      "So in honor of Springsteen's 83-song \u201cTracks II: The Lost Albums\u201d box set being released Friday, The Associated Press has collected 10 examples of albums that were meant to be but weren't.",
      "Back in the news with the death of Brian Wilson, this album \u201cinvented the category of the lost masterpiece in popular music,\u201d says Anthony DeCurtis, contributing editor at Rolling Stone. Some of the material that surfaced suggested Wilson, the Beach Boys' chief writer, was well on his way: the majestic single \u201cGood Vibrations,\u201d the centerpiece \u201cHeroes and Villains\u201d and the reflective \u201cSurf's Up.\u201d Wilson succumbed to internal competitive pressure worsened by mental illness and drug abuse while making it in 1966 and 1967, eventually aborting the project. He later finished it as a solo album backed by the Wondermints in 2004. The better-known songs were joined with some psychedelic-era curios that displayed Wilson's melodic sense and matchless ability as a vocal arranger, along with lyrics that some fellow Beach Boys worried were too \u201cout there.\u201d",
      "The mercurial Prince pulled back this disc, set for release in December 1987, at the last minute. Some promo copies had already slipped out, and it was so widely bootlegged that when Warner Bros. officially put it out in limited release in 1994, the company billed it as \u201cThe Legendary Black Album.\u201d Encased in an all-black sleeve, the project was said to be Prince's nod to Black fans who may have felt they had lost him to a pop audience. It's almost nonstop funk, including a lascivious Cindy Crawford tribute and the workout \u201cSuperfunkycalifragisexy.\u201d The maestro's instincts were well-placed, though. Coming after \u201cSign O' the Times\u201d \u2014 arguably his peak \u2014 this would have felt like a minor project.",
      "Written and recorded in 2003, Green Day's \u201cCigarettes and Valentines\u201d was actually lost; someone apparently stole the master tapes. Feeling on a creative roll, the rock trio decided against recreating what they'd done and pressed on with new material. Smart move. The result was \u201cAmerican Idiot,\u201d the band's best work. Perhaps the robbery was \u201cjust a sign that we made a crappy record and we should make a better one,\u201d songwriter Billie Joe Armstrong told MTV. The title cut later surfaced on a 2010 live album. The rest was lost to time.",
      "To say anticipation was high for Dr. Dre\u2019s third album when he started recording in 2002 puts it mildly. The theme disc about a hitman, which Dre described as a \u201chip-hop musical,\u201d had an all-star squad of contributors including Eminem, 50 Cent, Mary J. Blige, Busta Rhymes and Kendrick Lamar. \u201cI\u2019d describe it as the most advanced rap album musically and lyrically we\u2019ll probably ever have a chance to listen to,\u201d co-producer Scott Storch told MTV. But we never have. When he announced a different third album in 2015, Dre explained on his radio show what happened to \u201cDetox\u201d: \u201cI didn\u2019t like it. It wasn\u2019t good. ... I worked my ass off on it, and I don\u2019t think I did a good enough job.\u201d",
      "A series of unfinished demos, \u201cBlack Gold\u201d was a taste of where guitar god Jimi Hendrix might have gone creatively if he hadn't died at 27 in 1970. He was composing a song suite about an animated Black superhero, says Tom Maxwell, whose podcast \u201cShelved\u201d unearths stories behind lost music. Hendrix sent a tape of his work to longtime drummer Mitch Mitchell for advice on fleshing it out. That music was set aside at Mitchell's home and forgotten for two decades after Hendrix died. To date, Hendrix's estate has made only one of these recordings public, a song called \u201cSuddenly November Morning.\u201d Hendrix, after clearing his throat, slips in and out of falsetto while accompanying himself on an acoustic guitar.",
      "Written while Yoko Ono was separated from John Lennon during his infamous \u201clost weekend\u201d in 1973-74, \u201cA Story\u201d had the potential of changing the musical narrative around her. It was a strong album \u2014 without the avant-garde stylings that made Ono a challenge for mainstream listeners \u2014 recorded with musicians who worked on Lennon's \u201cWalls & Bridges.\u201d Maxwell calls it \u201can emancipation manifesto\u201d that was set aside when Ono reconciled with Lennon. She's never publicly explained why, Maxwell says, although one song seems clearly about an affair she had while Lennon was away. Some of the material from \u201cA Story\u201d was included as part of the \u201cOnobox\u201d project that came out in 1992, and the album was released separately in 1997. Ono also re-recorded some of its songs in 1980, and Lennon was holding a tape of her composition \u201cIt Happened\u201d when he was shot and killed. In it, she sings about an unspecified, seemingly traumatic event: \u201cIt happened at a time of my life when I least expected.\u201d That wasn't even the most chilling premonition. Her song \u201cO'Oh\u201d ended with firecrackers that sound like gunshots. It was left off the 1997 release.",
      "Guns N' Roses was at the top of the hard rock world when they began recording a new album in 1994. It didn't go well. Inconclusive sessions slogged on for years, and all but singer Axl Rose left the group. Recording costs exceeded a staggering $13 million, by some accounts the most expensive rock album ever. One witness told The New York Times in 2005: \u201cWhat Axl wanted to do was to make the best record that had ever been made. It's an impossible task. You could go on indefinitely, which is what they've done.\u201d When \u201cChinese Democracy\u201d was finally released in 2008, the world yawned.",
      "Not even a decade after the triumph of \u201cWhat's Going On,\u201d Marvin Gaye was floundering. His \u201cHere, My Dear\u201d divorce album flopped, he struggled with drugs and searched for relevance in the disco era. The single \u201cEgo Tripping Out,\u201d meant to herald a new album, laid bare the problems: Over a melody cribbed from Donna Summer's \u201cHot Stuff,\u201d the famously cool \u201cLove Man\u201d boasted like an insecure rapper. He scrapped the album, repurposing some its material for the 1981 disc \u201cIn Our Lifetime,\u201d a process so fraught he bitterly left his longtime label Motown. Gaye went to CBS, made a huge comeback with \u201cSexual Healing,\u201d then was shot dead by his father in 1984.",
      "Neil Young rivals Prince in the volume of material left in his vault, and he's been systematically releasing much of it. The mostly acoustic \u201cHomegrown\u201d was recorded as 1974 bled into 1975, during Young's breakup with actor Carrie Snodgress. Instead of releasing it in 1975, he put out another heartbreak album, the well-regarded \u201cTonight's the Night,\u201d about losing friends to drug abuse. When Young finally dropped \u201cHomegrown\u201d in 2020, he wrote in his blog, \u201cSometimes life hurts. This is the one that got away.\u201d",
      "Of the discs included in Springsteen's \u201cTracks II\u201d set, this was reportedly the closest to being released, in the spring of 1995. After the success of the Oscar-winning song \u201cStreets of Philadelphia,\u201d Springsteen recorded an album in the same vein, with a synthesizer and West Coast rap-inspired drum loops setting the musical motif. Strikingly contemporary for its time, Springsteen ultimately felt it was too similar to previous releases dominated by dark stories about relationships. \u201cI always put them away,\u201d he said of his lost albums. \u201cBut I don't throw them away.\u201d",

      "In the 50-plus years of James Bond, the wait between films has never gone longer than six years",
      "In the 50-plus years of James Bond, the wait between films has never gone longer than six years. The next entry, and first since Daniel Craig's dramatic exit, may test that \u2014 but things are speeding up.",
      "On Wednesday, Amazon MGM Studio announced that Denis Villeneuve will direct the 26th Bond movie, putting the franchise in the hands of one of the most respected big-budget filmmakers. Here's what to know about that decision, and where things stand for 007.",
      "Villeneuve, the 57-year-old French Canadian director, edged out other filmmakers who were reportedly eyed for the gig, including Edward Berger (\u201cConclave\u201d) and Paul King (\u201cPaddington 2\u201d). Since emerging with 2010's \u201cIncendies,\" Villeneuve has established himself as a steward of cinematic IP (\"Blade Runner 2049,\" \u201cDune\u201d) and a specialist in dark, doom-laden spectacle (\"Sicaro,\" \u201cArrival\u201d).",
      "\u201cJames Bond is in the hands of one of today\u2019s greatest filmmakers,\u201d said Mike Hopkins, head of Prime Video and Amazon MGM Studios.",
      "The culmination for Villeneuve has been the \u201cDune\u201d films. His first two entries have surpassed $1 billion in box office and gathered a combined 15 Academy Award nominations, winning seven. Villeneuve is expected to begin shooting the third \u201cDune\u201d film this summer, with a cast including Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, Florence Pugh, Zendaya and Javier Bardem.",
      "\"I\u2019m a die-hard Bond fan. To me, he\u2019s sacred territory,\u201d said Villeneuve. \u201cI intend to honor the tradition and open the path for many new missions to come. This is a massive responsibility, but also, incredibly exciting for me and a huge honor.\u201d",
      "Amazon, which bought MGM Studios in 2022 for $8.5 billion, hasn't set a release date yet or announced a screenwriter. Producers Amy Pascal and David Heyman are shepherding the movie for the first time. In February, Amazon MGM Studios secured creative control of the franchise from Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli, whose family has presided over Bond since the first film, 1962's \u201cDr. No.\u201d",
      "The most likely timing would be production starting in 2026 and the film being released sometime in 2027.",
      "No new 007 has been named, but that hasn't stopped rumors and conjecture from running rampant.",
      "It's pure speculation buts oddsmakers have a few expected contenders for the martini-sipping role. Those include Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Theo James, Aaron Pierre, Henry Cavill, James Norton and Jack Lowden. Expectations are that the new Bond will remain male and British, but producers have said nothing publicly to tip their hand.",
      "Whoever it is will have big shoes to fill. In his five-film, 15-year stretch in the tuxedo, Daniel Craig was widely seen as one of the best Bonds, including the high point of \u201cSkyfall\u201d (2012) and the swan song of \u201cNo Time to Die\u201d (2021).",
      "Since Albert \u201cCubby\u201d Broccoli obtained the movie rights to Ian Fleming's books, James Bond has been a family business. That didn't change after Amazon bought MGM, but it did earlier this year when Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli agreed to let the studio take creative control.",
      "That handoff stoked concern from many Bond fans that 007 would be picked apart for spinoffs, series and the kind of intellectual property strip mining Hollywood has been known for in other franchises like \u201cStar Wars.\u201d So far, though, Amazon MGM has made no announcement about any spinoffs, and is prioritizing the 26th Bond movie.",

    "story": [
      "A prosecutor began two days of closing arguments at Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs' sex trafficking trial by telling a jury that the music mogul used \u201cpower, violence and fear\u201d to rule a criminal enterprise for two decades",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs \u201ccommitted crime after crime\u201d but thought his \u201cfame, wealth and power\u201d put him above the law, a prosecutor told jurors Thursday as the hip-hop mogul\u2019s sex trafficking trial shifted to closing arguments.",
      "\u201cThat ends now,\u201d Assistant U.S. Attorney Christy Slavik said. \u201cIt\u2019s time to find the defendant guilty.\u201d",
      "Combs, 55, sat with his head down as Slavik highlighted testimony and evidence from the seven-week trial that she said proved sex trafficking, racketeering conspiracy and other charges. Wearing a sweater and khakis, he sometimes scribbled notes to his lawyers and shook his head as Slavik played one of his audio messages for the jury.",
      "\u201cOver the last several weeks, you\u2019ve learned a lot about Sean Combs,\u201d Slavik said, launching into a nearly five-hour presentation. \u201cHe\u2019s the leader of a criminal enterprise. He doesn\u2019t take no for an answer. And now you know about many crimes he committed with members of his enterprise.\u201d",
      "Among the proof, Slavik argued, was evidence that Combs kidnapped an employee, was involved in setting rapper Kid Cudi\u2019s convertible ablaze, bribed a hotel guard and carried out \u201cbrutal crimes at the heart of this case.\u201d",
      "Combs \u201cagain and again forced, threatened and manipulated\u201d his ex-girlfriends Cassie and Jane into \u201chaving sex with escorts for his own entertainment,\u201d Slavik said, her lectern directly in front of jurors.",
      "The prosecutor said Combs forced or coerced Cassie, whose real name is Casandra Ventura, and Jane, who testified under a pseudonym, to engage in dayslong sex marathons known as \u201cfreak-offs\u201d or \u201chotel nights\u201d with drugs, violence, or by threatening financial harm or the release of video recordings of some of the hundreds of encounters.",
      "\u201cUp until today, the defendant was able to get away with these crimes,\u201d Slavik said.",
      "Bookending the trial\u2019s start, jurors again saw now-infamous security footage of Combs hitting, kicking and dragging Cassie at the Intercontinental Hotel in Los Angeles in 2016 after she tried to leave a freak-off with a male sex worker.",
      "\u201cHe knew exactly what he was doing. That is sex trafficking,\u201d Slavik told the jury, adding that Combs was \u201cknowingly using force and coercion to get Cassie back to that room where the escort was waiting.\u201d",
      "Slavik said Combs \u201ccounted on silence and shame\u201d to enable and prolong his abuse. He used a \u201csmall army\u201d of employees, including personal assistants and bodyguards, to harm women and cover it up, she said.",
      "The theory of racketeering law is that \u201cwhen someone commits crime as part of a group, they\u2019re more powerful and dangerous,\u201d Slavik said. \u201cThe defendant was a powerful man, but he became more powerful and dangerous because of his inner circle, his businesses \u2014 the enterprise.\u201d",
      "Combs and his inner circle \u201ccommitted hundreds of racketeering acts,\u201d she said.",
      "Members of Combs\u2019 family, including several of his children, watched from wooden benches in the packed courtroom. At one point, he gave them a thumbs-up.",
      "Since his arrest at a Manhattan hotel last September, Combs and his lawyers have insisted he is innocent, though they conceded at trial that domestic violence occurred.",
      "Combs \u201cwas abusive: physical, emotional, psychological, sexual abuse,\u201d Slavik said. \u201cThe defendant doesn\u2019t deny the abuse. They just want to call it \u2018domestic violence\u2019 and claim it doesn\u2019t have anything to do with the crimes charged.\u201d",
      "The defense will give its closing argument on Friday, followed by a prosecution rebuttal argument. Then, Judge Arun Subramanian said, he will instruct jurors on the law before deliberations begin.",
      "Combs\u2019 lawyers built their case for acquittal through lengthy cross-examinations of government witnesses. Some testified only in response to subpoenas and insisted they didn't want to be there.",
      "Combs\u2019 lawyers contend there was no racketeering conspiracy because no employees agreed to join any conspiracy.",
      "In her closing, Slavik said employees repeatedly agreed to commit crimes for Combs, including delivering him drugs; accompanying him to kidnap his personal assistant; and locking Cassie in a hotel room after he stomped on her face.",
      "As Slavik returned repeatedly to the topic of Combs\u2019 sex marathons, jurors saw a slide that said \u201cThe Freak Offs\u201d next to a photo of him laying on a bed bathed in red light.",
      "Slavik reminded jurors of text messages and testimony that showed that the women didn't want to participate, including one in which Jane told Combs that she felt he gave her no choice.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s dark, sleazy and makes me feel disgusted with myself. I feel it\u2019s the only reason you have me around and why you pay for the house,\u201d Jane wrote. \u201cI don\u2019t want to feel obligated to perform these nights with you in fear of losing the roof over my head.\u201d",

      "Issey Miyake\u2019s menswear line has returned to Paris Fashion Week with a dazzling show at the Cartier Foundation",
      "PARIS -- As Paris wilted under the ruthless June sun, Issey Miyake sent out a battalion of intergalactic fashion soldiers at the Cartier Foundation Thursday, shimmering between art and menswear apparel in a spectacle where even the light was a player. The late-morning sun bounced sharply off the art museum's monumental steel pillars, forcing some guests to slide their seats to escape the dazzling reflections \u2014 an impromptu game of musical chairs set to a pulsing, kinetic soundtrack.",
      "This Paris Fashion Week season finds the Miyake house in the midst of transition. In January, Paris bid adieu to Homme Pliss\u00e9 \u2014 Miyake\u2019s pleated cult favorite that had anchored the city\u2019s menswear calendar since 2019 \u2014 as the brand shifted its focus to nomadic shows, most recently appearing under the Tuscan sun. The torch in Paris has now been passed to IM Men, the last line personally conceived by Issey Miyake before his death in 2022. Thursday\u2019s show marked IM Men\u2019s return to the Paris stage, under the direction of designers Sen Kawahara, Yuki Itakura, and Nobutaka Kobayashi.",
      "The theme, \u201cDancing Texture,\u201d nodded to the ceramic artistry of Shoji Kamoda, but also to the surreal choreography on display. Models appeared to roll, tilt, and swing through the light, their movements somewhere between ballet and a slow-motion video game. Occasionally, a guest would squint, unsure if they were watching a runway show or a heat-induced hallucination.",
      "The crowd \u2014 equal parts Parisian cool, visiting editors, and those for whom a pleated culotte is a spiritual calling \u2014 dodged the sun's glare and fanned themselves in the heat, shifting for both comfort and the best sightline. The first model glided out in a mad, angular hat, setting the tone for a parade of tin man-meets-space ninja silhouettes designed for dance floors or distant planets.",
      "The clothes themselves looked as if they had been engineered for a new climate \u2014 or perhaps a new species. Surfaces peeled, rippled, and shimmered, metallic foils flashed against the sun, and jacquard weaves evoked the carved waves of Kamoda\u2019s ceramics. Vermilion and white motifs burst forth alongside a near-neon green, courtesy of upcycled fishing nets. A coat unzipped into a dramatic collar while some blousons and pants, when laid flat, formed perfect circles \u2014 a wink at Kamoda\u2019s wheel-thrown plates.",
      "Miyake, who died in 2022, loomed large over the collection, his vision unmistakable in every engineered pleat and playful transformation. IM Men is the last line he conceived \u2014 a living laboratory for innovation, risk, and occasional absurdity, now energetically interpreted by a younger team. Even in his absence, his legacy is alive in every joke, fold, and jolt of surprise on the runway.",
      "Born in Hiroshima in 1938, Miyake rose from postwar Japan to become a global force, transforming fashion in the 1980s and \u201990s with his radical, sculptural vision. He pioneered heat-set pleating and created lines like Pleats Please and A-POC that blurred the boundaries between art, science, and daily life. Miyake\u2019s designs liberated fabric, allowing it to move with the body and imagination alike.",
      "Of course, the fashion house\u2019s embrace of the avant-garde still courts danger. Thursday's spectacle occasionally veered into excess, with kinetic art and sci-fi headgear that threatened to upstage the clothes themselves \u2014 a familiar Miyake risk. But the best moments, like a pared-back tangerine overcoat that floated past, proved restraint can sometimes steal the show.",

      "Channel 156 has been SiriusXM Fight Nation, which has carried pro wrestling, MMA and boxing shows.",
      "\u201cI couldn\u2019t be more excited,\u201d said Dave LaGreca, the longtime host of \u201cBusted Open,\u201d which started as a one-hour weekly show in 2009. \u201cI really owe it to our fans. They've really been dedicated and asked for this for years. It's a dream come true to actually see it form. And now, it's about to happen.\u201d",
      "\u201cBusted Open\u201d expanded to five days a week in 2018 before going to six days one year later. It will have a live episode seven days a week from 9 a.m.-noon EDT on the new channel featuring LaGreca with wrestling stars Bully Ray, Mark Henry and Tommy Dreamer.",
      "The show has appealed to fans of both WWE and AEW with video clips of interviews getting plenty of engagement on social media.",

      "\u201cThe great thing is we're not associated with WWE or AEW, so we can give our honest opinion about both products,\u201d said LaGreca, who signed a multi-year extension with SiriusXM. \u201cThe fact that there is a little bit of tension between those two companies and even the fans, it makes it even better for what we\u2019re doing on air. The fact that there are more companies that are succeeding at record-breaking levels is even better for our brand, and the big reason why we\u2019re going 24/7.\u201d",

      "Eva Victor's \u201cSorry, Baby\u201d is one of the more thrilling filmmaking debuts in recent years, writes Associated Press Film Writer Jake Coyle in his review",
      "The first thing to love about writer-director-star Eva Victor\u2019s extraordinary debut \u201cSorry, Baby\u201d is how she, as the young professor Agnes, tries, and fails, to hide a tryst with her neighbor.",
      "Agnes lives in a quaint New England home where her best friend and fellow former grad student Lydie (Naomi Ackie) is visiting. We are just getting to know each of these characters when a knock comes on the door. Gavin (Lucas Hedges) stands outside confused when Lydie answers. Agnes rushes over to act as though he\u2019s mistaken her house for his, and not for the first time.",
      "\u201cGod bless your lost soul,\u201d she says, shooing him away.",
      "The plot of \u201cSorry, Baby\u201d centers around a traumatic experience for Agnes that unfolds in a chapter titled \u201cThe Year With the Bad Thing.\u201d But it would be wrong to define \u201cSorry, Baby\u201d \u2014 or its singular protagonist \u2014 by that \u201cbad thing.\u201d In this remarkably fully formed debut, the moments that matter are the funny and tender ones that persist amid crueler experiences.",
      "Before her script to \u201cSorry, Baby\u201d attracted Barry Jenkins as a producer, Victor did improv and made comic social media videos. And the degree to which she\u2019s effectively channeled her sly sense of humor and full-bodied resistance to cliche makes \u201cSorry, Baby\u201d the immediately apparent revelation of a disarmingly offbeat new voice.",
      "The film unfolds in five chapters from across five years of Agnes\u2019 life, told out of chronology. That, in itself, is a way to place the \u201cbad thing\u201d of \u201cSorry, Baby\u201d in a reshuffled context. Stasis, healing and friendship are more the guiding framework of Victor\u2019s film.",
      "The opening tenor of \u201cSorry, Baby\u201d is, in a way, the prevailing one. Agnes and Lydie (a terrific Ackie) are best pals whose jokey chemistry is as natural as their protectiveness of each other. At a dinner with their former literature grad students, Lydie clasps Agnes\u2019 hand under the table at the mention of their former thesis adviser.",
      "In the second chapter, the \u201cbad thing\u201d one, we find out why. In an unnamed New England liberal arts school, their professor, Preston Decker (Louis Cancelmi), is charming and perceptive. He recognizes Agnes\u2019 intelligence and seems to respect her \u2014 which makes his betrayal all the more shattering. When the location of one of their meetings shifts last-minute to his home, Victor\u2019s camera waits outside while day turns to night. Only when Agnes exits, ashen and horrified, do we pick back up with her as she gets in the car and drives.",
      "In the aftermath, the trauma of the rape spills out of Agnes in unpredictable ways and at unexpected moments. With Lydie. Visiting a doctor. At jury duty. With a stray cat. These encounters \u2014 some heartwarming, some insensitive \u2014 are both Agnes\u2019 way of awkwardly processing what she went through and the movie\u2019s way of accentuating how people around you, friend or stranger, have a choice of empathy. Most movingly, in the chapter \u201cThe Year With the Good Sandwich,\u201d John Carroll Lynch plays a man who finds her having a panic attack, and sweetly sits down with her in a parking lot.",
      "Agnes doesn\u2019t process her experience the way a movie character might be expected to \u2014 with, say, revenge or sudden catharsis. Hers is a sporadic, often absurd healing that includes turning up at her neighbor\u2019s house to borrow some lighter fluid. Lydie is key. This is in many ways a portrait of a friendship, and a particularly lived-in one at that. What it\u2019s not so much is a story about sexual assault. Just as Agnes is sarcastically and self-deprecatingly resistant to convention, Victor\u2019s film sidesteps the definitions that usually accompany such a story. Originality becomes a kind of survival.",
      "\"Sorry, Baby,\u201d an A24 release is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for sexual content and language. Running time: 104 minutes. Three and a half stars out of four.",

      "The sequel to the horror-comedy hit \u201cM3GAN\u201d takes a bold turn into action territory",
      "If you want to know how big an upgrade the \u201cM3GAN\u201d sequel has on the original, look no further than the very first scene. \u201cM3GAN\u201d was mostly set in a Seattle house, but \u201cM3GAN 2.0\u201d starts at the Turkish-Iranian border \u2014 with a murderous rampage in a secret military installation and the presence of Saudi intelligence, with U.S. Defense Department officials covertly watching.",
      "Two hours later, it's not clear if this is really an upgrade.",
      "Most of the same team that gave us the refreshing horror-comedy original two years ago have not only gone super-big, but also changed the franchise's genre, turning \u201cM3GAN 2.0\u201d into an action movie with two AI robots, two villains, FBI units, wingsuits, neural implants, a \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d-style vault heist, exosuits, a 250-mph street chase in a supercar, a power grid disaster, a countdown clock, the United Nations and the fate of the planet at stake.",
      "If the evil doll M3gan in the first movie was responsible for the deaths of four humans and one dog, this time the screen is littered with the corpses of shootings, decapitations, severed limbs and laser slayings. There are double-crosses, impalings, blood splatter, cattle prods, tactical military soldiers, self-destruct sequences and insane close-combat martial arts. You can be forgiven for expecting a Tom Cruise appearance.",
      "What you won't get is much of the vibe of the original, which fused horror, cultural commentary and humor. This time, that's muted in favor of an overly ambitious, horribly convoluted plot that sometimes feels like the moviemakers just threw money at the sequel and tried to ape other franchises by going massive. The first had a bedroom feel; the new one starts, like we said, on an international border. The original's $12 million budget has been tripled.",
      "\u201cM3GAN 2.0\u201d owes a lot to \u201cTerminator 2: Judgment Day,\u201d in which the robot killer in the first movie becomes the robot hero of the second. M3gan, it will come as no surprise, wasn't killed at the end of the original. She's just been laying low, waiting for her time to seize the day \u2014 and dance. Now she is reborn to fight another, better AI robot, played with sinister lethality by Ivanna Sakhno.",
      "\u201cM3GAN\u201d arrived in 2023 just as AI technology like ChatGPT was beginning to go mainstream. Director and screenwriter Gerard Johnstone turns Allison Williams \u2014 who plays M3gan's creator, Gemma \u2014 into a high-profile author and advocate for government oversight of artificial intelligence as the sequel opens. One of the more intriguing questions the movie explores is if parents are gradually outsourcing their responsibilities to technology.",
      "Her niece Cady \u2014 the fabulous Violet McGraw \u2014 is now a budding computer programmer and rebellious. She has learned aikido and has a strong affinity for Steven Seagal, a running gag. Her protection is still the single focus of M3gan, who has apparently been in cloud networks between movies.",

      "Country singer Parker McCollum will release his fifth studio album on Friday",
      "NEW YORK -- Imagine you come from a small town in Texas and you have big dreams of being a country music star. Imagine those aspirations come true, tenfold: You win a couple Academy of Country Music Awards, a CMT Music Award and you have a couple platinum singles to your name. What's next?",
      "If you're Parker McCollum, it's new challenges. Surpassing his wildest expectations meant reveling in the carte blanche that follows \u2014 the freedom to do whatever you want. For the 33-year-old singer, that's the release of his fifth full-length project, a self-titled album out Friday.",
      "\u201cI would hang my hat on this record seven days a week,\u201d he says of the album. \u201cIt's just the most focused I've ever been.\u201d",
      "He's self-assured now, but the road to \u201cParker McCollum,\u201d the album, wasn't so steady. He originally recorded half a full-length with his longtime collaborator, producer Jon Randall. It wasn't working. \u201cI was comfortable,\u201d McCollum says. \u201cI was like, \u2018I gotta go get as uncomfortable as I can.\u201d\u2019",
      "So, he scrapped what he had, went to New York, worked with a new producer, Frank Liddell (Miranda Lambert, Lee Ann Womack, Chris Knight), and recorded what became the final album in a week.",
      "\u201cIt sounds absolutely ridiculous when you say it out loud,\u201d McCollum says. \u201cThat\u2019s a crazy way to do it, but I think it worked.\u201d",
      "It helped that McCollum had most of the songs written. \u201cI wrote \u2018Permanent Headphones\u2019 when I was 15. I wrote \u2018My Blue\u2019 in 2019. I wrote a lot of songs last year,\u201d he says. Still, they cut \u201ca couple songs a day.\u201d He credits Liddell for pulling the best songs out of him, as well as New York's industrious energy, for helping him realize the record.",
      "\u201cI'm glowing when I'm there,\u201d he says of the city. \u201cWhen I was in high school dreaming about being on a major label cutting records, you know, 'It\u2019s going to be in New York City and it\u2019s gonna be ... like a movie. And, you know, I just decided to try and actually do that.\u201d",
      "The album possesses that vigor, from the slow-building, John Mayer-esq. \u201cNew York Is On Fire\u201d to more country-and-then-some fare: \u201cSolid Country Gold,\u201d \u201cSunny Days,\u201d and \u201cWhat Kinda Man.\u201d",
      "There's also a spirited cover of Danny O\u2019Keefe's folk classic \u201cGood Time Charlie\u2019s Got The Blues\u201d with fellow Texan singer Cody Johnson, the album's sole feature. \u201cI've played that song my entire life,\u201d McCollum says.",
      "He thought, \u201cThat song is going to be cut at some point or another in my career. Might as well make it now.\u201d",
      "The narrative opener \u201cMy Blue\u201d was the first song McCollum and Liddell recorded in the studio, and it was \u201ca breeze,\u201d as McCollum describes it, \"And the worst thing happened that could have possibly happened.\u201d They thought the rest of the process would be effortless, but that's not how it goes. \u201cIt was just an absolute emotional grind for the next six and a half days. But I wouldn\u2019t have it any other way.\u201d",
      "That led to experimentation, too. \u201cI\u2019ve always wanted to be a country singer. And the more that I listen to what I do, I\u2019m like, \u2018This doesn\u2019t really sound like country music to me,\u2019 which is hard to put your thumb on nowadays, of course, what country music really is. It\u2019s just not as narrow as it used to be. But I\u2019m like, I just don\u2019t really even care anymore. You know, maybe I\u2019m not a country singer. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t give a (expletive) anymore. Whatever it is that I do sound like, you know, that\u2019s what I wanna do.\u201d",
      "As long as the songs \u201cmake you feel something.\u201d",
      "That's something fans have long connected to, since the release of his debut, \u201cThe Limestone Kid,\u201d a decade ago.",
      "\u201cIt really eats at me to put out music that hits you where music hits me,\u201d he says. \u201cI really enjoy that chase and that journey of, \u2018Am I going to write songs that are good enough?\u2019 ... I\u2019m trying to find those answers.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Venetian activists say they are planning a boisterous but peaceful protest during this weekend's wedding between multi-billionaire Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez in Venice",
      "VENICE, Italy -- This weekend's star-studded Venice wedding of multi-billionaire Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez has galvanized activist groups that are protesting it as a sign of the growing disparity between the haves and have-nots as well as disregard of the city's residents.",
      "About a dozen Venetian organizations \u2014 including housing advocates, anti-cruise ship campaigners and university groups \u2014 have united to protest the multi-day event under the banner \u201cNo Space for Bezos,\u201d a play on words also referring to the bride\u2019s recent space flight.",
      "They have staged small-scale protests, unfurling anti-Bezos banners on iconic Venetian sites. They were joined this week by Greenpeace and the British group \u201cEveryone Hates Elon,\u201d which has smashed Teslas to protest Elon Musk, to unfurl a giant banner in St. Mark\u2019s Square protesting purported tax breaks for billionaires.",
      "\u201cIF YOU CAN RENT VENICE FOR YOUR WEDDING YOU CAN PAY MORE TAX,\u201d read the banner, which featured a huge image of Bezos. Police quickly took it away.",
      "There has been no comment from Bezos\u2019 representatives on the protests.",
      "The local activists had planned a more organized protest for Saturday, aiming to obstruct access to canals with boats to prevent guests from reaching a wedding venue. Then they modified the protest to a march from the train station after claiming a victory, asserting that their pressure forced organizers to change the venue to the Arsenale, a more easily secured site beyond Venice's congested center.",
      "\u201cIt will be a strong, decisive protest, but peaceful,\u2019\u2019 said Federica Toninello, an activist with the Social Housing Assembly network. \u201cWe want it to be like a party, with music, to make clear what we want our Venice to look like.\"",
      "Among the 200 guests confirmed to be attending the wedding are Mick Jagger, Ivanka Trump, Oprah Winfrey, Katy Perry and Leonardo DiCaprio.",
      "Venice, renowned for its romantic canal vistas, hosts hundreds of weddings each year, not infrequently those of the rich and famous. Previous celebrity weddings, like that of George Clooney to human rights lawyer Amal Alamuddin in 2014, were embraced by the public. Hundreds turned out to wish the couple well at City Hall.",
      "Bezos has a different political and business profile, said Tommaso Cacciari, a prominent figure in the movement that successfully pushed for a ban on cruise ships over 25,000 tons traveling through the Giudecca Canal in central Venice.",
      "\u201cBezos is not a Hollywood actor,\u2019\u2019 Cacciari said. \u201cHe is an ultra-billionaire who sat next to Donald Trump during the inauguration, who contributed to his re-election and is contributing in a direct and heavy way to this new global obscurantism.\u2019\u2019",
      "Critics also cite Amazon\u2019s labor practices, ongoing tax disputes with European governments and Bezos\u2019 political associations as additional reasons for concern.",
      "Activists also argue that the Bezos wedding exemplifies broader failures in municipal governance, particularly the prioritization of tourism over residents' needs. They cite measures such as the day-tripper tax \u2014 which critics argue reinforces Venice\u2019s image as a theme park \u2014 as ineffective. Chief among their concerns is the lack of investment in affordable housing and essential services.",
      "City officials have defended the wedding. Mayor Luigi Brugnaro called the event an honor for Venice, and the city denied the wedding would cause disruptions.",
      "\"Venice once again reveals itself to be a global stage,\u2019\u2019 Brugnaro told The Associated Press, adding he hoped to meet Bezos while he was in town.",
      "Meanwhile, a Venetian environmental research association, Corila, issued a statement saying Bezos\u2019 Earth Fund was supporting its work with an \u201cimportant donation.\u201d",
      "Corila, which unites university scholars and Italy\u2019s main national research council in researching Venetian protection strategies, wouldn\u2019t say how much Bezos was donating but said contact began in April, well before the protests started.",

      "The birds scattered in every direction as the first drumbeat thundered across the plaza outside Paris\u2019s Centre Pompidou, heralding the start of Pharrell Williams\u2019 latest Louis Vuitton spectacle",
      "PARIS -- The birds scattered in every direction as the first drumbeat thundered across the plaza outside Paris\u2019 Pompidou Center Tuesday, clearing the way for a different kind of flight: Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z swept into the front row.",
      "The star couple anchored a guest list at Pharrell Williams\u2019 latest Louis Vuitton spectacle that doubled as a map of contemporary culture now: Bradley Cooper, J-Hope, Karol G, Pinkpanthress, Future, Pusha T, Jackson Wang, Bambam, Mason Thames, Miles Caton, D\u2019Pharaoh Woon-A-Tai, Malcolm Washington, Jalen Ramsey, and A$AP Nast. If there was any question about the gravitational pull of Louis Vuitton under Williams, it evaporated before the first look hit the runway.",
      "This was no ordinary catwalk: Williams \u2014 half showman, half pop impresario \u2014 staged a cultural passage from Paris to Mumbai, fusing Indian tradition and modern dandyism into a punchy, sunstruck vision of the Vuitton man in 2026.",
      "In Vuitton\u2019s world, a show is never just a show. It\u2019s a takeover, a mood. On Tuesday, the Pompidou\u2019s iconic colored pipes served as a sci-fi backdrop for a set dreamed up with Studio Mumbai architect Bijoy Jain: a lifesize \u201cSnakes and Ladders\u201d board, alluding to both the child\u2019s game and the adult risks of fashion\u2019s global game. For Williams, the house\u2019s mantra of travel is less about destination, more about movemen. Up, down, sideways, sunward.",
      "The clothes? This season, they marched to their own drumbeat. Out came models in Indian-style chunky sandals, striped boxy shorts and blue preppy shirts with sleeves billowing like monsoon sails. Silken cargo pants shimmered in the sun; pin-striped puffers added a louche, almost Bollywood-kitsch edge. Cricket jerseys appeared with jeweled collars or \u2014 why not? \u2014 a puffy hood dripping with rhinestones. Blue pearlescent leather bombers flirted with the bling of Mumbai\u2019s film sets, while pin-striped tailoring riffed on both the British Raj and Parisian boulevardiers.",
      "If all this felt like cultural collision, that\u2019s by design. Williams\u2019 Vuitton has become a mood board for global wanderlust: the checked silks, the mismatched stripes, the trompe l\u2019oeil fabrics that look sun-faded by actual adventures. It\u2019s a nod to the itinerant dandyism that\u2019s fast becoming his Vuitton calling card. Less about nostalgia, more about now.",
      "But don\u2019t mistake the globe-trotting optimism for naivety. There\u2019s calculation in the chaos. Williams\u2019 references bounce from Kenzo \u2019s Nigo (his onetime collaborator) to Indian contemporary artisans \u2014 like the hand-beaded snakes slithering across shirts, or the sandalwood-scented linens that recall a summer in Rajasthan. The \u201cworldwide community\u201d Vuitton preaches is real, but it\u2019s also realpolitik: What could be more luxurious in 2025 than clothing that tries to please everyone and everywhere, without losing itself?",
      "Of course, with Vuitton, the accessories make the man and this season\u2019s bags, bejeweled sandals and hardware-heavy necklaces delivered the requisite Instagram bait, each a covetable passport stamp in leather or gold. It\u2019s maximalism, sure, but not just for the TikTok set: the craftsmanship, from sun-bleached cloth to hand-loomed stripes, rewards anyone who bothers to look twice.",
      "If there\u2019s a criticism, it\u2019s that sometimes the noise of references threatens to drown out the signal. Williams piles motif on motif, color on color, joy on joy, until coherence blurs into sheer, Dionysian energy. But maybe that\u2019s the point: In a season of global anxiety the Vuitton man chooses to strut, sparkle, and swerve.",
      "LVMH, the world\u2019s largest luxury group, posted record revenue of 84.7 billion euros in 2024, with its Fashion & Leather Goods division anchored by Louis Vuitton still leading the pack. With a market value near $455 billion and over 6,300 stores worldwide, Vuitton remains the world\u2019s most valuable luxury brand. Even with a recent dip in sales, its scale and influence are unmatched.",
      "As the last look circled the Pompidou and the birds resettled, Vuitton\u2019s odyssey felt less like a fashion show and more like an announcement: the world is a game board, the ladders are real, and Louis Vuitton is still rolling the dice.",

      "Former teen idol Bobby Sherman has died at 81",
      "Bobby Sherman, whose winsome smile and fashionable shaggy mop top helped make him into a teen idol in the 1960s and \u201970s with bubblegum pop hits like \u201cLittle Woman\u201d and \u201cJulie, Do Ya Love Me,\u201d has died. He was 81.",
      "His wife, Brigitte Poublon, announced the death Tuesday and family friend John Stamos posted her message on Instagram: \u201cBobby left this world holding my hand \u2014 just as he held up our life with love, courage, and unwavering grace.\u201d Sherman revealed he had Stage 4 cancer earlier this year.",
      "Sherman was a squeaky-clean regular on the covers of Tiger Beat and Sixteen magazines, often with hair over his eyes and a choker on his neck. His face was printed on lunchboxes, cereal boxes and posters that hung on the bedroom walls of his adoring fans. He landed at No. 8 in TV Guide\u2019s list of \u201cTV\u2019s 25 Greatest Teen Idols.\u201d",
      "He was part of a lineage of teen heartthrobs who emerged as mass-market, youth-oriented magazines and TV took off, connecting fresh-scrubbed Ricky Nelson in the 1950s to David Cassidy in the \u201960s, all the way to Justin Bieber in the 2000s.",
      "Sherman had four Top 10 hits on the Billboard Hot 100 chart \u2014 \u201cLittle Woman,\u201d \u201cJulie, Do Ya Love Me,\u201d \u201cEasy Come, Easy Go,\u201d and \u201cLa La La (If I Had You).\u201d He had six albums on the Billboard 200 chart, including \u201cHere Comes Bobby,\u201d which spent 48 weeks on the album chart, peaking at No. 10. His career got its jump start when he was cast in the ABC rock \u2019n\u2019 roll show \u201cShindig!\u201d in the mid-\u201960s. Later, he starred in two television series \u2014 \u201cHere Come the Brides\u201d (1968-70) and \u201cGetting Together\u201d (1971).",
      "After the limelight moved on, Sherman became a certified medical emergency technician and instructor for the Los Angeles Police Department, teaching police recruits first aid and CPR. He donated his salary.",
      "\u201cA lot of times, people say, \u2018Well, if you could go back and change things, what would you do?\u2019\u201d he told The Tulsa World in 1997. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think I\u2019d change a thing \u2014 except to maybe be a little bit more aware of it, because I probably could\u2019ve relished the fun of it a little more. It was a lot of work. It was a lot of blood, sweat and tears. But it was the best of times.\u201d",
      "Sherman, with sky blue eyes and dimples, grew up in the San Fernando Valley, singing Ricky Nelson songs and performing with a high-school rock band.",
      "\u201cI was brought up in a fairly strict family,\u201d he told the Sunday News newspaper in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, in 1998. \u201cLaw and order were important. Respect your fellow neighbor, remember other people\u2019s feelings. I was the kind of boy who didn\u2019t do things just to be mischievous.\u201d",
      "He was studying child psychology at a community college in 1964 when his girlfriend took him to a Hollywood party, which would change his life. He stepped onstage and sang with the band. Afterward, guests Jane Fonda, Natalie Wood and Sal Mineo asked him who his agent was. They took his number and, a few days later, an agent called him and set him up with \u201cShindig!\u201d",
      "Sherman hit true teen idol status in 1968, when he appeared in \u201cHere Come the Brides,\u201d a comedy-adventure set in boom town Seattle in the 1870s. He sang the show\u2019s theme song, \u201cSeattle,\u201d and starred as young logger Jeremy Bolt, often at loggerheads with brother, played by David Soul. It lasted two seasons.",
      "Following the series, Sherman starred in \u201cGetting Together,\u201d a spinoff of \u201cThe Partridge Family,\u201d about a songwriter struggling to make it in the music business. He became the first performer to star in three TV series before the age of 30. That television exposure soon translated into a fruitful recording career: His first single, \u201cLittle Woman,\u201d earned a gold record in 1969.",
      "\u201cWhile the rest of the world seemed jumbled up and threatening, Sherman\u2019s smiling visage beamed from the bedroom walls of hundreds of thousands of teen-age girls, a reassuring totem against the riots, drugs, war protests and free love that raged outside,\u201d The Tulsa World said in 1997.",
      "His movies included \u201cWild In Streets,\u201d \u201cHe is My Brother\u201d and \u201cGet Crazy.\u201d",
      "Sherman pulled back from his celebrity career after several years of a frantic schedule, telling The Washington Post: \u201cI\u2019d film five days a week, get on a plane on a Friday night and go someplace for matinee and evening shows Saturday and Sunday, then get on a plane and go back to the studio to start filming again. It was so hectic for three years that I didn\u2019t know what home was.\u201d",
      "Sherman\u2019s pivot to becoming an emergency medical technician in 1988 was born out of a longtime fascination with medicine. Sherman said that affinity blossomed when he raised his sons with his first wife, Patti Carnel. They would get scrapes and bloody noses and he became the family\u2019s first-aid provider. So he started learning basic first aid and cardiopulmonary resuscitation from the Red Cross.",
      "\u201cIf I see an accident, I feel compelled to stop and give aid even if I\u2019m in my own car,\u201d he told the St. Petersburg Times. \u201cI carry equipment with me. And there\u2019s not a better feeling than the one you get from helping somebody out. I would recommend it to everybody.\u201d",
      "In addition to his work with the Los Angeles Police Department, he was a reserve deputy with the San Bernardino County Sheriff\u2019s Department, working security at the courthouse. Sherman estimated that, as a paramedic, he helped five women deliver babies in the backseats of cars or other impromptu locations.",
      "In one case, he helped deliver a baby on the sidewalk and, after the birth, the new mother asked Sherman\u2019s partner what his name was. \u201cWhen he told her Bobby, she named the baby Roberta. I was glad he didn\u2019t tell her my name was Sherman,\u201d he told the St. Petersburg Times in 1997.",
      "He was named LAPD\u2019s Reserve Officer of the Year for 1999 and received the FBI\u2019s Exceptional Service Award and the \u201cTwice a Citizen\u201d Award by the Los Angeles County Reserve Foundation.",
      "In a speech on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives in 2004, then-Rep.

      "Actor Damson Idris' career is about to hit turbo speed",
      "Damson Idris was trying to tune out the noise, but that's a little difficult at a Formula One race.",
      "The British-Nigerian actor was in the zone, in character, filming the high-octane summer movie \u201cF1\u201d with Brad Pitt at some of the world\u2019s most famous racetracks. While Idris\u2019 profile has been rising in recent years, after six seasons starring in the FX series \u201cSnowfall,\u201d there\u2019s nothing like being next to globally famous Formula One drivers and a Hollywood megastar to put things into perspective. He was pretty sure he was going to coast under the radar.",
      "Then he started hearing not just his own name from fans in the crowd but \u201cFranklin Saint,\u201d too, the name of his drug kingpin character on \u201cSnowfall.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s funny, because I see myself as a young actor who nobody knows,\u201d Idris, 33, said in a recent interview with The Associated Press.",
      "Anonymity may already be a thing of the past for Idris, though. In May, he made a splash at the Met Gala, arriving in a full racing suit (branded with \u201cF1\u2019s\u201d fictional team name APXGP) and a Swarovski crystal-studded helmet that he and two ushers removed to reveal a second look underneath. The boldness and theatricality of the stunt made it one of the most talked about moments at an event where everyone is trying to stand out.",
      "And things are poised to rev up even more when \u201cF1\u201d opens globally Friday. Speeding into theaters on a wave of great reviews and the promise of a \u201cTop Gun: Maverick\u201d-style spectacle, filmmaker Joseph Kosinski is pretty sure Idris is going to start hearing people shout \u201cJoshua Pearce\u201d at him too.",
      "That's the name of Idris' character, the hotshot rookie driver of the worst team on the circuit who's desperate to prove himself and hang on to one of the coveted seats.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m very excited for people to see him own this character and go toe to toe with a giant movie star,\u201d Kosinski said. \u201cI think he can do anything. He\u2019s just super talented, and I feel like I\u2019m lucky to see him at the beginning of what\u2019s going to be a pretty stratospheric launch.\u201d",
      "Idris tries to seek out projects that challenge him and characters who are as different as possible \u2014 from each other and, especially, from him. Joshua Pearce fit the bill in a moment when he was preparing to say goodbye to Franklin Saint. After he read the \u201cF1\u201d script, the character even infiltrated his dreams.",
      "\u201cI said to myself, \u2018Man, no one\u2019s going to be able to play this part like I will.\u2019 I remember writing Joe (Kosinski) a letter and telling him that,\u201d Idris said. \u201cWhen we finally jumped in the cars for the first time, I was hooked. I was like, \u2018Yep this movie\u2019s mine. It\u2019s no one else\u2019s and I can\u2019t wait to give my all to it.\u2019 And that\u2019s exactly what I did.\u201d",
      "\u201cF1\u201d wouldn\u2019t just require playing a part. Both he and Pitt had to learn how to drive the cars at speeds of up to 180 mph. It took months of training behind the wheel the supervision of stunt drivers Luciano Bacheta and Craig Dolby, as well as physical training to adapt to the G-forces they\u2019d feel in the car.",
      "When it came time to film, which they did with special cameras attached to the cars, sometimes they were driving during breaks at real races with hundreds of thousands of spectators around. Every time you see Idris' or Pitt\u2019s face in the car, Kosinski said, they\u2019re really driving that car.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s so insane. It\u2019s actually quicker in real life and it looks really fast on the screen,\u201d Idris said. \u201cIn a split second, a decision could be really detrimental. But I couldn\u2019t imagine doing this movie any other way. If it was on green screen, you\u2019d be able to tell.\u201d",
      "There\u2019s a bit of art-meets-life symmetry wrapped up in \u201cF1,\u201d in which an up-and-comer teams up with a veteran. In the film, it\u2019s a reluctant pairing of two alphas. The mentorship is fraught, the lessons are hard-earned and the competition is not exactly friendly. Unlike Joshua, Idris is more than willing to get advice from those around him, whether it\u2019s producers like Jerry Bruckheimer and Jeremy Kleiner, his director Kosinski, or his co-stars, from Pitt to Javier Bardem.",
      "\u201cI speak to them every day and I ask for advice,\u201d he said. \u201cThe main focus is on stories, playing characters that I can be proud of and range. That\u2019s everything I\u2019m setting out to do in this career.\u201d",
      "Acting was not always the goal for Idris. Like many kids in South London, he once dreamed of being a soccer player. Sure, the idea of being a renowned athlete held some appeal, but he also loved the sheer discipline it required. Then, at age 18, he realized he\u2019d never be as great as Lionel Messi.",
      "\u201cWhen I see him one day, hopefully I\u2019m blessed to meet him, I\u2019m going to tell him that he\u2019s the reason why I quit football, because he was so good,\u201d he said. \u201cWonderfully, acting is a subjective industry, so I can at least cheat my way into working with Brad Pitt.\u201d",
      "Cheating is, of course, a bit of cheeky hyperbole for an actor who studied drama at university and continued training at London's Identity School of Acting afterward. Since he made his stage debut in Ade Solanke\u2019s \u201cPandora\u2019s Box\u201d over 10 years ago, Idris has been hitting the pavement like the rest of his peers. And he\u2019s just getting started.",
      "Idris recently wrapped filming the Tomi Adeyemi adaptation \u201cChildren of Bone and Blood\u201d in Cape Town, South Africa. Directed by Gina Prince-Bythewood, Idris plays Prince Inan in the African fantasy that co-stars Viola Davis, Cynthia Erivo, Chiwetel Ejiofor and Idris' idol and real-life mentor Idris Elba.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not just a namesake,\u201d Idris said. \u201cI feel so blessed to be able to say that I\u2019m like his little brother and I can call him and get advice.\u201d",
      "Next up, Idris will prepare to portray Miles Davis in Bill Pohlad\u2019s \u201cMiles & Juliette,\u201d about the jazz legend\u2019s romance with French singer Juliette Gr\u00e9co. He's also founded a fine jewelry line, named Didris, inspired by his mother, and is getting into producing as well \u2014 his production company has a deal with FX Networks and wants to make opportunities for emerging talents.",
      "And like his character in \u201cF1,\u201d Idris is learning to block out the noise. He knows that a film career is a long journey and there will be ups and downs.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a huge moment, but I\u2019m fortunate to have so many people in my life that keep me grounded,\u201d Idris said. \u201cI\u2019ve soaked in information from people I admire who say the same thing during these higher moments: Pinch yourself, stay grounded, remember where you came from.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s exactly how I\u2019m walking through this portal and into these next couple of years. I\u2019m excited, I\u2019m humbled, I am blessed and I can\u2019t wait to see what the future brings.\u201d",

      "Mick Ralphs, the singer, songwriter, guitarist and founding member of the classic British rock bands Bad Company and Mott the Hoople, has died",
      "Mick Ralphs, a guitarist, singer, songwriter and founding member of the classic British rock bands Bad Company and Mott the Hoople, has died.",
      "A statement posted to Bad Company's official website Monday announced Ralphs' death at age 81. Ralphs had a stroke days after what would be his final performance with the band at London's O2 Arena in 2016, and had been bedridden ever since, the statement said. No further details on the circumstances of his death were provided.",
      "Ralphs is set to become a member of the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Bad Company in November.",
      "\u201cOur Mick has passed, my heart just hit the ground,\" Bad Company singer Paul Rodgers said in a statement. \u201cHe has left us with exceptional songs and memories. He was my friend, my songwriting partner, an amazing and versatile guitarist who had the greatest sense of humour.\u201d",
      "Ralphs wrote the 1970's song \u201cReady for Love\u201d for Mott the Hoople, later revamped for Bad Company's 1974 debut album, which also included the Ralphs-penned hit \u201cCan't Get Enough.\u201d He co-wrote Bad Company's 1975 classic \u201cFeel Like Makin' Love\u201d with Rodgers.",
      "Born in Stoke Lacy, Herefordshire, England, Ralphs began playing blues guitar as a teenager, and in his early 20s in 1966, he co-founded the Doc Thomas Group. In 1969, the band would become Mott the Hoople, a name taken from the title and title character of a 1966 novel by Willard Manus.",
      "The group's self-titled first album, recorded in a week, won a cult following, but the two that followed were critical and financial flops. They finally found popular success and became glam-rock giants with the 1972 David Bowie-penned-and-produced song \u201cAll the Young Dudes.\" But Ralphs felt creatively cramped in the band led by singer-songwriter Ian Hunter and left in 1973.",
      "He would soon form Bad Company with Rodgers, a singer who had left his own band, Free.",
      "The two had intended only to write songs together, and possibly to make a one-off album as a project. But when Free drummer Simon Kirke asked to sit in, they realized they were nearly a proper group already and went seeking a bassist. They found him in former King Crimson member Boz Burrell.",
      "\u201cWe didn't actually plan to have a band,\u201d Ralphs said in a 2015 interview with Gibson Guitars. \u201cIt was all kind of accidental I suppose. Lucky, really.\u201d",
      "Kirke said in a statement Monday that Ralphs was \u201ca dear friend, a wonderful songwriter, and an exceptional guitarist. We will miss him deeply.\"",
      "Bad Company found immediate success. its albums were full of radio-ready anthems, and its live sound was perfectly suited to the 1970s height of arena rock.",
      "Their self-titled debut album went to No. 1 on Billboard's album chart. And Ralphs' \u201cCan't Get Enough\u201d \u2014 often mistakenly called \u201cCan\u2019t Get Enough of Your Love\u201d because of its chorus lyrics \u2014 would be their biggest hit single, peaking at No. 5 on the Billboard Hot 100.",
      "\u201cWe actually did the whole thing in one take live,\u201d Ralphs said in the Gibson interview. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t perfect, but we just said, \u2018Yeah, that\u2019s great, it\u2019s going to capture the moment.\u2019 That\u2019s what I like to do in recording. It doesn\u2019t have to be perfect as long as it captures the moment. That\u2019s what it\u2019s all about.\u201d",
      "Bad Company's 1975 follow-up, \u201cStraight Shooter,\u201d was also a hit, going to No. 3 on album charts in both the Billboard Hot 100 in the U.S. and the UK Albums Chart.",
      "Its opening track, \u201cGood Lovin' Gone Bad,\u201d written by Ralphs, was a modest hit, and the song that followed it, \u201cFeel Like Makin' Love,\u201d was a big one that would remain in rotation on classic rock radio for decades.",
      "The band's statement says Ralphs is survived by \u201cthe love of his life,\u201d his wife Susie Chavasse, along with two children, three step-children and \u201cbeloved bandmates\u201d Rodgers and Kirke.",
      "\u201cOur last conversation a few days ago we shared a laugh,\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cBut it won\u2019t be our last.\u201d",

      "MILAN -- Giorgio Armani\u2019s menswear collection for the next warm weather season encoded the geography of summer in textures, geometrical designs and his signature relaxed silhouettes.",
      "The 90-year-old designer skipped the runway preview show closing Milan Fashion Week on Monday to recover from an undisclosed condition, but his fashion house said he kept a hand in the designs and watched the runway show on livestream.",
      "It was the first time in his career that the designer was absent.",
      "Taking the closing bow in his stead was Armani\u2019s longtime head of menswear, Leo Dell\u2019Orco, who has worked alongside Armani for 45 of the Giorgio Armani fashion house\u2019s 50 years.",
      "\u201cHe liked it,\u2019\u2019 Dell\u2019Orco told reporters after the show, adding that Armani was especially happy to see that he had sent male-female couples down the mostly menswear runway in matching looks, underlining their versatility.",
      "The collection was classic Armani: roomy wide pleated trousers paired with a seemingly endless array of softly constructed jackets, from a double-breasted made casual with shawl collars to shirt-weight leather coats. Vests with a deep-V front substituted for shirts, for looks that transition from work to leisure.",
      "The collection found balance in the melding of textures \u2013 raw linen, woven leather, soft suede and flowing silk. From a distance, ensembles may have appeared monochromatic, but a closer look revealed a harmonious blending of seemingly mismatched geometrical patterns and textures, adding depth to the looks.",
      "There was a touch of the exotic in the shapes, like Nehru collar, tunics or a kimono jacket, reflecting Armani\u2019s love of travel, without overwhelming the mood.",
      "Delicate decorative pins reflected the light, the sole adornment. Beachy touches included rope sandals and belts, which cinched through a loop.",
      "The showroom was awash in Mediterranean blue and featured installations of obsidian black stones, reflecting the sophisticated color palette that included washed-out desert shades, the palest green, deep blues and urban blacks and gray.",
      "Front-row guests included actors Giancarlo Esposito, who most recently appeared in \u201cCaptain America: Brave New World,\u2019\u2019 and Jason Isaacs, who was in the third season of \u201cWhite Lotus.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- Twenty-five years ago, a little girl with a bob haircut appeared on our TVs, speaking a mix of English and Spanish, with a spunky, can-do spirit. She had an adventure planned, a backpack, a monkey friend and upbeat songs.",
      "\u201cHi, I\u2019m Dora. What\u2019s your name?\u201d she asked.",
      "This was, of course, \u201cDora the Explorer,\u201d the first Latina to lead a major cartoon series and the girl who helped spearhead the rise of multicultural children\u2019s programming in the U.S. on her way to becoming a cultural phenomenon.",
      "\u201cThe show allowed Latinos to be depicted on TV as educators, teaching viewers how to speak our language, and yet at the same time, just teaching ordinary things that children need to learn,\u201d said Brenda Victoria Castillo, president and CEO of the National Hispanic Media Coalition.",
      "Nickelodeon is celebrating Dora\u2019s 25th anniversary with the feature-length live-action movie \u201cDora and the Search of Sol Dorado,\u201d a third season of the rebooted animated series \u201cDora,\u201d the podcast Dora\u2019s Mermaid Adventures, an album of songs and plenty of toys and apparel.",
      "\u201cThe great thing about Dora is that, yes, she celebrates Latin culture through every aspect \u2014 language, food, dress and music,\u201d says Ramsey Naito president of animation at Paramount and Nickelodeon. \u201cBut she also empowers everybody to be their true self and to be brave. She\u2019s not exclusive. She\u2019s inclusive.\u201d",
      "Kathleen Herles had a special vantage point to see Dora's influence: She was the original voice of the pint-size heroine, cast in the role when she was 7 and staying until she was 18 and off to college.",
      "\u201cIt has been the longest journey and the greatest adventure of my life \u2014 no pun intended,\u201d said Herles, who grew up in New York City to parents of Peruvian descent.",
      "On the convention circuit, Herles would see firsthand the power of Dora. \u201cI remember I would make kids cry, not intentionally,\u201d she says. \u201cTheir mind goes to a memory, to a moment, it's just incredible. It\u2019s so special, it\u2019s magical.\u201d",
      "Herles has lately been the voice actor for Dora's mom on \u201cDora,\u201d the reboot that started in 2024. It's a full-circle moment for the actor and singer: \u201cIt changed my life forever, twice.\u201d",
      "\u201cDora the Explorer\u201d led to what Herles laughingly calls the \u201cDora-verse\u201d \u2014 the spinoff series \u201cGo, Diego, Go!,\u201d a sequel series \u201cDora and Friends: Into the City!\u201d and the 2019 live-action feature film \u201cDora and the Lost City of Gold,\u201d starring Isabela Merced, Eva Longoria and Michael Pe\u00f1a.",
      "\u201cDora\u201d co-creator Chris Gifford has watched his creation age up and down and take human form. \u201cShe has been older and she has been younger and she has a hair clip now,\u201d he says. \u201cHer essence, her positive spirit, her I-can-do-anything-with-your-help attitude has stuck through.\u201d",
      "Dora is firmly part of the culture, as big as her Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade balloon. There's a reference to her in \u201cInside Out 2,\u201d she's been mocked on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d and if you look carefully at the PBS show \u201cAlma's Way,\u201d you can see a Dora doll in that heroine's bedroom. TikTok users have embraced the \u201cBackpack Song.\u201d",
      "\u201cThose kids coming of age now \u2014 the ones who 25 years ago were just watching it as little preschoolers \u2014 they\u2019re out there and they\u2019re remembering,\u201d says Valerie Walsh Valdes, co-creator of the original series and an executive producer on the new series and movie.",
      "Valdes and Gifford originally had the idea for a show about a little girl who was a problem solver. Like \u201cBlue's Clues,\u201d it would reward kids for figuring out answers posed by the host.",
      "\u201cPreschoolers are the least powerful people in our world,\u201d says Gifford. \u201cThey're not able to button their sweater and not able to tie their shoes, but if they\u2019re able to help Dora get to the City of Lost Toys and really feel like they helped, that\u2019s something special.\u201d",
      "Nickelodeon suggested the girl be Latina and the creators ran with it, making her pan-Latina so no one would feel excluded. Latin representation on TV \u2014 then and now \u2014 has been a struggle.",
      "The Latino Donor Collaborative\u2019s 2024 Latinos in Media report found that Latino actors made up 9.8% of the main cast in lead, co-lead and ensemble roles in scripted shows. In non-scripted television, Latino hosts made up only 5% of host roles. That\u2019s despite Latin people making up nearly 20% of the country.",
      "\u201cThere were few programs at the time that featured Latina protagonists with Dora\u2019s skin tone or features, so from that perspective, the representation is valuable,\u201d says Erynn Masi de Casanova, head of the Sociology Department at the University of Cincinnati.",
      "Dora was put in an animated world inside a computer, and the creators asked kids to help make the show better. They hired education consultants to tease out the skills Dora teaches, like spatial understanding and interpersonal. They brought in language and culture experts.",
      "\u201cWe did it!\u201d became her signature song.",
      "The series is seen in more than 150 countries and territories and translated in 32 languages on Nickelodeon channels and Paramount+. In English-speaking countries such as the United States and Australia, Dora teaches Spanish; in other markets \u2014 including the Hispanic U.S. markets \u2014 she teaches English.",
      "Samantha Lorraine, 18, who grew up in Miami of Cuban heritage, had the Dora T-shirts and backpack. She laughs that she once even had the Dora bob.",
      "In July, she's starring as Dora in \u201cDora and the Search of Sol Dorado,\u201d which was filmed in Colombia. \u201cI\u2019ve been doing my audition since day one,\u201d she says.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an honor to be stepping into Dora\u2019s shoes. It\u2019s such a huge legacy,\u201d she adds. \u201cIt\u2019s really nice to be able to be a part of representation where it counts. And Dora is the epitome of that.\u201d",
      "Castillo, of the National Hispanic Media Coalition, puts Dora up there with Mickey Mouse in terms of an instantly recognized cultural character and says she's relevant more than ever.",
      "\u201cWe need more Doras,\u201d she says. \u201cIf people were just open to being educated in other people\u2019s languages and cultures and beliefs and not see it as a threat, we wouldn\u2019t be in the situation that we\u2019re in this country and the world.\u201d",

      "CHICAGO -- Three dozen police captains pair off in a Chicago conference room to play a game: They must start a sentence with the last word their partner used.",
      "Many exchanges are nonsensical, full of one-upmanship using difficult words and laughter. But the improvisation game eventually makes sense.",
      "\u201cWhat we are trying to do, is get you to listen to the end of the sentence,\u201d says Kelly Leonard, wrapping up the improvisational exercise. \u201cIf my arm was a sentence, when do most people stop listening? Always the elbow! But then you're missing everything that goes after... and sometimes that's critical information.\u201d",
      "The police captains who have flown in from departments across the country nod. \u201cI definitely do that,\" some call out.",
      "Officials at the University of Chicago Crime Lab's Policing Leadership Academy brought members of The Second City, Chicago's storied improv theater, to teach police leaders the more diverse skills found in improv exercises \u2014 like thinking on your feet, reserving judgment and fully listening.",
      "The academy, a workshop taught over five months, tackles some serious topics like to make data-driven decisions or how to help officers handle on-the-job trauma.",
      "\u201cWe call it yoga for social skills,\u201d said Leonard, the vice president of Creative Strategy, Innovation and Business Development at The Second City.",
      "The skills might not apply to all policing situations in the field, but being a better listener or learning to take a breath before responding can make for better leaders, according to Tree Branch, a strategic client partner at The Second City Works.",
      "The creation of improv and of The Second City is rooted in social work. Both trace their beginnings to Viola Spolin, who created some of the exercises still used in improv while she was a resettlement worker in the 1920s helping immigrant children and local Chicago children connect. Spolin was also the mother of Second City cofounder, Paul Sills.",
      "The Policing Leadership Academy's creators believe those skills can also help meet their goals to increase community engagement, improve officer morale and ultimately reduce violent crime.",
      "\u201cWe are trying to make the case that you can do all three things,\" without compromising one over the other, said Kim Smith, director of programs at the Crime Lab.",
      "The academy is focused on working with leaders from departments dealing with high levels of community gun violence and pays for them to fly to Chicago one week a month to attend the five-month training.",
      "Crime Lab researchers found that district and precinct captains have the largest potential impact on their colleagues, despite often receiving little leadership training for the job. A precinct could have high marks for morale, community relationships, or be making a dent in crime numbers, but if the captain changes, those gains could plummet, researchers found, even if the community, the officers and everything else stayed the same.",
      "Professors, researchers and police leaders teach courses on topics like developing transparent policing cultures, using and collecting data, managing stress and building community partnerships. So far, about 130 police leaders from about 70 departments including tribal police departments and even a police inspector from Toronto have participated.",
      "Capt. Louis Higginson with the Philadelphia Police Department said the academy provided a much broader training than the two weeks of police job training he got before being promoted to captain a little more than a year ago.",
      "\u201cThe big thing for me was thinking about the things we allow to happen because they\u2019ve been that way before us,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the ways we can change the culture of our district by changing the thinking around why we do things.\u201d",
      "He said he did some of the improv exercises with his wife and daughters when he returned home and it opened up communication in a way he hadn\u2019t expected.",
      "\u201cI think it opened their eyes, like it did for me,\u201d Higginson said.",
      "Albuquerque Police Department Commander Ray Del Greco said he\u2019s still thinking more about how he communicates weeks after the improv class.",
      "\u201cWhen people talk to you and come to have you help solve their issues, to be able to push your ego out and worry less about your own agenda and listen, that\u2019s an understanding of leadership,\u201d Del Greco said. \u201cTo me that was the most valuable class we had.\u201d",
      "Academy leaders stressed the learning doesn't stop at graduation. They create communication channels so classmates can continue to support each other, they encourage captains to put on trainings with their departments, and participants are required to implement a capstone project that lasts well past the last day of class and addresses a real problem in their district or department.",
      "Many of the projects implement programs to address specific crimes, like involving the community in programs to prevent car thefts or piloting drones as first responders. One previous graduate created a partnership with community groups to increase community pride and reduce gun violence by reducing quality of life issues like littering, overgrown lots and graffiti.",
      "Stephen Donohue, a San Jose Police Department captain and recent academy graduate, is creating an early intervention system focusing on officer wellness. A typical system might flag citizen complaints or driving accidents, but Donohue's program gathers input from supervisors and peers to flag when an officer is taking on too much on-duty trauma, such as multiple murders or shooting investigations within a short time.",
      "\u201cIt's a Venn diagram between training, wellness and internal affairs,\" he said. \"And we can help them, we can lessen use-of-force complaints and allegations, offer better training and improve services put out by the department.\u201d",
      "The trainers hope in a few years more captains and officers will be saying \u201cyes and\u201d during improv classes. They are keeping tabs through a randomized control study on how well the overall training works. And with that evidence they hope funders, police departments or other universities will help expand the trainings to more departments.",
      "\u201cWe want there to be rigorously tested scientific evidence behind this,\u201d said Academy Executive Director Meredith Stricker. \u201cWe work to design a curriculum to ultimately make better leaders and better policing. The participants definitely talk about the improv class as one of their favorites. We hope all of it will work in tandem.\u201d",

      "Pomodoro died at home in Milan on Sunday, the eve of his 99th birthday, according to a statement from Carlotta Montebello, director general of the Arnaldo Pomodoro Foundation.",
      "Pomodoro\u2019s massive spheres are instantly recognizable: shiny, smooth bronze globes with clawed out interiors that Pomodoro has said referred to the superficial perfection of exteriors and the troubled complexity of interiors.",

      "The Vatican\u2019s sphere, which occupies a central place in the Pigna Courtyard of the Vatican Museums, features an internal mechanism that rotates with the wind. \u201cIn my work I see the cracks, the eroded parts, the destructive potential that emerges from our time of disillusionment,\u201d the Vatican quoted Pomodoro as saying about its sphere.",
      "The United Nations in New York received a 3.3-meter (10 foot, eight inch) diameter \u201cSphere Within Sphere\u201d sculpture as a gift from Italy in 1996. The U.N. sphere has refers to the coming of the new millennium, the U.N. said: \u201ca smooth exterior womb erupted by complex interior forms,\u201d and \u201ca promise for the rebirth of a less troubled and destructive world,\u201d Pomodoro said of it.",
      "Other spheres are located at museums around the world and outside the Italian foreign ministry, which has the original work that Pomodoro created in 1966 for the Montreal Expo that began his monumental sculpture project.",
      "Pomodoro was born in Montefeltro, Italy, on June 23, 1926. In addition to his spheres, he designed theatrical sets, land projects and machines. He had multiple retrospectives and taught at Stanford University, the University of California at Berkeley and Mills College, according to his biography on the foundation website.",

      "\u201cHow to Train Your Dragon\" is maintaining its top ranking in movie theaters",
      "NEW YORK -- Neither Pixar nor zombies were enough to topple \u201cHow to Train Your Dragon\" from the No. 1 slot at North American box offices over the weekend. The Universal Pictures live-action remake remained the top film, bringing in $37 million in ticket sales in its second weekend, despite the sizeable new releases of \u201cElio\u201d and \u201c28 Years Later.\u201d , according to studio estimates Sunday. \u201cHow To Train Your Dragon\u201d has rapidly amassed $358.2 million worldwide.",
      "Six years after its last entry, the Dean DeBlois-directed \u201cHow To Train Your Dragon\u201d has proven a potent revival of the DreamWorks Animation franchise. A sequel is already in the works for the $150 million production, which remakes the 2010 animated tale about a Viking boy and his dragon.",
      "Pixar's \u201cElio\u201d had a particularly tough weekend. The Walt Disney Co. animation studio has often launched some of its biggest titles in June, including \u201cCars,\u201d \u201cWALL-E\u201d and \u201cToy Story 4.\u201d But \u201cElio,\u201d a science fiction adventure about a boy who dreams of meeting aliens, notched a modest $21 million, the lowest opening ever for Pixar.",
      "\u201cThis is a weak opening for a new Pixar movie,\u201d said David A. Gross, who runs the movie consulting firm FranchiseRe. \u201cThese would be solid numbers for another original animation film, but this is Pixar, and by Pixar\u2019s remarkable standard, the opening is well below average.\u201d",
      "\u201cElio,\u201d originally set for release in early 2024, had a bumpy road to the screen. Adrian Molina \u2014 co-director of \u201cCoco\u201d \u2014 was replaced mid-production by Domee Shi (\u201cTurning Red\u201d) and Madeline Sharafian. Back at Disney\u2019s D23 conference in 2022, America Ferrera appeared to announce her role as Elio\u2019s mother, but the character doesn\u2019t even exist in the revamped film.",
      "Disney and Pixar spent at least $150 million making \u201cElio,\u201d which didn\u2019t fare any better internationally than it did in North America, bringing in just $14 million from 43 territories. Pixar stumbled coming out of the pandemic before stabilizing performance with 2023\u2019s \u201cElemental\u201d ($496.4 million worldwide) and 2024\u2019s \u201cInside Out 2\u201d ($1.7 billion), which was the company's biggest box office hit.",
      "\u201cElemental\u201d was Pixar's previously lowest earning film, launching with $29.6 million. It rallied in later weeks to collect nearly half a billion dollars at the box office. The company's first movie, \u201cToy Story,\u201d opened with $29.1 million in 1995, or $60 when adjusted for inflation. It remains to be seen whether \u201cElio's\u201d decent reviews and \u201cA\u201d from CinemaScore audiences can lead it to repeat \u201cElemental's\u201d trajectory.",
      "With most schools on summer break, the competition for family audiences was stiff. Disney\u2019s own \u201cLilo & Stitch,\u201d another live-action remake, continued to pull in young moviegoers. It grossed $9.7 million in its fifth weekend, bringing its global tally to $910.3 million. .",
      "\u201c28 Years Later\u201d signaled the return of another, far gorier franchise. Director Danny Boyle reunited with screenwriter Alex Garland to resume their pandemic apocalypse thriller 25 years after \u201c28 Days Later\u201d and 18 years after its sequel, \u201c28 Weeks Later.\u201d",
      "The Sony Pictures release opened with $30 million. That was good enough to give Boyle, the filmmaker of \u201cSlumdog Millionaire\u201d and \u201cTrainspotting,\u201d the biggest opening weekend of his career. The film, which cost $60 million to make, jumps ahead nearly three decades from the outbreak of the so-called rage virus for a coming-of-age story about a 12-year-old (Alfie Williams) venturing out of his family\u2019s protected village. Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Jodie Comer and Ralph Fiennes co-star.",
      "Reviews have been good (90% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes) for \u201c28 Years Later,\u201d though audience reaction (a \u201cB\u201d CinemaScore) is mixed. Boyle has more plans for the zombie franchise, which will next see the release of \u201c28 Years Later: The Bone Temple\u201d next year from director Nia DaCosta.",
      "\u201c28 Years Later\u201d added another $30 million in 59 overseas markets.",
      "After its strong start last weekend with $12 million, A24\u2019s \u201cMaterialists\u201d held well with $5.8 million in its second weekend. The romantic drama by writer-director Celine Song and starring Dakota Johnson, Pedro Pascal and Chris Evans has collected $24 million so far.",
      "Next weekend should also be a competitive one in movie theaters, with both \u201cF1,\u201d from Apple and Warner Bros., and Universal\u2019s \u201cMegan 2.0\u201d launching in cinemas.",
      "With final domestic figures being released Monday, this list factors in the estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore:",

      "It\u2019s a question seemingly laid to rest years ago, as studies showed no evidence that the preservative causes any health problems.",
      "\u201cThis is really a nonissue,\u201d said Dr. Sean O\u2019Leary of the American Academy of Pediatrics.",
      "Here are some things to know about the substance.",
      "Thimerosal is a preservative used in certain vaccines since the 1930s, as well as in some other medical products.",
      "It was mostly used in multi-dose vials of vaccine, to prevent bacterial contamination as the vessel was repeatedly punctured to withdraw a dose.",
      "Questions about thimerosal were raised in the late 1990s because it contains a form of mercury.",
      "It\u2019s not the same as the toxic type found in some seafood, called methylmercury. Instead, it\u2019s a different type called ethylmercury that the body can excrete, O\u2019Leary explained.",
      "The amount of ethylmercury per vaccine dose was small and studies found no evidence of harm. Nor was it used in all vaccines. For example, vaccines for chickenpox, polio and measles, mumps and rubella never contained it, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "But as a precaution, the U.S. phased the preservative out of childhood vaccines. Since 2001, all vaccines routinely recommended for children age 6 and younger in the U.S. come in formulas that don\u2019t contain thimerosal.",
      "The exception is a small subset of flu shot formulas in multi-dose vials that could be used for adults or kids. The vast majority of children, however, get their flu vaccination from a single-dose shot instead, O\u2019Leary said.",
      "According to the CDC, 96% of all flu vaccines in the U.S. administered last fall and winter \u2014 and an even higher share of those used in federally funded programs \u2014 were thimerosal-free.",
      "U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is a longtime antivaccine activist, and he has long contended there was a tie between thimerosal and autism.",
      "On Thursday, his newly appointed vaccine advisers were set to hear a presentation from Lyn Redwood, a nurse practitioner who once ran the antivaccine group that Kennedy founded.",
      "She will suggest that the remaining thimerosal-containing flu shots should be removed, according to meeting materials posted earlier this week. Among the claims were that they could be a risk to pregnant women.",
      "A new CDC staff analysis prepared for the meeting again showed no link between the preservative and autism or any other neurodevelopmental disorders.",
      "Some experts note that autism rates rose after thimerosal was removed from young children's vaccines in the U.S.",

      "ATLANTA -- U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s new vaccine advisory committee backed another option to protect infants against a dangerous virus \u2014 before turning to questions about fall flu vaccines and a preservative in a small fraction of them that some antivaccine groups have falsely tied to autism.",
      "The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices on Thursday took up protections against RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus, a common cause of cold-like symptoms that can dangerously inflame infants' tiny airways.",
      "In 2023, U.S. health officials began recommending two new measures to protect infants \u2014 a lab-made antibody for newborns and a vaccine for pregnant women \u2014 that experts say likely drove an improvement in infant mortality. That first antibody, called nirsevimab, proved to be 63% to 76% effective against emergency department visits for infants over the last year.",
      "On Thursday, the vaccine panel voted 5-2 that another newly approved antibody shot, Merck\u2019s clesrovimab, should be used similarly.",
      "The ACIP, created more than 60 years ago, helps the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention determine who should be vaccinated against a long list of diseases, and when. Those recommendations have a big impact on whether insurance covers vaccinations and where they\u2019re available.",
      "Kennedy was a leading voice in the antivaccine movement before becoming the nation\u2019s top health official. He fired the previous 17-member panel this month and replaced it with a seven-member group that includes several vaccine skeptics.",
      "At its June meetings, the committee usually refreshes guidance for Americans 6 months and older to get a flu shot, and helps propel the annual fall vaccination campaign.",
      "Presentations prepared for Thursday's meeting suggest that the panel may do much the same this year. But there's also a flu-related vote that promises controversy.",
      "It concerns thimerosal, a form of mercury that\u2019s been added to vaccines since the early 20th century to preventing bacterial contamination in multi-dose vials.",
      "Kennedy has long held there was a tie between thimerosal and autism, and also accused the government of hiding the danger. Study after study has found no evidence that thimerosal causes autism. But since 2001, vaccines manufactured for the U.S. market and routinely recommended for children 6 years or younger have contained no thimerosal or only trace amounts, with limited exceptions.",
      "Thimerosal was placed on the meeting agenda shortly after Kennedy\u2019s new vaccine advisory was named last week.",
      "Before the vote, the committee will hear from Lyn Redwood, the former president of what is now known as Children\u2019s Health Defense \u2014 an antivaccine group founded by Kennedy.",

      "Her organization, which represents large city health departments, \u201cis deeply concerned that many routine vaccines may soon become inaccessible or unaffordable for millions of Americans if ACIP makes changes based on ideology rather than science,\" she said. \"The stakes are simply too high to let that happen.\u201d",

      "One key issue stalling progress on President Donald Trump\u2019s big bill in Congress is particularly daunting",
      "WASHINGTON -- One key unsettled issue stalling progress on President Donald Trump's big bill in Congress is particularly daunting: How to cut billions from health care without harming Americans or the hospitals and others that provide care?",
      "Republicans are struggling to devise a solution to the health care problem their package has created. Already, estimates say 10.9 million more people would be without health coverage under the House-passed version of the bill. GOP senators have proposed steeper reductions, which some say go too far.",
      "\u201cThe Senate cuts in Medicaid are far deeper than the House cuts, and I think that\u2019s problematic,\u201d said GOP Sen. Susan Collins of Maine.",
      "Senators have been meeting behind closed doors and with Trump administration officials as they rush to finish up the big bill ahead of the president's Fourth of July deadline. Much of the package, with its tax breaks and bolstered border security spending, is essentially drafted. But the size and scope of healthcare cuts are among the toughest remaining issues.",
      "It's reminiscent of the summer during Trump's first term, in 2017, when Republicans struggled to keep their campaign promise to \u201crepeal and replace\u201d the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, only to see the GOP splinter over the prospect of Americans losing health coverage. That legislation collapsed when then-Sen. John McCain famously cast a thumbs-down vote.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune is determined to avoid that outcome, sticking to the schedule and pressing ahead with voting expected by the end of the week.",
      "\u201cThis is a good bill and it's going to be great for our country,\u201d Thune said Wednesday, championing its potential to unleash economic growth and put money in people's pockets.",
      "The changes to the federal health care programs, particularly Medicaid, were always expected to become a centerpiece of the GOP package, a way to offset the costs of providing tax breaks for millions of Americans. Without action from Congress, taxes would go up next year when current tax law expires.",
      "The House-passed bill achieved some $1.5 trillion in savings overall, a large part of it coming from changes to health care. The Medicaid program has dramatically expanded in the 15 years since Obamacare became law and now serves some 80 million Americans. Republicans say that's far too high, and they want to shrink the program back to a smaller size covering mainly poorer women and children.",
      "House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said Republicans are \u201ctrying to take away healthcare from tens of millions of Americans.\u201d Democrats are uniformly opposed to what they call the \u201cbig, ugly bill.\u201d",
      "Much of the health care cost savings would come from new 80-hour-a-month work requirements on those who receive Medicaid benefits, even as most recipients already work.",
      "But another provision, the so-called provider tax that almost all the states impose to some degree on hospitals and others that serve Medicaid patients, is drawing particular concern for potential cuts to rural hospitals.",
      "Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., said several senators spoke up Wednesday during a private meeting indicating they were not yet ready to start voting. \u201cThat\u2019ll depend if we land the plane on rural hospitals,\u201d he said.",
      "States impose the taxes as a way to help fund Medicaid, largely by boosting the reimbursements they receive from the federal government. Critics decry the system as a type of \u201claundering\u201d but almost every state except Alaska uses it to help provide the health care coverage.",
      "The House-passed bill would freeze the provider taxes at current levels, while the Senate proposal goes deeper by reducing the tax that some states are able to impose.",
      "\u201cI know the states are addicted to it,\u201d said Sen. Roger Marshall, R-Kan. But he added, \u201cObviously the provider tax needs to go away.\u201d",
      "But a number of GOP senators, and the hospitals and other medical providers in their states, are raising steep concerns that the provider tax changes would decimate rural hospitals.",
      "In a plea to lawmakers, the American Hospital Association said the cuts won\u2019t just affect those who get health coverage through Medicaid, but would further strain emergency rooms \u201cas they become the family doctor to millions of newly uninsured people.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd worse, some hospitals, especially those in rural communities, may be forced to close altogether,\u201d said Rick Pollack, president and CEO of the hospital group.",
      "The Catholic Health Association of the United States noted in its own letter that Medicaid provides health insurance coverage for one in five people and nearly half of all children.",
      "\u201cThe proposed changes to Medicaid would have devastating consequences, particularly for those in small towns and rural communities, where Medicaid is often the primary source of health care coverage,\u201d said Sister Mary Haddad, the group\u2019s president and CEO.",
      "Trying to engineer a fix to the problem, senators are considering creating a rural hospital fund to help offset the lost Medicaid money.",
      "GOP senators circulated a proposal to pour $15 billion to establish a new rural hospital fund. But several senators said that's too high, while others said it's insufficient. Collins has proposed that the fund be set at $100 billion.",
      "\u201cIt won\u2019t be that big, but there will be a fund,\u201d Thune said.",
      "Hawley, who has been among those most outspoken about the health care cuts, said he's interested in the rural hospital fund but needs to hear more about how it would work.",
      "He has also raised concerns about a new $35 per service co-pay that could be charged to those with Medicaid, which is in both the House and Senate versions of the bill.",
      "\u201cGetting the fund is good. That\u2019s important, a step forward,\u201d Hawley said. But he asked: \u201cHow does the fund actually distribute the money? Who will get it to hospitals? ... Or is this just going to be something that exists on paper?\u201d",
      "A new analysis from the White House Council of Economic Advisers estimates the package would result in up to $2.3 trillion in deficit reduction over 10 years, a markedly different assessment from other analyses. In contrast, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office\u2019s dynamic analysis of the House-passed measure estimates an increase in deficits by $2.8 trillion over the next decade.",

      "U.S. health officials have expanded warnings about a rare heart side effect associated with the two leading COVID-19 vaccines",
      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Food and Drug Administration said Wednesday it has expanded existing warnings on the two leading COVID-19 vaccines about a rare heart side effect mainly seen in young men.",
      "Myocarditis, a type of heart inflammation that is usually mild, emerged as a complication after the first shots became widely available in 2021. Prescribing information from both Pfizer and Moderna already advises doctors about the issue.",
      "In April, the FDA sent letters to both drugmakers asking them to update and expand the warnings to add more detail about the problem and to cover a larger group of patients. While the FDA can mandate label changes, the process is often more of a negotiation with companies.",
      "Specifically, the new warning lists the risk of myocarditis as 8 cases per 1 million people who got the 2023-2024 COVID shots between the ages of 6 months and 64 years old. The label also notes that the problem has been most common among males ages 12 to 24. The previous label said the problem mostly occurs in 12- to 17-year-olds.",
      "The FDA\u2019s labeling change appears to conflict with some prior findings of scientists elsewhere in the U.S. government.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention previously concluded there was no increased risk of myocarditis detected in government vaccine injury databases for COVID-19 shots dating back to 2022. Officials also noted that cases tend to resolve quickly and are less severe than those associated with COVID-19 infection itself, which can also cause myocarditis.",
      "The FDA announcement came as new vaccine advisers appointed by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. met to debate the continuing use of COVID-19 vaccines for key groups, including pregnant women. It's the first meeting of the CDC advisory panel since Kennedy abruptly dismissed all 17 members of the group, naming a new panel that includes several members with a history of anti-vaccine statements.",
      "The FDA's label update is the latest step by officials working under Kennedy to restrict or undercut use of vaccines. FDA Commissioner Marty Makary and a top deputy recently restricted annual COVID-19 shots to seniors and other Americans at higher risk from the virus. They\u2019ve also suggested seasonal tweaks to match the latest circulating virus strains are new products that require extra testing.",
      "Outside experts said the new warning is the wrong approach.",
      "\u201cThey are right to suggest that we need to consider myocarditis risks associated with the vaccine, but what they propose is exactly the wrong solution,\u201d said Dr. Robert Morris, a public health specialist at the University of Washington. \u201cWe should be investigating who is prone to myocarditis to see if we can predict and mitigate that risk.\u201d",
      "Makary and several other FDA officials gained prominence during the pandemic by suggesting the federal government exaggerated the benefits of COVID-19 boosters and downplayed serious side effects, including myocarditis.",
      "Before joining the government, Makary and two of his current FDA deputies wrote a 2022 paper that said mandating booster shots in young people would cause more vaccine-related injuries than prevented hospitalizations from COVID-19 infections. The conclusion contradicted that of many leading vaccine and public health experts at the time, including at the CDC.",

      "CDC nominee Susan Monarez says she values vaccines and rigorous scientific evidence but has largely sidestepped questions about widespread cuts to the agency and whether she disagreed with any of Health Secretary Robert F",
      "Susan Monarez, President Donald Trump's pick to lead the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told senators Wednesday that she values vaccines, public health interventions and rigorous scientific evidence, but largely sidestepped questions about widespread cuts to the agency, elimination of programs and whether she disagreed with any of Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s actions to date.",
      "\u201cThe secretary is doing the important work of leading a complex agency,\u201d Monarez told members of a Senate health committee that will decide whether to advance her nomination.",
      "Monarez, 50, is the first nominee for CDC director to require Senate confirmation. She was named acting director in January and the nominee for the post in March after Trump abruptly withdrew his first choice, David Weldon. Monarez is the former director of a federal biomedical research agency and a respected scientist, though she would be the first nonphysician to lead the CDC in decades.",
      "Monarez repeatedly said she had not been involved in decisions earlier this year to cut hundreds of staff and eliminate CDC programs, but that she would work to retain the agency's core functions and transition key programs to other parts of the Health and Human Services department.",
      "Her answers appeared to frustrate some senators, including Virginia Democrat Tim Kaine, who said he had no questions about her qualifications.",
      "\u201cI've got questions about your willingness to follow through on your values,\u201d he said.",
      "In the two-hour hearing, Monarez was sharply questioned about Kennedy's recent move to fire all 17 members of a crucial committee that evaluates and recommends vaccines, his downplaying of the risks of measles during a nationwide outbreak and staffing cuts to a program that investigates lead poisoning in children.",
      "Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican who is chairman of the committee, sought assurances about the scientific integrity of the CDC\u2019s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, which was reconstituted by Kennedy to include vaccine skeptics.",
      "\u201cSomeone can speak as a critic, but there should be someone who's reviewing the overwhelming evidence of the safety of vaccines,\u201d Cassidy said.",
      "Monarez said she strongly supported public health interventions, including immunizations, saying, \u201cI think vaccines save lives.\"",
      "\u201cThe ACIP has a very vital role to play,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd it must make sure that it is using science and evidence to drive that decision-making.\u201d",
      "She vowed to prioritize innovation, \u201cevidence-based rapid decision-making\u201d and clear communication at the $9.2 billion agency tasked with evaluating vaccines, monitoring diseases and watching for threats to Americans' health.",
      "Monarez declined to say whether she had disagreed with any of Kennedy's decisions regarding the agency to date, saying he has \u201claid out a very clear vision.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think he has prioritized key public health activities for preventing chronic diseases,\" she added.",
      "If Monarez is confirmed, it would end a stretch of confusion at the Atlanta-based CDC, where, for months, it wasn\u2019t clear who was running the agency. The acting director's role was filled in part by Matthew Buzzelli, the CDC\u2019s chief of staff who is a lawyer and political appointee with no medical experience.",
      "Monarez holds doctorate in microbiology and immunology from the University of Wisconsin, and her postdoctoral training was in microbiology and immunology at Stanford University.",
      "At CDC headquarters in Atlanta, employees have said Monarez was rarely heard from between late January and late March, when Trump nominated her.",
      "The CDC was created nearly 80 years ago to prevent the spread of malaria in the U.S. Its mission was later expanded, and it gradually became a global leader on infectious and chronic diseases and a go-to source of health information.",

      "ATLANTA -- U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u2019s new vaccine advisers began their first meeting Wednesday under intense scrutiny from medical experts worried about Americans\u2019 access to lifesaving shots.",
      "First on the agenda is an awkward scenario: Kennedy already announced COVID-19 vaccines will no longer be recommended for healthy children or pregnant women, and his new advisers aren\u2019t scheduled to vote on whether they agree. Yet government scientists prepared meeting materials calling vaccination \u201cthe best protection\u201d during pregnancy \u2014 and said most children hospitalized for COVID-19 over the past year were unvaccinated.",
      "COVID-19 remains a public health threat, resulting in 32,000 to 51,000 U.S. deaths and more than 250,000 hospitalizations since last fall, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Most at risk for hospitalization are seniors and children under 2 \u2014 especially infants under 6 months who could have some protection if their mom got vaccinated during pregnancy, according to the CDC's presentation.",
      "It\u2019s one signal that this week\u2019s two-day meeting of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices isn\u2019t business as usual.",
      "Another sign: Shortly before the meeting, a Virginia-based obstetrician and gynecologist stepped down from the committee, bringing the panel's number to just seven. The Trump administration said Dr. Michael Ross withdrew during a customary review of members' financial holdings.",
      "The meeting opened as the American Academy of Pediatrics announced that it will continue publishing its own vaccine schedule for children but now will do so independently of the ACIP, calling it \u201cno longer a credible process.\u201d",
      "The panel, created more than 60 years ago, helps the CDC determine who should be vaccinated against a long list of diseases, and when. Those recommendations have a big impact on whether insurance covers vaccinations and where they\u2019re available, such as at pharmacies.",
      "Earlier this month, Kennedy abruptly dismissed the existing 17-member expert panel and handpicked eight replacements, including several anti-vaccine voices. And a number of the CDC\u2019s top vaccine scientists \u2014 including some who lead the reporting of data and the vetting of presentations at ACIP meetings \u2014 have resigned or been moved out of previous positions.",
      "The highly unusual moves prompted a last-minute plea from a prominent Republican senator to delay this week\u2019s meeting. Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, a physician who chairs the chamber's health committee, said Monday that many of Kennedy\u2019s chosen panelists lack the required expertise and \u201cmay even have a preconceived bias\u201d against new vaccine technologies.",
      "In a House hearing Tuesday, Kennedy defended his purge, saying the old panel had been \u201ca template for medical malpractice.\u201d",
      "Rep. Kim Schrier, a pediatrician and Democrat from Washington state, told Kennedy: \u201cI will lay all responsibility for every death from a vaccine-preventable illness at your feet.\u201d",
      "The two-day meeting's agenda on was abruptly changed last week.",
      "Discussion of COVID-19 shots will open the session on Wednesday. Later in the day, the committee will take up RSV, with votes expected. On Thursday, the committee will vote on fall flu vaccinations and on the use of a preservative in certain flu shots.",
      "RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus, is a common cause of cold-like symptoms that can be dangerous for infants.",
      "In 2023, U.S. health officials began recommending two new measures to protect infants \u2014 a lab-made antibody for newborns and a vaccine for pregnant women \u2014 that experts say likely drove an improvement in infant mortality.",
      "The committee will discuss another company's newly approved antibody shot, but the exact language for the vote was not released prior to the meeting.",
      "\u201cI think there may be a theme of soft-pedaling or withdrawing recommendations for healthy pregnant women and healthy children,\u201d even though they are at risk from vaccine-preventable diseases, said Lawrence Gostin, a public health law expert at Georgetown University who co-authored a recent medical journal commentary criticizing the COVID-19 vaccination decision.",
      "At its June meetings, the committee usually refreshes guidance for Americans 6 month and older to get a flu shot, and helps greenlight the annual fall vaccination campaign.",
      "But given the recent changes to the committee and federal public health leadership, it's unclear how routine topics will be treated, said Jason Schwartz, a Yale University health policy researcher who has studied the committee.",
      "Thursday also promises controversy. The advisory panel is set to consider a preservative in a subset of flu shots that Kennedy and some antivaccine groups have falsely contended is tied to autism. In preparation, the CDC posted a new report confirming that research shows no link between the preservative, thimerosal, and autism or any other neurodevelopmental disorders.",
      "Gostin said the agenda appears to be \u201ca combination of what we would normally expect ACIP to cover along with a mixture of potential conspiracy theories,\u201d he said. \u201cWe clearly are in a new normal that's highly skeptical of vaccine science.\u201d",
      "The committee's recommendations traditionally go to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director. Historically, nearly all are accepted and then used by insurance companies in deciding what vaccines to cover.",
      "But the CDC currently has no director, so the committee\u2019s recommendations have been going to Kennedy, and he has yet to act on a couple recommendations ACIP made in April.",

      "Global efforts to protect children against diseases like measles, polio and tuberculosis have stalled since 2010, leaving millions vulnerable to deadly infections",
      "LONDON -- Efforts to vaccinate children globally have stalled since 2010, leaving millions vulnerable to tetanus, polio, tuberculosis and other diseases that can be easily prevented.",
      "Protection from measles in particular dropped in 100 countries between 2010 and 2019, unravelling decades of progress, including in rich countries that had previously eliminated the highly infectious disease, according to a new analysis of global vaccination trends published Tuesday in the journal Lancet.",
      "\u201cAfter clean water, vaccination is the most effective intervention for protecting the health of our children,\u201d said Helen Bedford, a professor of children's health at University College London, who was not connected to the research. She warned there has been a small but worrying rise in the number of parents skipping vaccination for their children in recent years, for reasons including misinformation.",
      "In Britain, Bedford said that has resulted in the largest number of measles recorded since the 1990s and the deaths of nearly a dozen babies from whooping cough. Vaccination rates in the U.S. are also falling, and exemptions from vaccinations are at an all-time high.",
      "After the World Health Organization established its routine immunization program in 1974, countries made significant efforts to protect children against preventable and sometimes fatal diseases; the program is credited with inoculating more than 4 billion children, saving the lives of 154 million worldwide.",
      "Since the program began, the global coverage of children receiving three doses of the diphtheria-tetanus-whooping cough vaccine nearly doubled, from 40% to 81%. The percentage of kids getting the measles vaccine also jumped from 37% to 83%, with similar increases for polio and tuberculosis.",
      "But after the COVID-19 pandemic, coverage rates dropped, with an estimated 15.6 million children missing out on the diphtheria-tetanus-whooping cough vaccine and the measles vaccine. Nearly 16 million children failed to get vaccinated against polio and 9 million missed out on the TB vaccine, with the biggest impact in sub-Saharan Africa. The study was funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and Gavi, The Vaccine Alliance.",
      "Researchers at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, who conducted the analysis, noted that more than half of the world\u2019s 15.7 million unvaccinated children live in just eight countries in 2023: Nigeria, India, Congo, Ethiopia, Somalia, Sudan, Indonesia and Brazil.",
      "Since President Trump has begun to withdraw the U.S. from the WHO and dismantled the U.S Agency for International Aid, public health experts have warned of new epidemics of infectious diseases. The researchers said it was too early to know what impact recent funding cuts might have on children's immunization rates.",
      "The WHO said there had been an 11-fold spike in measles in the Americas this year compared to 2024. Measles infections doubled in the European region in 2024 versus the previous year and the disease remains common in Africa and Southeast Asia.",
      "\u201cIt is in everyone's interest that this situation is rectified,\u201d said Dr. David Elliman, a pediatrician who has advised the British government, in a statement. \u201cWhile vaccine-preventable infectious diseases occur anywhere in the world, we are all at risk.\u201d",

      "The professionalization of college sports has prompted concern among team physicians that they will be exposed to a greater risk of medical liability lawsuits by injured athletes who claim a poor outcome caused them to lose future earnings",
      "The professionalization of college sports has prompted concern among team physicians that they will be exposed to a greater risk of being sued by athletes who claim a poor outcome from treatment caused them to lose future earnings.",
      "Before July 2021, when college athletes were cleared to be compensated by third parties for the use of their name, image and likeness, such lawsuits would have been virtually unwinnable.",
      "Four years later, and with schools set to share millions directly with their athletes, team physicians are wary. Some of the most high-profile college athletes are already signing multimillion-dollar deals and six-figure contracts are common.",
      "Though no malpractice lawsuits seeking lost future earnings at the college level are known to have been filed, it's only a matter of time, said Dr. James Borchers, Big Ten chief medical officer and president and CEO of the U.S. Council for Athletes\u2019 Health.",
      "\u201cThe complexity for the clinician is going to be significant,\u201d he said. \u201cI do think there are people who are going to evaluate this and say, \u2018I didn\u2019t sign up for an 18-year-old making a million dollars and then saying the decision I make affected their ability to make money.\u2019 I think you may see people say this isn\u2019t for me.\u201d",
      "The case of former Philadelphia Eagles player Chris Maragos jolted the sports medicine field in 2023 when a jury ordered his surgeon and an orthopedics group affiliated with the team to pay him $43.5 million for lost future earnings and pain and suffering after he alleged improper care of a knee injury. The orthopedics group ended its two-decade association with the Eagles out of fear of future lawsuits.",
      "At the college level, it still would be hard for an athlete to contend a team doctor's errant care cost them an opportunity to make money in professional sports because there are no guarantees to play at the next level. However, a college athlete who didn't have an optimal recovery could argue treatment reduced their ability to make NIL money or to transfer to a higher-level school where they could make more money.",
      "\u201cYou had an ACL tear, I did surgery and you never quite made it back \u2014 back in my day, you just had bad luck,\u201d said Borchers, who played football at Ohio State from 1989-93. \u201cYou\u2019re making a million dollars and that happens, you\u2019re probably having a different discussion.\u201d",
      "Borchers offered a hypothetical situation to illustrate his concerns about the pressures faced by team doctors. A receiver is treated for a hamstring injury, returns to play and reinjures the hamstring. The receiver says the injury never felt fully healed and his agent takes him to another doctor who has a different opinion on how the injury should have been treated.",
      "Borchers said the receiver would have been better off to sit out longer and miss a few more games.",
      "\u201cBut there wasn\u2019t money tied to that,\u201d he said. \"Now you could say you hurt my ability to go out and perform, so I\u2019m not going to get as much money or (it) has cost me the ability to put more tape out there so I could have transferred to a better situation and made more money. Those are the types of issues we\u2019re hearing about that used to not exist in college sports.\u201d",
      "Typically in college sports, team physicians are employed by a university-affiliated medical center or local medical group. Athletic trainers are employed by the athletic department.",
      "Team physicians must carry liability insurance either individually or through the medical center or group. The most common limits for a malpractice insurance policy are $1 million per incident and $3 million total in a year, said Mike Matray, editor of Medical Liability Monitor.",
      "\u201cYou can see how an athlete\u2019s economic damages, should a medical error end his/her career, would easily exceed those limits,\u201d Matray wrote in an email to The Associated Press.",
      "MLM has followed the medical liability insurance industry since 1975, and though the publication does not track data specific to sports medicine practitioners who perform surgeries, Matray estimated rates for that specialty to be more than $100,000 per year in some states.",
      "Dr. Jon Divine, head team physician at Cincinnati, said Big 12 team doctors are discussing among themselves and university general counsels whether they should increase their liability insurance limits, perhaps to $2 million or $6 million or more.",
      "Divine said he and other team doctors also are taking extra steps in evaluating injuries in the new era of college sports.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve probably ordered more MRIs than I ever have in 25 years in the last two years,\u201d he said. \u201cIt's to make sure we\u2019re getting it right for the (coaching) staff, for the kids, for the kid's family. There\u2019s that much more riding on it.\u201d",
      "A former Penn State football team doctor, Scott Lynch, alleged in 2019 that coach James Franklin attempted to interfere with medical decisions.",
      "A Penn State internal review found evidence of \u201cfriction\u201d between Lynch and Franklin but could not determine whether Franklin violated NCAA bylaws or Big Ten standards by interfering with medical decisions. Lynch was awarded $5.25 for wrongful termination by the hospital that had employed him.",
      "Dr. David McAllister, head team physician at UCLA who has been practicing for 27 years, said the relationship between team doctor and athlete has gone from one built on trust to now being transactional and at times adversarial.",
      "When athletes spent four or five years at the same school, as once was the norm, friendships were formed and the team doctor continued to provide care for the some athletes long after their playing days. Now, McAllister said, many football and basketball players are taking advice from agents and business managers whose priority is the athlete\u2019s earning power, and that puts pressure on team physicians.",
      "\u201cThere are seasoned, experienced people that do what I do who either recently got out of it or are really considering it because they don\u2019t want to be exposed to the liability,\u201d McAllister said, \u201cand they don\u2019t find it that much fun anymore.\u201d",

      "CHARLESTON, W.Va. -- A West Virginia woman filed a lawsuit Tuesday seeking a religious exemption from required school vaccinations for her young child.",
      "Miranda Guzman alleges that the state's vaccine mandate violates a 2023 West Virginia law that stipulates the government would not be able to \u201csubstantially burden\u201d someone\u2019s constitutional right to freedom of religion unless doing so \u201cis essential to further a compelling governmental interest.\u201d Guzman sued the state and local boards of education and the county schools superintendent in Raleigh County Circuit Court.",
      "West Virginia was among just a handful of states that granted only medical exemptions from school vaccinations when Republican Gov. Patrick Morrisey issued an executive order in January allowing religious exemptions. However, the state Board of Education voted this month to direct public schools to ignore the executive order and instead follow long-standing school vaccine requirements that are laid out in state law.",
      "Also, two groups have sued over the governor's order, saying the Legislature, not the governor, has the authority to make such decisions.",
      "Guzman obtained a religious exemption to the vaccine mandate from the state health department and enrolled her child in elementary school for the 2025-26 school year. But on June 17, Guzman received an email from the Raleigh County school superintendent rescinding the certificate, according to the lawsuit.",
      "Guzman's attorneys said \u201cthe straightforward legal issue\" in the lawsuit is whether enforcement of the state vaccine mandate violates the 2023 Equal Protection for Religion Act.",
      "West Virginia Board of Education spokesperson Christy Day referred to a June 12 statement from the board that its intent is to \u201cdo what is best\u201d for public school students, educators and school service personnel. \u201cThis includes taking the important steps of protecting the school community from the real risk of exposure to litigation that could result from not following vaccination laws,\u201d the earlier statement said.",
      "A telephone message left with Raleigh County Schools Superintendent Serena Starcher wasn\u2019t immediately returned.",
      "West Virginia\u2019s school vaccination policy long has been heralded by medical experts as one of the most protective in the country for children. State law requires children to receive vaccines for chickenpox, hepatitis B, measles, meningitis, mumps, diphtheria, polio, rubella, tetanus and whooping cough before starting school.",
      "Morrisey, who is not a party to the lawsuit, held a news conference Tuesday in Beckley in support of Guzman.",
      "\u201cThis is not about whether or not about parents should vaccinate their children,\u201d Morrisey said. \u201cThis is about standing up for religious liberty.\u201d",
      "At least 30 states have religious freedom laws, including one signed by Georgia's governor in April. The laws are modeled after the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act, signed in 1993 by then-President Bill Clinton, which allows federal regulations that interfere with religious beliefs to be challenged.",

      "A Texas law promoting the Trump administration\u2019s \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d agenda requires first-ever warning labels on certain foods like chips and candies",
      "DALLAS -- A new Texas law promoting the Trump administration's \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d agenda requires first-ever warning labels on foods like chips and candies that contain dyes and additives not allowed in other countries.",
      "It could have far-reaching effects on the nation's food supply, but a review of the legislation shows it also misrepresents the status of some ingredients that would trigger the action.",
      "The law signed by Republican Gov. Greg Abbott on Sunday requires foods made with any of more than 40 dyes or additives to have labels starting in 2027 saying they contain ingredients \u201cnot recommended for human consumption\u201d in Australia, Canada, the European Union or the U.K. But a review shows that nearly a dozen of the targeted additives are either authorized in the cited regions \u2014 or already restricted in the U.S.",
      "The law, which will send the food industry scrambling to respond, is laudable in its intent, but could lead to incorrect citations and potential legal challenges, a consumer advocacy group said.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know how the list of chemicals was constructed,\u201d said Thomas Galligan, a scientist with the Center for Science in the Public Interest. \u201cWarnings have to be accurate in order to be legal.\u201d",
      "The law, approved with wide bipartisan support, is part of a flurry of similar legislation this year by GOP-led statehouses as lawmakers align themselves with U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u2019s \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d agenda. Texas would be the first in the U.S. to use warning labels to target additives, rather than nutrients like sugar or saturated fat, to change American diets.",
      "It will force food companies to decide whether to reformulate products to avoid the labels, add the newly required language, pull certain products from Texas shelves or oppose the measure in court.",
      "It's unclear how the list of additives was created. Inquiries to the office of the bill's author, Republican state Sen. Lois Kolkhorst, were not immediately returned.",
      "Regulators in Australia, Canada, the EU and the U.K. take a cautious approach to food additives: If a product's safety is uncertain, it can be banned or restricted until it is determined to be safe. By contrast, the U.S. generally allows products on the market unless there is clear risk of harm.",
      "Three additives targeted by Texas \u2014 partially hydrogenated oils, Red Dye No. 4 and Red Dye No. 3 \u2014 are not approved or have been banned in food by U.S. regulators.",
      "Several of the other listed ingredients are allowed in all four of those regions, noted Galligan and representatives from the Consumer Brands Association, a food industry trade group.",
      "Examples of those include: Blue Dye No. 1; Blue Dye No. 2; butylated hydroxyanisole, or BHA; butylated hydroxytoluene, or BHT; diacetyl; interesterified soybean oil; lactylated fatty acid esters of glycerol and propylene glycol; and potassium aluminum sulfate.",
      "In addition, the legislation contains regulatory loopholes that could prevent certain ingredients from being labeled at all, said Melanie Benesh, an analyst with the Environmental Working Group, an activist organization that focuses on toxic chemicals.",
      "For example, the food additive azodicarbonamide, known as ADA and used as a bleaching agent in cereal flours, is included on the Texas list. But under the Federal Code of Regulations, it may safely be used in food under certain conditions. That federal regulation likely exempts ADA from the state labeling law, Benesh said.",
      "\u201cThe law, as passed, may not end up having the impact that legislators intended,\u201d Benesh said.",
      "Nutrition experts have long worried about the potential health effects of food additives, even as it remains unclear how much of a role processed foods have in driving chronic health disease.",
      "Research has shown that requiring food label warnings can help steer consumers toward healthier choices and prompt industry to remove concerning ingredients. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has proposed front-of-package labels that would flag levels of saturated fat, sugar and sodium.",
      "\u201cThis represents a big win for Texas consumers and consumers overall,\u201d said Brian Ronholm, director of food policy for Consumer Reports. \u201cIt\u2019s a reflection of states not wanting to wait for the federal government to act.\u201d",
      "The law also creates a state nutrition advisory committee, boosts physical education and nutrition curriculum requirements in public and charter schools, and requires nutrition courses for college students and medical professionals doing continuing education.",
      "Several states have been taking action to restrict dyes and additives in foods.",
      "In 2023, California became the first state to ban some chemicals and dyes used in candies, drinks and other foods because of health concerns. The state expanded on that last year by barring several additional dyes from food served in public schools.",
      "Other laws passed this year include one in Arkansas banning two particular additives from food sold or manufactured in the state and a West Virginia law includes a statewide ban on seven dyes.",
      "Lawmakers in several states have passed measures this year banning certain additives from food served or sold at public schools, according to an Associated Press analysis using the bill-tracking software Plural. That includes Texas, where the governor last month signed a bill banning foods with certain ingredients from being served in school lunches.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a pretty dizzying time to be watching what\u2019s happening, because usually policies that are not very industry friendly are opposed, particularly in red states,\" said Christina Roberto, director of the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Center for Food and Nutrition Policy, \u201cWith RFK and the MAHA movement, it\u2019s really turned things upside-down in some ways.\u201d",
      "At the federal level, Kennedy and FDA Commissioner Marty Makary have pledged to remove artificial dyes from foods and have pressured industry to take voluntary action. Some large food manufacturers have complied.",
      "Health advocates have long called for the removal of artificial dyes from foods, citing mixed studies indicating they can cause neurobehavioral problems, including hyperactivity and attention issues, in some children.",

The dome of high pressure that's parking over the eastern United States is trapping hot air from the Southwest that already made an uncomfortable stop in the Midwest.",
      "A key measurement of the strength of the high pressure broke a record Monday and was the third-highest reading for any date, making for a \u201cnear historic\u201d heat wave, said private meteorologist Ryan Maue, a former National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration chief scientist. The worst of the heat was likely to peak for Northeastern cities on Tuesday, forecasters said.",
      "\u201cLike an air fryer, it\u2019s going to be hot,\" Maue said. \u201dThis is a three-day stretch of dangerous heat that will test the mettle of city dwellers who are most vulnerable to oppressive heat waves.\u201d",
      "A heat dome occurs when a large area of high pressure in the upper atmosphere acts as a reservoir, trapping heat and humidity. A heat wave is the persistence of heat, usually three days or more, with unusually hot temperatures.",
      "Nearly three-quarters of the country's population \u2014 245 million people \u2014 will swelter with 90 degrees Fahrenheit (about 32 Celsius) or higher temperatures on Monday, and 33 million people, almost 10% of the country, will feel blistering 100-degree heat (about 38 Celsius) on Tuesday, Maue said. The government's heat health website showed the highest level of heat risk in swaths from Chicago to Pittsburgh and North Carolina to New York.",
      "Those triple-digit air temperatures \u2014 with the feels-like index even worse because of humidity \u2014 are possible in places where it\u2019s unusual. New York hasn\u2019t seen 100 degrees since 2011 and Philadelphia, which is forecast to have consecutive triple-digit days, hasn\u2019t reached that mark since 2012, said Climate Central chief meteorologist Bernadette Woods Placky.",
      "In downtown Baltimore, temperatures climbed into the high 90s by early Monday afternoon, bringing dozens of people to cool off at St. Vincent de Paul's resource center. A few blocks away, the city's historic Broadway Market food hall closed early when the building's air conditioning broke.",
      "The heat forced the cancellation of events in west Baltimore, said Eric Davis Sr., who spends most of his days working at a baseball field there.",
      "\u201cYou can\u2019t have kids getting heat stroke,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just too hot today.\u201c",
      "NOAA meteorologist David Roth said it takes time to acclimate to summer heat and this heat dome could be a shock for some.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re talking about some places that could be 40 degrees warmer than last week. So that\u2019s a big deal,\u201d he said.",
      "The heat is part of Earth's long-term warming. Summers in the United States are 2.4 degrees (1.3 degrees Celsius) hotter than 50 years ago, according to NOAA data. Human-caused climate change has made this heat wave three times more likely than without the burning of coal, oil and gas, the climate science nonprofit Climate Central calculated, using computer simulations comparing the current weather to a fictional world without the industrial greenhouse gases.",
      "A key question is how much humidity will add to the discomfort and danger of the heat.",
      "Maue is forecasting dry air which may be a degree or two or three hotter than predicted by NOAA, but more comfortable. Other meteorologists expected worse: Sticky, humid and even more dangerous.",
      "\"The \u2018big deal' will be with the humidity being provided with the wet late spring conditions,\" said University of Oklahoma meteorology professor Jason Furtado. \u201cThe area of high pressure will allow for a lot of evaporation to occur from the wet grounds locally and regionally, which will increase the heat indices quite a bit.\u201d",
      "Woods Placky said to expect dew points, a key measure of humidity, in the 70s. That's downright tropical, with some places approaching a dew point of 80 \u2014 a level Woods Placky said feels like \u201cyou\u2019re in a swimming pool\u201d and \u201cthe atmosphere is absorbing you.\u201d",
      "If this heat were later in the summer, it might not be as dangerous because the human body can adjust to the seasonably warmer temperatures, but this one is coming within days of the solstice, Woods Placky and others said.",
      "\u201cIt will be a shock to the system,\u201d she said.",

      "The nation\u2019s major health insurers are promising to scale back and improve a widely despised practice that leads to care delays and complications.",
      "UnitedHealthcare, CVS Health's Aetna and dozens of other insurers said Monday that they plan to reduce the scope of health care claims subject to prior authorization, standardize the process and expand the number of responses done in real time.",
      "Prior authorization means insurers require approval before they\u2019ll cover medical care, a prescription or a service like an imaging exam. Insurers say they do this to guard against care overuse and to make sure patients get the right treatment.",
      "But doctors say the practice has grown in scope and complication, leading to frequent care delays. The fatal shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in December prompted many people to vent their frustrations with coverage issues like prior authorization.",
      "Dr. Mehmet Oz called prior the practice \u201ca pox on the system\u201d that hikes administrative costs during his Senate confirmation hearing in March to lead the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.",
      "Insurers said Monday that they will standardize electronic prior authorization by the end of next year to help speed up the process. They will reduce the scope of claims subject to it.",
      "They also plan to expand the number of real-time responses and ensure medical reviews are done for denied requests.",
      "Researchers say prior authorization has grown more common as care costs have climbed, especially for prescription drugs, lab testing, physical therapy and imaging exams.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re sort of trapped between care being unaffordable and then these non-financial barriers and administrative burdens growing worse,\u201d said Michael Anne Kyle, an assistant professor at the University of Pennsylvania who studies how patients access care.",
      "Nearly all customers of Medicare Advantage plans, the privately run version of the federal government's Medicare program, need prior authorization for some services, particularly expensive care like hospital stays, the health policy research organization KFF found in a study of 2023 claims. The study also found that insurers denied about 6% of all requests.",
      "Dr. Ashley Sumrall of Charlotte, North Carolina, says she has seen an increase in prior authorizations required for routine exams like MRIs. An oncologist who treats brain tumors, Sumrall said these images are critical for doctors to determine whether a treatment is working and to plan next steps.",
      "Doctors say delays from requests that are eventually approved or coverage rejections can harm patients by giving a disease time to progress untreated. They also can spike anxiety in patients who want to know whether their tumor has stopped growing and if insurance will cover the scan.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a term that we use called \u2018scanxiety,\u2019 and it\u2019s very real,\u201d said Sumrall, a member of the Association for Clinical Oncology\u2019s volunteer leadership.",
      "Different forms and varied prior authorization policies also complicate the process. Sumrall noted that every insurer \u201chas their own way of doing business.\u201d",
      "\u201cFor years, the companies have been unwilling to compromise, so I think any step in the direction of standardization is encouraging,\u201d she said.",

      "A new report finds that the number of abortions in the U.S. grew in 2024 as more women obtained pills through telehealth",
      "The number of abortions in the U.S. rose again in 2024, with women continuing to find ways to get them despite bans and restrictions in many states, according to a report out Monday.",
      "The latest report from the WeCount project of the Society of Family Planning, which supports abortion access, was released a day before the third anniversary of the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling that overturned Roe v. Wade and ended nearly 50 years of legal abortion nationally for most of pregnancy.",
      "Currently, 12 states are enforcing bans on abortion at all stages of pregnancy, with limited exceptions, and four have bans that kick in at or about six weeks into pregnancy \u2014 often before women realize they are pregnant.",
      "While the total number of abortions has risen gradually over those three years, the number has dropped to near zero in some states, while abortions using pills obtained through telehealth appointments have become more common in nearly all states.",
      "Pills are used in the majority of abortions and are also prescribed in person.",
      "The latest survey, released Monday, tallied about 1.1 million abortions nationally last year, or about 95,000 a month. That is up from about 88,000 monthly in 2023 and 80,000 a month between April and December of 2022. WeCount began after Roe was overturned, and the 2022 numbers don't include January through March, when abortions are traditionally at their highest.",
      "The number is still well below the historic peak in the U.S. of nearly 1.6 million a year in the late 1990s.",
      "The Society of Family Planning relies primarily on surveys of abortion providers and uses estimates.",
      "WeCount found that in the months before the Dobbs ruling was handed down, about 1 in 20 abortions was accessed by telehealth.",
      "But during the last three months of 2024, it was up to 1 in 4.",
      "The biggest jump over that time came in the middle of 2023, when laws in some Democratic-controlled states took effect with provisions intended to protect medical professionals who use telehealth to prescribe pills to patients in states where abortion is banned or where there are laws restricting telehealth abortion.",
      "WeCount found that about half of the telehealth abortions last year were facilitated by the shield laws. The number of telehealth abortions also grew for those in states without bans.",
      "WeCount is the only nationwide public source of information about the pills prescribed to women in states with bans. One key caveat is that it is not clear how many of the prescriptions result in abortion. Some women may change their minds, access in-person abortion or be seeking pills to save for future use.",
      "The WeCount data could help explain data from a separate survey from the Guttmacher Institute, which found the number of people crossing state lines for abortion declined last year.",
      "Anti-abortion efforts are zeroing in on pills, along with barring federal funds for Planned Parenthood and undoing ballot measures that provided for abortion access.",
      "Three states have sued to try to get courts to limit telehealth prescriptions of mifepristone, one of the two drugs usually used in combination for medication abortions. President Donald Trump's administration last month told a judge it does not believe the states have legal standing to make that case.",
      "The U.S. Supreme Court last year found that anti-abortion doctors and their organizations didn't have standing, either.",
      "Meanwhile, officials in Louisiana are using criminal laws, and there is an effort in Texas to use civil penalties against a New York doctor accused of prescribing abortion pills to women in their states. Louisiana lawmakers have also sent the governor a bill to further restrict access to the pills.",
      "SBA Pro-Life America President Marjorie Dannenfelser said on a call with reporters Monday that it's a priority for her group to keep pushing U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and other officials to investigate the safety of abortion pills \u2014 and to require that they be dispensed only in person.",

      "Abbott, a Republican, waited until the final moment to veto the bill in what would have been one of the most restrictive THC bans in the country and a significant blow to the state's billion-dollar industry.",
      "The law would have made it a misdemeanor to own, manufacture or sell consumable THC, or tetrahydrocannabinol, products and was the latest push by states to regulate THC after a 2018 federal law allowed states to regulate hemp, a similar plant to marijuana that can be synthetically processed to produce THC, the compound giving marijuana its psychoactive properties.",
      "Loopholes in existing law have allowed many THC-infused goods to enter the market across the country, including states with strict marijuana laws.",
      "Texas has some of the strictest marijuana laws in the country, prohibiting all recreational use and providing a limited medical marijuana program. The consumables market has allowed residents to legally access goods giving a similar high to marijuana.",
      "Republican lawmakers have criticized the products as dangerous due to a lack of federal oversight in how the goods are manufactured. Texas' ban is one of the more far-reaching among states that have taken similar steps. Several states, including California, have imposed age limits and restrictions on the potency of THC products.",
      "Critics of the Texas bill say it allows people who cannot access marijuana through the state's medical marijuana program to acquire goods that can provide a similar relief.

      "Everyone needs protein \u2014 it's vital for the growth, repair and maintenance of your muscles, bones and skin",
      "The human body needs protein. Proteins carry out countless functions inside cells and they are vital for the growth, repair and maintenance of muscles, bones and skin. And with food companies rolling out high-protein versions of a huge range of foods, including milkshakes and granola bars \u2014 and even pancakes and popcorn \u2014 you might be tempted to think you need to add more to your diet.",
      "But nutritionists say that if you are getting enough food, you are probably getting enough protein.",
      "\u201cAdding protein to foods is very beneficial \u2014 for the profits of that food,\u201d said Federica Amati, nutrition lead at Imperial College London and head nutritionist at the health science company ZOE. \u201cIt is not based on health, it is not backed by science.\u201d",
      "The amount of protein you need depends on your age, weight and personal nutritional needs and it is especially important for children and older adults to make sure they eat protein-rich foods. Here\u2019s what to know about how much protein you need and how to ensure you're getting it from the best sources.",
      "Protein is a macronutrient, or a basic kind of food like fat or carbohydrates that your body needs to function. There are thousands of proteins, assembled from smaller molecules called amino acids \u2014 most of which can be made by the body.",
      "\u201cBecause protein is so important, our body has adapted really well to making sure that it can reassemble and change the building blocks of these amino acids to make sure we have what we need, as long as we\u2019re eating adequate amounts of food,\u201d Amati said.",
      "Still, the body can't make all the amino acids, so some must come from food.",
      "The World Health Organization recommends that healthy adults get about 0.4 grams of protein per pound of body weight (0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight). That's roughly 60 grams for men and 50 grams for women per day, based on body weights of 165 pounds (75 kilograms) for men and 143 pounds (65 kilograms) for women.",
      "In most rich countries, the average adult gets far more, Amati said. Protein deficiencies are mostly seen in malnourished people on subsistence diet in poorer countries, she said.",
      "Bridget Benelam, a nutritionist with the British Nutrition Foundation, said it was important to get protein from different foods, like dairy, fish, beans, nuts, vegetables and meat. She said studies suggest vegetarians and vegans have lower protein intake than meat and fish eaters, but that their average protein levels are still OK.",
      "Having some protein at every meal is also a likely a good idea. \u201cIt appears to be better for preserving muscle function if you have some protein throughout the day, rather than just having it all in one meal,\u201d Benelam said.",
      "Plant-based sources of protein include foods such as beans, lentils, peas, nuts, seeds, tofu, tempeh and meat substitutes. Fish, meat, poultry, eggs and dairy foods such as milk and yogurt are also good sources of protein. Amati said that proteins from animal-based sources may be easier for the body to break down compared to plant-based proteins, which tend to have more fiber.",
      "\u201cIf you eat a piece of beef, you\u2019re getting protein and things like zinc and iron, but you\u2019re also getting more saturated fat,\u201d she said. In comparison, Amati said eating protein-rich foods like chickpeas or beans also provides the body with fiber, something that's lacking in most of our diets.",
      "\u201cUnless you have a specific health issue that requires you to have more protein, most people in countries like the U.S. and the U.K. do not need more,\u201d said Benelam of the British Nutrition Foundation.",
      "Amati, of Imperial College London, said people should scrutinize the ingredient list of protein-enriched products to make sure they aren\u2019t loaded with sugar and fat.",
      "For people trying to build more muscle, she recommended a more direct solution: exercise.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re worried about your body composition and muscle strength, you have to lift (heavier) weights and give your body a challenge,\u201d Amati said. \u201cEating a protein bar is not going to help.\u201d",

      "An Argentine judge has ordered that the 10 Lebanese and Iranian citizens accused of involvement in the 1994 bombing of a Jewish community center in Buenos Aires face trial in absentia",
      "BUENOS AIRES, Argentina -- An Argentine judge on Thursday ordered that the seven Iranians and three Lebanese citizens accused of involvement in the 1994 bombing of a Jewish community center in Buenos Aires face trial in absentia for the first time in the long-running case plagued by setbacks and controversy.",
      "For years Argentine courts have ordered that the suspects \u2014 Iranian former officials and Lebanese nationals \u2014 be apprehended and brought before a judge because Argentina never allowed trials in absentia.",
      "Past efforts to encourage foreign governments to arrest the suspects, including an influential advisor to Iran's supreme leader, on the basis of Interpol red alerts never gained traction.",
      "But right-wing President Javier Milei, a loyal ally of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and fierce critic of Iran who studies the Torah with a rabbi despite being born Catholic, pushed a bill through Congress earlier this year that authorizes trials in absentia for fugitives that have long sought to evade justice \u2014 allowing Argentina to put the defendants on trial for the first time.",
      "On Thursday, Judge Daniel Rafecas approved the trial in absentia following a request from the special prosecutor\u2019s office responsible for investigating the 1994 attack, the deadliest in the South American country\u2019s history, which killed 85 people two years after a separate bombing of the Israeli Embassy in Buenos Aires killed 22 people.",
      "Rafecas described the trial as the only way to avoid impunity now more than 30 years after the bombing.",
      "\u201cTrial in absentia, however limited, remains a tool that allows us, at the very least, to attempt to uncover the truth, reconstruct what happened, and, above all, give those representing the victims a place to express themselves publicly in this process,\u201d he wrote in his ruling.",
      "Last year, a high court in Argentina ruled that the Iranian government had masterminded the 1994 attack on the center, known by its acronym AMIA, and that members of Lebanon's Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah had carried it out.",
      "Iran has long denied any involvement in the attacks.",
      "Among the seven Iranians who are subject to Argentine arrest warrants are former Intelligence Minister Ali Fallahian, former commander of Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard Mohsen Rezaei and former Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati, who now advises Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.",
      "The three Lebanese citizens include Salman Raouf Salman, who allegedly coordinated the attack, and fellow Hezbollah members Abdallah Salman and Hussein Mounir Mouzannar. All have been declared in contempt of court, in some cases decades ago.",
      "Advancing the AMIA case has been a key goal of Milei, who concluded a trip to Jerusalem on June 12, the night before Israel launched its unprecedented air campaign targeting Iran's nuclear sites and military leadership.",
      "Milei escalated his rhetoric against Iran and in support of Israel during the 12-day war between the regional foes, calling the Islamic republic \u201can enemy of Argentina\u201d and praising Israel as \u201csaving Western civilization.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Guatemala and Honduras have signed agreements with the U.S. to accept asylum seekers from other countries",
      "GUATEMALA CITY -- Guatemala and Honduras have signed agreements with the United States to potentially offer refuge to people from other countries who otherwise would seek asylum in the United States, U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said Thursday at the conclusion of her Central America trip.",
      "The agreements expand the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to provide the U.S. government flexibility in returning migrants not only to their own countries, but also to third countries as it attempts to ramp up deportations.",
      "Noem described it as a way to offer asylum-seekers options other than coming to the United States. She said the agreements had been in the works for months. with the U.S. government applying pressure on Honduras and Guatemala to get them done.",
      "\u201cHonduras and now Guatemala after today will be countries that will take those individuals and give them refugee status as well,\u201d Noem said. \u201cWe\u2019ve never believed that the United States should be the only option, that the guarantee for a refugee is that they go somewhere to be safe and to be protected from whatever threat they face in their country. It doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be the United States.\u201d",
      "Both governments denied having signed third safe country agreements when asked following Noem's comments.",
      "Guatemala's presidential communications office said the government did not sign a safe third country agreement nor any immigration related agreement during Noem's visit.",
      "They reaffirmed that Guatemala would receive Central Americans sent by the United States as a temporary stop on the return to their countries.",
      "Noem had said Thursday that \u201cpolitically, this is a difficult agreement for their governments to do.\u201d",
      "Both countries have limited resources and many needs making support for asylum seekers from other countries a tougher sell domestically. There are also the optics of two left-of-center governments appearing to help the Trump administration limit access to U.S. asylum.",
      "Noem said that during her Guatemala meeting, she was given the already signed agreement. While later there was a public signing ceremony for a memorandum of understanding that establishes a Joint Security Program that will put U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers in the Guatemalan capital's international airport to help train local agents to screen for terrorist suspects.",
      "Honduras' immigration director Wilson Paz denied such an agreement was signed and its Foreign Affairs Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "During U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s first term, the U.S. signed such accords called safe-third country agreements with Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala. They effectively allowed the U.S. to declare some asylum seekers ineligible to apply for U.S. protection and permitted the U.S. government to send them to those countries deemed \u201csafe.\u201d",

But in Guatemala\u2019s case it was to only be a point of transit for migrants who would then return to their homelands, not to apply for asylum there. And in El Salvador, it was broader, allowing the U.S. to send migrants to be imprisoned there.",
      "Mexico President Claudia Sheinbaum said Tuesday that Mexico would not sign a third safe country agreement, but at the same time Mexico has accepted more than 5,000 migrants from other countries deported from the U.S. since Trump took office. She said Mexico accepted them for humanitarian reasons and helped them return to their home countries.",
      "The U.S. also has agreements with Panama and Costa Rica to take migrants from other countries though so far the numbers sent have been relatively small. The Trump administration sent 299 to Panama in February and fewer than 200 to Costa Rica.",
      "The agreements give U.S. authorities options, especially for migrants from countries where it is not easy for the U.S. to return them directly.",

      "Manuel Somoza, president of strategies of CIBanco, told local press that they only heard about the order the same time it was made public, and noted that it wasn't a formal legal accusation, but rather an investigation.",
      "\u201cOur books are open,\" he said. \u201dRumors are clearly damaging, whether they\u2019re true or not. So, what we want is for (American authorities) to come and investigate.\"",
      "Sheinbaum said they were notified by American officials of the accusations ahead of the Wednesday announcement, and that Mexican financial regulators carried out their own investigations into the institutions.",
      "They found \"administrative infractions,\" she said, but nothing close to the accusations being levied by Treasury officials.",
      "In the orders blocking transactions between the three institutions and American banks, the Trump administration alleged that the three companies facilitated millions of dollars in transfers with Chinese companies, which it said were used to buy chemicals to produce fentanyl. The Treasury Department said the institutions had facilitated transfers to U.S. banks, but officials would not name which U.S. institutions were implicated nor provide more details.",
      "Sheinbaum countered that their own investigation simply showed that institutions had strong relationships with Chinese clients and banks, which she said was more of an indicator that the two countries share a robust trade relationship. China has been the main source of chemical precursors to produce fentanyl in Mexico, according to U.S. authorities. At the same time, the U.S. has increasingly sought to block growing Chinese influence and investment in Latin America.",
      "The leader also expressed frustration on Thursday morning, reminding Trump officials that Mexico is a sovereign nation and must be treated as an equal by the U.S. government.",

      "In February, the rebels closed settlement camps, leading to the displacement of more than 110,000 people in just a few days, according to the U.N. and locals.",
      "Maombi Pascaline, a displaced person living in Shasha, a rebel-controlled town near Goma, said she and her six children fled the M23 advance and found refuge in camps before M23 forced them to return home.",
      "\u201cWhen they arrived, they told us to go back home because the war was over. They said that anyone who didn\u2019t obey would be considered an enemy,\u201d Pascaline told The Associated Press.",

      "\u201cWhen M23 arrived, they said they would burn down the camp that was sheltering us. Each of us was told to destroy our little makeshift shelter, which forced us to leave,\" Rusezera said. \"Today, we\u2019re left with nothing.\u201d",
      "M23 is one of about 100 armed groups that have been vying for a foothold in mineral-rich eastern Congo near the border with Rwanda, in a conflict that has created one of the world\u2019s most significant humanitarian crises. More than 4 million people have been displaced, including hundreds of thousands who fled homes this year.",

      "The Vatican Museums has unveiled the last and most important of the restored Raphael Rooms",
      "VATICAN CITY -- The Vatican Museums on Thursday unveiled the last and most important of the restored Raphael Rooms, the spectacularly frescoed reception rooms of the Apostolic Palace that in some ways rival the Sistine Chapel as the peak of high Renaissance artistry.",
      "A decade-long project to clean and restore the largest of the four Raphael Rooms uncovered a novel mural painting technique that the superstar Renaissance painter and architect began but never completed: the use of oil paint directly on the wall, and a grid of nails embedded in the walls to hold in place the resin surface onto which he painted.",
      "Vatican Museums officials recounted the discoveries on Thursday in inaugurating the hall, known as the Room of Constantine, after the last scaffolding came down. The reception room, which was painted by Raphael and his students starting in the first quarter-century of the 1500s, is dedicated to the fourth-century Roman emperor Constantine whose embrace of Christianity helped spread the faith throughout the Roman Empire.",
      "\u201cWith this restoration, we rewrite a part of the history of art,\u201d Vatican Museums director Barbara Jatta said.",
      "Pope Julius II summoned the young Raphael Sanzio from Florence to Rome in 1508 to decorate a new private apartment for himself in the Apostolic Palace, giving the then 25-year-old painter and architect a major commission at the height of his artistic output.",
      "Even at the time, there were reports that Raphael had wanted to decorate the rooms not with frescoes but with oil paint directly on the wall, to give the images greater brilliance. The 10-year restoration of the Rome of Constantine proved those reports correct, said Fabio Piacentini, one of the chief restorers.",
      "Vatican technicians discovered that two female figures, Justice and Courtesy and located on opposite corners of the hall, were actually oil-on-wall paintings, not frescoes in which paint is applied to wet plaster. They were therefore clearly the work of Raphael himself, he said.",
      "But Raphael died on April 6, 1520, at the age of 37, and before the hall could be completed. The rest of the paintings in the room were frescoes completed by his students who couldn\u2019t master the oil technique Raphael had used, Jatta said.",
      "During the cleaning, restorers discovered that Raphael had clearly intended to do more with oil paints: Under the plaster frescoes, they found a series of metal nails which they believed had been drilled into the wall to hold in place the natural resin surface that Raphael had intended to paint onto, Piacentini said.",
      "\u201cFrom a historical and critical point of view, and also technical, it was truly a discovery,\u201d he said. \u201cThe technique used and planned by Raphael was truly experimental for the time, and has never been found in any other mural made with oil paint.\u201d",
      "The final part of the restoration of the room was the ceiling, painted by Tommaso Laureti and featuring a remarkable example of Renaissance perspective with his fresco of a fake tapestry \u201cTriumph of Christianity over Paganism.\u201d",
      "The Raphael Rooms were never fully closed off to the public during their long restoration, but they are now free of scaffolding for the many visitors flocking to the Vatican Museums for the 2025 Jubilee.",

      "A large wildfire has broken out south of the Greek capital, with authorities sending push alerts to mobile phones urging people to evacuate from five settlements near the blaze",
      "ATHENS, Greece -- A large wildfire broke out Thursday south of Athens, prompting authorities to send phone alerts urging the evacuation of five communities near the blaze as temperatures approached 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) in Greece\u2019s first heat wave of the summer.",
      "Eight water-dropping planes and five helicopters provided air support to 90 firefighters battling the blaze in the Palaia Fokaia seaside area south of Athens, the fire department said. The fire, which reportedly broke out within a populated area, was fanned by strong winds, sending plumes of smoke fanning out across the sky. Footage from local television showed at least one house burning.",
      "The coast guard said two patrol boats and nine private vessels were on standby in the Palaia Fokaia area in case an evacuation by sea became necessary, while a lifeboat was also on its way.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re telling people to leave their homes,\u201d local town councilor Apostolos Papadakis said on Greece\u2019s state-run ERT television.",
      "The entire wider Athens area, as well as several Aegean islands, were on Level 4 of a 5-level scale for the danger of wildfires due to the weather conditions, with the heat wave expected to last until the weekend.",
      "Earlier in the week, hundreds of firefighters took four days to bring a major wildfire under control on the eastern Aegean island of Chios. More than a dozen evacuation orders had been issued for Chios, where the flames devoured forest and farmland. The fire department said one woman had been arrested on suspicion of having contributed to that fire\u2019s start \u2013 reportedly by discarding a cigarette.",
      "Wildfires are frequent in Greece during its hot, dry summers. In 2018, a massive fire swept through the seaside town of Mati, east of Athens, trapping people in their homes and on roads as they tried to flee. More than 100 died, including some who drowned trying to swim away from the flames.",

      "Ukrainian forces claim to have stopped Russia\u2019s advance into the northern Sumy region, stabilizing the front line near the border",
      "KYIV, Ukraine -- Ukrainian forces have halted Russia\u2019s recent advance into the northern Sumy region and have stabilized the front line near the border with Russia, Ukraine\u2019s top military commander said Thursday.",
      "Col. Gen. Oleksandr Syrskyi, commander in chief of Ukraine\u2019s armed forces, said that Ukrainian successes in Sumy have prevented Russia from deploying about 50,000 Russian troops, including elite airborne and marine brigades, to other areas of the front line.",
      "His claim couldn't be independently verified, and Russian officials made no immediate comment.",
      "Russian forces have been slowly grinding forward at some points on the roughly 1,000-kilometer (620-mile) front line, though their incremental gains have been costly in terms of troop casualties and armor. The outnumbered Ukrainian army has relied heavily on drones to keep the Russians back.",
      "Months of U.S.-led international efforts to stop the more than three years of fighting have failed.",
      "Sumy, the city which is the capital of the Ukrainian region of the same name, had a prewar population of around 250,000. It lies about 20 kilometers (12 miles) from the front line. Russia\u2019s push into the Sumy region earlier this year compelled Ukraine to strengthen its defenses there.",
      "A special defense group has been formed to improve security in Sumy and surrounding communities, Syrskyi said. It's focusing on improving fortifications and accelerating construction of defensive barriers.",
      "In March, Ukrainian forces withdrew from much of Russia\u2019s neighboring Kursk region, parts of which they had controlled after a surprise cross-border attack in August.",
      "That retreat enabled Russia to launch a counteroffensive that advanced between 2-12 kilometers (1-7 miles) into Ukrainian territory, according to different estimates.",
      "Ukrainian officials say fierce fighting is also taking place in the eastern Donetsk region.",
      "The Russian Defense Ministry said Thursday that its forces have captured two villages, Novoserhiivka and Shevchenko, in Donetsk.",
      "Capturing Shevchenko marked an important stage in Russia\u2019s ongoing offensive that is trying to break into Ukraine\u2019s Dnipropetrovsk region, which borders Donetsk and is a major industrial center, according to the Defense Ministry.",
      "Meanwhile, the two sides continued to launch long-range strikes.",
      "Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry said that 50 Ukrainian drones were downed over nine regions overnight, including three over the Moscow region.",
      "Ukraine's air force said that Russia deployed 41 Shahed and decoy drones across the country overnight, wounding five people. It said that 24 drones were either intercepted or jammed.",

      "LONDON -- The former chief executive of Barclays Bank, Jes Staley, lost a legal challenge Thursday against a 2023 decision by Britain's financial regulator to ban him from holding senior financial roles in the United Kingdom for misleading it over the nature of his relationship with the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "The case centered on a letter sent from Barclays to the Financial Conduct Authority in 2019, which claimed that Staley did not have a \u201cclose relationship\u201d with Epstein and that their last contact was \u201cwell before\u201d he joined the bank in December 2015.",
      "He left the bank in 2021 following criticism of his ties to Epstein, who killed himself in a federal jail in August 2019, a month after his arrest on federal sex trafficking and conspiracy charges.",
      "The regulator had found that the letter was misleading and that Staley acted \u201crecklessly and without integrity\u201d by allowing it to be sent. Lawyers for the regulator told the tribunal in March that Staley and Epstein had a \u201cfriendship\u201d and maintained contact through Staley\u2019s daughter up to at least February 2017.",
      "In its ruling, the tribunal said it would have expected Staley, 68, to have been \u201cparticularly careful\u201d in ensuring the letter was accurate, and that his breaches of FCA rules represented \u201ca serious failure of judgment.\u201d",
      "It added that they saw \u201cno basis\u201d on which it should interfere with the decision to ban Staley, which was \u201ca course of action reasonably open\u201d to the FCA.",
      "The judgment also said that Staley had shown \u201cno remorse for his conduct.\u201d",
      "In addition to the ban, Staley, a U.S. citizen, had been fined 1.8 million pounds ($2.5 million) by the regulator. The tribunal did reduce that to around 1.1 million pounds.",
      "Staley's lawyers said that he \u201cnever attempted to conceal\" his relationship with Epstein, a claim unanimously dismissed by the three-person tribunal in London.",
      "Over the course of the hearing earlier this year, Staley admitted having a close professional relationship with Epstein. He had acted as a private banker to the disgraced financier during his previous time at JP Morgan Chase, but insisted they were not personally close.",
      "Following the FCA\u2019s decision in Oct. 2023, Barclays said Staley would not be eligible for, or would forfeit, bonuses and share awards totaling 17.8 million pounds. It had already suspended all of Staley\u2019s deferred bonuses and long-term share awards while the watchdog investigated.",
      "JP Morgan Chase has also agreed to pay $75 million to the U.S. Virgin Islands to settle claims that the bank enabled Epstein\u2019s sex-trafficking acts. It also reached a confidential settlement with Staley, who it had sued for allegedly concealing his personal activities with Epstein from the bank.",

      "At a reception for the U.S. Independence Day, U.S. Consul General Gregory May, who will join the U.S. Embassy in Beijing next month after a three-year term in Hong Kong, told reporters he is a \u201cbig fan\u201c of Hong Kong, and that its people and spirit made the city a good place.",
      "\u201cHong Kong is a great city. What is not great is the policies of the mainland Chinese government, the Hong Kong government, that have eroded freedom,\u201d he said.",
      "Following the 2019 anti-government movement that filled Hong Kong\u2019s streets with protesters, Beijing imposed a national security law that it deemed necessary for the city's stability. Under the law, Lai and many other leading activists were prosecuted.",

      "May said Washington is also concerned about others, jailed for the peaceful expression of political views.",

      "He was referring to accusations by Hong Kong authorities against some overseas-based activists claiming they violated the security law and offering rewards of 1 million Hong Kong dollars ($128,000) for information leading to each of their arrests.",
      "On Tuesday, the U.S. Consulate condemned the Hong Kong government for what it called repression of 4th of July celebrations after city education authorities reportedly cautioned teachers and students not to attend events marking the day and organized by American diplomats.",

      "Chinese police and media report that a driver hit several children near an elementary school in Beijing's Miyun district",
      "BEIJING -- A driver hit an unknown number of children with their car near an elementary school in an outlying district of Beijing, police and media reports said Thursday.",
      "It wasn't immediately clear if it was another case of a driver intentionally running into people in China.",
      "A short statement from police in Beijing's Miyun district described the cause only as \u201cimproper operation\u201d of the vehicle. The statement said it happened near the intersection of two streets, but didn't mention the nearby school or whether children were among the victims.",
      "Online maps show that Miyun No. 1 Elementary School is just north of the intersection. Miyun is about 60 kilometers (40 miles) northwest of central Beijing.",
      "Nearby shop owners told news outlet Caixin that several children had been injured, and a hospital told the outlet that it and one other hospital was treating some of the children. It wasn't clear if any had died.",
      "There have been several recent cases in China of drivers hitting people, often outside schools, as well as knife attacks on crowds. Police have previously said that the attackers were upset or depressed and taking out their anger on random targets.",
      "Chinese leader Xi Jinping made the issue a priority after a particularly deadly case in November that killed 35 people in Zhuhai, a city on China\u2019s southern coast.",
      "Since then, reports about the attacks have been censored, in an apparent attempt to prevent copycat crimes. Photos of the aftermath Thursday were quickly removed from social media sites and comments on what had happened were taken down.",

      "Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei says his country has \u201cdelivered a hand slap to America\u2019s face\u201d with its strike on an American base in Qatar, and warned against any further U.S. attacks on Iran",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Thursday his country had delivered a \"slap to America\u2019s face\u201d with its strike on an American base in Qatar, and warned against any further U.S. attacks in his first public comments since a ceasefire was declared with Israel after 12 days of war.",
      "Khamenei spoke in a recorded video broadcast on Iranian state television, his first appearance since June 19. The 86-year-old looked and sounded more tired than he did only a week ago, speaking in a hoarse voice and occasionally stumbling over his words.",
      "The more-than 10 minute speech by the supreme leader was filled with warnings and threats directed toward the United States and Israel.",
      "He downplayed Sunday's U.S. strikes on three Iranian nuclear sites using bunker-buster bombs and cruise missiles, saying that U.S. President Donald Trump \u2014 who said the attack \"completely and fully obliterated Iran's nuclear program \u2014 had \u201cexaggerated\u201d its impact.",
      "\u201cThey could not achieve anything significant,\u201d he said.",
      "The head of the U.N. nuclear watchdog, International Atomic Energy Agency Director Rafael Grossi, reiterated on Thursday that the damage done by Israeli and U.S. strikes at Iranian nuclear facilities \u201cis very, very, very considerable.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think annihilated is too much but it suffered enormous damage,\u201d Grossi told French broadcaster RFI.",
      "Iran\u2019s Foreign Ministry spokesman, Esmail Baghaei, on Wednesday also conceded that \"our nuclear installations have been badly damaged, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d",
      "Khamenei has not been seen in public since taking shelter in a secret location after the outbreak of the war June 13 when Israel attacked Iranian nuclear facilities and targeted top military commanders and scientists.",
      "Following Sunday's U.S. attack on Iran's nuclear facilities, Trump was able to help negotiate a ceasefire that came into effect on Tuesday.",
      "Khamenei claimed the U.S. had only intervened in the war because \u201cit felt that if it did not intervene, the Zionist regime would be utterly destroyed.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt entered the war to save them, yet it gained nothing,\u201d he said.",
      "He said his country's attack on the U.S. base in Qatar on Monday was significant, since it shows Iran \u201chas access to important U.S. centers in the region and can act against them whenever it deems necessary.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe Islamic Republic was victorious and, in retaliation, delivered a hand slap to America\u2019s face,\u201d he said, adding \u201cthis action can be repeated in the future.\"",
      "\u201cShould any aggression occur, the enemy will definitely pay a heavy price,\u201d he said.",
      "Since the ceasefire, life has been gradually returning to normal in Iran.",
      "On Thursday, Iran partially reopened its airspace, which had been shut down since the war broke out, and shops in the capital of Tehran began to reopen, with traffic returning to the streets.",
      "Majid Akhavan, spokesperson for the Ministry of Roads and Urban Development, said Iran had reopened the airspace for the eastern half of the country to domestic and international flights, including those transiting Iranian airspace.",
      "Earlier this week, Tehran said 606 people had been killed in the conflict in Iran, with 5,332 people wounded. The Washington-based Human Rights Activists group released figures Wednesday suggesting Israeli strikes on Iran had killed at least 1,054 and wounded 4,476.",
      "The group, which has provided detailed casualty figures from multiple rounds of unrest in Iran, said 417 of those killed were civilians and 318 were security forces.",
      "At least 28 people were killed in Israel and more than 1,000 wounded, according to officials there.",
      "During the 12-day war, Iran fired more than 550 missiles at Israel with a 90% interception rate, according to new statistics released by Israeli authorities on Thursday. Israel, meantime, hit more than 720 Iranian military infrastructure targets and eight nuclear-related sites, Israel said.",
      "Trump has also asserted that American and Iranian officials will talk next week, giving rise to cautious hope for longer-term peace.",
      "Iran has not acknowledged any such talks would take place, though U.S. Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff has said there has been direct and indirect communication between the countries. A sixth round of U.S.-Iran negotiations was scheduled for earlier this month in Oman but was canceled after Israel attacked Iran on June 13.",
      "Iran has insisted that it will not give up its nuclear program. In a vote underscoring the tough path ahead, its parliament agreed Wednesday to fast-track a proposal that would effectively stop the country\u2019s cooperation with the IAEA, which has monitored the program for years.",

      "After a meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Pyongyang last week, top Russian security official Sergei Shoigu said Kim decided to send 1,000 sappers and 5,000 military construction workers to help rebuild the war-torn area. North Korea has already provided combat troops and ammunition to support Russia\u2019s war efforts against Ukraine.",
      "On Thursday, South Korea\u2019s National Intelligence Service told a closed-door parliamentary committee meeting that the dispatch of those 6,000 additional military personnel will likely come as early as July or August, according to Lee Seong Kweun, one of the lawmakers who attended the meeting.",
      "Lee cited the NIS as saying that North Korea has begun recruiting soldiers to be sent to Russia. He told reporters the NIS noted that North Korea\u2019s dispatch of combat troops last year came about one month after Shoigu visited North Korea and signed an agreement with Pyongyang officials.",
      "In April, Pyongyang and Moscow announced that their soldiers fought together to repel a Ukrainian incursion into Russia\u2019s Kursk border region. The two countries haven\u2019t disclosed how many North Koreans soldiers have been deployed in Russia, but South Korea, U.S. and Ukraine officials said North Korea last fall sent about 10,000-12,000 troops to Russia. South Korea said North Korea deployed about 3,000-4,000 additional soldiers to Russia earlier this year.",
      "In return for North Korea\u2019s supply of troops and weapons, Russia is believed to have given North Korea military and economic assistance. South Korea, the U.S. and their allies are concerned that Russia could even transfer sensitive technologies that can enhance North Korea\u2019s nuclear program.",
      "In its briefing Thursday, the NIS said it believed Russia has sent North Korea air defense systems, electronic jamming equipment and technological knowhow for space rocket engines, drones and missile guidance as well as unspecified economic help.",

      "Persistent protests started in November after a renovated rail station canopy collapsed that killed 16 people and which many blamed on rampant government corruption and negligence in state infrastructure projects. University students have been a key force behind the nationwide movement.",

The otherwise peaceful gathering on March 15 came to an abrupt end when part of the crowd suddenly scattered in panic, triggering allegations that authorities used a sonic weapon against peaceful protesters, which they have denied.",

      "NEW YORK -- Hundreds of millions of \u2018Buy Now, Pay Later\u2019 loans will soon affect credit scores for millions of Americans who use the loans to buy clothing, furniture, concert tickets, and takeout.",
      "Scoring company FICO said Monday that it is rolling out a new model that factors the short-term loans into their consumer scores. A majority of lenders use FICO scores to determine a borrower\u2019s credit worthiness. Previously, the loans had been excluded, though Buy Now, Pay Later company Affirm began voluntarily reporting pay-in-four loans to Experian, a separate credit bureau, in April.",
      "The new FICO scores will be available beginning in the fall, as an option for lenders to increase visibility into consumers' repayment behavior, the company said. Still, not all Buy Now, Pay Later companies share their data with the credit bureaus, and not all lenders will opt in to using the new models, so widespread adoption could take time, according to Adam Rust, director of financial services at the nonprofit Consumer Federation of America.",
      "Here's what to know.",
      "Typically, when using Buy Now, Pay Later loans, consumers pay for a given purchase in four installments over six weeks, in a model more similar to layaway than to a traditional credit card. The loans are marketed as zero-interest, and most require no credit check or only a soft credit check.",
      "The main three credit reporting bureaus, Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax, haven't yet incorporated a standard way of including these new financial products in their reports, since they don't adhere to existing models of lending and repayment. FICO, the score of the Fair Isaac Corporation, uses data from the bureaus to calculate its own credit score, and is independently choosing to pilot a new score that takes the loans into account.",
      "BNPL providers promote the plans as safer alternatives to credit cards, while consumer advocates warn about \u201cloan stacking,\u201d in which consumers take on many loans at once across several companies. So far, there's been little visibility into this practice in the industry, and the opacity has led to warnings of \u201cphantom debt\" that could mask the health of the consumer.",
      "In a statement, FICO said that their new credit score model is accounting for the growing significance of the loans in the U.S. credit ecosystem.",
      "\u201cBuy Now, Pay Later loans are playing an increasingly important role in consumers\u2019 financial lives,\u201d said Julie May, vice president and general manager of business-to-business scores at FICO. \u201cWe\u2019re enabling lenders to more accurately evaluate credit readiness, especially for consumers whose first credit experience is through BNPL products.\"",
      "FICO said the new model will responsibly expand access to credit. Many users of BNPL loans are younger consumers and consumers who may not have good or lengthy credit histories. In a joint study with Affirm, FICO trained its new scores on a sample of more than 500,000 BNPL borrowers and found that consumers with five or more loans typically saw their scores increase or remain stable under the new model.",
      "For consumers who pay back their BNPL loans in a timely way, the new credit scoring model could help them improve their credit scores, increasing access to mortgages, car loans, and apartment rentals. Currently, the loans don't typically contribute directly to improved scores, though missed payments can hurt or ding a score.",
      "Since March, credit scores have declined steeply for millions, as student loan payments resume and many student borrowers find themselves unable to make regular payments on their federal student loans.",
      "Nadine Chabrier, senior policy and litigation counsel at the Center for Responsible Lending, said her main concern is that the integration of the loans into a score could have unexpected negative effects on people who are already credit-restrained.",
      "\u201cThere isn\u2019t a lot of information out there about how integrating BNPL into credit scoring will work out,\u201d Chabrier said. \u201cFICO simulated the effect on credit scoring through a study. They saw that some users\u2019 scores increased. But if you factor in something that, last week, didn\u2019t affect your credit, and this week, it does, without having very much information about the modeling, it's a little hard to tell what the consequences will be.\u201d",
      "Chabrier cited research that\u2019s shown that many BNPL users have revolving credit card balances, lower credit scores, delinquencies, and existing debt. Women of color are also more likely to use the loans, she said.",
      "\u201cThis is a credit vulnerable community,\u201d said Chabrier.",
      "Rust, of the Consumer Federation of America, said he doesn't expect this to be a game-changer for consumers who already have a credit profile.",
      "\u201cAre we at a point where using BNPL loans will dramatically alter your credit profile? Probably not,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it's important that people have reasonable expectations.\u201d",
      "Rust said the average BNPL loan is for $135, and that repaying such small loans, even consistently, might not result in changes to a credit score that would significantly move the needle.",
      "\u201cIt's not about going from 620 to 624. It's about going from 620 to 780,\u201d he said, referring to the kind of credit score jumps that affect one's credit card offers, interest rates on loans, and the like.",
      "Still, Rust said that increased transparency around the loans could create a more accurate picture of a consumer's debts, which could improve accurate underwriting and keep consumers from over-extending themselves.",
      "\u201cThis addresses the problem of \u2018phantom debt,\u2019 and that\u2019s a good thing,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause it could be something that keeps people from getting too deeply into debt they can\u2019t afford.\u201d",

      "GE Appliances has announced a nearly half-billion-dollar project that will create 800 jobs and shift production of clothes washers from China to its manufacturing complex in Kentucky",
      "LOUISVILLE, Ky. -- GE Appliances announced a nearly half-billion-dollar project Thursday that it says will create 800 new jobs and shift production of clothes washers from China to its massive manufacturing complex in Kentucky.",
      "The $490 million investment positions the Kentucky home appliances company to rank as the biggest U.S. manufacturer of washing machines, it said.",
      "\u201cWe are bringing laundry production to our global headquarters in Louisville because manufacturing in the U.S. is fundamental to our \u2018zero-distance\u2019 business strategy to make appliances as close as possible to our customers and consumers,\u201d CEO Kevin Nolan said. \u201cThis decision is our most recent product reshoring and aligns with the current economic and policy environment.\u201d",
      "The announcement comes as President Donald Trump attempts to lure factories back to the United States by imposing import taxes \u2014 tariffs \u2014 on foreign goods. He has slapped 10% tariffs on imports from most countries and put 30% levies on Chinese goods. GE Appliances says nearly all the steel used in its U.S. manufacturing for its appliances comes from American steelmakers.",
      "GE Appliances said the project will move production of a combo washer/dryer and a lineup of front load washers from China to the Bluegrass State. In all, production of more than 15 models of front load washers will shift to the company's sprawling Louisville production complex \u2014 known as Appliance Park, it said. Once the added production is in place, the total area devoted to clothes care production at the Louisville complex will equal 33 football fields, it said.",
      "Kentucky Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear, who has criticized Trump's tariffs, hailed the company's deepening commitment to the state.",
      "\u201cToday's announcement brings more appliance manufacturing back to the United States and solidifies Kentucky and Louisville as the global headquarters of GE Appliances,\u201d the governor said.",
      "The redesigned factory will become its most advanced manufacturing plant for clothes washing production, the company said, featuring the latest in automation, robotics and material-handling technologies including automated guided vehicles and autonomous mobile robots.",
      "The new manufacturing lines will open in 2027, the company said.",
      "Next door at the complex's Building 1, the company produces top load washers and front load dryers.",
      "GE Appliances handles product design and engineering work at its Louisville headquarters but lacks overall production capacity to make all of its products at its U.S. plants. So it contracts with other manufacturers, including in China, for some of its production. The company said its core business strategy is to base production in the United States, and the investment announced Thursday is another step toward achieving that goal.",
      "\u201cManufacturing in Louisville puts production closer to our designers, engineers and consumers so that together we can create our most innovative laundry platforms,\u201d said Lee Lagomarcino, vice president of clothes care at GE Appliances.",
      "The $490 million infusion into Appliance Park is the latest round of investments in recent years as part of the company\u2019s growth strategy. It builds on the company's previous investments of $3.5 billion in U.S. manufacturing in the past decade, with more than one-third of the amount going to Appliance Park.",
      "Appliance Park in Louisville employs about 8,000 workers and is home to five plants that produce washers, dryers, dishwashers and refrigerators as well as parts and components. GE Appliances also has manufacturing plants in South Carolina, Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee and Connecticut.",

    "story": [
      "The Senate parliamentarian has advised that a Medicaid provider tax overhaul central to President Donald Trump's tax cut and spending bill doesn't adhere to procedural rules",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Senate parliamentarian has advised that a Medicaid provider tax overhaul central to President Donald Trump's tax cut and spending bill does not adhere to the chamber's procedural rules, delivering a crucial blow as Republicans rush to finish the package this week.",
      "Guidance from the parliamentarian is rarely ignored and Republican leaders are now forced to consider difficult options. Republicans were counting on big cuts to Medicaid and other programs to offset trillions of dollars in Trump tax breaks, their top priority. Additionally, the parliamentarian, who is the Senate's chief arbiter of its often complicated rules, advised against various GOP provisions barring certain immigrants from health care programs.",
      "Republicans scrambled Thursday to respond, with some calling for challenging, or ever firing, the nonpartisan parliamentarian, who has been on the job since 2012. GOP leaders dismissed those views and instead worked to revise the various proposals.",
      "\u201cWe have contingency plans,\u201d said Majority Leader John Thune of South Dakota.",
      "Friday's expected votes appeared to be slipping, but Thune insisted that \u201cwe\u2019re plowing forward.\u201d",
      "But Democrats, who are unified against the package as a tax giveaway for the wealthy at the expense of American safety net programs, said the procedural decisions would devastate the GOP package.",
      "Sen. Ron Wyden, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, said the Republican proposals would have meant $250 billion less for the health care program, \u201cmassive Medicaid cuts that hurt kids, seniors, Americans with disabilities and working families.\u201d",
      "The outcome is a setback as Senate Republicans race toward a weekend session to pass the bill and send it back to the House for another vote before Trump\u2019s Fourth of July deadline. Trump hosted House Speaker Mike Johnson and other GOP lawmakers in the East Room at the White House, joined by truck drivers, firefighters, tipped workers, ranchers and others that the administration says will benefit from the bill.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t want to have grandstanders,\u201d Trump said of the GOP holdouts.",
      "Trump said there are \u201chundreds of things\u201d in the emerging package of tax breaks, spending cuts and bolstered money to carry out his mass deportation plans. \u201cIt's so good.\u201d",
      "At its core, the big bill, which has passed the House and is now being revised in the Senate, includes $3.8 trillion in tax breaks that had been approved during Trump's first term but will expire in December, imposing a tax hike if Congress fails to act. To help offset lost revenues, Republicans are relying on steep cuts to health care and food stamps, and imposing new fees on immigrants.",
      "GOP leaders were already struggling to rally support for Medicaid changes that some senators said went too far and would have left millions without coverage. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has said more than 10.9 million more people would not have health care under the House-passed bill; Senate Republicans were proposing deeper cuts.",
      "After the parliamentarian advised against the Medicaid provider tax change, Republicans said they would try to revise the provision to make it acceptable, perhaps by extending the start date of any changes. They are rushing to come up with similar adjustments to other proposals that have run into violations, including one to change the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or food stamps.",
      "It's all delaying action on the bill, but Republican leaders have little choice. They are counting on the health care restrictions to save billions of dollars and offset the cost of trillions of dollars in tax cuts.",
      "Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., the Budget Committee chairman, rejected calls to fire the parliamentarian, and said in a statement he was working with the office to \u201cfind a pathway forward.\u201d",
      "States impose the so-called provider tax on hospitals and other entities as a way to help fund Medicaid, largely by boosting the reimbursements they receive from the federal government. Critics say the system is a type of \u201claundering,\u201d but almost every state except Alaska uses it to help provide health care coverage.",
      "The House-passed bill would freeze the tax, while the Senate would cut the tax that some states are allowed to impose.",
      "Several GOP senators have opposed cutting the Medicaid provider tax, saying it would hurt rural hospitals that depend on the money. Hospital organizations have warned that it could lead to hospital closures.",
      "Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., among those fighting the change, said he had spoken to Trump late Wednesday and the president told him to revert to the earlier proposal from the House.",
      "\u201cI think it just confirms that we weren\u2019t ready for a vote yet,\u201d said Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., who also had raised concerns about the provider tax cuts.",
      "More than 80 million people in the United States use the Medicaid program, alongside the Obama-era Affordable Care Act. Republicans want to scale Medicaid back to what they say is its original mission, providing care mainly to women and children, rather than a much larger group of people.",
      "To help defray lost revenues to the hospitals, one plan Republicans had been considering would have created a rural hospital fund with $15 billion as backup. Some GOP senators said that was too much; others, including Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, wanted at least $100 billion.",
      "The parliamentarian has worked around the clock to assess the legislation and ensure it complies with the so-called Byrd Rule, named for the late Sen. Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia. It essentially bars policy matters in budget reconciliation bills.",
      "If leaders moved ahead without altering the provisions, the measures could be challenged, requiring a 60-vote threshold to overcome objections. That would be a tall order in a Senate divided 53-47 and with Democrats unified against Trump's bill.",
      "\u201cIt's pretty frustrating,\u201d said Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., who wants even steeper reductions.",
      "Overnight Wednesday the parliamentarian advised against GOP student loan repayment plans, and Thursday the parliamentarian cited those that would have blocked access to Medicaid and other health care programs from immigrants who are not citizens. Earlier, plans to gut the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau were also found to violate the rules.",
      "But Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., said there's no desire to challenge the parliamentarian's advice. \u201cIt's the institutional integrity,\u201d he said. \u201cEven if I'm convinced 100% she's wrong.\u201d",
      "At the same time, Republicans lost another potential revenue source Thursday after agreeing to a request from Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to remove the so-called revenge tax provision, section 899, that would have allowed the government to impose taxes on companies with foreign owners and investors from certain countries. Bessent said he has reached a separate agreement with such countries.",

      "Power plants and industrial facilities that emit planet-warming carbon dioxide are hopeful that Congress will keep tax credits for capturing the gas and storing it deep underground",
      "Power plants and industrial facilities that emit carbon dioxide, the primary driver of global warming, are hopeful that Congress will keep tax credits for capturing the gas and storing it deep underground.",
      "The process, called carbon capture and sequestration, is seen by many as an important way to reduce pollution during a transition to renewable energy.",
      "But it faces criticism from some conservatives, who say it is expensive and unnecessary, and from environmentalists, who say it has consistently failed to capture as much pollution as promised and is simply a way for producers of fossil fuels like oil, gas and coal to continue their use.",
      "Here's a closer look:",
      "Carbon dioxide is a gas produced by burning of fossil fuels. It traps heat close to the ground when released to the atmosphere, where it persists for hundreds of years and raises global temperatures.",
      "Industries and power plants can install equipment to separate carbon dioxide from other gases before it leaves the smokestack. The carbon then is compressed and shipped \u2014 usually through a pipeline \u2014 to a location where it\u2019s injected deep underground for long-term storage.",
      "Carbon also can be captured directly from the atmosphere using giant vacuums. Once captured, it is dissolved by chemicals or trapped by solid material.",
      "Lauren Read, a senior vice president at BKV Corp., which built a carbon capture facility in Texas, said the company injects carbon at high pressure, forcing it almost two miles below the surface and into geological formations that can hold it for thousands of years.",
      "The carbon can be stored in deep saline or basalt formations and unmineable coal seams. But about three-fourths of captured carbon dioxide is pumped back into oil fields to build up pressure that helps extract harder-to-reach reserves \u2014 meaning it's not stored permanently, according to the International Energy Agency and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.",
      "The most commonly used technology allows facilities to capture and store around 60% of their carbon dioxide emissions during the production process. Anything above that rate is much more difficult and expensive, according to the IEA.",
      "Some companies have forecast carbon capture rates of 90% or more, \u201cin practice, that has never happened,\u201d said Alexandra Shaykevich, research manager at the Environmental Integrity Project\u2019s Oil & Gas Watch.",
      "That's because it's difficult to capture carbon dioxide from every point where it's emitted, said Grant Hauber, a strategic adviser on energy and financial markets at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.",
      "Environmentalists also cite potential problems keeping it in the ground. For example, last year, agribusiness company Archer-Daniels-Midland discovered a leak about a mile underground at its Illinois carbon capture and storage site, prompting the state legislature this year to ban carbon sequestration above or below the Mahomet Aquifer, an important source of drinking water for about a million people.",
      "Carbon capture can be used to help reduce emissions from hard-to-abate industries like cement and steel, but many environmentalists contend it's less helpful when it extends the use of coal, oil and gas.",
      "A 2021 study also found the carbon capture process emits significant amounts of methane, a potent greenhouse gas that\u2019s shorter-lived than carbon dioxide but traps over 80 times more heat. That happens through leaks when the gas is brought to the surface and transported to plants.",
      "About 45 carbon-capture facilities operated on a commercial scale last year, capturing a combined 50 million metric tons of carbon dioxide \u2014 a tiny fraction of the 37.8 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide emissions from the energy sector alone, according to the IEA.",
      "It's an even smaller share of all greenhouse gas emissions, which amounted to 53 gigatonnes for 2023, according to the latest report from the European Commission\u2019s Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research.",
      "The Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis says one of the world's largest carbon capture utilization and storage projects, ExxonMobil\u2019s Shute Creek facility in Wyoming, captures only about half its carbon dioxide, and most of that is sold to oil and gas companies to pump back into oil fields.",
      "Even so, carbon capture is an important tool to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, particularly in heavy industries, said Sangeet Nepal, a technology specialist at the Carbon Capture Coalition.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not a substitution for renewables ... it\u2019s just a complementary technology,\u201d Nepal said. \u201cIt\u2019s one piece of a puzzle in this broad fight against the climate change.\u201d",
      "Experts say many projects, including proposed ammonia and hydrogen plants on the U.S. Gulf Coast, likely won't be built without the tax credits, which Carbon Capture Coalition Executive Director Jessie Stolark says already have driven significant investment and are crucial U.S. global competitiveness.",
      "They remain in the Senate Finance Committee's draft reconciliation bill, after another version passed the House, though the Carbon Capture Coalition said inflation has already slashed their value and could limit projects.",

      "Jobless claims for the week ended June 21 dropped 10,000 to 236,000, a historically-low level. The four-week average of claims, which smooths out weekly volatility, dipped 750 to 245,000.",
      "Applications for unemployment aid are a proxy for layoffs, and so the decline is evidence that businesses are mostly holding onto their employees. Yet separate data suggests hiring also remains cool, in what economists are referring to as a \u201cno hire, no fire\u201d job market.",
      "The unemployment rate remains low, though there are signs that the economy is slowing. So far this year, employers have added a solid but unspectacular 124,000 jobs a month, down from an average 168,000 last year. Most of the hiring has been concentrated in a few industries, specifically health care, restaurants and hotels, and government. Layoffs have mostly remained low, but hiring has also been weak.",
      "Yet for many job-seekers, the sluggish creation of new jobs has been a challenge. Recent college graduates are facing the toughest job market in more than a decade. The unemployment rate for grads aged 22 to 27 is now higher than the overall jobless rate, and the gap between the two is the widest it has been in more than 30 years.",
      "The difficulty many of the unemployed are having in finding work can be seen in the number of people continuing to claim unemployment aid, which rose 37,000 to 1.97 million for the week ending June 14. That is the most since November 2021.",
      "Separately, the economy shrank 0.5% at an annual rate in the first three months of the year, the Commerce Department said Thursday, a worse showing than its previous estimate of a 0.2% decline. A flood of imports swamped the economy as companies rushed to bring in foreign goods before the Trump administration's tariffs took effect.",

The Commerce Department previously estimated that the economy fell 0.2% in the first quarter. Economists had forecast no change in the department's third and final estimate.",
      "The January-March drop in gross domestic product \u2014 the nation\u2019s output of goods and services \u2014 reversed a 2.4% increase in the last three months of 2024 and marked the first time in three years that the economy contracted. Imports expanded 37.9%, fastest since 2020, and pushed GDP down by nearly 4.7 percentage points.",
      "Consumer spending also slowed sharply, expanding just 0.5%, down from a robust 4% in fourth-quarter 2024 and sharp downgrade from the Commerce Department's previous estimate.",
      "A category within the GDP data that measures the economy\u2019s underlying strength rose at a 1.9% annual rate from January through March. It's a decent number, but down from 2.9% in the fourth quarter of 2024 and from the Commerce Department's previous estimate of 2.5% January-March growth.",
      "This category includes consumer spending and private investment but excludes volatile items like exports, inventories and government spending. Ryan Sweet of Oxford Economics called the downgrade in that figure \u201ctroubling,\u2033 though he doesn\u2019t expect to make a significant change to his near-term economic forecast.",
      "And federal government spending fell at a 4.6% annual pace, the biggest drop since 2022.",
      "Trade deficits reduce GDP. But that\u2019s just a matter of mathematics. GDP is supposed to count only what\u2019s produced domestically, not stuff that comes in from abroad. So imports \u2014 which show up in the GDP report as consumer spending or business investment \u2014 have to be subtracted out to keep them from artificially inflating domestic production.",
      "The first-quarter import influx likely won\u2019t be repeated in the April-June quarter and therefore shouldn\u2019t weigh on GDP. In fact, economists expect second-quarter growth to bounce back to 3% in the second quarter, according to a survey of forecasters by the data firm FactSet.",
      "The first look at April-June GDP growth is due July 30.",
      "____",
      "This story has been corrected to show that the drop in federal spending was the biggest since 2022, not 1986.",

    "story": [
      "The European Union is reassessing its ties with China strained relations with the United States",
      "BARCELONA, Spain -- Jilted, betrayed, dumped, or defiant. It's hard to describe the European Union after relentless attacks from its once-dependable ally, the United States. The threat from Donald Trump's second administration against Greenland, its sweeping tariff plans and courtship of Moscow have firmed up some European leaders\u2019 vows to reduce their reliance on America.",
      "That has not gone unnoticed in another global power. China hopes for a Europe detached from the U.S. and is sensing an opportunity now to divide the West. For the past several years, the EU moved in lockstep with Washington to levy tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles and sanction Chinese officials accused of rights violations.",
      "Now, locked in a trade war with Washington that may be prolonged, Beijing sees the 27-nation bloc as a desirable partner in blunting the impact from Trump\u2019s tariffs and to maintain its strong global position.",
      "But for EU leaders, meeting Thursday in Brussels to discuss China among a host of regional and global issues, managing ties with Beijing is no easy matter.",
      "An upcoming summit in China in July to mark 50 years of ties might offer the first hint of new consensus between these two global behemoths.",
      "The EU-China economic ties are hefty: bilateral trade is estimated at 2.3 billion euros ($2.7 billion) per day.",
      "China is the EU\u2019s second largest trading partner in goods, after the United States. Both China and the EU believe it is in their interest to keep their trade ties stable for the sake of the global economy, and they share certain climate goals.",
      "Like the U.S., Europe runs a massive trade deficit with China: around 300 billion euros last year. It relies heavily on China for critical minerals, which are also used to make magnets used in cars and appliances. As European companies are seeing declining profitability in China, Brussels is hoping Beijing will follow through on recent pledges, like one announced Thursday by the Ministry of Commerce, to ease restrictions on foreign business ventures.",
      "\u201cWhile other opened their market, China focused undercutting intellectual property protections, massive subsidies with the aim to dominate global manufacturing and supply chains,\u201d said EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen at the G7 meeting in Canada. \u201cThis is not market competition \u2013 it is distortion with intent.\"",
      "Now, Europe, already fretting over the trade deficit, worries that Trump's tariffs could divert even more Chinese goods to Europe, destabilizing markets across the continent.",
      "Such vulnerabilities could strengthen Beijing's negotiating position, said Alicia Garcia-Herrero, a China analyst with the Brussels-based Bruegel think tank.",
      "\u201cChina has built so many strategic dependencies that the EU is trapped in an asymmetric relationship,\u201d she said, and Beijing could leverage them to \u201cget a deal in July\" at the summit.",
      "Analysts don\u2019t expect a grand bargain at the summit, but China will likely demand the EU lift tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles or even reopen the bilateral trade treaty, the Comprehensive Agreement on Investment. Either or both would send a powerful signal to Washington.",
      "But China's main goal is ensuring the EU remains an accessible and affluent market for goods that might not reach the U.S. because of Trump\u2019s tariff blitzkrieg. Despite a truce in the trade war, Chinese businesses are widening their global reach to be less dependent on the U.S.",
      "Regardless of any deal, the summit itself will be the message, said Noah Barkin, an analyst of Europe-China relations at the German Marshall Fund think tank. For the EU, the main goal would be for von der Leyen to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping, he said.",
      "Whereas she was \u201ctreated rather shabbily\u201d on a 2023 trip to Beijing, Barkin said the Chinese this time will probably \u201croll out the red carpet,\" keen to see \u201cpictures of Chinese and European leaders walking through gardens and sending a message of unity.\u201d",
      "Sun Chenghao, head of the U.S.-EU program at Tsinghua University\u2019s Center for International Security and Strategy, expressed hope \u201cthat the future of China-Europe relations can be more independent on both sides.\u201d",
      "\u201cFor Europe, that would mean shaping its China policy based on its own interests, rather than simply taking sides,\u201d Sun told the German Marshall Fund in a podcast. \u201cAnd for China, this means building a more independent and nuanced approach to Europe.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt is precisely because most European decision-makers realize the necessity of strategic autonomy that they have made it clear that they must strengthen cooperation with China,\" said Yan Xuetong, dean of the Institute of International Relations at Tsinghua University, to The Paper, a Shanghai-based news site.",
      "\"Even if China and Europe have differences on the Ukraine issue, there is still room for expanding cooperation in areas beyond the differences.\u201d",
      "China\u2019s deepening ties with its historic allies in Europe like Hungary and Greece stand alongside fears across the continent about its human rights record, espionage, trade policies, military buildup and support for Russia.",
      "European police arrested employees of the Chinese tech giant Huawei during an ongoing bribery investigation in Brussels. Czech intelligence services have claimed Beijing directed cyberattacks on its critical infrastructure. And the EU\u2019s criticisms of China\u2019s human rights violations remain unabated.",
      "Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine has further disaffected Europe from China. Despite Beijing\u2019s claims of neutrality, Europe largely sees China as complicit in, if not covertly supporting Russia\u2019s war machine.",
      "The EU recently cancelled a high-level economic and trade dialogue with China, due to a lack of progress on trade disputes. It also has moved to restrict Chinese participation in EU medical devices procurement.",
      "U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has called out Spain for its courtship of China, warning that countries seeking to get closer to China would be \u201ccutting their own throat\u201d because Chinese factories will be looking to dump goods that they can\u2019t ship to the U.S.",
      "By decoupling their positions on China, analysts say both Brussels and Washington have weaker hands dealing with Beijing. And that might hurt the U.S., which has vowed to prevail over China and retain its global dominance but, as many believe, needs help from its allies and partners.",
      "\u201cIf we could just get Japan and the EU and the U.S. together on any issue, ... we could outweigh the Chinese at the negotiating table,\u201d said Nick Burns, the U.S. ambassador to China in the Biden administration. \u201cPresident Trump, I think, because of his inattention to our allies and maybe even worse, his sometimes just acrimonious behaviors towards allies, has given away that leverage.\u201d",
      "Joerg Wuttke, former president of the EU Chamber of Commerce in China and now a partner at DGA-Albright Stonebridge Group in Washington, argued that the fundamentals underlining EU-China relations have not changed as long as China does not take genuine steps to open its market and that the EU remains \u201cgeared towards\u201d the U.S., though he described Washington as a \u201cmajor backdrop noise.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are not allies. We are trading partners,\u201d Wuttke said of EU and China. \u201cAnd, so from my point of view is, what is there to worry for the United States?\u201d",

      "Tania Le\u00f3n, the noted composer and conductor who also co-founded Dance Theatre of Harlem, never planned on emigrating to the United States. She wanted to move to Paris.",
      "When Le\u00f3n received the opportunity to leave Cuba on a resettlement flight to Miami in 1967, she took it, thinking she would eventually end up settling in France where she would join the Conservatoire de Paris and become a concert pianist. Instead, she moved to New York and within months met Arthur Mitchell, the New York City Ballet dancer who achieved international acclaim and integrated the art form as its first Black star.",
      "\u201cYou cannot predict the future,\u201d Le\u00f3n told The Associated Press in an interview. \u201cBy a chance moment, I bumped into the man that in a way changed my life\u2026 and then he spoke to me about the creation of something that he had in mind that later on became the Dance Theatre of Harlem and then I was involved in all of this.\u201d",
      "\u201cAll of this\u201d \u2013 her composing, her conducting of the New York Philharmonic, her work on Broadway \u2013 led to Le\u00f3n being honored Thursday by the Carnegie Corp. of New York as part of its 20th class of Great Immigrants, Great Americans.",
      "\u201cI am just overwhelmed with this latest recognition about what I have been able to contribute because I didn\u2019t do it with the purpose of gaining awards and things like that,\u201d Leon said. \u201cI think that one has to convey the gratitude for the opportunities that I have received since I arrived.\"",
      "The 20 members of this year\u2019s class of Great Immigrants, Great Americans represent a wide range of immigration journeys, but they share a desire to give back to the country that has become their home. What the Carnegie initiative celebrates is also how American immigrants have improved their country.",
      "\u201cFor 20 years, our Great Immigrants public awareness initiative has been a reminder that many of the most influential figures in our country have been distinguished naturalized citizens, like our founder Andrew Carnegie, born in Scotland,\u201d Carnegie President Dame Louise Richardson -- also a naturalized American citizen, born in Ireland -- said in a statement. \u201cThe U.S. is a nation of immigrants and our ongoing support of nonpartisan organizations that help establish legal pathways for citizenship continues to enrich the very fabric of American life.\u201d",
      "British-born Massachusetts Institute of Technology Sloan School of Management professor Simon Johnson, another honoree from this year\u2019s Great Immigrants class, said immigrants have also enriched the American economy.",

They want to be productive. They want to improve their lives and have better futures for their kids\u2026 That dynamism we have is a big part of what\u2019s going well in many parts of the U.S.\u201d",
      "Johnson said the immigrant perspective helped the team on its prize-winning study, which studied countries and found that freer, open societies are more likely to prosper. And the support that academia in the United States provides is also helpful.",
      "\u201cAmerican universities have incredible opportunities -- lots of time for research, really interesting teaching, great students -- it\u2019s an amazing combination,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been incredibly lucky because it\u2019s a space that allows you to work hard and get lucky.\u201d",
      "This year\u2019s honorees are named as immigration becomes an increasingly contentious issue. President Donald Trump\u2019s administration is looking to add $150 billion to support his mass deportation agenda, which has drawn protests, as U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement looks to arrest 3,000 people in the country illegally each day.",
      "Maria Teresa Kumar, president and CEO of the civic engagement nonprofit Voto Latino and another of Carnegie\u2019s 2024 honorees, said the anti-immigration sentiment is painful on so many levels.",
      "\u201cA multicultural America is our secret superpower,\u201d said Kumar, who emigrated from Colombia with her family when she was four years old. \u201cThere are plenty of people in foreign interference that try to divide our country around race and status because they know that multiculturally, when human capital is what\u2019s going to determine the 21st Century, we are truly unstoppable\u2026 It\u2019s that diversity and value of thought that makes us really strong.

      "Colombian President Gustavo Petro has signed a controversial labor reform into law, delivering a significant increase in worker protections",
      "BOGOTA, Colombia -- Colombian President Gustavo Petro signed into law on Wednesday a controversial labor overhaul with the potential to profoundly shift the balance of power from employers to workers, a key victory for the left-wing leader even as Congress compelled him to scale back his more radical ambitions.",
      "The enactment of the law marks a milestone for a president who has struggled to deliver on his promises to reduce inequality in one of the region's most unequal nations. But it's faced opposition from business leaders and Colombian government bonds have suffered as markets worry about the fiscal and economic effects.",
      "The law increases overtime pay for salaried workers and limits the use of short-term contract workers, while requiring companies to provide medical coverage and social security for gig workers like food delivery drivers. It also promises student interns proper contracts and benefits like vacation time and severance pay.",
      "Many of Petro\u2019s efforts to vastly expand social programs have stalled in Congress, with lawmakers shooting down this labor law twice. Lawmakers let the legislation squeak by last week after Petro\u2019s moved to call a public referendum.",
      "Petro signed the legislation at the historic home of 19th-century war hero Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar, who led South America's fight against imperial Spain.",
      "He posted on social media platform X: \u201cI sign the labor reform into law before Bol\u00edvar and the working people.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe must elect a government that will uphold this law and enforce it,\u201d Petro said, alluding to the 2026 presidential elections.",
      "The reform was cheered by trade unions and Petro\u2019s political allies Wednesday.",
      "But his push to strengthen worker protections has proved controversial, as the expensive benefits are expected to hike up costs for business owners. Petro\u2019s government has promised to push through a new bill to help small businesses, though the details remain unclear.",
      "Opposition lawmakers have painted a nightmare scenario of mass layoffs that will push more workers into Colombia\u2019s already vast informal economy.",
      "Many say that the mandated reductions in working hours, increases in overtime pay for Sunday and holiday shifts will especially squeeze small and medium-sized businesses.",
      "Already, his government\u2019s increased spending and reduced tax income have challenged fiscal stability.",
      "Critics also say that the changes won\u2019t help informal workers without contracts, who represent over half of Colombia\u2019s total labor force, according to the latest figures. The legislation guarantees health and pension benefits for only some gig workers, such as app-based delivery workers.",
      "Then there\u2019s the question of compliance. \u201cI want to tell those employers who say they won\u2019t implement the labor reform that they\u2019re not intelligent,\u201d Petro said on Wednesday.",
      "Even as he hailed the law, it fell short of Petro's ambitions. He was forced to compromise on some key provisions to push it through a hostile Congress.",
      "Provisions stripped from the final version included extended paternity leave, paid leave for women with debilitating menstrual pain and some collective bargaining rights for unions.",
      "The signing of the law comes at a tumultuous time for the third largest nation in Latin America, with a wave of bombing attacks shaking the northeast and an assassination attempt on conservative presidential hopeful and senator Miguel Uribe stunning the country. Uribe remains in intensive care.",

      "Producers Amy Pascal and David Heyman had maintained that before the next Bond is cast, they would develop a screenplay and find a director first. Now, they have one of the most respected blockbuster makers in Hollywood, who's coming off a pair of widely acclaimed \u201cDune\u201d films.",
      "In a statement, the 57-year-old French Canadian filmmaker said he grew up watching Bond movies.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m a die-hard Bond fan. To me, he\u2019s sacred territory,\u201d said Villeneuve. \u201cI intend to honor the tradition and open the path for many new missions to come. This is a massive responsibility, but also, incredibly exciting for me and a huge honor.\u201d",
      "Since taking creative control of Bond in February, Amazon MGM has worked quickly to get the next movie going. The studio is also trying to win over fans skeptical of the new corporate leadership and the fearful of future spinoffs.",
      "\u201cJames Bond is in the hands of one of today\u2019s greatest filmmakers,\u201d said Mike Hopkins, head of Prime Video and Amazon MGM Studios.",
      "With Pascal and Heyman lodged as producers and Villeneuve behind the camera, the next Bond movie will have an enviable brain trust. Villeneuve beat out a field of directors floated for the movie including Edward Berger (\"Conclave\"), Paul King (\"Paddington 2\"), Edgar Wright (\"Baby Driver\") and Jonathan Nolan, co-creator of \u201cWestworld\u201d and brother to Christopher Nolan.",

      "One key issue stalling progress on President Donald Trump\u2019s big bill in Congress is particularly daunting",
      "WASHINGTON -- One key unsettled issue stalling progress on President Donald Trump's big bill in Congress is particularly daunting: How to cut billions from health care without harming Americans or the hospitals and others that provide care?",
      "Republicans are struggling to devise a solution to the health care problem their package has created. Already, estimates say 10.9 million more people would be without health coverage under the House-passed version of the bill. GOP senators have proposed steeper reductions, which some say go too far.",
      "\u201cThe Senate cuts in Medicaid are far deeper than the House cuts, and I think that\u2019s problematic,\u201d said GOP Sen. Susan Collins of Maine.",
      "Senators have been meeting behind closed doors and with Trump administration officials as they rush to finish up the big bill ahead of the president's Fourth of July deadline. Much of the package, with its tax breaks and bolstered border security spending, is essentially drafted. But the size and scope of healthcare cuts are among the toughest remaining issues.",
      "It's reminiscent of the summer during Trump's first term, in 2017, when Republicans struggled to keep their campaign promise to \u201crepeal and replace\u201d the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, only to see the GOP splinter over the prospect of Americans losing health coverage. That legislation collapsed when then-Sen. John McCain famously cast a thumbs-down vote.",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune is determined to avoid that outcome, sticking to the schedule and pressing ahead with voting expected by the end of the week.",
      "\u201cThis is a good bill and it's going to be great for our country,\u201d Thune said Wednesday, championing its potential to unleash economic growth and put money in people's pockets.",
      "The changes to the federal health care programs, particularly Medicaid, were always expected to become a centerpiece of the GOP package, a way to offset the costs of providing tax breaks for millions of Americans. Without action from Congress, taxes would go up next year when current tax law expires.",
      "The House-passed bill achieved some $1.5 trillion in savings overall, a large part of it coming from changes to health care. The Medicaid program has dramatically expanded in the 15 years since Obamacare became law and now serves some 80 million Americans. Republicans say that's far too high, and they want to shrink the program back to a smaller size covering mainly poorer women and children.",
      "House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said Republicans are \u201ctrying to take away healthcare from tens of millions of Americans.\u201d Democrats are uniformly opposed to what they call the \u201cbig, ugly bill.\u201d",
      "Much of the health care cost savings would come from new 80-hour-a-month work requirements on those who receive Medicaid benefits, even as most recipients already work.",
      "But another provision, the so-called provider tax that almost all the states impose to some degree on hospitals and others that serve Medicaid patients, is drawing particular concern for potential cuts to rural hospitals.",
      "Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., said several senators spoke up Wednesday during a private meeting indicating they were not yet ready to start voting. \u201cThat\u2019ll depend if we land the plane on rural hospitals,\u201d he said.",
      "States impose the taxes as a way to help fund Medicaid, largely by boosting the reimbursements they receive from the federal government. Critics decry the system as a type of \u201claundering\u201d but almost every state except Alaska uses it to help provide the health care coverage.",
      "The House-passed bill would freeze the provider taxes at current levels, while the Senate proposal goes deeper by reducing the tax that some states are able to impose.",
      "\u201cI know the states are addicted to it,\u201d said Sen. Roger Marshall, R-Kan. But he added, \u201cObviously the provider tax needs to go away.\u201d",
      "But a number of GOP senators, and the hospitals and other medical providers in their states, are raising steep concerns that the provider tax changes would decimate rural hospitals.",
      "In a plea to lawmakers, the American Hospital Association said the cuts won\u2019t just affect those who get health coverage through Medicaid, but would further strain emergency rooms \u201cas they become the family doctor to millions of newly uninsured people.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd worse, some hospitals, especially those in rural communities, may be forced to close altogether,\u201d said Rick Pollack, president and CEO of the hospital group.",
      "The Catholic Health Association of the United States noted in its own letter that Medicaid provides health insurance coverage for one in five people and nearly half of all children.",
      "\u201cThe proposed changes to Medicaid would have devastating consequences, particularly for those in small towns and rural communities, where Medicaid is often the primary source of health care coverage,\u201d said Sister Mary Haddad, the group\u2019s president and CEO.",
      "Trying to engineer a fix to the problem, senators are considering creating a rural hospital fund to help offset the lost Medicaid money.",
      "GOP senators circulated a proposal to pour $15 billion to establish a new rural hospital fund. But several senators said that's too high, while others said it's insufficient. Collins has proposed that the fund be set at $100 billion.",
      "\u201cIt won\u2019t be that big, but there will be a fund,\u201d Thune said.",
      "Hawley, who has been among those most outspoken about the health care cuts, said he's interested in the rural hospital fund but needs to hear more about how it would work.",
      "He has also raised concerns about a new $35 per service co-pay that could be charged to those with Medicaid, which is in both the House and Senate versions of the bill.",
      "\u201cGetting the fund is good. That\u2019s important, a step forward,\u201d Hawley said. But he asked: \u201cHow does the fund actually distribute the money? Who will get it to hospitals? ... Or is this just going to be something that exists on paper?\u201d",
      "A new analysis from the White House Council of Economic Advisers estimates the package would result in up to $2.3 trillion in deficit reduction over 10 years, a markedly different assessment from other analyses. In contrast, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office\u2019s dynamic analysis of the House-passed measure estimates an increase in deficits by $2.8 trillion over the next decade.",

      "Zahid, 25, completed her studies in December, but so far she hasn't found a job in the industry that surrounds her.",
      "\u201cIt stings a little bit,\u201d she said. \u201cI never imagined it would be this difficult just to get a foot in the door.\u201d",
      "Young people graduating from college this spring and summer are facing one of the toughest job markets in more than a decade. The unemployment rate for degree holders ages 22 to 27 has reached its highest level in a dozen years, excluding the coronavirus pandemic. Joblessness among that group is now higher than the overall unemployment rate, and the gap is larger than it has been in more than three decades.",
      "The rise in unemployment has worried many economists as well as officials at the Federal Reserve because it could be an early sign of trouble for the economy. It suggests businesses are holding off on hiring new workers because of rampant uncertainty stemming from the Trump administration's tariff increases, which could slow growth.",
      "\u201cYoung people are bearing the brunt of a lot of economic uncertainty,\u201d Brad Hersbein, senior economist at the Upjohn Institute, a labor-focused think tank, said. \u201cThe people that you often are most hesitant in hiring when economic conditions are uncertain are entry-level positions.\u201d",
      "The growth of artificial intelligence may be playing an additional role by eating away at positions for beginners in white-collar professions such as information technology, finance, and law.",
      "Higher unemployment for younger graduates has also renewed concerns about the value of a college degree. More workers than ever have a four-year degree, which makes it less of a distinguishing factor in job applications. Murat Tasci, an economist at JPMorgan, calculates that 45% of workers have a four-year degree, up from 26% in 1992.",
      "While the difficulty of finding work has demoralized young people like Zahid, most economists argue that holding a college degree still offers clear lifetime benefits. Graduates earn higher pay and experience much less unemployment over their lifetimes.",
      "The overall U.S. unemployment rate is a still-low 4.2%, and the government's monthly jobs reports show the economy is generating modest job gains. But the additional jobs are concentrated in health care, government, and restaurants and hotels. Job gains in professions with more college grads, such as information technology, legal services, and accounting have languished in the past 12 months.",
      "The unemployment rate has stayed low mostly because layoffs are still relatively rare. The actual hiring rate \u2014 new hires as a percentage of all jobs \u2014 has fallen to 2014 levels, when the unemployment rate was much higher, at 6.2%. Economists call it a no-hire, no-fire economy.",
      "For college graduates 22 to 27 years old, the unemployment rate was 5.8% in March \u2014 the highest, excluding the pandemic, since 2012, and far above the nationwide rate.",
      "Lexie Lindo, 23, saw how reluctant companies were to hire while applying for more than 100 jobs last summer and fall after graduating from Clark Atlanta University with a business degree and 3.8 GPA. She had several summer internships in fields such as logistics and real estate while getting her degree, but no offer came.",
      "\u201cNobody was taking interviews or responding back to any applications that I filled out,\u201d Lindo, who is from Auburn, Georgia, said. \"My resume is full, there\u2019s no gaps or anything. Every summer I\u2019m doing something. It\u2019s just, \u2018OK, so what else are you looking for?\u2019\u201d",
      "She has returned to Clark for a master's program in supply chain studies and has an internship this summer at a Fortune 500 company in Austin, Texas. She's hopeful it will lead to a job next year.",
      "Artificial intelligence could be a culprit, particularly in IT. Matthew Martin, senior U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, has calculated that employment for college graduates 28 and above in computer science and mathematical occupations has increased a slight 0.8% since 2022. For those ages 22 to 27, it has fallen 8%, according to Martin.",
      "Company announcements have further fueled concerns. Tobi Lutke, CEO of online commerce software company Shopify, said in an April memo that before requesting new hires, \u201cteams must demonstrate why they cannot get what they want done using AI.\u201d",
      "Last week, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said AI would likely reduce the company's corporate workforce over the next few years.",
      "\u201cWe will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs,\u201d Jassy said in a message to employees. \u201cWe expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.\u201d",
      "Zahid worries that AI is hurting her chances. She remembers seeing big billboard ads for AI at the San Francisco airport that asked, \u201cWhy hire a human when you could use AI?\u201d",
      "Still, many economists argue that blaming AI is premature. Most companies are in the early stages of adopting the technology.",
      "Professional networking platform LinkedIn categorized occupations based on their exposure to AI and did not see big hiring differences between professions where AI was more prevalent and where it wasn't, said Kory Kantenga, the firm's head of economics for the Americas.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t see any broad-based evidence that AI is having a disproportionate impact in the labor market or even a disproportionate impact on younger workers versus older workers,\u201d Kantenga said.",
      "He added that the Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes have also slowed hiring in tech. Many IT firms expanded when the Fed pinned its short-term rate at nearly zero after the pandemic. In 2022, the Fed began cranking up rates to combat inflation, which made it harder to borrow and grow.",
      "In fact, IT's hiring spree when rates were low \u2014 fueled by millions of Americans ramping up their online shopping and video conferencing \u2014 left many firms with too many workers, economists say.",
      "Cory Stahle, an economist at the job-listings website Indeed, says postings for software development jobs, for example, have fallen 40% compared with four years ago. It's a sharp shift for students who began studying computer science when hiring was near its peak.",
      "Zahid, who lives in Dublin, California, has experienced this whiplash firsthand. When she entered college in 2019, her father, who is a network engineer, encouraged her to study IT and said it would be easy for her to get a job in the field.",
      "She initially studied psychology but decided she wanted something more hands-on and gravitated to data analysis. Her husband, 33, has a software development job, and friends of hers in IT received immediate job offers upon graduation a few years ago. Such rapid hiring seems to have disappeared now, she said.",
      "She has her college diploma, but hasn't hung it up yet.",
      "\u201cI will put it up when I actually get a job, confirming that it was worth it all,\u201d she said.",

      "Nestle said Wednesday it will eliminate artificial colors from its U.S. food and beverages by the middle of 2026.",
      "It\u2019s the latest big food company making that pledge. Last week, Kraft Heinz and General Mills said they would remove artificial dyes from their U.S. products by 2027. General Mills also said it plans to remove artificial dyes from its U.S. cereals and from all foods served in K-12 schools by the middle of 2026.",
      "The move has broad support. About two-thirds of Americans favor restricting or reformulating processed foods to remove ingredients like added sugar or dyes, according to an AP-NORC poll. Both California and West Virginia have recently banned artificial dyes in foods served in schools.",
      "On Sunday, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas signed a bill requiring foods made with artificial dyes or additives to contain a new safety label starting in 2027. The label would say they contain ingredients \u201cnot recommended for human consumption\u201d in Australia, Canada, the European Union or the U.K.",
      "The federal government is also stepping up its scrutiny of artificial colors. In January, days before President Donald Trump took office, the U.S. regulators banned the dye called Red 3 from the nation\u2019s food supply, nearly 35 years after it was barred from cosmetics because of potential cancer risk.",
      "In April, Trump\u2019s Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said the agency would take steps to eliminate synthetic dyes by the end of 2026, largely by relying on voluntary efforts from the food industry.",
      "Nestle has pledged to remove artificial dyes before. Early in 2015, the company said it would remove artificial flavors and colors from its products by the end of that year. But the promise didn't hold.",
      "Nestle said Wednesday it's been removing synthetic dyes from its products over the last decade, and 90% of its U.S. portfolio doesn\u2019t contain them. Among those that do is Nesquik Banana Strawberry milk, which is made with Red 3.",
      "Nestle said Wednesday it wants to evolve with its U.S. customers\u2019 changing nutritional needs and preferences.",
      "\u201cServing and delighting people is at the heart of everything we do and every decision that we make,\u201d Nestle's U.S. CEO Marty Thompson said in a statement.",

      "Under the provision, Trump \u2014 or someone he designates \u2014 controls that decision-making power while he is president. However, control over those powers reverts to the Treasury Department and the Commerce Department when anyone else is president, according to the filings.",

      "Those matters include reductions in Nippon Steel\u2019s capital commitments in the national security agreement; changing U.S. Steel\u2019s name and headquarters; closing or idling U.S. Steel\u2019s plants; transferring production or jobs outside of the U.S.; buying competing businesses in the U.S.; and certain decisions on trade, labor and sourcing outside the U.S.",

      "India\u2019s push toward winning the 2036 Olympics hosting contest has seemed to stall a little in the first big decision of Kirsty Coventry\u2019s IOC presidency",
      "GENEVA -- India\u2019s push toward winning the 2036 Olympics hosting contest seemed to stall a little on Thursday in the first big decision of Kirsty Coventry\u2019s IOC presidency.",
      "Coventry paused the fast tracking of a preferred bidder \u2014 a signature policy of her predecessor and mentor Thomas Bach \u2014 in a concession to International Olympic Committee members who have wanted more say in decisions under new leadership.",
      "\u201cMembers want to be engaged more in the process\u201d of picking Olympic hosts, Coventry acknowledged, citing \u201coverwhelming support\u201d at meetings this week to stop and review how it is done and when.",
      "India has been seen as gaining momentum in the 2036 race that involves at least 10 bidders in talks including Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia and Istanbul in Turkey.",
      "In her third full day in office, Coventry promised to create two working groups \u2014 to look at how hosts are chosen, and a second analyzing how to \u201cprotect the female category\u201d after controversy in women's boxing at the 2024 Paris Olympics.",
      "The two-time Olympic champion swimmer also restated a principled vision ahead of the 2028 Summer Games in the city of Los Angeles, which U.S. President Donald Trump this month called \u201ca trash heap.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe see the best of humanity, we see compassion for others\u201d in Olympic values, Coventry said at a news conference after chairing her first executive board meeting over two days.",
      "\u201cIf we can celebrate in the diversity that we are, and that we have, we can really work towards creating something great,\u201d the former sports minister of Zimbabwe said, pledging to try to inspire young people.",
      "Olympic officials from LA met with Coventry\u2019s board Wednesday and promised a \u201cunity of effort\u201d in the city where the Trump administration deployed military forces after street protests against immigration raids.",
      "\u201cThere is so much goodwill from all levels of government,\u201d Coventry insisted, including federal.",
      "\u201cThat gives us faith,\u201d she said, that a platform for the Olympics \u201cwill be there for us to ensure that our values are stuck to but that our values will also be heard.\u201d",
      "After Los Angeles in 2028, the 2032 Summer Games will go to Brisbane which was picked 11 years ahead of time in the most secretive of modern hosting decisions.",
      "Bach aimed to avoid expensive bid campaigns and contested votes that could lead to negative headlines: rejection by local voters or allegations of vote buying.",
      "Instead, the IOC administration talked discreetly with potential hosts with no set timetable to deal exclusively with a bid well-connected in Olympic circles.",
      "Under this system, an India bid for 2036 promoted by influential IOC member Nita Ambani, from the family that is the richest in Asia, has looked strong.",
      "However, Coventry\u2019s strongest opponents in a seven-candidate election she won in March promised to consult more with their 100-plus IOC colleagues than was the case during Bach\u2019s tightly controlled 12-year presidency.",
      "Her presidency started Tuesday in closed-door sessions with more than 70 IOC members in Lausanne. The result is a reset for the 2036 contest.",
      "Still, Coventry confirmed, a bid team from India will continue to make a scheduled visit to the IOC next week.",
      "Olympic gold medalists are among 11 candidates for two vacancies to be IOC members when athletes vote at the Milan-Cortina d\u2019Ampezzo Olympics in February.",
      "Chinese pairs figure skater Cong Han, Canadian ski cross racer Marielle Thompson, Ukrainian aerials skier Oleksandr Abramenko and Swiss cross-country skier Dario Cologna will be on the ballot.",
      "The two winners will be IOC members for eight years through the 2034 Salt Lake City Winter Games.",
      "American 1,500-meter runner Shannon Rowbury was formally confirmed as the bronze medalist from the 2012 London Olympics nearly 13 years later.",
      "The IOC reallocated the medals to take account of a doping ban for Tatyana Tomashova imposed in September by the Court of Arbitration for Sport.",
      "Rowbury crossed the line in sixth place in London in a race notoriously tainted by doping cases for the runners who placed first, second and fourth. Abeba Aregawi of Ethiopia was upgraded to silver on Thursday. The gold medal was previously awarded to Maryam Yusuf Jamal of Bahrain.",

    "story": [
      "One of the founders of Spire Motorsports has entered an agreement to purchase the NASCAR team owned by Rick Ware and is jumping back into the stock car series because he believes the current charters are grossly undervalued",
      "CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- One of the founders of Spire Motorsports has entered an agreement to purchase the NASCAR team owned by Rick Ware and is jumping back into the stock car series because he believes the current charters are grossly undervalued.",
      "T.J. Puchyr, who in 2018 alongside Jeff Dickerson launched the Spire team to take over the charter that Furniture Row Racing could not unload, told The Associated Press on Thursday he and Rick Ware Racing have a deal for him to take over Ware's organization next season.",
      "When Puchyr and Dickerson bought the Furniture Row charter, the market for NASCAR's version of franchise models was essentially dead. Their agency had been hired by Furniture Row owner Barney Visser to sell the charter and when they couldn't find a buyer, the two decided to purchase it themselves for $6 million and launch their own team.",
      "That decision jump-started the charter market and the most recent charters sold \u2014 when Stewart-Haas Racing went out of business at the end of last season \u2014 went for approximately $30 million. Puchyr and Dickerson are largely credited with pumping life and value into an otherwise dormant charter system.",
      "Puchyr last year sold his shares of Spire to Dan Towriss, the CEO of TWG Motorsports and header of the new Cadillac F1 team. Puchyr has spent 2025 consulting with various teams, including RWR and Legacy Motor Club. He's watched the market closely and has attended several of the recent court hearings involving NASCAR against 23XI Racing and Front Row Motorsports, who have filed an antitrust lawsuit over the charter agreement those two teams refused to sign last September.",
      "There are only 36 Cup Series charters, which guarantee a team entry into every NASCAR race and a steady revenue stream. Puchyr believes they are greatly undervalued and in one of his final deals with Spire, he helped acquire a charter from Live Fast Motorsports for $40 million.",
      "\u201cI am bullish on wanting to build a three-car team. I believe in the France family and the direction of the sport and I want the rest of the shareholders and industry to know that I believe the charters are worth $75 million or more,\u201d he told AP.",
      "In his deal with Ware, Puchyr will keep Ware on board as a partner, also keep Ware\u2019s son, Cody, in the No. 51 Ford, and retain all of the current RWR employees. Ware\u2019s current second charter is leased to RFK Racing, but Legacy Motor Club made a legal claim that it had entered an agreement to buy that charter next season.",
      "A judge did not agree with Legacy, and said Ware has a lease deal with RFK for 2026 on a second charter. Puchyr believes none of the parties can perform to Legacy-RWR contract \u2014 which he said was written by Legacy \u2014 and there is no charter available from Ware for Legacy for either lease or purchase in 2026. Ware has filed a countersuit against Legacy.",
      "Legacy, a two-car Cup team, is currently owned by seven-time NASCAR champion and Hall of Famer Jimmie Johnson. He has recently taken on partnership from private equity firm Knighthead Capital Management, which alongside Johnson is exploring expansion into several other motorsports series.",
      "\u201cIf anybody deserves a pass it is Jimmie and if he wants to sit down and talk about it like men, I\u2019d entertain the conversation,\u201d said Puchyr, who was offended that Legacy sued Ware.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think Jimmie has all the facts, doesn\u2019t understand the deal we had, and they tried to humiliate Rick publicly. We don\u2019t do business that way.\u201d",
      "Now, Puchyr and Ware are confident the second charter currently leased to RFK will be returned to their team in 2027, allowing Puchyr to expand the organization. He wants to buy a third charter that makes the organization a three-car Cup team by 2027.",
      "Ware has done the second-most charter transactions in the industry only to Spire and at one point held four. Now he\u2019s trying to rebuild his organization and win races with his son as the driver, something Puchyr wants to help him achieve.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve won at everything I\u2019ve done at every level and I think we can compete with these guys,\u201d Puchyr said. \u201cI think we can build it brick-by-brick and it\u2019s going to take people, money and time. It\u2019s not lost on me that (RWR) is the 36th-place car in the garage, we all see it. But I believe we can make this a competitive organization, even a winner.",
      "\u201cAnd I believe we can get these charters valued at their true worth.\u201d",
      "Ware fields winning organizations in other motorsports series, including NHRA with Clay Millican, who won the 2024 American Flat Track championship, the 2022 FIM World Supercross Championship and the 2019-2020 Asian Le Mans Series prototype title.",
      "Puchyr did not reveal to the AP how much he\u2019s paying for Ware\u2019s organization, which technically only holds the charter for Cody Ware\u2019s car this season and runs Corey Lajoie in a second \u201copen\u201d car in select races. Once it gets its leased charter back from RFK in 2027, the team will have at least two cars with the focus on purchasing a third.",
      "Purchasing charters is not easy at this time as multiple teams have interest but lack the monetary funds to buy them at the ever-increasing rates. Among this is Hall of Famer Dale Earnhardt Jr., who has not been able to get his hands on charters to take his Xfinity Series team to NASCAR\u2019s top Cup Series level.",

      "Coco Gauff and Carlos Alcaraz are ushering in a new era for tennis",
      "LONDON -- LONDON (AP) \u2014 Coco Gauff and Carlos Alcaraz are helping usher in a new era for tennis.",
      "With Wimbledon beginning Monday, the sport\u2019s most recent Grand Slam champions are Gauff, a 21-year-old American, and Alcaraz, a 22-year-old Spaniard, who are both at No. 2 in the rankings and are both coming off French Open titles secured in riveting finals against the sport's No. 1 players.",
      "They are young, they are charismatic as an be on the court and they are media-friendly off it.",
      "Along with No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka and former No. 1 Iga Swiatek in the women\u2019s game, and No. 1 Jannik Sinner in the men\u2019s, Gauff and Alcaraz offer a bright future for a sport's fanbase that in recent years saw all-time greats Serena Williams, Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal walk away and currently might be pondering how much longer Novak Djokovic will contend for the biggest prizes.",
      "\u201cTennis is just in such a great, great place right now. We are so fortunate to have not only Coco, not only Carlos, but a deep bench of young stars that are just propelling the growth of our sport,\u201d U.S. Open tournament director Stacey Allaster said. \u201cI\u2019ve been around a long time, and when we have lost great, iconic champions in the past, there\u2019s generally been a little bit of a dip. We have had the exact opposite during this transition. ... I always like to say the champions of today are standing on the shoulders of the champions of the past. These champions have jumped off the shoulders of the past champions.\u201d",
      "One key for a sport, especially an individual one, to gain attention and grow popularity is to have rivalries that demand buy-in.",
      "Alcaraz vs. Sinner clearly provides that, much in the way that Federer vs. Nadal or Nadal vs. Djokovic did.",
      "The five-set, 5 1/2-hour men's final at Roland-Garros was as full of momentum swings, terrific tennis and athleticism as anything those greats conjured.",
      "\u201cThe level,\u201d two-time reigning Wimbledon champion Alcaraz said, \u201cwas insane.\u201d",
      "The way he and Sinner, 23, are currently divvying up the biggest prizes \u2014 they've split the past six major trophies and eight of the past 11 \u2014 is certainly reminiscent of the Big Three's dominance, albeit over a much smaller sample size so far.",
      "\u201cHaving these two guys fighting for big trophies \u2014 I think we have to be very happy about it in the sport of tennis,\u201d said Juan Carlos Ferrero, Alcaraz's main coach. \u201cFor them, for sure it\u2019s something that they raise their level every time that they go on the court. They know they have to play unbelievable tennis to beat the other guy, and it\u2019s something that is going to help for sure each player to raise the level even more.\u201d",
      "It sure does seem as though Gauff vs. Sabalenka could provide that sort of dynamic and buzz, too.",
      "Consider that, like Alcaraz and Sinner, they occupy the top two spots in the rankings. And consider that, like those other two, both own multiple major titles. Gauff's two Slam triumphs came via three-set victories over Sabalenka in the finals.",
      "Plus, their latest meeting, at Roland-Garros less than a month ago, came with some added spice because of Sabalenka's post-match comments that were seen as less than fully gracious toward Gauff.",
      "It became such a thing that Sabalenka felt the need to issue a pair of apologies \u2014 one privately via writing to Gauff, and one publicly in an interview at her next tournament.",
      "Add that sort of off-court intrigue to the on-court interest, and if there are rematches at the All England Club a couple of weeks from now, no one who is invested in tennis will be displeased.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s incredible momentum and wind in our sales as we think about the sport, in total,\u201d said Lew Sherr, who is about to leave his role as the CEO of the U.S. Tennis Association. \u201cWe\u2019ve had five consecutive years of participation growth ... and that certainly is being, in part, fueled by the great talent and inspiring players we have at the professional level, and also is feeding record attendance, record interest, record viewership. Those things go hand in hand. We have not missed a beat.\"",

      "Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 has filed a legal complaint against Paris Saint-Germain, accusing the club of moral harassment",
      "PARIS -- PARIS (AP) \u2014 Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 has accused Paris Saint-Germain of moral harassment in a legal filing, the Paris prosecutor\u2019s office confirmed on Thursday.",
      "The Real Madrid star is at odds with his former club, arguing PSG owes him 55 million euros ($61 million) in unpaid wages.",
      "Mbapp\u00e9 is also unhappy with the way he was treated by the Ligue 1 club when the France captain was sidelined before the 2023-24 season, following his decision not to extend his club contract.",
      "The prosecutor's office said Mbapp\u00e9 is \"denouncing the \u2018lofting\u2019 he claimed to have been subjected to at Paris Saint-Germain.\u201d The word lofting is used in France to describe a practice that involves isolating a player from the main squad for sporting, administrative, or disciplinary reasons.",
      "Mbapp\u00e9 joined Real Madrid last summer on a free transfer after scoring a club-record 256 goals in seven years at PSG, which won the Champions League without him this year.",
      "Mbapp\u00e9\u2019s relationship with PSG ended amid deep tensions, and some fans booed him in his last home game at Parc des Princes. PSG felt let down by Mbapp\u00e9 after offering him the most lucrative contract in club history when he signed a new contract in 2022.",
      "But Mbapp\u00e9 was frustrated because he felt promises to sign key players were not kept. When he signed that deal, he was paraded in front of fans holding up a jersey with 2025 on it. Mbapp\u00e9 was reportedly annoyed because the contract was until 2024 \u2014 with a player\u2019s option for an extra season.",
      "Mbapp\u00e9 stunned PSG in June 2023 by informing the club he would not take the option for an extra year. With his contract effectively into its final year, it put PSG in the position of needing to sell Mbapp\u00e9 to avoid losing him for nothing when the contract expired.",
      "His PSG career could have ended that summer amid a tense transfer standoff.",
      "After telling the club he would not extend, Mbapp\u00e9 was left off a preseason tour to Japan and South Korea and forced to train with fringe players. PSG said it would rather sell him than let the player leave for free in 2024, but he rejected a 300 million euros move to Saudi Arabia team Al-Hilal.",
      "PSG left Mbapp\u00e9 out of the opening league game of that season but he soon returned to the lineup following talks.",
      "Mbapp\u00e9\u2019s legal team said in April it would start an action against PSG for harassment because of the way he was treated at the time.",

      "The 31-year-old Kipyegon looked exhausted as she reached the finish and fell on her back as she was surrounded by photographers.",

      "At Euro 2009 there was an average attendance of just over 5,000 at the matches in England. In the same country in 2022, the average was 18,544.",
      "And just as attendance levels have soared, so have television viewing figures.",
      "Euro 2022 had a global cumulative live viewership of 365 million across TV, out-of-home viewing and streaming. That was more than double the number of live viewers compared to the 2017 edition (178 million) and 214% more live viewers than in 2013 (116 million).",
      "The rise in attendances is also evident in club soccer as women start playing in stadiums with bigger capacities and clubs start to invest more in their women\u2019s teams. A couple of Barcelona's Women's Champions League matches in 2022 drew more than 90,000 fans.",
      "A major change that's happened in recent years is investors are now looking at women's soccer as something you can make money off, said Seattle Reign coach Laura Harvey, who coached Arsenal and Birmingham City in her native England before moving to the U.S.",
      "\u201cFor those of us who\u2019ve been in this a long time \u2014 I was Birmingham City\u2019s head coach in 2006 \u2014 and to think where the game\u2019s evolved in 19 years or whatever it\u2019s been, it\u2019s just wild,\u201d she told AP. \u201cI\u2019m glad that I can be part of it.\u201d",
      "The continued growth in popularity of women\u2019s soccer has the knock-on effect of more sponsorship, more prize money and more to invest in grassroots soccer and clubs.",
      "In 2017, UEFA made what was perceived as a bold move: unbundling sponsorship rights for its women\u2019s competitions and selling the commercial rights separately from the men\u2019s.",
      "That was done with the express purpose of \u201caccelerating the growth of women\u2019s football competitions\u201d and was considered a success.",
      "So much so that FIFA has followed suit, as have governing bodies of other sports.",
      "UEFA now counts 11 dedicated women\u2019s soccer partners among its wider portfolio, including Visa, Amazon and Adidas.",
      "There are more than 20 sponsors for Euro 2025 and that revenue is projected to increase by 145% compared to 2022, according to UEFA.",
      "\u201cThe impact of Women\u2019s Euro 2025 extends far beyond the competition itself,\u201d UEFA President Aleksander Ceferin said in a report last month. \u201cWith record prize money and unprecedented interest from sponsors, the tournament will bring more investment into the women\u2019s game than ever before.\u201d",
      "The prize pot at Euro 2025 has been set at 41 million euros ($47 million), more than double the 16 million euros ($18.3 million) received by national associations in 2022.",
      "Moreover, players will receive a guaranteed share from their national associations for the first time.",
      "The men\u2019s Euro 2024 had a total prize fund of 331 million euros ($347 million), with each of the 24 teams receiving a minimum of 9.25 million euros and champion Spain earning 28.25 million euros.",
      "UEFA\u2019s aim is that Euro 2025 will act as a catalyst for further progress in the women's professional game in Switzerland and across Europe.",
      "However, Klaveness has a warning: that the richest leagues shouldn't financially separate themselves completely from the currently semi-pro ones.",
      "\u201cNow I think the next step that\u2019s really important to go further now is \u2026 not to let the head move away from the body, then we would do the same as the men\u2019s side,\u201d she said.",

      "The 6-foot-8, 232-pound junior is coming off a productive season that included averaging 14.7 points, 8.5 rebounds for career-best outputs. He tied for fourth at the combine with a better than 7-5 wingspan, helping him average 1.5 blocks over the last two seasons.",
      "He also proved he could stretch his range, going from shooting 31.3% on 3-pointers in his first two college seasons to 39% last year. Notably, he performed well in catch-and-shoot situations (in the 79th percentile) and finishing at the rim (89th percentile), according to Synergy's analytics data.",
      "The 7-footer from France is a skilled a skilled 7-footer who averaged 20.2 points and 10.6 rebounds, putting himself alongside eventual No. 1 overall draft pick Cooper Flagg of Duke as the only unanimous first-team picks on The Associated Press' All-Atlantic Coast Conference first team.",

      "The 6-8, 225-pound forward offers inside-out versatility and defensive potential. The 20-year-old averaged 10.3 points, 5.5 rebounds and 2.6 assists in 33 games last year in France\u2019s top league, rating as \u201cvery good\u201d by Synergy in halfcourt settings.",
      "Penda also led the team in steals (1.3) and blocks (0.9), and showed playmaking ability with his nifty passing.",

He shot 58.5% in post-up situations to rank in Synergy's 87th percentile, and made 37 3-pointers in the last two years to show ability to step outside.",

      "Yet Broome plays below the rim and lacks elite athleticism, tying for the combine\u2019s second-lowest max vertical leap (28.0). Synergy ranked his jumper as \u201cbelow average,\" raising uncertainty about his ability to stretch defenses (27.8% on 3s last year) and create space.",

      "The Wednesday ruling from U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria was the second in a week from San Francisco's federal court to dismiss major copyright claims from book authors against the rapidly developing AI industry.",
      "Chhabria found that 13 authors who sued Meta \u201cmade the wrong arguments\u201d and tossed the case. But the judge also said that the ruling is limited to the authors in the case and does not mean that Meta\u2019s use of copyrighted materials is lawful.",
      "\u201cThis ruling does not stand for the proposition that Meta\u2019s use of copyrighted materials to train its language models is lawful,\u201d Chhabria wrote. \u201cIt stands only for the proposition that these plaintiffs made the wrong arguments and failed to develop a record in support of the right one.\u201d",
      "Lawyers for the plaintiffs \u2014 a group of well-known writers that includes comedian Sarah Silverman and authors Jacqueline Woodson and Ta-Nehisi Coates \u2014 said in a statement that the \"court ruled that AI companies that \u2018feed copyright-protected works into their models without getting permission from the copyright holders or paying for them\u2019 are generally violating the law. Yet, despite the undisputed record of Meta\u2019s historically unprecedented pirating of copyrighted works, the court ruled in Meta\u2019s favor. We respectfully disagree with that conclusion.\u201d",
      "Meta said it appreciates the decision.",
      "\u201cOpen-source AI models are powering transformative innovations, productivity and creativity for individuals and companies, and fair use of copyright material is a vital legal framework for building this transformative technology,\u201d the Menlo Park, California-based company said in a statement.",
      "Although Meta prevailed in its request to dismiss the case, it could turn out to be a pyrrhic victory. In his 40-page ruling, Chhabria repeatedly indicated reasons to believe that Meta and other AI companies have turned into serial copyright infringers as they train their technology on books and other works created by humans, and seemed to be inviting other authors to bring cases to his court presented in a manner that would allow them to proceed to trial.",
      "The judge scoffed at arguments that requiring AI companies to adhere to decades-old copyright laws would slow down advances in a crucial technology at a pivotal time. \"These products are expected to generate billions, even trillions of dollars for the companies that are developing them. If using copyrighted works to train the models is as necessary as the companies say, they will figure out a way to compensate copyright holders for it.\u201d",
      "On Monday, from the same courthouse, U.S. District Judge William Alsup ruled that AI company Anthropic didn\u2019t break the law by training its chatbot Claude on millions of copyrighted books, but the company must still go to trial for illicitly acquiring those books from pirate websites instead of buying them.",
      "But the actual process of an AI system distilling from thousands of written works to be able to produce its own passages of text qualified as \u201cfair use\u201d under U.S. copyright law because it was \u201cquintessentially transformative,\u201d Alsup wrote.",
      "In the Meta case, the authors had argued in court filings that Meta is \u201cliable for massive copyright infringement\u201d by taking their books from online repositories of pirated works and feeding them into Meta's flagship generative AI system Llama.",
      "Lengthy and distinctively written passages of text \u2014 such as those found in books \u2014 are highly useful for teaching generative AI chatbots the patterns of human language. \u201cMeta could and should have paid\u201d to buy and license those literary works, the authors' attorneys argued.",
      "Meta countered in court filings that U.S. copyright law \u201callows the unauthorized copying of a work to transform it into something new\u201d and that the new, AI-generated expression that comes out of its chatbots is fundamentally different from the books it was trained on.",
      "\"After nearly two years of litigation, there still is no evidence that anyone has ever used Llama as a substitute for reading Plaintiffs\u2019 books, or that they even could,\u201d Meta's attorneys argued.",
      "Meta says Llama won\u2019t output the actual works it has copied, even when asked to do so.",
      "\u201cNo one can use Llama to read Sarah Silverman\u2019s description of her childhood, or Junot Diaz\u2019s story of a Dominican boy growing up in New Jersey,\u201d its attorneys wrote.",
      "Accused of pulling those books from online \u201cshadow libraries,\" Meta has also argued that the methods it used have \u201cno bearing on the nature and purpose of its use\u201d and it would have been the same result if the company instead struck a deal with real libraries.",
      "Such deals are how Google built its online Google Books repository of more than 20 million books, though it also fought a decade of legal challenges before the U.S. Supreme Court in 2016 let stand lower court rulings that rejected copyright infringement claims.",
      "The authors' case against Meta forced CEO Mark Zuckerberg to be deposed, and has disclosed internal conversations at the company over the ethics of tapping into pirated databases that have long attracted scrutiny.",
      "\u201cAuthorities regularly shut down their domains and even prosecute the perpetrators,\u201d the authors' attorneys argued in a court filing. \"That Meta knew taking copyrighted works from pirated databases could expose the company to enormous risk is beyond dispute: it triggered an escalation to Mark Zuckerberg and other Meta executives for approval. Their gamble should not pay off.\u201d",
      "The named plaintiffs are Jacqueline Woodson, Richard Kadrey, Andrew Sean Greer, Rachel Louise Snyder, David Henry Hwang, Ta-Nehisi Coates, Laura Lippman, Matthew Klam, Junot Diaz, Sarah Silverman, Lysa TerKeurst, Christopher Golden and Christopher Farnsworth.",
      "Chhabria said in the ruling that while he had \u201cno choice\u201d but to grant Meta\u2019s summary judgment tossing the case, \u201cin the grand scheme of things, the consequences of this ruling are limited. This is not a class action, so the ruling only affects the rights of these 13 authors -- not the countless others whose works Meta used to train its models.\u201d",

      "The three countries shared the tab for the two-week mission. Axiom Space, the Houston company that arranged the deal, put the ticket price at more than $65 million per customer.",
      "SpaceX\u2019s Falcon rocket blasted off from NASA\u2019s Kennedy Space Center two weeks late because of space station leak concerns. The capsule on top carried not only the three newcomers to space \u2014 none of whom were alive when their countries\u2019 first astronauts launched \u2014 but America\u2019s most experienced astronaut, Peggy Whitson.",
      "Besides Whitson, the crew includes India\u2019s Shubhanshu Shukla, a pilot in the Indian Air Force; Hungary\u2019s Tibor Kapu, a mechanical engineer; and Poland\u2019s Slawosz Uznanski-Wisniewski, a radiation expert and one of the European Space Agency\u2019s project astronauts sometimes pressed into temporary duty.",
      "The astronauts are due to arrive at the orbiting lab the next morning.",
      "In addition to dozens of experiments, the astronauts are flying food that celebrates their heritage: Indian curry and rice with mango nectar; spicy Hungarian paprika paste; and freeze-fried Polish pierogies.",
      "Hungary\u2019s first astronaut, Bertalan Farkas, cheered on Kapu from the launch site.",
      "\u201cFor such a small country as Hungary, it is really important to collaborate in a peaceful international space cooperation,\u201d Farkas told The Associated Press. He called it \u201cone of the most important moments\" of his life.",
      "Farkas launched with the Soviets in 1980, taking along a teddy bear in a cosmonaut suit that went back up with Kapu. India and Poland\u2019s original astronauts also launched with the Soviets in the late 1970s and 1980s.",
      "Uznanski-Wisniewski carried up the Polish flag worn on his predecessor\u2019s spacesuit, noting that Miroslaw Hermaszewski was his biggest supporter until his death in 2022. India\u2019s first astronaut, Rakesh Sharma, couldn\u2019t make it to Florida for the launch; Shukla said he\u2019s been a mentor \u201cat every step of this journey\u201d and is flying a surprise gift for him.",
      "While others born in India and Hungary have flown in space before \u2014 including NASA astronaut Kalpana Chawla, who died aboard the shuttle Columbia in 2003, and two-time space tourist Charles Simonyi, of Microsoft fame \u2014 they were U.S. citizens at the time of launch.",
      "Shukla said before the flight that he hopes \u201cto ignite the curiosity of an entire generation in my country\u201d and drive innovation. Like his crewmates, he plans several outreach events with those back home.",
      "\u201cI truly believe that even though I, as an individual, am traveling to space, this is the journey of 1.4 billion people,\u201d he said.",
      "It was Axiom\u2019s fourth chartered flight to the space station since 2022 and Whitson\u2019s second time flying as an Axiom crew commander and chaperone. The trip caused her to miss her induction into the U.S. Astronaut Hall of Fame late last month, since she was in quarantine before the flight. Whitson joined Axiom after retiring from NASA nearly a decade ago and has logged almost two years in orbit over her career.",
      "Once opposed to nontraditional station guests, NASA now throws out the welcome mat, charging for their food and upkeep while insisting that an experienced astronaut accompany them.",
      "It\u2019s all part of NASA\u2019s push to open space \u2014 moon included \u2014 to private businesses. Axiom is among several U.S. companies planning to launch their own space stations in the next few years. The goal is for them to be up and running before the international station comes down in 2031 after more than three decades of operation.",
      "Access to space \u201cis not only for the biggest agencies anymore \u2014 space is for everyone,\u201d Poland\u2019s Uznanski-Wisniewski said ahead of liftoff. He repeated the sentiment upon reaching orbit.",
      "Hungarians want to \u201csit at the same table with the giants,\u201d said Kapu. Through this mission, \u201cHungary gets one step closer to the stars.\u201d",
      "They should have flown earlier this year, but their mission was delayed following a switch in SpaceX capsules. The change enabled NASA\u2019s two stuck astronauts Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams to return to Earth in March sooner than planned.",
      "The Axiom astronauts faced more launch delays once arriving in Florida. SpaceX had to fix an oxygen leak in its rocket, then NASA put the crew\u2019s visit on indefinite hold while monitoring repairs to longtime air leaks on the Russian side of the space station.",
      "Once in orbit, the astronauts radioed messages in their native languages and revealed the name they gave to their brand-new capsule: Grace.",

      "Last week, Ukrainian drone hunters searching through the debris of Russia's nightly assault on their cities found a drone that was different to the rest",
      "Last week, Ukrainian drone hunters picking up the debris from Russia\u2019s nightly assault on their cities found a weapon that stood out from the rest.",
      "It had an advanced camera, a computing platform powered by artificial intelligence and a radio link, allowing an operator to pilot it remotely from Russia. It also contained new, Iranian-made, anti-jamming technology, according to a Ukrainian drone expert.",
      "Most Russian attack drones are black, said Serhii Beskrestnov, an electronics expert more widely known as Flash. The new one, he told The Associated Press, was white.",
      "Inside, there were no markings or labels consistent with Russian-made drones. Instead, the stickers followed a \u201cstandard Iran labeling system,\u201d Beskrestnov said.",
      "Experts who spoke to AP said the labels are not conclusive proof but the English-language words are consistent with how Iran marks its drones. It is quite possible, they said, that it was sold by Iran to Russia to test in combat.",
      "Moscow has pummeled Ukraine almost nightly with Iranian-designed drones throughout the course of the war, now in its fourth year. They swarm above Ukrainian cities, their moped-like sound filling the air, as air defenses and sharpshooters take aim. While some carry warheads, many are decoys.",
      "Russia is improving its drone technology and tactics, striking Ukraine with increasing success. But the U.K's Defense Ministry said Israel\u2019s strikes on Iran will \u201clikely negatively impact the future provision of Iranian military equipment to Russia,\" since Tehran had supplied \u201csignificant quantities\u201d of attack drones to Moscow.",
      "Israel\u2019s military would not comment on what it struck. Although it has carried out sweeping attacks across Iranian military facilities and the U.S. bombed nuclear sites, the impact on Iran\u2019s drone industry is not yet clear.",
      "The anti-jammer in the latest drone discovered in Ukraine contained new Iranian technology, suggested Beskrestnov. Other components in Russia's drones often come from Russia, China and the West.",
      "Although Russia's drones are based on an Iranian design, the majority are now made in Russia.",
      "And because much of the technology to make them, including the Iranian software and technical expertise, has already been transferred to Russia, the immediate impact on Moscow\u2019s drone program could be limited, experts said.",
      "However, if Israel struck facilities producing drones and components \u2014 such as engines and anti-jamming units \u2014 which are shipped to Russia, then Moscow could face supply shortages, experts suggested.",
      "Moscow makes its Shahed \u2014 meaning \u201cwitness\u201d in Farsi \u2014 drones based on an Iranian model in a highly secure factory in central Russia.",
      "The Alabuga plant in the Tatarstan region took delivery of its first Iranian drones in 2022 after Russia and Iran signed a $1.7 billion deal. It later established its own production lines, churning out thousands of them.",
      "The upgrades identified from debris in Ukraine are the latest in a series of innovations that began with Russia buying drones directly from Iran in the fall of 2022, according to leaked documents from Alabuga previously reported on by AP.",
      "In early 2023, Iran shipped about 600 disassembled drones to be reassembled in Russia before production was localized. In 2024, the design was adapted.",
      "Specialists added cameras to some drones and implemented a plan, revealed in an AP investigation, dubbed Operation False Target \u2014 creating decoys to overwhelm Ukrainian air defenses.",
      "Alabuga also modified the Shahed to make it more lethal, creating a thermobaric drone which sucks out all the oxygen in its path \u2014 potentially collapsing lungs, crushing eyeballs and causing brain damage. The size of the warhead was also upgraded.",
      "In at least one case, Iran shipped a jet-powered Shahed that Russia \u201cexperimented\u201d with in Ukraine, said Fabian Hinz, an expert on Russian and Iranian drones at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London.",
      "Ukraine\u2019s air force found two more examples of jet-powered Shaheds in May but it appears they have not been widely adopted.",
      "That\u2019s possibly because the Iranian design uses a very sophisticated jet engine that also powers Iran\u2019s cruise missiles, Hinz said. That likely makes it too expensive to use nightly in Ukraine, he said, even if the engine is swapped to a cheaper Chinese model.",
      "The electronics in the drone most recently found in Ukraine are also very expensive, Beskrestnov said, pointing to its AI computing platform, camera and radio link. It\u2019s unclear why it was deployed but Beskrestnov suggested it could be used to target \u201ccritical infrastructure,\u201d including electrical transmission towers.",
      "Previous versions of the Shahed drone could not hit a moving object or change their flight path once launched. They sometimes ended up \u201ctraveling in circles all through Ukraine before they finally hit a target,\u201d which made them easier to shoot down, said David Albright of the Washington-based Institute for Science and International Security.",
      "The radio link means an operator can communicate with the drone from Russia, introduce a new target and potentially control many drones at the same time, the experts said.",
      "The remotely operable Shahed has similarities to drones Russia is already using on the front lines and is particularly resistant to jamming, Beskrestnov said.",
      "There are eight, rather than four, antennas on the drone which means it is harder for Ukraine to overwhelm it with electronic warfare, he said.",
      "The new drone has markings that suggest the anti-jamming unit was made in Iran within the past year and similarities to Iranian components found in older models of the Shahed, said Beskrestnov.",
      "Such advanced antennas, said Hinz, have not previously been seen on drones used in Ukraine but have been found on Iranian missiles destined for Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen.",
      "In a statement, Ukraine's Ministry of Defense told AP in the past four months it had found drones with eight and 12 antennas made in China and Russia.",
      "Despite sanctions, both Russia and Iran have continued to find ways to procure Western technology.",
      "The drone\u2019s AI computing platform can help it autonomously navigate if communications are jammed. Similar technology was used by Ukraine to attack aircraft deep inside Russia during Operation Spiderweb, when it used drones to target Russian air bases hosting nuclear-capable strategic bombers.",
      "Russia is improving its technology at the same time as it is also changing its tactics.",
      "Moscow is flying the Shahed drones at high altitudes where they are out of reach of Ukrainian shooters, as well as lower down to avoid radio detection.",
      "It is also carrying out massive group attacks on cities including where drones sometimes dive-bomb a target, Ukraine's Ministry of Defense said.",
      "The drones can be used to clear a path for cruise missiles or to exhaust Ukrainian air defenses by sending a wave of decoys followed by one or two with a warhead.",
      "The tactics appear to be working.",
      "AP collected almost a year\u2019s worth of Russian drone strike data on Ukraine posted online by the Ukrainian air force.",
      "An analysis shows that Russia significantly ramped up its attacks after U.S. President Donald Trump was inaugurated in January. And Russian hits have increased markedly since March \u2014 shortly before reports emerged that Russia was using Shahed drones with advanced jammers.",
      "In November 2024, only around 6% of drones hit a discernible target but, by June, that reached about 16%. On some nights, almost 50% of drones got through Ukraine\u2019s air defenses.",
      "Ukraine's Ministry of Defense said the Shaheds' effectiveness is likely because Russia is firing more drones, including decoys, as well as the change in technology and tactics.",
      "But although Russia appears to have had increasing success striking Ukraine, it is not clear if that will continue.",

      "But that could change if the ceasefire between Iran and Israel collapses or if independent hacking groups supporting Iran make good on promises to wage their own digital conflict against the U.S., analysts and cyber experts say.",

      "The hackers detailed their work in a post on the Telegram messaging service and urged other hackers to follow their lead, according to researchers at the SITE Intelligence Group, which tracks the groups' activity.",
      "The attacks were denial-of-service attacks, in which a hacker tries to disrupt a website or online network.",
      "\u201cWe increase attacks from today,\u201d one of the hacker groups, known as Mysterious Team, posted Monday.",
      "Federal authorities say they are on guard for additional attempts by hackers to penetrate U.S. networks.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security issued a public bulletin Sunday warning of increased Iranian cyber threats. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency issued a statement Tuesday urging organizations that operate critical infrastructure like water systems, pipelines or power plants to stay vigilant.",
      "While it lacks the technical abilities of China or Russia, Iran has long been known as a \u201cchaos agent\u201d when it comes to using cyberattacks to steal secrets, score political points or frighten opponents.",
      "Cyberattacks mounted by Iran's government may end if the ceasefire holds and Tehran looks to avoid another confrontation with the U.S. But hacker groups could still retaliate on Iran's behalf.",
      "In some cases, these groups have ties to military or intelligence agencies. In other cases, they act entirely independently. More than 60 such groups have been identified by researchers at the security firm Trustwave.",
      "These hackers can inflict significant economic and psychological blows. Following Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel, for instance, hackers penetrated an emergency alert app used by some Israelis and directed it to inform users that a nuclear missile was incoming.",
      "\u201cIt causes an immediate psychological impact,\" said Ziv Mador, vice president of security research at Trustwave's SpiderLabs, which tracks cyberthreats.",
      "Economic disruption, confusion and fear are all the goals of such operations, said Mador, who is based in Israel. \u201cWe saw the same thing in Russia-Ukraine.\u201d",
      "While Iran lacks the cyberwarfare capabilities of China or Russia, it has repeatedly tried to use its more modest operations to try to spy on foreign leaders \u2014 something national security experts predict Tehran is almost certain to try again as it seeks to suss out President Donald Trump\u2019s next moves.",
      "Last year, federal authorities charged three Iranian operatives with trying to hack Trump\u2019s presidential campaign. It would be wrong to assume Iran has given up those efforts, according to Jake Williams, a former National Security Agency cybersecurity expert who is now vice president of research and development at Hunter Strategy, a Washington-based cybersecurity firm.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s fairly certain that these limited resources are being used for intelligence collection to understand what Israel or the U.S. might be planning next, rather than performing destructive attacks against U.S. commercial organizations,\u201d Williams said.",

      "The CIA, NSA and other intelligence agencies also have seen reductions in staffing. Trump abruptly fired Gen. Timothy Haugh, who oversaw the NSA and the Pentagon\u2019s Cyber Command.",
      "The Israel-Iran conflict shows the value of investments in cybersecurity and cyber offense, Mador said. He said Israel's strikes on Iran, which included attacks on nuclear scientists, required sophisticated cyberespionage that allowed Israel to track its targets.",
      "Expanding America's cyber defenses will require investments in education as well as technical fixes to ensure connected devices or networks aren't vulnerable, said Bellini, who recently contributed $40 million toward a new cybersecurity center at the University of South Florida.",

      "With help from his parents, who both have backgrounds in marketing, he founded the nonprofit Wild Tunes in 2023 to recruit musicians to play in animal shelters. So far he has enlisted about 100 volunteer musicians and singers of all ages and abilities to perform at nine shelters in Houston, New Jersey and Denver.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t have to understand the lyrics to enjoy the music. Just enjoy the melody, the harmony and the rhythms. So it transcends linguistic barriers, and even it can just transcend species,\u201d Agarwal said recently after playing hits like The Beatles' \u201cHey Jude\u201d and Ed Sheeran's \u201cPerfect\u201d on his portable keyboard at the Denver Animal Shelter.",
      "Agarwal, who was playing for an elderly miniature poodle named Pituca \u2014 Spanish slang sometimes used to describe a snob \u2014 said many of his four-legged listeners, which include cats, become excited when he enters their kennel. But after a few minutes of playing, they calm down. Some even go to sleep.",
      "He remembers a rescue dog named Penelope that refused to come out of her enclosure in Houston to be fed.",
      "\u201cWithin a short period of me playing, she went from not even coming out of her kennel to licking me all over my face and nibbling my ears,\u201d Agarwal said.",
      "A few stalls down from where he was jamming on his keyboard at the Denver shelter, volunteer Sarah McDonner played Mozart and Bach on her flute for Max, a 1-year-old stray boxer that tilted his head when she hit the high notes.",
      "\u201cThe animals having that human interaction in a positive way, I think, gives them something to look forward to, something that is different throughout their day,\u201d said McDonner, a professional musician who met Argawal in Houston.",
      "She helped bring the program to Colorado after moving to Denver a few months ago. \u201cI think it\u2019s very important to give them something different from what they\u2019re used to in their little tiny cages ... and makes them more adoptable in the long run,\u201d McDonner said.",
      "While the effect of music on humans has been studied extensively, its role in animal behavior remains murky.",
      "Several studies suggest that classical music generally has a calming influence on dogs in stressful environments like kennels, shelters and veterinary clinics. But some researchers warn there is not enough data to support the claim.",
      "\u201cWe always want these really simplistic answers. So we want to say that music calms animals, for example, and I think that it\u2019s much more nuanced than that,\u201d said Lori Kogan, a self-described \u201cdog-person\" who chairs the human-animal interaction section of the American Psychological Association. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot more research that needs to happen before I think that we can unequivocally say that music is a great thing for animals.\"",
      "Kogan, a professor and researcher at Colorado State University, has studied for more than two decades how animals and humans get along. Research involving the effect of music on dogs often produces mixed results, she said, because there are so many variables: the setting; the volume, type and tempo of the music and the breed of the dog and its previous exposure to music.",
      "She suggests a case-by-case approach to introducing music to animals.",
      "\u201cIf you play music for your pet, and they seem to like it and they appear calmer, then I think we can say that that\u2019s a positive thing, that you\u2019re providing some level of enrichment for that pet. ... I would encourage people to give it a try and to see how their pets respond,\u201d she said.",
      "For Agarwal, his firsthand experience at shelters is undeniable evidence that music helps comfort stressed animals, and he plans to grow Wild Tunes into a nationwide program. The volunteers get something out of it, too, he said.",
      "\"You get a really great way to practice your instrument or sing in front of a nonjudgmental audience, which can boost your confidence,\u201d he said.",

      "Defense tech hackathons are attracting engineering students, tech industry workers and hobbyists to solve military challenges",
      "SANDHURST, England -- Hunched over laptops, the team of four raced to solve a challenge: how to get a set of drones to fly themselves from one place to another when GPS and other signals are jammed by an enemy.",
      "Elsewhere around the hall, groups of people \u2014 engineering students, tech workers and hobbyists \u2014 gathered around long tables to brainstorm, write computer code or tinker with more drones and other hardware.",
      "Most of them were strangers when they first gathered last month at Britain's Sandhurst Military Academy to compete in a 24-hour \u201chackathon\" focused on defense technology. Many were drawn to the event because they wanted to use their technical skills to work on one of the biggest challenges confronting Europe: the continent's race to beef up its military capabilities as Russia's war in Ukraine threatens to widen global instability.",
      "\u201cGiven the geopolitical climate, defense tech is relevant now more than ever,\u201d said Aniketh Ramesh, a startup founder with a Ph.D. in robotics in extreme environments and one of the drone team members. The hackathon, he said, \u201cis a good place to sort of go and contribute your ideas.\u201d",
      "\u201cRobotics and drones are having their iPhone moment\" because costs have come down and the hardware is widely available, Ramesh said. That means building drones to do new things is more a \u201cthinking challenge\" than a technical one, he said.",
      "Ramesh already knew one teammate, a former British army paratrooper, from a previous event. They recruited two others \u2014 one engineer and one with a Ph.D. in computer vision \u2014 through the event\u2019s group chat on Signal.",
      "The drone problem was just one of the many challenges the teams could choose to solve. The tasks were proposed by defense startups like German drone maker Helsing and robotics company Arx, the British military and Kyiv-based venture capital firm D3.",
      "Some worked on software, such as an algorithm to predict which way a target would move. Others came with their own ideas. One team made a plastic cup packed with sensors that could be produced in large amounts to be scattered across a battlefield. Another team built a scale model of an autonomous medical evacuation aircraft.",
      "Similar competitions have been held regularly across Europe since last year, inspired by the Ukrainian military\u2019s on-the-fly wartime innovations to fend off the larger Russian army.",
      "The grassroots meetups are part of a wider network of defense innovation that organizers hope to foster in Europe, underscoring the continent's scramble to churn out weapons that have been turbocharged by U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s persistent threats to withdraw from the NATO trans-Atlantic security alliance.",
      "The idea is to \u201cgo build a prototype, take your prototype to become a product, and go build a company\u201d that can \u201cdeliver stuff to the frontline and hopefully save someone\u2019s life,\u201d said Benjamin Wolba, who organizes a separate but similar series, the European Defense Tech Hackathon.",
      "Wolba's group has held tournaments in about 10 cities in the past twelve months, including one in Lviv, Ukraine, in May, and has scheduled more this year in Sheffield, England; Gothenburg, Sweden; Marseilles, France; London; and Berlin.",
      "The European Union-backed EUDIS Defence Hackathon holds simultaneous competitions at eight universities twice a year. Meanwhile, NATO has launched DIANA, an \u201caccelerator\u201d program to speed up defense innovations.",
      "The competitions are producing real-world results. The winners of one European Defense Tech Hackathon were a team of Bulgarian high school students who came up with a de-mining solution that they used to found a startup.",
      "At last year\u2019s London event, the winning team devised an idea for an anti-drone system. They went to Ukraine for more testing, and then were bought by a startup that went on to raise millions in venture capital funding, said Richard Pass, co-founder of the London hackathon.",
      "This year, instead of a trophy, some London teams signed term sheets with investors.",
      "Hackathons have their origins in the software industry. Small teams of programmers and developers are pitted against each other in marathon brainstorming sessions to write programs that could become new products.",
      "\u201cThe beauty of the hackathon is you get a mixture of people who never normally meet,\u201d said Wolba. \u201cEngineers are \u201cpaired with actual investors who understand something on the commercial side, but also, critically, military end users.\u201d",
      "Organizers want to foster a culture of nimble startups to join Europe's defense ecosystem, traditionally dominated by a handful of big \u201cprime\u201d military contractors such as Britain's BAE, Germany's Rheinmetall and France's Thales that are focused on building pricey hardware.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s definitely been a shift in the industry from the purchase of more exquisite, high-cost capabilities, such as fighter jets, or submarines, or expensive tanks, towards more low-cost systems that can give you scale advantages,\u201d said Pass.",
      "A recent aerial confrontation between Pakistan and India further highlights how Europe is at risk of losing its edge against adversaries, he said.",
      "Pass said reports that Pakistan used Chinese-made fighter jets armed with Chinese air-to-air missiles to down Indian air force planes, including three French-made Rafale jets, came as a big surprise.",
      "Not only does it show \u201ctechnological parity between the Chinese and leading Western industrial nations like France,\u201d but it also hints at China's advantages in mass-producing fighter jets that could overwhelm Western forces, he said.",
      "Fostering a broader European defense tech start-up ecosystem is a way \u201cto regain that technological advantage,\u201d he said.",
      "Defense tech startup founders can ride a wave of investment as Europe moves to beef up its military capabilities. Leaders of NATO, which includes 30 European nations, are meeting this week to endorse a goal to spend 5% of gross domestic product on defense.",
      "The European Union has sought to mobilize 800 billion euros ($927 billion) to boost the 27-nation bloc's defense, with priorities including drones, AI, autonomous systems and quantum computing.",
      "Britain, which left the EU, has meanwhile pledged to spend 10% of its defense budget on new technologies.",
      "Europe still has a long way to go. The continent's defense tech startup ecosystem is young and about five years behind the United States, consulting firm McKinsey said in a recent report. But it's growing rapidly as investors flock there. Venture capital investment in Europe's defense tech sector for 2021-2024 more than quadrupled from the previous three-year period, according to Pitchbook.",
      "At the London hackathon, teams worked into the evening, fueled by chocolate bars, energy drinks, fruit and a late-night pizza delivery. Army cots were available for those who wanted to catch a few hours of sleep.",
      "Soldiers in camouflage and defense company reps hovered on the sidelines to provide advice and answer questions.",
      "Andrii Solonskyi, CEO of Soloma Avionics, which fielded a team, said defense hackathons are \u201ca bit of a novelty.\u201d",
      "The industry has traditionally been more structured and formal, because \u201cit\u2019s a serious business and there\u2019s a lot of things that can go wrong,\u201d he said. But, \"what we definitely feel is that you can be very agile in defense right now.\"",

      "But the company is still on the hook and must now go to trial over how it acquired those books by downloading them from online \u201cshadow libraries\u201d of pirated copies.",
      "U.S. District Judge William Alsup of San Francisco said in a ruling filed late Monday that the AI system's distilling from thousands of written works to be able to produce its own passages of text qualified as \u201cfair use\u201d under U.S. copyright law because it was \u201cquintessentially transformative.\u201d",
      "\u201cLike any reader aspiring to be a writer, Anthropic\u2019s (AI large language models) trained upon works not to race ahead and replicate or supplant them \u2014 but to turn a hard corner and create something different,\u201d Alsup wrote.",
      "But while dismissing a key claim made by the group of authors who sued the company for copyright infringement last year, Alsup also said Anthropic must still go to trial in December over its alleged theft of their works.",
      "\u201cAnthropic had no entitlement to use pirated copies for its central library,\u201d Alsup wrote.",
      "A trio of writers \u2014 Andrea Bartz, Charles Graeber and Kirk Wallace Johnson \u2014 alleged in their lawsuit last summer that Anthropic's practices amounted to \u201clarge-scale theft,\" and that the San Francisco-based company \u201cseeks to profit from strip-mining the human expression and ingenuity behind each one of those works.\u201d",
      "Books are known to be important sources of the data \u2014 in essence, billions of words carefully strung together \u2014 that are needed to build large language models. In the race to outdo each other in developing the most advanced AI chatbots, a number of tech companies have turned to online repositories of stolen books that they can get for free.",
      "Documents disclosed in San Francisco's federal court showed Anthropic employees' internal concerns about the legality of their use of pirate sites. The company later shifted its approach and hired Tom Turvey, the former Google executive in charge of Google Books, a searchable library of digitized books that successfully weathered years of copyright battles.",
      "With his help, Anthropic began buying books in bulk, tearing off the bindings and scanning each page before feeding the digitized versions into its AI model, according to court documents. But that didn't undo the earlier piracy, according to the judge.",
      "\u201cThat Anthropic later bought a copy of a book it earlier stole off the internet will not absolve it of liability for the theft but it may affect the extent of statutory damages,\u201d Alsup wrote.",
      "The ruling could set a precedent for similar lawsuits that have piled up against Anthropic competitor OpenAI, maker of ChatGPT, as well as against Meta Platforms, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram.",
      "Anthropic \u2014 founded by ex-OpenAI leaders in 2021 \u2014 has marketed itself as the more responsible and safety-focused developer of generative AI models that can compose emails, summarize documents and interact with people in a natural way.",
      "But the lawsuit filed last year alleged that Anthropic\u2019s actions \u201chave made a mockery of its lofty goals\u201d by building its AI product on pirated writings.",
      "Anthropic said Tuesday it was pleased that the judge recognized that AI training was transformative and consistent with \u201ccopyright\u2019s purpose in enabling creativity and fostering scientific progress.\u201d Its statement didn't address the piracy claims.",
      "The authors' attorneys declined comment.",

      "Waymo's robotaxis will begin carrying passengers through parts of Atlanta on Tuesday in an expansion of a partnership with Uber that began earlier this year in Austin.",
      "Waymo's driverless march into Atlanta comes just days after Tesla finally launched a limited robotaxi service in Austin, more than five years after CEO Elon Musk brashly promised the electric automaker would quickly overtake Waymo as the leader in autonomous driving technology. Unlike Waymo's robotaxis, Tesla is initially placing a human in the passenger seat of its rival service to take over the vehicle if something goes wrong.",
      "While Tesla is starting with about a dozen supervised robotaxis, Waymo and Uber have dispatched about 100 completely driverless vehicles in Austin less than four months after their partnership began. The expansion into Atlanta keeps the two companies aligned with a road map they laid out last September.",
      "As has been the case in Austin, Waymo's robotaxis in Atlanta will be dispatched through Uber's app. Uber will give customers a choice to request a car operated by a human if they don't want to take a driverless ride. The robotaxis will initially cover a 65-square-mile (168,00-square-kilometers) area within the Atlanta market before expanding to a larger stretch.",
      "Waymo's own ride-hailing app is available in Phoenix, Los Angeles and a steadily expanding swath of the San Francisco Bay Area. Factoring in its partnership with Uber, Waymo is currently providing more than 250,000 paid rides per week \u2014 making it the early frontrunner in the still-nascent robotaxi market.",
      "But competition looms down the road as Musk continues to insist Tesla's robotaxi service will be able to grow quickly and Amazon gears up to bring its Zoox driverless cabs to Las Vegas later this year \u2014 with plans to expand into San Francisco next year. Zoox is also aiming to bring its robotaxi service to Atlanta, although it hasn't set a target date for that yet.",
      "Uber once had ambitions to build robotaxis, but reversed course after a bruising legal battle with Waymo, which alleged the ride-hailing company stole its autonomous technology after poaching one of its engineers. After reaching a $245 million settlement with Waymo, Uber eventually sold its self-driving vehicle division following a 2018 crash that killed a pedestrian in Tempe, Arizona.",
      "Uber then pivoted to robotaxi partnerships to remain competitive as driverless cabs reshape the ride-hailing market. \u201cBy integrating Waymo\u2019s cutting-edge technology into the Uber platform, we\u2019re continuing to make transportation more convenient, sustainable, and reliable,\u201d said Sarfraz Maredia, who oversees Uber's efforts in autonomous driving.",

      "A laser navigating tool doomed a Japanese company's lunar lander earlier this month, causing it to crash into the moon.",
      "Officials for ispace announced the news from Tokyo on Tuesday. The crash landing was the second for ispace in two years.",
      "This time, the company\u2019s lander named Resilience was aiming for the moon\u2019s far north in Mare Frigoris, or Sea of Cold. NASA\u2019s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter relayed pictures of the crash site last week where Resilience and its mini rover ended up as wreckage.",
      "Company officials blamed the accident on the lander's laser range finder, saying it was slow to kick in and properly measure the spacecraft's distance to the lunar surface. Resilience was descending at a rapid rate of 138 feet (42 meters) per second when contact was lost, and crashed five seconds later, they said.",
      "Bad software caused ispace's first lunar lander to slam into the moon in 2023. Like the latest try, the problem occurred during the final phase of descent.",
      "Of seven moon landing attempts by private outfits in recent years, only one can claim total success: Firefly Aerospace's touchdown of its Blue Ghost lander in March. Blue Ghost launched with Resilience in January, sharing a SpaceX rocket ride from Florida.",
      "Aside from Texas-based Firefly, only five countries have pulled off a successful lunar landing: the Soviet Union, the U.S., China, India and Japan. And only the U.S. has put astronauts on the moon, back during NASA's Apollo program more than a half-century ago.",
      "Despite back-to-back losses, ispace is pressing ahead with its third moon landing attempt in 2027, with NASA cooperation, as well as a fourth planned mission. Extra tests and improvements will add as much as 1.5 billion yen (more than $10 million) to the development costs, officials said.",
      "CEO and founder Takeshi Hakamada stressed that his company \u201chas not stepped down in the face of setbacks\" and is looking to regain customers' trust. Outside experts will join the accident review, and ispace will collaborate more closely with the Japanese Space Agency on technical matters.",

    "story": [
      "Although women face the threat of more injury risks in vehicle crashes, the crash test dummies used in U.S. safety tests are designed almost entirely around the body of a man",
      "Maria Weston Kuhn had one lingering question about the car crash that forced her to have emergency surgery during a vacation in Ireland: Why did she and her mother sustain serious injuries while her father and brother, who sat in the front, emerge unscathed?",
      "\u201cIt was a head-on crash and they were closest to the point of contact,\" said Kuhn, now 25, who missed a semester of college to recover from the 2019 collision that caused her seat belt to slide off her hips and rupture her intestines by pinning them against her spine. \"That was an early clue that something else was going on.\u201d",
      "When Kuhn returned home to Maine, she found an article her grandma had clipped from Consumer Reports and left on her bed. Women are 73% more likely to be injured in a frontal crash, she learned, yet the dummy used in vehicle tests  by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration dates back to the 1970s and is still modeled almost entirely off the body of a man.",
      "Kuhn, who is starting law school at New York University this fall, took action and founded the nonprofit Drive US Forward. Its aim was to raise public awareness and eventually encourage members of Congress to sign onto a bill that would require NHTSA to incorporate a more advanced female dummy into its testing.",
      "The agency has the final word on whether cars get pulled from the market, and the kind of dummy used in its safety tests could impact which ones receive coveted five-star ratings.",
      "\u201cIt seems like we have an easy solution here where we can have crash test dummies that reflect an average woman as well as a man,\u201d Sen. Deb Fischer, a Nebraska Republican who has introduced the legislation the past two sessions, told The Associated Press.",
      "Senators from both parties have signed onto Fischer's \u201cShe Drives Act,\u201d and the transportation secretaries from the past two presidential administrations have expressed support for updating the rules.",
      "But for various reasons, the push for new safety requirements has been moving at a sluggish pace. That's particularly true in the U.S., where much of the research is happening and where around 40,000 people are killed each year in car crashes.",
      "The crash test dummy currently used in NHTSA five-star testing is called the Hybrid III, which was developed in 1978 and modeled after a 5-foot-9, 171-pound man (the average size in the 1970s but about 29 pounds lighter than today's average). What's known as the female dummy is essentially a much smaller version of the male model with a rubber jacket to represent breasts. It's routinely tested in the passenger seat or the back seat but seldom in the driver's seat, even though the majority of licensed drivers are women.",
      "\u201cWhat they didn\u2019t do is design a crash test dummy that has all the sensors in the areas where a woman would be injured differently than a man,\u201d said Christopher O'Connor, president and CEO of the Farmington Hills, Michigan-based Humanetics Group, which has spent more than a decade developing and refining one.",
      "A female dummy from Humanetics equipped with all of the available sensors costs around $1 million, about twice the cost of the Hybrid used now.",
      "But, O'Connor says, the more expensive dummy far more accurately reflects the anatomical differences between the sexes \u2014 including in the shape of the neck, collarbone, pelvis, and legs, which one NHTSA study found account for about 80% more injuries by women in a car crash compared to men.",
      "Such physical dummies will always be needed for vehicle safety tests, and to verify the accuracy of virtual tests, O'Connor said.",
      "Europe incorporated the more advanced male dummy developed by Humanetics' engineers, the THOR 50M (based on a 50th percentile man), into its testing procedures soon after Kuhn's 2019 crash in Ireland. Several other countries, including China and Japan, have adopted it as well.",
      "But that model and the female version the company uses for comparison, the THOR 5F (based on a 5th percentile woman), have been met with skepticism from some American automakers who argue the more sophisticated devices may exaggerate injury risks and undercut the value of some safety features such as seat belts and airbags.",
      "Bridget Walchesky, 19, had to be flown to a hospital, where she required eight surgeries over a month, after a 2022 crash near her home in Sheboygan, Wisconsin, that killed her friend, who was driving. While acknowledging the seat belt likely saved her life, Walchesky said some of the injuries \u2014 including her broken collarbone \u2014 were the result of it pinning her too tightly, which she views as something better safety testing focused on women could improve.",
      "\u201cSeat belts aren\u2019t really built for bodies on females,\u201d Walchesky said. \u201cSome of my injuries, the way the force hit me, they were probably worsened.\u201d",
      "The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, an industry trade group, said in a statement to the AP that the better way to ensure safety \u2014 which it called its top priority \u2014 is through upgrades to the existing Hybrid dummy rather than mandating a new one.",
      "\u201cThis can happen on a faster timeline and lead to quicker safety improvements than requiring NHTSA to adopt unproven crash test dummy technology,\u201d the alliance said.",
      "Humanetics' THOR dummies received high marks in the vehicle safety agency's early tests. Using cadavers from actual crashes to compare the results, NHTSA found they outperformed the existing Hybrid in predicting almost all injuries \u2014 including to the head, neck, shoulders, abdomen and legs.",
      "A separate review by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, a research arm funded by auto insurers, was far more critical of the dummy's ability to predict chest injuries in a frontal crash. Despite the vast expansion in the number of sensors, the insurance institute's testing found, the male THOR dummy was less accurate than the current Hybrid dummies, which also had limitations.",
      "\u201cMore isn\u2019t necessarily better,\u201d said Jessica Jermakian, senior vice president for vehicle research at IIHS. \u201cYou also have to be confident that the data is telling you the right things about how a real person would fare in that crash.\"",
      "NHTSA\u2019s budget plan commits to developing the female THOR 5F version with the ultimate goal of incorporating it into the testing. But there could be a long wait considering the THOR's male version adopted by other countries is still awaiting final approval in the U.S.",
      "A 2023 report by the Government Accountability Office, which conducts research for Congress, cited numerous \u201cmissed milestones\u201d in NHTSA's development of various crash dummy enhancements \u2014 including in the THOR models.",
      "Kuhn acknowledges being frustrated by the slow process of trying to change the regulations. She says she understands why there's reluctance from auto companies if they fear being forced to make widespread design changes with more consideration for women's safety.",
      "\u201cFortunately, they have very skilled engineers and they\u2019ll figure it out,\u201d she said.",

    "summary": "New York City is using ranked choice voting in its Democratic mayoral primary election",
    "story": [
      "New York City is using ranked choice voting in its Democratic mayoral primary election",
      "NEW YORK -- New York City is using ranked choice voting in its Democratic mayoral primary election Tuesday, a system that takes some explaining, even for New Yorkers who have used it before.",
      "Voters' understanding of how ranked choice works could play a role in which candidate comes out on top in a race that features former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, progressive upstart Zohran Mamdani and several other current and former public officials, including City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams and City Comptroller Brad Lander, who was arrested last week at an immigration court.",
      "The system is based on a simple premise: Democracy works better if people aren't forced to make an all-or-nothing choice with their vote.",
      "Rather than pick just one candidate, voters get to rank several in order of preference. Even if a voter's top choice doesn't have enough support to win, their rankings of other candidates still play a role in determining the victor.",
      "The system is more complex than a traditional election, making it tough to forecast a winner. It could also take longer to get results.",
      "In New York City's version, voters get to rank up to five candidates, from first to last, on the ballot.",
      "If one candidate is the first choice of a majority of voters \u2014 more than 50% \u2014 that person wins the race outright, just like in a traditional election.",
      "If nobody hits that threshold, ranked choice analysis kicks in.",
      "Vote tabulation is done by computer in rounds. After the first round, the candidate in last place \u2014 the candidate ranked No. 1 by the fewest amount of people \u2014 is eliminated. The computer then looks at the ballots cast by people who ranked that candidate first, to see who they ranked second. Those people's votes are then redistributed to their second choices.",
      "That process then repeats. As more candidates are eliminated, voters' third, fourth and even fifth choices could potentially come into play. Rounds continue until there are only two candidates left. The one with the most votes wins.",
      "Eleven candidates are on the ballot in the Democratic mayoral primary. Incumbent Mayor Eric Adams isn't one of them. He's a Democrat but is running as an independent. The Republican Party has already picked its nominee, Guardian Angels founder Curtis Sliwa.",
      "The computerized process of tabulating votes takes little time, but it doesn't start right away.",
      "Polls close at 9 p.m. Tuesday. Within a few hours, preliminary results should give a picture of how the candidates are doing based on voters' first choices.",
      "The ranked choice tabulations, however, won't start until July 1 because the city needs to wait for the arrival of mail-in ballots.",
      "The July 1 tabulation could potentially give a clear picture of who won, but the result won't be official. Further rounds of ranked choice analysis will be done as additional absentee ballots come in until the board certifies the election July 15.",
      "This will be the second time New York City has used ranked choice in a mayoral primary. The first time, in 2021, things went haywire when elections officials neglected to clear test data from the tabulation program. That led to an inaccurate vote tally being reported until officials realized the error.",
      "Officials are hoping things go smoother this time.",
      "One benefit is that nobody \u201cwastes\u201d their vote by picking an unpopular candidate as their first choice.",
      "Voters can rank someone they like No. 1, even if they suspect the candidate doesn't stand a chance. If that person is eliminated, voters still get a say in who wins based on their other rankings.",
      "Another benefit is that it's tough for someone to get elected without broad support. In a traditional election, it's possible for someone with fringe political views to win in a crowded field of candidates, even if they are deeply disliked by a majority of voters.",
      "That's theoretically less likely in a ranked choice system. A candidate could get the largest share of first-choice votes but still lose to someone who is the second or third choice of a large number of people.",
      "The system is tough to grasp. It requires voters to do more research. It also makes races less predictable.",
      "Transparency and trust are also potential problems. Ordinarily, candidates, the public and news organizations can see votes coming in, precinct by precinct, and know exactly who is leading and where their support comes from.",
      "Under the ranked choice system, the process of redistributing votes is done by computer. Outside groups will have a harder time evaluating whether the software sorted the ranked votes accurately.",
      "That\u2019s a challenge for news organizations, like The Associated Press, that analyze vote tallies and attempt to report a winner before the count is complete.",
      "There may be instances when candidates who seem to have a comfortable lead in first-place votes on election night lose because relatively few voters rank them as their second or third choice. That could lead to people questioning the results.",

    "story": [
      "Elon Musk has long promised to put a fleet of driverless Tesla \u201crobotaxis\" on the roads, but fans and shareholders have been kept waiting",
      "NEW YORK -- Elon Musk promised in 2019 that driverless Tesla \u201crobotaxis\u201d would be on the road \u201cnext year,\u201d but it didn\u2019t happen. A year later, he promised to deliver them the next year, but that didn\u2019t happen either.",
      "Despite the empty pledges the promises kept coming. Last year in January, Musk said, \u201cNext year for sure, we\u2019ll have over a million robotaxis.\u201d",
      "Would you settle for 10 or 12?",
      "Musk appears to be on the verge of making his robotaxi vision a reality with a test run of a small squad of self-driving cabs in Austin, Texas, starting Sunday. Reaching a million may take a year or more, however, although the billionaire should be able to expand the service this year if the Austin demo is a success.",
      "The stakes couldn't be higher, nor the challenges.",
      "While Musk was making those \u201cnext year\u201d promises, rival Waymo was busy deploying driverless taxis in Los Angeles, San Diego, Austin and other cities by using a different technology that allowed it to get to market faster. It just completed its 10 millionth paid ride.",
      "Boycotts related to Musk's politics have tanked Tesla's sales. Rival electric vehicle makers with newly competitive models have stolen market share. And investors are on edge after a $150 billion stock wipeout  when Musk picked a social media fight with a U.S. president overseeing federal car regulators who could make the robotaxi rollout much more difficult. The stock has recovered somewhat after Musk said he regretted some of his remarks.",
      "Tesla shareholders have stood by Musk over the years because he\u2019s defied the odds by building a successful standalone electric vehicle company \u2014 self-driving car promises aside \u2014 and making them a lot of money in the process. A decade ago, Tesla shares traded for around $18. The shares closed Friday at $322.",
      "Musk says the Austin test will begin modestly enough, with just 10 or 12 vehicles picking up passengers in a limited area. But then it will quickly ramp up and spread to other cities, eventually reaching hundreds of thousands if not a million vehicles next year.",
      "Some Musk watchers on Wall Street are skeptical.",
      "\u201cHow quickly can he expand the fleet?\u201d asks Garrett Nelson, an analyst at CFRA. \u201cWe're talking maybe a dozen vehicles initially. It's very small.\"",
      "Morningstar's Seth Goldstein says Musk is being classic Musk: Promising too much, too quickly.",
      "\u201cWhen anyone in Austin can download the app and use a robotaxi, that will be a success, but I don't think that will happen until 2028,\" he says. \u201cTesting is going to take a while.\u201d",
      "Musk's tendency to push up the stock high with a bit of hyperbole is well known among investors.",
      "In 2018, he told Tesla stockholders he had \u201cfunding secured\u201d to buy all their shares at a massive premium and take the company private. But he not only lacked a written commitment from financiers, according to federal stock regulators who fined him, he hadn't discussed the loan amount or other details with them.",
      "More recently, Musk told CNBC in May that Tesla was experiencing a \u201cmajor rebound\u201d in demand. A week later an auto trade group in Europe announced sales had plunged by half.",
      "Musk has come under fire for allegedly exaggerating the ability of the system used for its cars to drive themselves, starting with the name. Full Self-Driving is a misnomer. The system still requires drivers to keep their eyes on the road because they may need to intervene and take control at any moment.",
      "Federal highway safety regulators opened an investigation into FSD last year after several accidents, and the Department of Justice has conducted its own probe, though the status of that is not known. Tesla has also faced lawsuits over the feature, some resulting in settlements, other dismissed. In one case, a judge ruled against the plaintiffs but only because they hadn't proved Musk \u201cknowingly\u201d made false statements.",
      "Musk says the robotaxis will be running on an improved version of Full Self-Driving and the cabs will be safe.",
      "He also says the service will be able to expand rapidly around the country. His secret weapon: Millions of Tesla owners now on the roads. He says an over-the-air software update will soon allow them to turn their cars into driverless cabs and start a side business while stuck at the office for eight hours or on vacation for a week.",
      "\u201cInstead of having your car sit in the parking lot, your car could be earning money,\u201d Musk said earlier this year, calling it an Airbnb model for cars. \u201cYou will be able to add or subtract your car to the fleet.\u201d",
      "Musk says Tesla also can move fast to deploy taxis now because of his decision to rely only on cameras for the cars to navigate, unlike Waymo, which has gone a more expensive route by supplementing its cameras with lasers and radar.",
      "\u201cTesla will have, I don\u2019t know,\u201d Musk mused in an conference call with investors, \u201d99% market share or something ridiculous.\u201d Given Waymo's head start and potential competition from Amazon and others, dominating the driverless market to that extent could be a reach.",
      "But Dan Ives, a Wedbush Securities analyst and big Musk fan, says this time Musk may actually pull it off because of Tesla's ability to scale up quickly. And even skeptics like Morningstar's Goldstein acknowledge that Musk occasionally does gets things right, and spectacularly so.",
      "He upended the car industry by getting people to buy expensive electric vehicles, brought his Starlink satellite internet service to rural areas and, more recently, performed a gee-whiz trick of landing an unmanned SpaceX rocket on a platform back on earth.",
      "\u201cMaybe his timelines aren\u2019t realistic,\" Goldstein says, \u201cbut he can develop futuristic technology products.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Officials unveiled details about a 15-year top-secret program.",
      "The Pentagon on Thursday released an extraordinary number of details about the military's top-secret bombing of Iran's nuclear facilities and its defense of an air base in Qatar.",
      "The unusual disclosures \u2013 including analysts briefed at secret locations, bombs dropped into ventilation shafts, and a small group of young service members left behind at a base to shoot down Iranian missiles \u2013 is being orchestrated by a White House angry over questions about the effectiveness of the U.S. strike, which targeted three Iranian nuclear targets on June 21.",
      "Trump insists Iran's nuclear program has been \"obliterated,\" while an early military intelligence assessment said the strike might only have set back Iran's program by \"months.\" Military officials say they need much more time to assess the damage.",
      "Here's what we've learned:",
      "There was a 15-year, top-secret mission to figure out how to destroy Iran's Fordo nuclear facility",
      "In 2009, a U.S. officer working for the Defense Threat Reduction Agency was brought into a vault at an undisclosed location and shown highly classified photos of a construction site in the Iranian mountains, according to Gen. Dan Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.",
      "Caine said the officer and another colleague would go on to spend 15 years studying the site. They analyzed the weather and the geology of the mountain, along with any items discarded from the site. They eyed ventilation shafts, electrical systems and environmental control systems too, he said.",
      "\"Every nook, every crater, every piece of equipment going in and every piece of equipment going out -- they literally dreamed about this target at night when they slept,\" Caine said.",
      "When the analysts realized they did not have a weapon to strike Fordo if needed, Caine said they teamed up with industry in a top-secret effort to build the Massive Ordnance Penetrator, or GBU-57, specifically to hit it.",
      "\"Then, on a day in June of 2025, more than 15 years after they started their life's work, the phone rang and the president of the United States ordered the B-2 force\" to strike the target, Caine said.",
      "One of them later told Caine, \"I can't even get my head around this.\"",
      "12 bombs were dropped down two ventilation shafts capped with concrete.",
      "In a bid to defend the strikes as successful, both Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth in recent days have publicly disclosed that 12 of the 14 Massive Ordnance Penetrators used in the June 21 strike were dropped on the nuclear facility at Fordo.",
      "At the briefing on Thursday, Caine went further, describing that six bunker-buster bombs were dropped down each of the two ventilation shafts with fuses programmed to detonate at specific times.",
      "Caine said the Iranians had covered the ventilation shafts with concrete caps, but the first bomb blew off the caps. After that, the next four bombs were programmed to drop more than 1,000 feet per second and \"explode in the mission space.\" The final bomb was designated as a \"flex weapon,\" or backup, he said.",
      "\"All six weapons at each vent, at Fordow went exactly where they were intended to go,\" Caine said, adding that the result was \"a mix of overpressure and blast ripping through the open tunnels and destroying critical hardware.\"",
      "Caine said the fighter pilots who trailed the B-2 bombers said that after the first bomb struck the target \"the pilots stated, quote, this was the brightest explosion that I've ever seen. It literally looked like daylight.\"",
      "DIA says Fordo damaged, but questions remain on impact to Iran's nuclear program.",
      "About a day after the attack, the Defense Intelligence Agency produced an early assessment estimating Iran's nuclear program was set back by \"months.\"",
      "According to the two people familiar with the classified report, the bombing sealed off the entrances to two of the three nuclear sites targeted in the attack but that most of the damage was done to structures above ground, leaving the lower structures intact. The assessment also found that at least some enriched uranium remained \u2013 possibly moved from the nuclear sites ahead of the blasts.",
      "President Donald Trump insists the enriched uranium wasn't moved in advance.",
      "Hegseth, visibly angry that details of the report had leaked, said \"new intelligence\" estimates the Iran program has been knocked back by \"years,\" not months, and he read from the classified assessment to reporters.",
      "\"It points out that it's not been coordinated with the intelligence community at all,\" said Hegseth, adding that the report was labeled \"low confidence.\"",
      "A couple of dozen service members in their 20s defended a U.S. airbase in Qatar.",
      "Two days after the strike, U.S. officials got word that Iran was planning to launch a retaliatory attack on an American air base in Qatar called al-Udeid.",
      "According to Caine, officials quickly evacuated the base in part of extend the security perimeter, leaving behind two Patriot missile batteries and some 44 soldiers.",
      "Of the troops left to defend the base, the oldest was a 28-year-old captain.",
      "Caine said the group listened to \"chatter\" of the impending attack in the oppressive heat and were told to ensure their missile batteries were pointed north. Iran began launching short- and medium-range missiles, prompting the soldiers to unleash \"round after round\" of Patriot missiles from their canisters.",
      "Caine called the operation the \"largest single Patriot engagement in U.S. military history,\" noting the Qataris aided in the defense.",
      "\"I'm not going to tell you how many rounds were shot,\" Caine said, noting the number was classified. \"But it was a bunch.\"",

      "A few moments before, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's vaccine advisory committee voted 6-0 to recommend all Americans aged 6 months and older receive an annual influenza vaccine.",
      "One committee member, Vicky Pebsworth, abstained on each vote.",
      "Thimerosal is a mercury-based preservative, which is used to prevent microbial contamination of vaccines. Most flu vaccines currently used in the United States contain little to no thimerosal, but both the Food and Drug Administration and the CDC say there is no evidence low doses of thimerosal in vaccines cause harm other than minor reactions at the injection site, such as redness or swelling.",
      "Additionally, a 2010 CDC study found exposure to vaccines and immunoglobulins that contain thimerosal, in prenatal or infant stages, does not increase risk for autism spectrum disorder.",
      "This preservative was previously used in some common childhood immunizations, However, in the late 1990s, federal health agencies, the American Academy of Pediatrics and vaccine manufacturers agreed to reduce or eliminate thimerosal in vaccines as a precautionary measure, which public health experts previously told ABC News gave rise to anti-vaccine groups alleging thimerosal is not safe and fueled speculation that mercury causes autism.",
      "Kennedy, who has promoted vaccine-skeptic views that experts and decades of robust research have refuted, wrote a book in 2014 falsely claiming thimerosal is \"toxic to brain tissue\" and may cause autism, calling for its removal from all vaccines.",
      "During the ACIP meeting, Lyn Redwood, a former president of Children's Health Defense, a group that used to be chaired by Kennedy, gave a highly charged presentation as a private citizen. She claimed the preservative was toxic to the brain and refuted evidence-based claims that there has been no proven harm from thimerosal in vaccines.",
      "Her presentation received pushback from ACIP member Dr. Cody Meissner, who was the only member to vote against the recommendation. He said there \"is no scientific evidence that thimerosal has caused problems.\"",
      "\"The risk for influenza is so much greater than the non-existing risk from thimerosal,\" he added.",
      "Meissner said vaccines with thimerosal are metabolized as ethylmercury, not methylmercury, which is the form of mercury found in fish and shellfish, and is known to be a neurotoxin.",
      "\"I'm not quite sure how to respond to this presentation,\" he said. \"This is an old issue that has been addressed in the past. Ethylmercury is excreted much more quickly from the body. It is not associated with the high neurotoxicity that methylmercury [is].\"",
      "Meissner also added that thimerosal is included in most multi-dose vaccines administered around the world because single-dose vials are more expensive, and removing thimerosal could increase the costs of vaccines.",
      "\"Thimerosal is included in most vaccines that are administered around the globe, and that is because single-dose vials are more expensive, and many countries cannot afford a single-dose vial,\" Meissner said.",
      "He went on, \"I realize ACIP is focused on the United States, but the recommendations that the ACIP makes are followed among many countries around the world and removing thimerosal from all vaccines that are used in other countries, for example, is going to reduce access to these vaccines, it will increase cost.\"",
      "Multiple liaisons of medical groups in the committee also questioned in the meeting why Redwood was permitted to present given her limited scientific background and pushed back on the lack of peer-reviewed studies in her presentation.",
      "\"This committee has always prided itself on openness, transparency and data and evidence. So I am wondering if we will have an actual scientific presentation with peer-reviewed literature, strong evidence to actually discuss this issue, as many statements have been made here today, without support of science or evidence, but merely opinion,\" Dr. Jason Goldman, a liaison for the American College of Physicians (ACP), said in the meeting.",
      "A CDC review of evidence on thimerosal was previously published on the agency's website -- showing no safety risks from the ingredient -- but was later taken down. A former CDC official posted a copy of the article online.",
      "\"A scientifically rigorous CDC report reviewing the safety of thimerosal was posted for public access and then abruptly removed at the direction of the Office of the Secretary. The removal of this document, which contextualized decades of evidence showing no link between thimerosal and neurotoxicity or autism, raises serious concerns about transparency and the integrity of the decision-making process,\" Sean O'Leary, chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics' Committee on Infectious Diseases, said in a statement to ABC News.",
      "Doctors have voiced concern that no longer recommending thimerosal in some flu shots could lead to less people getting vaccinated and fuel further distrust of vaccines.",
      "\"Any decrease in the number of flu vaccines available will likely result in fewer people being vaccinated and subsequently more hospitalizations and deaths. Its removal could also signal to the general public unwarranted safety concerns,\" O'Leary said.",
      "Another heated exchange in the meeting came during the discussion of flu vaccines when ACIP member Dr. Robert Malone described the 250 flu deaths among children during the most recent flu season as a \"modest number.\"",
      "\"The 250 pediatric deaths, which is, let's acknowledge, is a modest number fortunately,\" Malone said.",
      "This past season saw the highest number of flu deaths among children for a non-pandemic season, and the highest number seen since the 2009 H1N1 global flu pandemic, CDC data shows.",
      "Malone received immediate push back during the meeting. Goldman from ACP said the number of deaths \"is not a small number, especially if it's your own child dying from the vaccine preventable illness.\"",

      "President Donald Trump on Thursday offered enthusiastic praise of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's briefing at the Pentagon, where he provided more information about the U.S. strikes on Iran and defended the president.",
      "\"One of the greatest, most professional, and most 'confirming' News Conferences I have ever seen! The Fake News should fire everyone involved in this Witch Hunt, and apologize to our great warriors, and everyone else!\" Trump wrote on his conservative social media platform, where earlier he had encouraged followers to tune in.",
      "Hegseth's news conference came amid a full-court press from Trump's top officials disputing a preliminary U.S. intelligence assessment that said the bombings may have only set Iran's nuclear program back by a few months.",
      "\"You want to call it destroyed. You want to call it defeated. You want to call it obliterated. Choose your word. This was an historically successful attack and we should celebrate as Americans,\" a defiant Hegseth said from the podium as he railed against the news media coverage of the events and the leaked initial intelligence assessment.",
      "\"This is preliminary but leaked because someone had an agenda to try to muddy the waters and make it look like this historic strike wasn't successful,\" Hegseth said.",
      "\"Classified information is leaked or peddled for political purposes to try to make the president look bad,\" he added.",
      "The day prior, CIA Director John Ratcliffe and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard posted statements saying their intelligence supported Trump's description of the damage inflicted by the U.S. military operation.",
      "\"CIA can confirm that a body of credible intelligence indicates Iran's Nuclear Program has been severely damaged by the recent, targeted strikes,\" Ratcliffe wrote in a statement.",
      "Gabbard wrote on X: \"New intelligence confirms what @POTUS has stated numerous times: Iran's nuclear facilities have been destroyed. If the Iranians chose to rebuild, they would have to rebuild all three facilities (Natanz, Fordow, Esfahan) entirely, which would likely take years to do.\"",
      "Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Dan Caine, who on Sunday had said it was \"way too early\" to make complete damage assessments, at Thursday's news conference declined to give a detailed damage assessment.",
      "\"By design, we don't grade our own homework. The intelligence community does,\" Caine said.",
      "\"But here's what we know following the attacks and the strikes on Fordo,\" Caine continued. \"First, that the weapons were built, tested and loaded properly. Two, the weapons were released on speed and on parameters. Three, the weapons all guided to their intended targets and to their intended aim points. Four, the weapons functioned as designed, meaning they exploded.\"",
      "\"We know this through other means, intelligence means that we have that we were visibly able to see them,\" Caine added. \"And we know that the trailing jets saw the first weapons function and the pilots stated quote this was the brightest explosion that I've ever seen. It literally looked like daylight.'\"",
      "Caine was asked if he felt any political pressure on how to describe the strikes or their impact. \u201cNo, I have not, and no, I would not,\u201d Caine responded.",
      "Hegseth momentarily interrupted the questioning.",
      "\"The chairman here, who's not involved in politics, he doesn't do politics. That's my lane -- to understand and translate and talk about those types of things. So, I can use the word 'obliterated,'\" Hegseth said, the term Trump has used repeatedly.",
      "Still, several questions remain not fully answered, particularly how far exactly the strikes set back Iran's nuclear capabilities and whether Iran was able to move uranium away from the Fordo site before the bombings.",
      "Hegseth and Caine were asked about the uranium during their 45-minute news conference. Neither provided a clear answer.",
      "Hegseth first attacked the news reporter who asked the question, before saying: \"We're looking at all aspects of intelligence and making sure we have a sense of what was where.\"",
      "Later, Hegseth said on uranium: \u201cI'm not aware of any intelligence that I've reviewed that says things were not where they were supposed to be -- moved or otherwise.\"",
      "President Trump, who was watching the news conference, took to his social media account to weigh in on speculation that Iran may have moved uranium because of satellite images showing trucks lined up at Fordo in the days leading up to the attack.",
      "\"The cars and small trucks at the site were those of concrete workers trying to cover up the top of the shafts. Nothing was taken out of facility. Would take too long, too dangerous, and very heavy and hard to move!\" Trump wrote on his social media site.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt was asked at her own briefing on Thursday what Trump's social media post was based on.",
      "\"Look, the president shared that statement with all of you. And I already answered the question about whether uranium was moved prior to the strike. And the answer is no,\" Leavitt said.",
      "Leavitt was also asked if the Defense Intelligence Agency report on the U.S. strikes would be made public. The initial assessment that was reported on this week was produced by DIA with the help of U.S. Central Command.",
      "\"I don't think this administration is going to get into the habit of sharing classified top-secret information,\" she said. \"Those classifications exist for a reason. And I wish everyone who had the privilege of looking at these documents would respect that.\"",

      "\"I think that there is a need for a new generation of leadership,\" he said.",
      "Zohran Mamdani, the presumptive Democratic nominee for mayor of New York City, told ABC News in a wide-ranging interview aired Wednesday that he plans to win over moderate voters -- even as a self-identified Democratic socialist -- as he runs in the general election.",
      "He said he also believes the Democratic Party needs to refocus on what working-class Americans are going through.",
      "\"I think that the Democratic Party must always remember what made so many proud to be Democrats, which is a focus on the struggles of working class Americans across this country,\" Mamdani told ABC News Senior Political Correspondent Rachel Scott.",
      "\"And I think that there is a need for a new generation of leadership,\" he added.",
      "The 33-year-old State Assembly member, who campaigned on a progressive economic platform, declared victory over former Gov. Andrew Cuomo as results in Tuesday's closely watched primary rolled in.",
      "Asked how he'd respond to voters who are nervous about his age and relative inexperience, Mamdani pointed to his campaign fundraising and sheer number of volunteers, as well as meetings he said he's had with deputy mayors and commissioners from many mayoral administrations, \"all as part of my commitment to building a team that is united, not by ideology, not by past relationship or knowledge, but frankly, by excellence.\"",
      "Mamdani also spoke with Scott about addressing concerns from Democrats about the \"Democratic socialist\" label, when he would be open to collaborating with President Donald Trump and reaching out to Jewish New Yorkers.",
      "Embracing the Democratic socialist label -- and winning over moderates",
      "Mamdani has proudly identified as a Democratic socialist -- a label that some Democrats have expressed concerns about, especially as some Republicans have seized on the label to claim that all Democrats are socialists or far-left.",
      "\"What do you say to those Democrats who have concerns about that term, Democratic socialist, that you so proudly claim you are?\" Scott asked.",
      "\"I would say that I hear them, because there's room to have disagreement and tension in any one party. And for too long, we've thought of politics as an act of purity, where you only work with those that you agree with on every issue\u2026 And there are going to be many Democrats, both here in this city and across the country, who have a different lens of what it is that they see us needing in this moment,\" Mamdani said.",
      "\"But ultimately, we agree on the importance of addressing affordability, and that's at the core of our campaign.\"",
      "How would he win back voters who may think the policies Mamdani ran on are too far to the left of where they think the Democratic Party should be?",
      "\"I would tell them to look at the results of last night,\" he said, referring to the primary on Tuesday. He called the results a \"clear reflection of a mandate to make this city affordable\" and one that showed Democrats united in support of his economic proposals.",
      "\"And it shows that for a long time, what we've heard in terms of the analysis of this city and its politics is actually out of step with where people are.\"",
      "He added later that he hopes to win the support of people who would otherwise vote for incumbent Mayor Eric Adams, who he criticized as \"the original architect of this affordability crisis over the last few years.\"",
      "As to why voters should support him over Adams, he said, \"I'm someone who will make the city more affordable, and because what we've seen is that this present has been delivered to us by the policies and the politics and even the politicians of the past. It's time for a new generation of leadership. It's time for a politics of the future.\"",
      "Adams, speaking on Fox News on Wednesday, criticized Mamdani as a \"snake oil salesman,\" saying, \"I delivered for the city and we're not going backwards.\"",
      "Working with, or opposing, Trump",
      "When asked about comments from President Donald Trump on social media calling him a \"Communist Lunatic,\" Mamdani shrugged off the epithet, saying he'd encourage Trump to learn about his policies, and that he'd work with Trump on affordability but would resist the president's deportation plans.",
      "\"The next mayor of New York City will have to work with the Trump administration. Are you willing to do that? Will you do that?\" Scott asked.",
      "\"I will work with the Trump administration when it is to the benefit of New Yorkers,\" Mamdani said. \"My approach will never be reflexive, whether in agreement or opposition, but if it comes at the expense of the New Yorkers that I'm running to serve, then, no, I will not be working with the administration on harming the people that I look to represent.\"",
      "Asked by Scott how he'd manage that relationship, Mamdani reiterated wanting to collaborate with Trump on lowering the price of groceries \u2013 pointing to his campaign plan to open \"a network of municipal-owned stores\" \u2013 but also reiterated not wanting to assist the president with immigrant detentions.",
      "Outreach to the Jewish community",
      "Mamdani has faced some pushback, given New York's large Jewish population, over his history of comments and activism opposing Israel, including his criticism of Israel over the war in Gaza. In response, he has emphasized policies to combat antisemitism and said that he wants to focus on city issues. When asked in an interview with ABC News' New York station WABC on Wednesday whether he supports the concept of Israel as a Jewish state, Mamdani said: \"I've said time and again that I support Israel's right to exist as a state with equal rights for all, and ultimately, my focus is on the five boroughs of the city.\"",
      "In her interview, Scott asked Mamdani, \"How do you gain the trust of Jewish voters in New York City?\"",
      "Mamdani brought up his campaign plan to increase funding for anti-hate crime programming, but acknowledged a divide between his views on Israel and those of many in the Jewish community.",
      "\"Ultimately, my comments have been on critiques of the Israeli government's policies, and I know that there are many New Yorkers who may disagree with me on those same critiques,\" Mamdani said. \"And yet that disagreement is still rooted in the shared sense of humanity.\"",
      "As for his strategy to reach out to Jewish voters, Mamdani said he was ready to \"to introduce myself again and again\" to every New Yorker, including Jewish New Yorkers, given the low name recognition he started out with in the race.",

      "Editor's note: This article has been updated to add Mamdani's position on the State of Israel.",

      "Democrats are torn between courting moderates or doubling down on progressives.",
      "New York State Assembly member Zohran Mamdani\u2019s ascension to presumptive Democratic nominee in New York\u2019s mayoral race has reinvigorated the conversation about which ideological faction of the Democratic Party should lead the way as it aims to rebuild.",
      "Mamdani, a self-described Democratic Socialist in the style of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Bernie Sanders, centered his campaign on affordability with bold promises: free child care, fare-free buses and rent freezes.",
      "\"I think that the Democratic Party must always remember what made so many proud to be Democrats, which is a focus on the struggles of working-class Americans across this country,\" Mamdani told ABC News Senior Political Correspondent Rachel Scott after his upset victory in the party's primary on Tuesday.",
      "Another dynamic at play in this race, and for Democrats nationally: age. A well-heeled former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, 67, conceded to the 33-year-old relative newcomer. The concession comes as some in the party call for a new generation of leadership to take the reins of the party.",
      "\u201cTonight was Assemblyman Mamdani's night, and he put together a great campaign and he touched young people and inspired them and moved them and got them to come out and vote,\" Cuomo said at an event Tuesday night. He added, \"Tonight is his night. He deserved it. He won.\u201d",
      "The party remains a fractured big tent. Democrats are torn between courting disillusioned moderates or doubling down on progressive ideals, between elevating new leaders or clinging to the old guard. In New York, at least, the momentum appears to be with the young and the left, though his win may not be reflective of Democratic sentiment all over the country.",
      "While Mamdani received praise from Democratic leadership in Washington after declaring victory, there have been some moderate Democratic members of Congress who have raised concerns about his progressivism.",
      "\u201cI had serious concerns about Assemblyman Mamdani before yesterday, and that is one of the reasons I endorsed his opponent. Those concerns remain,\u201d Rep. Tom Suozzi, who represents a part of New York\u2019s Queens borough, posted to X.",
      "Another, Rep. Laura Gillen, who represents a district in the city\u2019s suburbs, wrote in a social media post \u201cSocialist Zohran Mamdani is too extreme to lead New York City. His entire campaign has been built on unachievable promises and higher taxes which is the last thing New York needs.\u201d",
      "And those in conservative circles, including President Donald Trump, have already rushed to paint Mamdani\u2019s win as a reflection of all Democrats as \u201cradical.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s finally happened, the Democrats have crossed the line. Zohran Mamdani, a 100% Communist Lunatic, has just won the Dem Primary, and is on his way to becoming Mayor. We\u2019ve had Radical Lefties before, but this is getting a little ridiculous,\u201d Trump said on a social media post.",
      "As Democrats head into a critical midterm season hoping to regain lost ground, one big question looms: Is the Mamdani playbook a path forward -- or is New York just an exception?",

    "summary": "New York City Mayor Eric Adams formally launched his reelection bid on Thursday from the steps of City Hall,",
    "story": [
      "A former Democrat, Adams is running as an independent.",
      "With supporters waving campaign signs and chanting \"Four more years,\" New York City Mayor Eric Adams formally launched his re-election bid on Thursday from the steps of City Hall, framing himself as a blue collar candidate with a record of achievement and his upstart chief rival, Zohran Mamdani, as an inexperienced opponent making \"empty promises.\"",
      "\"I'm so proud to be here to say to the people of the city of New York, I am seeking reelection to be your mayor for the city of New York,\" Adams said amid loud applause from an enthusiastic group of supporters standing behind him.",
      "The 64-year-old Adams' first term in office was hounded by federal charges of accepting illegal gifts, including plane upgrades and hotel stays, from Turkish businessmen and officials in exchange for preferential treatment. Some Democrats also criticized Adams for meeting with Trump administration officials on immigration enforcement after federal prosecutors under the new administration dismissed the corruption charges against him.",
      "Adams announced in April that he was switching from being a Democrat to an independent to run in the general election.",
      "On Tuesday, 33-year-old Mamdani, a member of the New York State Assembly and self-described Democratic socialist, declared victory in the Democratic primary, upsetting former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who resigned from office in 2021 after a series of women accused him of sexual harassment, charges he has denied.",
      "On Thursday, Adams only focused on his accomplishments as mayor, while casting Mamdani as someone from a privileged background whom he said has accomplished little as a state lawmaker.",
      "\"This election is a choice between a candidate with a blue collar and one with a ... silver spoon, a choice between dirty fingernails and manicured nails, a choice between someone who delivered lower crime, the most jobs in history, the most new housing built in decades and an assembly member who did not pass a bill,\" Adams said.",
      "Referring to Mamdani's campaign promises to make New York City more affordable by freezing rents on stabilized apartments, making city-run buses faster and free, creating city-run grocery stores to drive down food prices and raising the minimum wage to $30 an hour, Adams said the election poses \"a choice between real progress and empty promises.\"",
      "\"This election is a choice between those who believe in this city and those who don't,\" Adams said.",
      "Adams also noted that Mamdani calls himself a Democratic socialist.",
      "\"Let me tell you something, this is a city not of socialism,\" Adams said. \"I've been to socialist countries. This is a city where you can come as a dishwasher, and you can own a chain of restaurants. This is a city where you could be a cab driver and then become a doctor. This is a city where you could go from homelessness to building housing.\"",
      "In an interview on Wednesday with ABC New York station WABC's anchor Bill Ritter, Mamdani was asked to define being a Democratic socialist.",
      "\"I think of Dr. King, who decades ago said, 'Call it democracy or call it democratic socialism.' There must be a better distribution of wealth for all of God's children in this country. And it gets to the heart of the matter, which is inequality, and my belief that every New Yorker should have what they need to live a dignified life,\" Mamdani said. \"It shouldn't be something that they can be priced out of. And that's why, at the heart of our campaign is this focus on freezing the rent for more than 2 million rent-stabilized tenants, making the slowest buses in the country fast.\"",
      "Besides Mamdani, Adams will face Republican Curtis Sliwa, founder of the Guardian Angels crime prevention organization, in the general election in November. Cuomo said he is weighing a decision to run in the general election as an independent.",
      "At times during his speech, Adams was interrupted by hecklers who blew whistles and one who yelled an expletive and called him a \"criminal.\"",
      "\"Listen, notice how we utilize the letter F,\" Adams told his supporters in response to the badgering. \"We utilize the letter F for faith. Our opponents use the letter F for profanity. So, we need to stay focused, no distractions and grind.\"",
      "Adams recounted his rise from a poor child raised in Brooklyn by a single mother to becoming a captain in the New York Police Department, then being elected a state senator, Brooklyn borough president and, in November 2021, the city's 110th mayor.",
      "Referring to his own background, Adams said, \"This is a city where you could be a young person who is dyslexic, a young person who is rejected and eventually be elected to be the mayor of the city of New York.\"",
      "He added, \"I wasn't born into power and privilege; I grew up in struggle,\" Adams said, apparently referring to Mamdani, whose mother, Mira Nair, is an Oscar-nominated filmmaker and whose father, Mahmood Mamdani, is a Columbia University professor.",
      "Adams said that as mayor he helped lead New York through the pandemic and that under his leadership, violent crime in the city has fallen to historic levels. According to Adams, 500,000 new jobs have been created and affordable housing has been expanded by turning unused buildings into homes. He even boasted that Broadway just had its best 12 months in recorded history.",
      "But in his interview with WABC, Mandami said that Adams has \"exacerbated a cost-of-living crisis.\"",
      "\"He raised the rent on more than 2 million New Yorkers by 9%. He increased water bills to the highest they've been in 13 years, and he sided with Con Edison when they wanted to increase gas and electric bills by $65 a month,\" Mamdani said. \"This is someone who has put his thumb on the scale against working, middle-class New Yorkers. We need someone who will actually use every tool to provide relief to those same New Yorkers.\"",
      "Mandani also said he will not shy away from battling the Trump administration's policies that \"attack the very fabric of what makes so many of us proud as New Yorkers.\"",
      "During his speech on Thursday, Adams didn't mention Trump.",
      "\"There's some critics who spend more time attacking than achieving,\" Adams said. \"Let me be clear: They have a record of tweets; I have a record on these streets -- a record of results. They talk about problems, I fix them.\"",

      "Gun control crusader and former U.S. Rep. Carolyn McCarthy of New York has died",
      "Former U.S. Rep. Carolyn McCarthy, who successfully ran for Congress in 1996 as a crusader for gun control after a mass shooting on a New York commuter train left her husband dead and her son severely wounded, has died. She was 81.",
      "News of her death was shared Thursday by several elected officials on her native Long Island and by Jay Jacobs, chair of the New York State Democratic Committee. Details about her death were not immediately available.",
      "McCarthy went from political novice to one of the nation\u2019s leading advocates for gun control legislation in the aftermath of the 1993 Long Island Rail Road massacre. However, the suburban New York Democrat found limited success against the National Rifle Association and other Second Amendment advocates.",
      "McCarthy announced in June 2013 that she was undergoing treatment for lung cancer. She announced her retirement in January 2014.",
      "Democratic U.S. Rep. Tom Suozzi said the nation has \u201clost a fierce champion.\u201d",
      "\u201cCarolyn channeled her grief and loss into advocacy for change, becoming one of the most dedicated gun violence prevention advocates,\u201d Suozzi said on X.",
      "She became a go-to guest on national TV news shows after each ensuing gun massacre, whether it was at Columbine High School or Sandy Hook Elementary School.",
      "Known as the \u201cgun lady\u201d on Capitol Hill, McCarthy said she couldn\u2019t stop crying after learning that her former colleague, Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, had been seriously wounded in a January 2011 shooting in Arizona.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like a cancer in our society,\u201d she said of gun violence. \u201cAnd if we keep doing nothing to stop it, it\u2019s only going to spread.\u201d",
      "During one particularly rancorous debate over gun show loopholes in 1999, McCarthy was brought to tears at 1 a.m. on the House floor.",
      "\u201cI am Irish and I am not supposed to cry in front of anyone. But I made a promise a long time ago. I made a promise to my son and to my husband. If there was anything that I could do to prevent one family from going through what I have gone through then I have done my job,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cLet me go home. Let me go home,\u201d she pleaded.",
      "McCarthy was born in Brooklyn and grew up on Long Island. She became a nurse and later married Dennis McCarthy after meeting on a Long Island beach. They had one son, Kevin, during a tumultuous marriage in which they divorced but reconciled and remarried.",
      "McCarthy was a Republican when, on Dec. 7, 1993, a gunman opened fire on a train car leaving New York City. By the time passengers tackled the shooter, six people were dead and 19 wounded.",
      "She jumped into politics after her GOP congressman voted to repeal an assault weapons ban.",
      "Her surprise victory inspired a made-for-television movie produced by Barbra Streisand. Since that first victory in 1996, McCarthy was never seriously challenged for reelection in a heavily Republican district just east of New York City..",
      "Some critics described McCarthy as a one-issue lawmaker, a contention she bristled about, pointing to interests in improving health care and education. But she was realistic about her legacy on gun control, once telling an interviewer:",

      "NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte called President Donald Trump \"Daddy\" on Wednesday, reacting to the president's recent use of expletives when he accused Iran and Israel of violating a ceasefire agreement.",
      "Early Wednesday morning during a bilateral meeting between Trump and Rutte during the NATO Summit in The Hague, Netherlands, Trump likened the countries of Israel and Iran to \"two kids in a schoolyard\" that had a \"big fight.\"",
      "\"You know, they fight like hell. You can't stop them. Let them fight for about two-three minutes, then it's easy to stop them,\" he continued.",
      "Rutte raised eyebrows when he interjected, \"Daddy has to sometimes use strong language to get them to stop.\"",
      "\"You have to use strong language,\" Trump agreed. \"Every so often you have to use a certain word.\"",
      "One day earlier, Trump became visibly frustrated about the Israel-Iran conflict, blurting an expletive before departing the White House en route to the summit.",
      "Trump was receptive to Rutte's nickname, saying during a press conference later Wednesday that the secretary-general meant it in an affectionate manner.",
      "Asked if Trump views his NATO allies as his \"children,\" the president responded, \"No, [Rutte] likes me. I think he likes me. If he doesn't, I'll let you know. I'll come back and I'll hit him hard, OK? He did it very affectionately, 'Daddy, you're my Daddy.'\"",
      "Rutte later defended his use of the word and continued to pile praise on Trump, describing him as a \"good friend.\" He also said his language is a matter of taste.",
      "On Trump's decision to strike Iran and the ceasefire, Rutte said \"I think he deserves all the praise.\"",

      "\"The 'daddy' thing -- I didn't call him 'daddy.' \u2026 In Europe, I hear sometimes countries saying, 'Hey, Mark, will the U.S. stay with us?' And I said that sounds a little bit like a small child asking his daddy, 'Hey, are you still staying with the family?'\" Rutte told Reuters. \"So in that sense, I used 'daddy', not that I was calling President Trump 'daddy.'\"",
      "Yet the White House continues to embrace the \"daddy\" title, posting on X a video compilation of Trump's NATO trip set to the tune of Usher's \"Hey Daddy (Daddy's Home)\" with the accompanying text: \"Daddy's home\u2026 Hey, hey, hey, Daddy.\"",

    "summary": "Michigan Sen. Elissa Slotkin pushed her fellow Democrats to go back to focusing on the issues and struggles plaguing middle-class Americans in a speech Thursday.",
    "story": [
      "The first-term senator said internal disagreements are splitting the party.",
      "Democratic Sen. Elissa Slotkin delivered a blunt assessment of what's wrong with her party on Thursday.",
      "Slotkin expressed frustration with how she said the Democratic Party was \"disparate,\" allowing itself to be split by internal disagreements.",
      "\"We're like a solar system with no sun ... We don't act as a team, and when we don't work as a team, we turn our guns on each other, and it's so, so, so, fruitless,\" she said in a speech at the Center for American Progress.",
      "Asked after her speech by ABC News Live anchor Linsey Davis if she had confidence in Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, Slotkin declined to answer.",
      "\"They are the leaders of the House and Senate,\" she said. \"I work with them every single day. I push on them every day, especially in the Senate. I think they would attest to that. And we need to work as a team, and we need wartime generals who are gonna get us there because of what's going on in the country. And I have no big announcement to make. I would just say the pressure is there from inside the caucus, but also from the grassroots.\"",
      "Slotkin characterized the central split within the party as between those who saw the second Trump administration as \"an existential threat to democracy\" and would actively resist, and those who saw it as \"bad, but kind of like the first Trump administration: survivable.\"",
      "\"These labels of progressive, moderate, whatever -- that's less relevant. It's fight or flight,\" Slotkin said. \"I think we are churning behind closed doors to figure out which camp can win.\"",
      "Slotkin pushed her party to focus their priorities on Americans who are struggling the most. A shrinking middle class is the \"single greatest security threat to the U.S.,\" she said.",
      "\"I believe deep in my bones that if we lose our middle class and, by association, the American Dream, we will lose our democracy and eventually our country,\" Slotkin said.",
      "In her speech, meant to present \"A New Vision for the Democratic Party\", Slotkin laid out a plan to focus on affordability and \"pocketbook\" issues. During her speech, she said Democrats needed to \"get back to the basics\", which included creating more and better jobs, affordable options in education, and building more housing.",
      "As the Democratic Party seeks a message that will resonate with voters after its losses in 2024 election, Slotkin emerged as a voice proposing a way forward for the party. Slotkin prevailed over Republican candidate Mike Rogers by 0.34 percentage points last November in a state that President Donald Trump won by more than 1 percentage point.",
      "\"In a multiracial, multiethnic democracy like ours, when people don't feel like they can get ahead, when the system is rigged against them, they start blaming people who don't look like them, or who sound different, or who pray differently. It's how we begin to tear each other apart from the inside,\" Slotkin said. \"So in order to attack that threat, we need to get government back to the basics of what it was designed to do.\"",
      "\"And to me, those fundamentals are the following: jobs that pay enough to save every month; schools that prepare kids for those jobs; a home you can call your own; safety and security from fear; energy to power our lives; and an environment to pass on to our kids; and health care you can actually afford,\" she added.",
      "Slotkin highlighted impacts from artificial intelligence as an area that would require wholesale changes to how the government approaches jobs and education.",
      "\"We need to invest heavily in certification programs, community colleges, trade schools and apprenticeships. Key to that is taking a stick of dynamite to our federal workforce training programs. Just blow it up,\" Slotkin said. \"We have to align all those programs around one goal: training and retraining people for a future economy.\"",
      "Another area Slotkin addressed was housing costs and the need to build more homes. She said the country needed 4 million homes to catch up with what she called a \"housing emergency.\"",
      "\"The single biggest thing holding us back is overlapping and outdated housing regulations \u2026 We need to streamline regulations that hold back builders from constructing homes, federal and state programs, but also incentives for communities to change zoning laws that prevent corruption,\" Slotkin said.",
      "Speaking on health care costs, she argued special interest campaign donations and lobbying were key factors preventing politicians from lowering prices.",
      "\"We have to go after special interests that keep our health care prices high,\" Slotkin said. She added that the perception that special interests were influencing politicians' decisions contributed to some voters believing \"the system is flawed\" as a whole. \"I think that you have to have a radical package of ethics and money reform in order to even start to right that ship.\"",
      "Asked what she took from New York Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani's presumptive win in the New York Democratic mayoral primary on Tuesday, where the progressive candidate obtained more first-choice votes than former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, Slotkin said voters' prioritization of cost of living was clear.",
      "While Mamdani ran a campaign with a similar relentless economic focus as Slotkin's \"war plan,\" he unabashedly embraced progressive stances, including city-owned grocery stores.",
      "\"People, just like in November, are still really focused on costs and the economy, and their own kitchen table math, and they're looking for a new generation of leadership,\" Slotkin said. \"It reinforces that you may disagree on some key issues, but understanding that people are concerned about their family budget, that is a unifying thing for a coalition.\"",

      "The Kansas Legislative Coordinating Council is scheduled to meet July 7 to consider extending the incentive deadline.",
      "\u201cThe letter from Mark Donovan indicates that the drive to bring this historic project to Kansas is moving down the field,\u201d Masterson said in a statement. \u201cNow that we are in the red zone, this extension will provide stakeholders sufficient time to ensure the ball crosses the goal line.\u201d",
      "The Chiefs and Royals have played for more than five decades at the Truman Sports Complex on the east side of Kansas City, Missouri, where Arrowhead Stadium and Kauffman Stadium share parking facilities. But leases with Jackson County are due to expire in January 2031, and the two franchises have been trying to plot a course forward for years.",
      "Donovan indicated in his letter to Masterson that Kansas remains an enticing option.",
      "\u201cTogether,\u201d he wrote, \u201cwe have the opportunity to bring the National Football League to Kansas, anchored by a world-class domed stadium, new team headquarters, a state-of-the-art practice facility, and a vibrant mixed-use and entertainment district.\u201d",
      "Last year, Jackson County voters defeated a sales tax extension that would have helped to finance an $800 million renovation of Arrowhead Stadium \u2014 the home of the Chiefs \u2014 and a $2 billion ballpark district for the Royals in downtown Kansas City.",
      "While local and state officials in Missouri were considering another a stadium financing package, lawmakers in Kansas quickly and aggressively authorized bonds for up to 70% of the cost of new stadiums to be built in their state.",
      "Many believed the Chiefs and Royals would use the Kansas offer as leverage for a better deal from Missouri \u2014 including Kansas City, Missouri, Mayor Quinton Lucas, who acknowledged that \"the teams are in an exceptional leverage position.\u201d",
      "Finally, earlier this month, Missouri Gov. Mike Kehoe called lawmakers into a special session to approve a stadium financing deal that included disaster relief for the St. Louis area, where a series of devastating tornadoes caused widespread damage. The legislation authorizes bonds covering up to 50% of the cost of new or renovated stadiums in Missouri, plus up to $50 million of tax credits for each stadium and unspecified aid from local governments.",
      "The prevailing belief was that the package would be enough to keep the Chiefs at Arrowhead Stadium, where they have floated plans for a $1.15 billion renovation, and perhaps hold onto the Royals, who are still interested in building downtown.",
      "Yet news surfaced about a month ago that an affiliate of the Royals purchased the mortgage on a large property in the southern Kansas City suburb of Overland Park, Kansas, raising the possibility of building a new stadium and ballpark district there.",
      "And the letter from Donovan requesting an extension in Kansas indicates the Chiefs also are serious about switching states.",
      "Chiefs owner Clark Hunt has long professed his affinity for Arrowhead Stadium, which was built by his father and team founder Lamar Hunt. But he also is keenly aware of the revenue streams available by building a new domed stadium, including the chance to host the Super Bowl, the Final Four and other marquee sporting events.",
      "It is unclear where the Chiefs would build in Kansas, but one possibility is the juncture of Interstates 435 and 70 in Kansas City, Kansas. That's the site of Kansas Speedway, a mixed residential and commercial district called The Legends, the home stadiums of MLS club Sporting Kansas City and the Kansas City Monarchs minor league baseball club, as well as a casino, hotels, a major soccer training center and the infrastructure necessary to support a domed football stadium.",
      "\u201cWe are excited about the potential for this project, which would represent the largest economic development initiative in the state\u2019s history,\" Donovan wrote in his letter Thursday. \"Just as important, the presence of an NFL franchise in (Kansas) will serve as a powerful engine for immediate and long term-growth \u2014 driving national attention, sustained tourism, and billions more in private development across the state.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- Congressional Republicans agreed to remove the so-called revenge tax provision from President Donald Trump\u2019s big bill on Thursday after a request by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.",
      "The Section 899 provision that was nixed would have allowed the federal government to impose taxes on companies with foreign owners, as well as investors from countries judged as charging \u201cunfair foreign taxes\u201d on U.S. companies.",
      "The measure was expected to lead many companies to avoid investing in the U.S. out of concern that they could face steep taxes. But the removal of the provision adds a wrinkle to Republicans\u2019 plans to try to offset the cost of the massive package.",
      "Bessent said in an X post that he made the request to lawmakers after reaching an agreement with other countries on the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development Global Tax Deal. He said that after \u201cmonths of productive dialogue,\u201d they would \u201cannounce a joint understanding among G7 countries that defends American interests.\u201d",
      "Senate Finance Committee Chairman Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, and House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Jason Smith, R-Mo., said they would remove the provision. But, they noted, \u201cCongressional Republicans stand ready to take immediate action if the other parties walk away from this deal or slow walk its implementation.\u201d",
      "The removal of the provision will provide \u201cgreater certainty and stability for the global economy and will enhance growth and investment in the United States and beyond,\u201d Bessent said in his post.",
      "An analysis by the Global Business Alliance, a trade group representing international companies such as Toyota and Nestl\u00e9, estimates that the provision would have cost the U.S. 360,000 jobs and $55 billion annually over 10 years in lost gross domestic product.",
      "The Global Business Alliance was among several groups that signed a letter addressed to Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., and Crapo warning of the consequences of Section 899.",
      "Republicans are rushing to finish the package this week to meet the president's Fourth of July deadline for passage.",
      "Earlier Thursday, the Senate parliamentarian advised that a Medicaid provider tax overhaul central to the spending bill does not adhere to the chamber\u2019s procedural rules, delivering a crucial blow to Republicans, who are counting on big cuts to Medicaid and other programs to offset trillions of dollars in Trump tax breaks.",

      "\u201cIn the years leading up to the accident, Third Coast missed several opportunities to evaluate how geohazards may threaten the integrity of their pipeline. Information widely available within the industry suggested that land movement related to hurricane activity was a threat to pipelines in the Gulf of America, including the MPOG 18-inch pipeline,\u201d the NTSB said in its final report, using the new name assigned to the body of water by the Trump administration.",
      "Third Coast did not immediately respond to phone and email messages seeking comment about the report Thursday afternoon.",

      "The amount of oil spilled was far less than the 2010 BP oil disaster, when 134 million gallons were released in the weeks following an oil rig explosion, but it could have been much smaller if workers in the Third Coast control room had acted more quickly, the NTSB said.",
      "The pipeline operator first noticed pressure changes about 45 minutes after he started his shift at 6 p.m. on Nov. 15, 2023. The gauges showed that the volume of oil exiting the pipeline was less than the amount entering, with the output eventually dropping to zero around 12:30 a.m. the next morning.",
      "The controller said his supervisor recommended not shutting down the pipeline as the pressure dropped throughout the evening. Even after the flow went to zero, the controller and his colleagues decided not to shut it down because they believed the the data were the result of equipment issues.",
      "It was only after day shift workers started the next day and noticed the trend data and lack of output that Third Coast started to shut down the pipeline, around 6:30 a.m. It was fully shut down by 9 a.m., and the leak was reported to the Environmental Protection Agency less than an hour later.",

He sought to show the level of destruction but did not directly address President Donald Trump\u2019s assertion that Tehran\u2019s nuclear program has been \u201cobliterated.\u201d",
      "The bombs, called the GBU-57 A/B Massive Ordnance Penetrator, have their roots in a decades-old classified briefing \u201cof what looked like a major construction project in the mountains of Iran,\u201d Caine said.",
      "That turned out to be the Fordo fuel enrichment plant, with construction believed to have started around 2006. It became operational in 2009, the same year Tehran publicly acknowledged its existence.",
      "The classified briefing was shown in 2009 to a Defense Threat Reduction Agency officer, who with a colleague \u201clived and breathed\u201d Fordo for the next 15 years, studying the geology, construction dig, the earth moved and \u201cevery piece of equipment going in and every piece of equipment going out,\" Caine said.",
      "What they concluded: The U.S. didn't have a bomb that could destroy those sites. So the Pentagon got to work, Caine said.",
      "\u201cWe had so many Ph.D.s working on the mock program \u2014 doing modeling and simulation \u2014 that we were quietly and in a secret way the biggest users of supercomputer hours within the United States of America,\u201d he said.",
      "The 30,000-pound bomb is comprised of steel, explosive and a fuse programmed to a specific detonation time. The longer the fuse, the deeper the weapon will penetrate before exploding.",
      "Over the years, the military tested and retested it hundreds of times on mock facilities, Caine said. Crews fine-tuned the bombs to detonate in the mock enrichment rooms, delaying detonation until they had reached a position to send a pressure blast through open tunnels to destroy equipment underground.",
      "Fordo had two main ventilation routes into the underground facility \u2014 and officials carefully eyed these entry points as a way to target the site.",
      "Each route had three shafts \u2014 a main shaft and a smaller shaft on either side, which looked almost like a pitchfork in graphics provided by the Pentagon. In the days preceding the U.S. attack, Iran placed large concrete slabs on top of both ventilation routes to try to protect them, Caine said.",
      "In response, the U.S. crafted an attack plan where six bunker-buster bombs would be used against each ventilation route, using the main shaft as a way down into the enrichment facility.",
      "Seven B-2 stealth bombers were used, carrying two of the massive munitions apiece. The first bomb was used to eliminate the concrete slab, Caine said.",
      "The next four bombs were dropped down the main shaft and into the complex at a speed of more than 1,000 feet per second before exploding, he said. A sixth bomb was dropped as a backup, in case anything went wrong.",
      "In addition to the 12 bombs dropped on Fordo, with six on each ventilation route, two more hit Iran's main Natanz facility, Caine said.",
      "Each crew was able to confirm detonation as they saw the bombs drop from the aircraft in front of them: \u201cWe know that the trailing jets saw the first weapons function,\u201d Caine said.",
      "The pilots reported back that it was the brightest explosion they had ever seen \u2014 that it looked like daylight, he said.",
      "Caine said the munitions were built, tested and loaded properly, guided to their intended targets and then exploded as designed.",
      "\u201cIran\u2019s nuclear facilities have been destroyed,\u201d Hegseth said.",
      "However, questions remained as to whether the highly enriched uranium that Iran would need to develop a nuclear weapon was at the site at the time. Asked repeatedly, Hegseth did not say if the uranium had been destroyed or moved.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not aware of any intelligence that I\u2019ve reviewed that says things were not where they were supposed to be \u2014 moved or otherwise,\u201d Hegseth said.",

    "summary": "The Supreme Court is letting South Carolina block Medicaid funding for Planned Parenthood",
    "story": [
      "The Supreme Court is letting South Carolina block Medicaid funding for Planned Parenthood",
      "The U.S. Supreme Court ruled Thursday that states can bar Medicaid payments to Planned Parenthood, the nation's largest abortion provider.",
      "The federal government and many states already block using Medicaid funds to cover abortion. But the state-federal health insurance program for lower-income people does pay for other services from Planned Parenthood, including birth control, cancer screenings and testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections.",
      "The ruling comes at a moment when Congress is considering blocking Planned Parenthood from receiving any federal Medicaid funding, a move that the group says would force hundreds of clinic closings \u2014 most of them in states where abortion remains legal.",
      "Here are things to know about the situation:",
      "This legal dispute goes back to a 2018 executive order from South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster that barred abortion providers from receiving Medicaid money in the state, even for services unrelated to abortion.",
      "In its 6-3 ruling, the Supreme Court overruled lower courts and said that patients don't necessarily have the right to sue for Medicaid to cover their health care from specific providers.",
      "Abortion opponents hail it as a victory on principle.",
      "\u201cNo one should be forced to subsidize abortion,\u201d CatholicVote President Kelsey Reinhardt said in a statement.",
      "Supporters of Planned Parenthood see the ruling as an obstacle to health care aside from abortion.",
      "Planned Parenthood \u201cprovides services for highly disadvantaged populations and this will mean not only that many women in the state will lose their right to choose providers, but it will also mean that many women will lose services altogether,\u201d said Lawrence Gostin, who specializes in public health law at Georgetown Law.",
      "For many people with Medicaid, Gostin said, Planned Parenthood is a trusted service provider, and it's often the closest one.",
      "Others emphasize that the people who could be most impacted are women who already face the greatest obstacles to getting health care.",
      "\u201cPeople enrolled in Medicaid, including young people and people of color, already face too many barriers to getting health care,\u201d Kimberly Inez McGuire, the executive director of Unite for Reproductive & Gender Equality, said in a statement. \u201cThis decision makes a difficult situation worse.\u201d",
      "Planned Parenthood has two clinics in South Carolina, one in Charleston and one in Columbia.",
      "Combined, they\u2019ve been receiving about $90,000 a year from Medicaid out of nearly $9 billion a year the program spends in the state.",
      "South Carolina has banned most abortions after six weeks gestational age, before many women realize they\u2019re pregnant. It\u2019s one of four states to bar abortion at that point. Another 12 are enforcing bans at all stages of pregnancy. The bans were implemented after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022.",
      "The most recent high court ruling isn't a guarantee that other states will follow South Carolina's lead, but Republican attorneys general of 18 other states filed court papers supporting the state's position in the case.",
      "\u201cWe can imagine that there\u2019s anti-abortion legislators in states who are looking to this case and may try to replicate what South Carolina has done,\" said Amy Friedrich-Karnik, director of federal policy at the Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that supports abortion rights.",
      "The U.S. House last month passed a budget measure that would bar all federal payments for 10 years to nonprofit groups that provide abortion and received more than $1 million in federal funding in 2024.",
      "A Senate vote on the measure, which President Donald Trump supports, could happen in coming days.",
      "Planned Parenthood says that if the measure becomes law, it would force its affiliates to close up to 200 of their 600 facilities across the U.S. The hardest-hit places would be the states where abortion is legal.",
      "If the federal effort is successful, Friedrich-Karnik said states that support abortion rights could use their own tax revenue to keep clinics open.",
      "On a call with reporters this week, SBA Pro-Life America President Marjorie Dannenfelser said it's a priority for her group to hobble Planned Parenthood.",
      "She said starving Planned Parenthood of Medicaid reimbursements would not have a major impact on patients, because other clinics offer similar services without providing abortion.",
      "\u201cMedicaid money is attached to the person, so she\u2019ll retain the same amount of money,\u201d Dannenfelser said. \u201cShe\u2019ll just take it to a different place.\u201d",
      "The 2022 Supreme Court ruling that ended the nationwide right to abortion jolted the abortion system across the U.S. and left clinics struggling.",
      "Women in states with bans in place now use abortion pills or travel to states where it's legal.",
      "Surveys have found that the number of monthly abortions nationally has risen since the court ruling.",
      "But over the same time period, some clinics have closed and funds that help people obtain abortion have said it's hard to stretch their money to cover the added cost of travel.",

      "COLUMBUS, Ohio -- A petition drive seeking the repeal of a recent Ohio law banning diversity, equity and inclusion programs as well as faculty strikes at public colleges and universities has fallen short of the signatures needed to place it before voters, organizers announced Thursday.",
      "Surrounded by boxes of petitions, the organizers said they lacked the time and support to collect all 250,000 signatures needed to place a referendum on November\u2019s ballot seeking to overturn the bill, which makes several higher education policy changes including the ban on DEI programs.",
      "Absent those signatures, Senate Bill 1 is now free to become law on Friday, its initial effective date.",
      "The legislation cleared the GOP-led Legislature and was signed by Gov. Mike DeWine in March. Supporters say it will protect \u201cintellectual diversity,\u201d including welcoming more conservative voices on campuses.",
      "Opponents of the legislation numbered in the thousands. Educators and students delivered hours of opposition testimony and staged protests at the Statehouse, decrying the measure as an anti-labor government encroachment on academic freedom.",
      "Besides eliminating DEI programs, the bill prohibits schools from endorsing or opposing any \u201ccontroversial beliefs or topics,\u201d which it defines as anything related to climate policies, electoral politics, foreign policy, DEI programs, immigration policy, marriage or abortion.",
      "It also outlaws faculty strikes, eliminates the voting rights of student trustees at The Ohio State University, requires every Ohio college student to take a three-hour civics education course, and imposes dozens of other programmatic and administrative changes on the state\u2019s 14 public universities and 23 community colleges.",
      "Schools that violate the measure would risk losing their state funding.",

      "Zohran Mamdani's surge to the top in New York City's Democratic mayoral primary came with the help of an army of volunteers who set a goal of knocking on 1 million doors to get votes",
      "NEW YORK -- On Tuesday night, shortly before polls closed in New York's Democratic mayoral primary, and less than an hour until the first signs of his seismic upset over Andrew Cuomo, Zohran Mamdani was in a Brooklyn park, searching for a ride.",
      "\u201cHe said he\u2019d met some kids in the park who still hadn\u2019t voted, so he sent his personal driver to get them to a poll site before it closed,\u201d recalled Charlie Dulik, a campaign volunteer and tenant organizer, who said he approached Mamdani in the park to say hello.",
      "Instead, Mamdani climbed into Dulik\u2019s 2007 Toyota Highlander, drawing cheers from passing pedestrians and cyclists as he made his last-minute pitch to voters while hanging from the car\u2019s sunroof, according to the volunteer. \u201cHe just kept saying, \u2018It\u2019s razor thin,\u2019\u201d Dulik added.",
      "While the results are not yet finalized, Mamdani\u2019s likely primary victory has jolted the Democratic establishment, leaving many astonished that a 33-year-old democratic socialist outmaneuvered the better-funded and more experienced Cuomo.",
      "Those close to the Mamdani campaign are less surprised. They credit a seemingly omnipresent candidate devoted to speaking directly to New Yorkers, along with a sprawling field operation that helped amplify his affordability-centered platform to new voters.",
      "As Mamdani prepares for the November general election, they say they intend to return to that playbook once again.",
      "\u201cFrom the very beginning, he was very clear that our ground game was going to be the backbone of this entire campaign,\u201d said Jason Halal, a lead field canvasser for Mamdani. \u201cThere was never any lack of urgency, and we got that from the top down.\u201d",
      "Mamdani\u2019s approach offered a stark contrast to Cuomo\u2019s campaign. The former governor, who resigned four years ago over a barrage of sexual harassment allegations, rarely put out a public schedule, chafed at questions from reporters and skipped most candidate forums.",
      "He received fewer individual donations than Mamdani, but more than $25 million in super PAC funds, which were poured into ads that framed the city as beset by chaos.",
      "\u201cHe was running a Rose Garden strategy that might\u2019ve suited him as governor, but voters expect an intimacy from the mayor of New York City,\u201d said Basil Smikle, a Democratic political strategist and professor at Columbia University. \u201cThey want to see you at the subway stop, the local pizza shop, at church.\u201d",
      "Even Cuomo\u2019s backers \u2014 including several prominent labor unions \u2014 \u201cdidn\u2019t seem that enthusiastic about him,\u201d Smikle said, noting that with Mamdani\u2019s campaign, \u201cyou saw both that anger toward the current party and hopefulness in the street.\u201d",
      "A Cuomo spokesperson did not respond to inquiries about the campaign\u2019s field operations, including how many volunteers had signed up.",
      "But some voters took notice of the candidate\u2019s absence.",
      "As she went to vote Tuesday, Michelle Hemmings Harrington, 70, a one-time supporter of the former governor, said she felt as though Cuomo was \u201ctaking our votes for granted.\u201d",
      "She carried a pile of Mamdani pamphlets and a water bottle, both handed to her by the group of nearly a dozen of his campaign volunteers stationed around her Brooklyn polling site.",
      "When Mamdani launched his campaign late last year, few New Yorkers had heard of the two-term assemblyman. His solution: recruit an army of volunteers to knock on 1 million doors.",
      "Much of that effort was coordinated by the Democratic Socialists of America, a left-wing organization that counts Mamdani as a member, with experience canvassing for Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and other progressives.",
      "Volunteers used an app to track the outcome of each door knock. Another app allowed them to text everyone in their phone contacts and ensure they had a plan to vote \u2014 a strategy known as \u201crelational organizing.\u201d",
      "Armed with brightly colored campaign literature and screen-printed merch, supporters also set up shop around concert venues and downtown bars. They hosted cheeky events that dovetailed with Mamdani\u2019s youth-friendly social strategy, including a Mamdani lookalike contest and a \u201cHot Girls for Zohran\u201d canvas launch.",
      "Volunteers received a \u201cZetroCard,\u201d a play on the city\u2019s MetroCard, to keep track of how many times they canvassed.",
      "\"It felt joyous and optimistic at a time when people are feeling really scared and disillusioned by the state of the world,\" said Halal, the field organizer.",
      "As Mamdani\u2019s exposure increased in recent weeks, the number of volunteers ballooned. They came from as far as Ireland and Hawaii, though many were young New Yorkers not previously involved in politics, according to Alvaro Lopez, the electoral coordinator for the city\u2019s DSA chapter.",
      "\u201cPeople would come to us who never even thought of canvassing and say they wanted to get involved, they wanted to get to know their neighbors, they wanted to be part of this,\u201d Lopez said. \u201cWe went from basically 300 volunteers in December to being able to launch canvases throughout the city with over 10,000 people.\u201d",
      "Early in the campaign, Lopez said he\u2019d met with a 100-year-old woman in the neighborhood of East Williamsburg, where he grew up. The woman, a former city employee, hadn\u2019t heard of Mamdani when Lopez showed up. By the end of their conversation, she said she wanted to contribute to his campaign in any way she could.",
      "\u201cCanvassing is about bringing ideas to people that can make them feel like they\u2019re part of a broader political project,\u201d Lopez said. \u201cOur message made sense to her: she felt like it was time for a change.\u201d",

      "COLUMBUS, Ohio -- The two-year, $60 billion operating budget sent to Republican Gov. Mike DeWine calls for flattening Ohio's income tax and setting aside $600 million in unclaimed funds for a new Cleveland Browns stadium, among hundreds of spending decisions. He has until Monday to sign it and issue any line-item vetoes.",
      "State Sen. George Lang described the massive spending blueprint as \u201ca budget of abundance,\u201d as he and other members of the GOP supermajority touted its $1 billion in income tax relief, pathways to address Ohio's property tax crisis and how \u2014 like the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency initiative \u2014 it trims spending at administrative agencies and curtails regulations.",
      "Democrats voted uniformly against the bill, alongside a handful of Republicans, casting it as a collection of misguided policy tradeoffs that prioritize the wealthy over the middle class.",
      "Those opponents argued that joining what the Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit Tax Foundation has described as a \u201cflat tax revolution\u201d in the states would stand to mostly benefit higher income earners at the expense of local governments and libraries. Another key Democratic sticking point: Though it increases public education funding by about $3 billion over the biennium, the bill underfunds, by hundreds of millions of dollars or more, the final stage of a bipartisan, legislatively approved overhaul of Ohio's unconstitutional school funding system.",
      "Here's a closer look:",
      "It includes the $600 million Haslam Sports Group, owner of the Browns, requested from the state to help build a new domed stadium in suburban Brook Park south of Cleveland.",
      "DeWine proposed doubling taxes on sports betting to help the Browns, as well as the Bengals and other teams who might seek facility upgrades. But the Legislature settled on using some of the $4.8 billion in unclaimed funds the state is holding on to \u2014 in small sums residents left behind from dormant bank accounts, uncashed checks and forgotten utility deposits. The budget earmarks $1.7 billion from that fund to create an Ohio Cultural and Sports Facility Performance Grant Fund and designates the Browns as the first grant recipient.",
      "The budget doesn't explicitly include money for the Bengals, who reached a tentative deal on stadium renovations with their home county Thursday, but the fund would assist such projects going forward.",
      "Lawmakers who represent Cleveland and surrounding communities, mostly Democrats, blasted the proposal as a gift to the team's billionaire owners. Democrats outside the Legislature threatened to sue if DeWine signs the plan, arguing it would be unconstitutionally raiding the unclaimed funds without due process. The Republican attorney general vowed their effort would fail.",
      "The budget phases in a single flat-tax rate of 2.75% over two years, effective on anyone making over $26,050 a year. Those making less would continue to pay nothing. The plan eliminates the existing 3.5% rate on those making over $100,000 a year by the 2026 tax year. Ohio would be the 15th state with a flat tax rate if the plan is enacted.",
      "Republicans tout that as a benefit to working Ohioans and the economy and another step in their continuing efforts to reduce the state's tax burden, with the aim of some of them being to eventually eliminate the income tax entirely. Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a Washington, D.C. nonprofit, found 98% of the benefit would go to the top 20% of income earners, or those making over $139,900.",
      "To address skyrocketing property taxes largely collected by public school districts, the bill prohibits any new emergency or new replacement levies and requires wording changes on ballots when seeking any future levies.",
      "It also caps districts' operating budget carryovers, requiring them to spend down surpluses that exceed 40% or return the excess to taxpayers. Opponents argued that penalizes districts that have been good stewards of their money.",
      "Echoing the approach of Trump's DOGE as one of that program's architects runs for governor with Trump's support, lawmakers boasted of the legislation's 3% to 4% cuts to administrative agency budgets.",
      "Beyond that, it defunds, defangs, reassigns or abolishes bodies that punish election law violations, craft public school policy, monitor rare diseases, field complaints about Ohio's state prisons and oversee state spending on Medicaid \u2014 the largest and most foundational portion of the state budget. Most of the affected boards, commissions and committees were bipartisan.",
      "It also reduces funding for tobacco use prevention, food banks and several housing programs, while devoting $7 million to quantum computing research at Miami University and $5 million to child cancer research.",
      "In anticipation of potential cuts to the federal budget, Republicans also included a trigger mechanism that would end coverage under Medicaid expansion if the federal government match falls below 90%. Democrats criticized the decision, which affects health insurance coverage for more than 800,000 Ohioans.",
      "The legislation declares as not only state policy but \u201cincontrovertible reality\u201d that there are \u201conly two sexes, male and female.\"",
      "It prohibits, to the extent allowed under federal law, the distribution of Medicaid funds for mental health services that \"promote or affirm social gender transition\u201d and bans state funds from going to youth shelters that do the same. It also would require public libraries to move children's books \u201crelated to sexual orientation or gender identity or expression\u201d out of view of minors.",

There's also nearly $1 billion more allocated in federal water and sewer grants and state transportation money with a focus on Helene repairs.",
      "Stein had urged lawmakers this week to set aside their differences \u201cand get this relief out the door.\u201d",
      "Cutting diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives were a major priority for GOP lawmakers. State agencies, local governments, public K-12 schools and higher education institutions would be impacted if the bills become law.",
      "Training, staff positions and hiring decisions that incorporate DEI are banned in state agencies under one bill. The legislation also would outlaw those agencies or local governments from using state funds for DEI programs. Two other bills would bar \u201cdivisive concepts\u201d and \u201cdiscriminatory practices\u201d across public education in the state.",

      "\u201cWhen it\u2019s done right, it opens a door for more students to compete fairly,\u201d Sen. Michael Lee, the bill\u2019s sponsor, said in committee Tuesday. \u201cWhen it\u2019s done wrong, it prioritizes identity over ability.\u201d",
      "But Democrats said the legislation will \u201cchill\u201d state employees\u2019 speech and may reverse progress for students of color who weren\u2019t historically afforded certain opportunities.",
      "\u201cA multiethnic, diverse society has to learn how to grapple with things that can make you feel uncomfortable,\u201d Rep. Brandon Lofton said on Wednesday. \u201cThis bill puts an end to that.\u201d",
      "It was shrimp that elicited a giant response from the public this week.",
      "A bill pushed by the state Senate would ban shrimp trawling \u2014 which uses a cone-shaped net to scoop up the crustaceans \u2014 inshore and within a half-mile (.8 kilometers) of coastal North Carolina shorelines.",
      "Proponents say shrimp trawling has negative environmental impacts, such as killing juvenile fish populations and disrupting ecosystems.",
      "But several coastal Republican legislators were outraged, saying the bill would completely devastate North Carolina\u2019s shrimping industry. About 75% of North Carolina shrimp are caught inshore, according to the North Carolina Local Food Council.",
      "Hundreds of shrimp industry members and their allies on Tuesday crowded inside and outside the Legislative Building to oppose the bill. A dozen semitrailers \u2014 draped with banners like \u201cNC Seafood for All. No Trawl Ban\u201d \u2014 circled the building and blasted their horns for hours.",
      "Bill opponents cheered Wednesday outside a House Republican caucus meeting where members said they decided not to act on the bill.",
      "Legislators gave final approval this week to a host of bipartisan bills, such as a measure sought by the governor to require public school districts to pass policies barring students from having cellphones turned on during instructional time. There would be exceptions.",
      "Others were divisive, like a bill prohibiting state funds for gender-affirming care for prisoners and stating there are only two sexes. Another measure would allow private school boards to authorize a trained, permitted adult to carry a handgun on a school\u2019s campus for security.",
      "These measures now head to Stein\u2019s desk. The governor vetoed three GOP measures last week. No override attempts have yet occurred.",

      "SOUTH LAKE TAHOE, Calif. -- A California black bear with a history of confronting humans and breaking into homes was euthanized this week after swiping at a camper near Lake Tahoe and sending her to the hospital with cuts and bruises, officials said.",
      "The woman was awakened around 4:30 a.m. Sunday when the female bear broke into her trailer at a campground near Emerald Bay State Park, according to the California Department of Fish and Wildlife.",
      "The camper tried to scare off the bear by screaming and banging pots and pans, the department said in a statement Tuesday.",
      "\u201cUndeterred, the bear forced its way into the trailer and swiped at the camper, leaving her with cuts and bruises on her arms and hand and requiring an escorted trip to the hospital,\u201d the statement said.",
      "Later that morning, the bear ripped open the door to a camper van with teenagers sleeping inside and then was reported harassing other campers at the same campground.",
      "The bear, deemed a public safety risk, was tracked to another campground nearby on Monday and euthanized by a State Parks ranger, officials said. DNA testing confirmed it was the same bear responsible for the attack on the woman a day earlier.",
      "Wildlife officers had been trying to trap the bear since June 17 after attempts to haze it out of areas where people live and recreate had failed. The bear had been the subject of multiple 911 calls following break-ins and confrontations, officials said. On June 10, the bear broke into a car parked at a campground with a child fastened to a child seat inside.",

      "BALTIMORE -- A federal lawsuit could open a new chapter in an escalating legal battle in Maryland, where officials are struggling to address an unexpected onslaught of claims alleging child sexual abuse in state-run juvenile detention facilities.",
      "With thousands of similar claims already pending in state court, the litigation has raised questions about how Maryland will handle the potential financial liability.",
      "The new federal suit, filed Wednesday on behalf of three plaintiffs, seeks $300 million in damages \u2014 an amount that far exceeds caps imposed on claims filed in state court. It alleges Maryland juvenile justice leaders knew about a culture of abuse inside youth detention facilities and failed to address it, violating the plaintiffs\u2019 civil rights.",
      "A message seeking comment was left Thursday with the state\u2019s Department of Juvenile Services. The department generally doesn\u2019t comment on pending litigation. The Maryland Office of the Attorney General declined to comment.",
      "An estimated 11,000 plaintiffs have sued in state court, according to the attorneys involved. Maryland Senate President Bill Ferguson said Wednesday that he believes negotiations for a potential settlement are ongoing between attorneys for the plaintiffs and the attorney general\u2019s office. Officials have said the state is facing a potential liability between $3 billion and $4 billion.",
      "Lawsuits started pouring in after a state law passed in 2023 eliminated the statute of limitations for child sexual abuse claims in Maryland. The change came in the immediate aftermath of a scathing investigative report that revealed widespread abuse within the Archdiocese of Baltimore. It prompted the archdiocese to file for bankruptcy to protect its assets.",
      "But Maryland leaders didn\u2019t anticipate they\u2019d be facing similar budgetary concerns because of claims against the state\u2019s juvenile justice system.",
      "Facing a potentially enormous payout, lawmakers recently passed an amendment to limit future liabilities. The new law reduces caps on settlements from $890,000 to $400,000 for cases filed after May 31 against state institutions, and from $1.5 million to $700,000 for private institutions. It allows each claimant to receive only one payment, instead of being able to collect for each act of abuse.",
      "Suing in federal court allows plaintiffs to sidestep those limits.",
      "\u201cDespite Maryland\u2019s recent unconstitutional legislative efforts to insulate itself from liability for the horrific sexual brutalization of children in its custody, Maryland cannot run from liability under Federal law,\u201d plaintiffs\u2019 attorney Corey Stern said in a statement. \u201cThe United States Constitution was created for all of us, knowing that some would need protection from the tyranny of their political leaders.\u201d",
      "The three plaintiffs in the federal case allege they were sexually abused by staff at two juvenile detention centers. While other lawsuits have mainly presented allegations of abuse occurring decades ago, the federal complaint focuses on events alleged to have happened in 2019 and 2020. The plaintiffs were 14 and 15 years old.",
      "The victims feared their sentences would be extended if they spoke out, according to the complaint. They accuse state officials of turning a blind eye to a \u201cculture of sexual brutalization and abuse.\u201d",

      "Despite recent upticks in donations to nonprofits combatting climate change, Enlight Foundation President Xin Liu said emerging leaders on the front lines of the crisis are not getting enough of that money. So, she and The Patchwork Collective are offering $1 million multi-year grants to 25 community organizations led by 15- to 35-year-olds.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a little funder stigma of trusting youth, trusting young funders, trusting their capacity, their ability to lead,\" Liu said.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re really quite often very innovative and creative. And very much close to the problem, which drives them to come up with really impactful solutions,\" she added. \"As an older generation, we have a responsibility in helping them, empowering them, to scale their work, too.\u201d",

Applicants have until Sept. 22 to enter the open call run by Lever for Change, a nonprofit affiliate of the MacArthur Foundation.",

More than a dozen young advisors gave feedback on the open call\u2019s design and will help with peer review, according to Liu. Youth-led organizations and climate experts are welcome to participate in the external evaluation panel. Liu is inviting more funders to join because she said each additional $1 million will allow them to benefit another awardee.",
      "\u201cThe people who are most invested in this are the people who are going to be bearing the burden of climate change in their future,\u201d Molyneaux said. \u201cSo, they understand the importance of this issue and how to mobilize their communities.\u201d",
      "The length of the multi-year grants will be tailored to the recipients\u2019 needs. Recognizing that some organizations might not have the capacity to accept all that money at once, Liu said 2- to 5-year periods are \u201cfine.\u201d",
      "Enlight Foundation will also do more than just write a check. Liu promised to provide mentorship and connections \u201cto really watch them flourish.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- A divided Supreme Court allowed states to cut off Medicaid money to Planned Parenthood in a ruling handed down Thursday amid a wider Republican-backed push to defund the country\u2019s biggest abortion provider.",
      "The case centers on funding for other health care services Planned Parenthood provides in South Carolina, but the ruling could have broader implications for Medicaid patients.",
      "The court split 6-3 in the opinion, with the three liberal justices dissenting.",
      "Public health care money generally can\u2019t be used to pay for abortions. Medicaid patients go to Planned Parenthood for things like contraception, cancer screenings and pregnancy testing, in part because it can be tough to find a doctor who takes the publicly funded insurance, the organization has said.",
      "South Carolina\u2019s Republican governor says no taxpayer money should go the organization. The budget bill backed by President Donald Trump in Congress would also cut Medicaid funding to Planned Parenthood. That could force the closure of about 200 centers, most of them in states where abortion is legal, the organization has said.",
      "Gov. Henry McMaster first moved to cut off Medicaid funding to Planned Parenthood in 2018 but was blocked in court after a lawsuit from a patient named Julie Edwards. Edwards wanted to keep going there for birth control because her diabetes makes pregnancy potentially dangerous, so she sued over a provision in Medicaid law that allows patients to choose their own qualified provider.",
      "South Carolina, though, argued that patients shouldn\u2019t be able to file those lawsuits. The state pointed to lower courts that have been swayed by similar arguments and allowed states such as Texas to block Medicaid funding from Planned Parenthood.",
      "Public health groups like the American Cancer Society, by contrast, said in court papers that lawsuits are the only real way that Medicaid patients have been able to enforce their right to choose their own doctor. Losing that right would reduce access to health care for people on the program, which is estimated to include one-quarter of everyone in the country. Rural areas could be especially affected, advocates said in court papers.",
      "In South Carolina, $90,000 in Medicaid funding goes to Planned Parenthood every year, a tiny fraction of the state\u2019s total Medicaid spending. The state banned abortion at about six weeks\u2019 gestation after the high court overturned it as a nationwide right in 2022.",

      "In an announcement this week, the FTC said it was distributing more than 969,000 refunds totaling over $126 million to consumers on Wednesday and Thursday. That follows the regulator's first round of payments amounting to more than $72 million, which went out in December 2024.",
      "The refunds are part of a $520 million settlement that Epic agreed to pay back in 2022 \u2014 to address complaints revolving around children\u2019s privacy and payment methods on its popular Fortnite video game. At the time, the FTC had alleged that the gaming giant used deceptive online design tactics to trick Fortnite players, including children, into making unintended purchases \u201cbased on the press of a single button.\u201d",
      "Consumers could be charged while doing something as simple as attempting the wake the game from sleep mode, for example, or by pressing a nearby button when trying to preview an item, the agency said. The FTC also accused Epic of blocking some users who disputed the charges from accessing the content they purchased.",
      "Beyond a $275 million fine related to collecting personal information for players under the age of 13, the settlement, which was finalized in 2023, included $245 million in customer refunds. Between December's payments and the refunds sent out this week, about $198 million of that has been sent out \u2014 leaving roughly $47 million left to be distributed.",
      "The latest refunds are being doled out to consumers who filed a valid claim before Feb. 14 \u2014 meaning that any claims filed after that date are still under review, according to the FTC.",
      "And the FTC also says it's reopening the claims process. Eligible consumers who have not been compensated yet now have until July 9 to file a claim.",
      "If accepted, the refunds come in the form of checks or PayPal payments. To apply and learn more about the settlement, users should visit the FTC's website. People who are eligible for these payouts include Fortnite players who were charged in-game currency for items they didn\u2019t want or saw their account locked after complaining to a credit card company about wrongful charges between January 2017 and September 2022 \u2014 as well as parents whose kids made charges on their credit cards without their knowledge from January 2018 through November 2018.",
      "The Associated Press reached out to Epic for comment on Thursday. At the time the settlement was announced in December 2022, Epic said it accepted the agreement because it wanted \u201cto be at the forefront of consumer protection and provide the best experience for our players.\u201d The Cary, North Carolina-based company added that it was already rolling out changes \u201cto ensure our ecosystem meets the expectations of our players and regulators, which we hope will be a helpful guide for others in our industry.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- The Senate parliamentarian has advised that a key Medicaid provider tax overhaul that is central to President Donald Trump's big tax cut and spending bill does not adhere to procedural rules, delivering a crucial blow to Republicans rushing to finish the massive package this week.",
      "The guidance Thursday from the parliamentarian is rarely ignored, and it forces GOP leaders to consider options. Senate leaders could try to revise it or strip it from the package. Otherwise, the provision could be challenged during floor votes, requiring a 60-vote threshold to keep it, a tall order in the narrowly split Senate. Democrats are unified against the Republican president\u2019s bill.",
      "Republican leaders are relying on the provider tax change to save billions of dollars from the Medicaid health care program for the massive tax cuts package. But they had been struggling to rally support because several GOP senators warn it would harm rural hospitals who depend on the funds.",
      "The outcome is a setback as Senate Republicans hoped to launch votes on the package by the end of the week, to meet Trump\u2019s Fourth of July deadline for passage.",
      "The parliamentarian of the Senate is a nonpartisan appointed position, a chief arbiter of the chamber\u2019s historic and often complicated rules.",

      "Her sixth album, \"Princess of Power,\" comes after the artist \u2014 born Marina Diamandis \u2014 recovered from chronic fatigue syndrome while rebuilding her relationship with music and her identity.",
      "MARINA has scored billions of streams without ever having a top 10 single in the U.K. or U.S., yet her influence runs deep among a generation of artists including Olivia Rodrigo and Billie Eilish. \"I think artists who are very commercially successful, like they'll have these peaks and troughs and mine's kind of like been like steadily going up,\" MARINA said.",
      "Although she admitted it's \"somewhat frustrating\" when music doesn't reach mainstream success, her dedicated fanbase never fails to find it.",
      "\"I always want people to choose to love my music. I don't want to shove it in anyone's face,\" she said.",
      "The origins of MARINA's journey",
      "The daughter of a Welsh mother and Greek father, MARINA moved from her hometown of Abergavenny, Wales, to London at 19. She was initially embarrassed to sing in public \u2014 but music felt like an \"innate calling.\"",
      "She overcame her stage fright \"painfully\" by going to open mic nights alone.",
      "\"I was like, if I'm bad, I need no one I know to see me be bad, which you can't do anymore, 'cause everyone's filming everything,\" she said, laughing.",
      "She launched her career with her 2010 debut \"The Family Jewels,\" then going by Marina and the Diamonds, followed by 2012's \"Electra Heart,\" which reached No. 1 on British charts.\u00a0But by 2016, success felt suffocating.",
      "\"And I just suddenly felt really trapped,\" she said. \"I felt like my identity was glued to my artist's identity. I just suddenly, like wanted out.\"",
      "Discovering health issues",
      "That same year, MARINA began experiencing mysterious symptoms that would later be diagnosed as chronic fatigue syndrome.",
      "\"The main symptom actually was buzzing all over,\" she explained. \"And it always started in my feet then it would basically go all the way up my body \u2026 like my face would basically be throbbing. Like my whole body would feel like it was ringing.\"",
      "It took six years to understand the condition was connected to her nervous system. Breathwork ultimately provided relief.",
      "\"I have had to basically change my whole life, like inside out,\" she said.",
      "While MARINA stepped back from her career, her early music found new life on TikTok.",
      "\"It is strange because I was so used to like pushing to make things happen in my career. And then suddenly this whole thing, you get three platinum records by doing nothing,\" she said.",
      "Now living in Los Angeles, MARINA approaches each album with detailed planning, usually in a journal. But this time, she made an album map for \"Princess of Power\" which includes a color palette, themes and the kind of energy she wanted the music to have: cosmic, love rush, euphoric, dazzling, bright light and powerful.",
      "\"This album was different because I think I'm at the point where I'm not writing so much to like heal myself,\" she said. \"I was like, I have this platform, and I want to make sure that whatever I'm putting out into the world has a certain type of energy that feels positive to me \u2026 because that's what I really needed two years ago when I started writing this.\"",
      "\"You don't get to do this many times in your life, you know, as an artist,\" she continued. \"So, I was like, this is the time I'm gonna do this. Let's see what happens.\"",
      "Performing these new songs allows MARINA to embody the transformation she's undergone.",
      "\"It's almost like making it public means I can suddenly step into it,\" she said. \"It's almost like I can finally say to people, 'This is who I am actually.' Like the person you knew four years ago has gone.\"",

      "Bobby Sherman, whose winsome smile and fashionable shaggy mop top helped make him into a teen idol in the 1960s and '70s with bubblegum pop hits like \"Little Woman\" and \"Julie, Do Ya Love Me,\" has died, his wife said in a statement posted to social media. He was 81.",
      "His wife, Brigitte Poublon, announced the death Tuesday, and family friend John Stamos posted her message on Instagram: \"Bobby left this world holding my hand \u2014 just as he held up our life with love, courage, and unwavering grace through all 29 beautiful years of marriage. I was his Cinderella, and he was my prince charming. Even in his final days, he stayed strong for me. That's who Bobby was-brave, gentle, and full of light.\"",
      "Sherman revealed he had Stage 4 cancer earlier this year.",
      "Sherman was a squeaky clean regular on the covers of Tiger Beat and Sixteen magazines, often with hair over his eyes and a choker on his neck. His face was printed on lunch boxes, cereal boxes and posters that hung on the bedroom walls of his adoring fans. He landed at No. 8 in TV Guide's list of \"TV's 25 Greatest Teen Idols.\"",
      "He was part of a lineage of teen heartthrobs who emerged as mass-market, youth-oriented magazines and TV took off, connecting fresh-scrubbed Ricky Nelson in the 1950s to David Cassidy in the '60s, all the way to Justin Bieber in the 2000s.",
      "Sherman had four Top 10 hits on the Billboard Hot 100 chart \u2014 \"Little Woman,\" \"Julie, Do Ya Love Me,\" \"Easy Come, Easy Go,\" and \"La La La (If I Had You).\" He had six albums on the Billboard 200 chart, including \"Here Comes Bobby,\" which spent 48 weeks on the album chart, peaking at No. 10. His career got its jump-start when he was cast in the ABC rock 'n' roll show \"Shindig!\" in the mid-'60s. Later, he starred in two television series \u2014 \"Here Come the Brides\" (1968-70) and \"Getting Together\" (1971).",
      "After the limelight moved on, Sherman became a certified emergency medical technician and instructor for the Los Angeles Police Department, teaching police recruits first aid and CPR. He donated his salary.",
      "\"A lot of times, people say, 'Well, if you could go back and change things, what would you do?'\" he told The Tulsa World in 1997. \"And I don't think I'd change a thing \u2014 except to maybe be a little bit more aware of it, because I probably could've relished the fun of it a little more. It was a lot of work. It was a lot of blood, sweat and tears. But it was the best of times.\"",
      "Sherman, with sky-blue eyes and dimples, grew up in the San Fernando Valley, singing Ricky Nelson songs and performing with a high school rock band.",
      "\"I was brought up in a fairly strict family,\" he told the Sunday News newspaper in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, in 1998. \"Law and order were important. Respect your fellow neighbor, remember other people's feelings. I was the kind of boy who didn't do things just to be mischievous.\"",
      "He was studying child psychology at a community college in 1964 when his girlfriend took him to a Hollywood party, which would change his life. He stepped onstage and sang with the band. Afterward, guests Jane Fonda, Natalie Wood and Sal Mineo asked him who his agent was. They took his number and, a few days later, an agent called him and set him up with \"Shindig!\"",
      "Sherman hit true teen idol status in 1968, when he appeared in \"Here Come the Brides,\" a comedy-adventure set in boom town Seattle in the 1870s. He sang the show's theme song, \"Seattle,\" and starred as young logger Jeremy Bolt, often at loggerheads with his brother, played by David Soul. It lasted two seasons.",
      "Following the series, Sherman starred in \"Getting Together,\" a spinoff of \"The Partridge Family,\" about a songwriter struggling to make it in the music business. He became the first performer to star in three TV series before the age of 30. That television exposure soon translated into a fruitful recording career: His first single, \"Little Woman,\" earned a gold record in 1969.",
      "\"While the rest of the world seemed jumbled up and threatening, Sherman's smiling visage beamed from the bedroom walls of hundreds of thousands of teen-age girls, a reassuring totem against the riots, drugs, war protests and free love that raged outside,\" The Tulsa World said in 1997.",
      "His movies included \"Wild In Streets,\" \"He is My Brother\" and \"Get Crazy.\"",
      "Sherman pulled back from his celebrity career after several years of a frantic schedule, telling The Washington Post: \"I'd film five days a week, get on a plane on a Friday night and go someplace for matinee and evening shows Saturday and Sunday, then get on a plane and go back to the studio to start filming again. It was so hectic for three years that I didn't know what home was.\"",
      "Sherman's pivot to becoming an emergency medical technician in 1988 was born out of a longtime fascination with medicine. Sherman said that affinity blossomed when he raised his sons with his first wife, Patti Carnel. They would get scrapes and bloody noses, and he became the family's first-aid provider. So he started learning basic first aid and CPR from the Red Cross.",
      "\"If I see an accident, I feel compelled to stop and give aid even if I'm in my own car,\" he told the St. Petersburg Times. \"I carry equipment with me. And there's not a better feeling than the one you get from helping somebody out. I would recommend it to everybody.\"",
      "In addition to his work with the Los Angeles Police Department, he was a reserve deputy with the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department, working security at the courthouse. Sherman estimated that, as a paramedic, he helped five women deliver babies in the backseats of cars or other impromptu locations.",
      "In one case, he helped deliver a baby on the sidewalk and, after the birth, the new mother asked Sherman's partner what his name was. \"When he told her Bobby, she named the baby Roberta. I was glad he didn't tell her my name was Sherman,\" he told the St. Petersburg Times in 1997.",
      "He was named LAPD's Reserve Officer of the Year for 1999 and received the FBI's Exceptional Service Award and the \"Twice a Citizen\" Award by the Los Angeles County Reserve Foundation.",
      "In a speech\u00a0on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives in 2004, then-Rep. Howard McKeon said: \"Bobby is a stellar example of the statement 'to protect and serve.' We can only say a simple and heartfelt thank you to Bobby Sherman and to all the men and women who courageously protect and serve the citizens of America.\"",
      "Later, Sherman would join the 1990s-era \"Teen Idols Tour\" with former 1960s heartthrobs Micky Dolenz and Davy Jones of the Monkees and Peter Noone of Herman's Hermits.",
      "The Chicago Sun-Times in 1998 described one of Sherman's performances: \"Dressed to kill in black leather pants and white shirt, he was showered with roses and teddy bears as he started things off with 'Easy Come, Easy Go.' As he signed scores of autographs at the foot of the stage, it was quickly draped by female fans of every conceivable age group.\"",
      "Sherman also co-founded the Brigitte and Bobby Sherman Children's Foundation in Ghana, which provides education, health and welfare programs to children in need.",
      "He is survived by two sons, Christopher and Tyler, and his wife.",

      "Did he have any reservations? \"Yes, I was worried,\" he said. \"I didn't want him to come off as just this one-note character.\"",
      "And early on he didn't even know yet just how sexually awkward things were going to get. \"When I was auditioning, they had said, 'Are you okay with, know, performing things sexually? Are you okay being nude at times?'\" Schwarzenegger recalled. \"So, I knew an idea of where it could go. I didn't know to what extent the show would go.\"",
      "To watch a trailer for Season 3 of \"The White Lotus,\" click on the video player below:",
      "The series' creator, Mike White, has spent three seasons pushing the envelope, writing exotic whodunits that, along the way, skewer the rich and privileged vacationing at White Lotus resorts all around the world \u2013 a world he knew Patrick probably understood. Schwarzenegger said, \"There was a joke because he was always like, 'You don't look like you're rich. You're not walking rich. Aren't you a Schwarzenegger? Aren't you a Kennedy? Aren't you rich in real life? You don't look like you're rich at all!'\"",
      "The show's first season, set in Hawaii, debuted during the pandemic in 2021, and it hit Schwarzenegger and his family head-on. \"It was me, Abby, my fianc\u00e9e, and my mom,\" he said. \"We lived together, us three, during the pandemic. So, you can imagine how fun that was! And then they were always like, 'You need to be in the show, you need to audition, this is perfect.'\"",
      "His fianc\u00e9e is fashion model Abby Champion; his mom is journalist and member of the Kennedy clan Maria Shriver; and his dad, well, that goes without saying.",
      "Arnold Schwarzenegger has said that he didn't recognize his son in the role. \"It would be a little bit alarming if he did recognize a lot of those characteristics!\" Patrick laughed.",
      "His best friends are his family.  They're also his greatest fans.  When he got the part, they were tears all around. Patrick Schwarzenegger has emerged from \"The White Lotus,\" as a standout among standouts \u2013 the kind of breakout he hopes will put to rest any suspicions about nepotism.",
      "In a recent father-and-son chat on Variety's \"Actors on Actors,\"\u00a0Arnold Schwarzenegger said, \"To me, the name Schwarzenegger always meant a big plus.\"",
      "Patrick revealed that he worried his name might get in the way: \"There were times earlier in my career where I was wondering, Does it makes sense to go under some sort of alias? Does it make sense to go under a different name?\"",
      "\"Well, I'm glad that you kept the name, 'cause now I can take credit,\" Arnold said. \"My son! The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.\"",
      "Patrick idolized his dad growing up, spending time on movie sets that became his playground. By the time he was 13, he was on his own sets, but he says he rarely brought up his dad. \"I mean, I always know that there's, you know, my last name, there's connections, there's, you know, things that are gonna help me, but I wanted to try to take a different path than that.\"",
      "He did, however, follow his dad's path on matters of money \u2013 how to run a business, how to create a brand. \"My dad put me in charge of his memorabilia when I was 10,\" said Patrick. \"And so, I would take these different photos of him, you know, at Muscle Beach, and we would frame them. I took a replica of the Conan swords and get him to sign them, and I would sell them for $10,000 a pop. It was all for nonprofit. I didn't make any money, but it was to understand how to sell.\"",
      "He actually majored in business as USC, starting college just about a year after his parents had left the California Governor's office. Politics has been in his genes, after all \u2013 and so has the idea of public service. His grandfather, Sargent Shriver, was the founding director of the Peace Corps. His grandmother, Eunice Kennedy Shriver, founded the Special Olympics.",
      "Asked if he's thought about going into politics himself, Patrick replied, \"I think it was instilled in us to find ways to give back at an early age. It doesn't have to be through public office, to find ways to give back.\"",
      "Through it all, his focus on acting remained pretty singular. He spent a decade in acting class, building a resume one part at a time, recently acting opposite Colin Firth in the HBO mini-series, \"The Staircase.\" That, he said, \"was the first time that the people in the industry were able to see me in a dramatic role. ... Before, people maybe didn't take me serious. They didn't know if I was really, you know, in it for the long haul, was I really working on my craft?\"",

      "He hopes his next role will be a character with a few less character flaws than Saxon Ratliff. That said, Patrick Schwarzenegger would happily check back into the White Lotus anytime Mike White asks. \"I said, if you don't hire me again, I'll come and be the head of craft services,\" he said. \"I'll come and hire me as your scouting location guy because I just want to come in and be part of the journey.\"",

    "story": [
      "In 1967, this video introduced a new American band: The Doors, who would quickly light the music world on fire, with a sound hypnotic, mystical, and almost menacing:",
      "You know the day destroys the night Night divides the day Tried to run, tried to hide Break on through to the other side Break on through to the other side Break on through to the other side, yeah",
      "They came together 60 years ago in Venice, California: Jim Morrison, a poet in leather pants, backed by Ray Manzarek on keys, Robby Krieger on guitar, and John Densmore on drums.",
      "The Doors soon got their break, in May of '66, at London Fog, a tiny nightclub on the Sunset Strip. It's now a barber shop. \"Oh, I need a haircut,\" laughed Densmore on a recent return visit.",
      "The barber shop's owner, Chad Oringer, an avid Doors fan, asked for a photo with Densmore and Krieger, the band's last surviving members.",
      "The Doors were fired by London Fog, but quickly got another gig just a few doors down Sunset, at the Whisky a Go Go. Playing there, said Krieger, was \"the biggest deal in town.\"",
      "\"It was Mecca,\" Densmore added.",
      "The room isn't much different from what it was back then. \"The stage is lower,\" Densmore said. People would dance in front of the stage. \"And they would just all be down there writhing around. Very inspirational!\" he laughed.",
      "He described the improvisational attitude of the band: \"Ray handed me a crumpled piece of paper and it said, 'Day destroys the night. Night divides the day. Try to run. Try to hide \u2026 Break on through.'\"",
      "Morrison had never sung lead before, and Densmore wasn't sure about him at first: \"He was so shy, it was ridiculous. And I thought, 'This is not the next Mick Jagger! But I love playing music, so I'll fool around here.'\"",
      "I asked, \"Why did you have confidence the band would work if he was so inexperienced as a singer?\"",
      "\"It was the words,\" Krieger said. \"They were so different than anything that was out there.\"",
      "\"Gifted,\" said Densmore. \"'Let's swim to the moon. Let's climb through the tide\u2026 ' A psychedelic love song. Wow!\"",
      "In 1967, Los Angeles DJ Dave Diamond began playing their records on his show, \"The Diamond Mine.\" Krieger said, \"And he would call us all the time and say, 'Hey, man. Every time I play 'Light My Fire,' people go nuts!'\"",
      "\"Light My Fire,\" written by Krieger, went to #1.",
      "But Morrison's troubles with alcohol and drugs were already apparent. Densmore said, \"At first I remember we talked about, 'Oh, he's an Irish drunk. He'll live forever. But deep down, maybe he's just a shooting star that'll be a quick impact.'\"",
      "\"You knew that right away?\" I asked.",
      "\"Kinda sensed it.\"",
      "\"Was that hard to accept?\"",
      "\"Yeah,\" Densmore said. \"I mean, we miss his artistry like crazy. We don't miss his self-destruction.\"",
      "After Morrison's sudden death in Paris in 1971 at age 27, Densmore and Krieger didn't always agree with Manzarek about the band's legacy. \"At times, I felt he was selling The Doors too much. It's for the critics to do that,\" Densmore said.",
      "Krieger said, \"He would try to spread the rumor Jim's not really dead.\"",
      "Why? \"He loved the mythology,\" Densmore replied.",
      "\"He lived for The Doors,\" said Krieger. \"I mean, that was his whole life, you know? And he didn't want it to be over.\"",
      "Manzarek died in 2013.",
      "The band's 60th anniversary is celebrated in a new book \"Night Divides the Day.\"",
      "To the end, The Doors were an improvisational group. One of their best-known songs grew out of another tune they were jamming on in a session. \"We were goofing around,\" said Densmore, and \"Ghost Riders in the Sky\" morphed into \"Riders on the Storm.\" It would be Morrison's final recording.",
      "At the Whisky a Go Go every month, Krieger (now 79) has been playing a Doors album in its entirety. Densmore (80) recently sat in on drums.",

    "published": "Thu, 26 Jun 2025 13:32:21 -0400",
    "summary": "RFK Jr. announced a halt to all U.S. funding for the global Gavi vaccine alliance. One expert calls it a \"travesty and a nightmare.\"",
    "story": [
      "Johannesburg \u2014\u00a0Every four years, representatives to the global alliance of governments, pharmaceutical makers, United Nations agencies and philanthropic organizations known as Gavi, which helps get vaccines to people who need them, meet to lock in new funding pledges. Just as this year's meeting in Brussels was drawing to a close on Wednesday, U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced that all funding from Washington would cease.",
      "In a three-and-a-half-minute video message that Kennedy\u00a0shared on social media, he said the Trump administration was halting funding to the organization because it had \"neglected the key issue of vaccine safety.\"",
      "Kennedy, who has sought to distance himself from the \"anti-vaccine\" label, has a history of making\u00a0misleading statements about\u00a0vaccine safety and has been tied to\u00a0anti-vaccine activism groups.",
      "Gavi says it has helped vaccinate more than 1.1 billion children in 78 low income countries and prevented more than 18.8 million deaths since its creation 25 years ago. Its focus is getting vaccines, especially new vaccines, to populations that would struggle to afford them or access them otherwise.",
      "Kennedy argued in the video that GAVI \"has neglected the key issue of vaccine safety,\" and that \"when vaccine safety issues have come before Gavi, Gavi has treated them not as a patient health problem, but as a public relations problem.\"",
      "Kennedy accused GAVI of ignoring the science and said the alliance must \"justify the $8 billion the U.S. has given it since 2001.\"",
      "The U.S. has long been among the top government contributors to Gavi's funding, which also comes from private organizations.",
      "The Biden administration had committed to $1.6 billion in funding for the organization from 2026 through 2030 \u2014 an amount roughly equal to the funding pledged by the private Gates Foundation \u2014 and shock and outrage reverberated across the conference in Brussels after Kennedy's announcement.",
      "Bill Gates, co-founder of Microsoft and the Gates Foundation, said on social media that the move would have \"devastating consequences.\" He called on the U.S. Congress to keep funding Gavi, warning that if it did not, \"more sick kids will fall behind in school,\" and there would be \"more overcrowded hospital wards and eventually more grieving parents.\"",
      "\"If Congress allows this to happen, the consequences will be devastating,\" Gates Foundation CEO Mark Suzman said. \"Hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of preventable deaths will occur, especially among mothers and children.\"",
      "Dr. Atul Gawande, a public health researcher and surgeon at the Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston who previously held a seat on the Gavi board, said Kennedy would be held personally responsible for the results of halted U.S. government funding, which he called a \"travesty and a nightmare.\"",
      "\"I would expect to see significant changes and reductions in access to safe and effective vaccines to children, in the poorest and most vulnerable countries of the world,\" one U.S. official with decades of experience in global health and vaccination programs told CBS News on the condition of anonymity. \"Kennedy's rhetoric on vaccine safety is not helpful and is likely to fuel vaccine hesitancy in the minds of people across the world, where we will surely now see more uncontrolled outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases. This is very unfortunate.\"",
      "The U.N.'s World Health Organization has warned since 2019 that vaccine hesitancy and mistrust is one of the leading threats to global public health.",
      "The goal of this year's conference was to secure funding to reach the organization's target of over 90% global coverage with essential vaccines for a wide range of diseases such as diphtheria, tetanus and measles. Gavi received more than $9 billion in funding commitments on Wednesday, but it had hoped to garner $11.9 billion for the next five years, with the goal of immunizing 500 million children globally.",
      "Other countries acknowledged Gavi's importance, and increased their contributions at the conference on Wednesday.",
      "Topping that list was the U.K.",
      "British Foreign Secretary David Lammy announced $1.7 billion for the coming five years, making the U.K. Gavi's new largest donor.",
      "Ghana's President John Darami Mahama, addressing the Gavi conference on Wednesday, began by detailing his younger brother's struggle with polio, and the stigma associated with the disease, which has been virtually eradicated worldwide thanks to vaccination programs launched in the late 1980s.",
      "\"I understand the importance of vaccines,\" Mahama told the delegations.",
      "When his brother was diagnosed, vaccine access in Ghana was close to zero, but the president said that, through partnership with Gavi, 97% of the population was now vaccinated.",
      "He said officials were still working to reach the last 3% \u2014   about \"65,000 children who are in remote areas, difficult to reach for life saving vaccines\" \u2014 and that Ghana planned to no longer need Gavi's support by 2030.",
      "Mahama concluded his remarks with a topical comparison, saying: \"One B-2 Spirit Bomber that dropped bombs on Iran cost $2.13 billion,\" and that he had done the math, adding: \"Surely the world can afford the value of four B-2 bombers to save 500 million children. It's a choice we have to make.\"",

      "Redwood was the president of the group now called Children's Health Defense, which lists as its founder Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who now oversees the CDC as secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services. Children's Health Defense has sued to curb vaccine requirements, petitioned federal agencies to revoke vaccine authorizations and spread misinformation about vaccines. Kennedy was listed as the group's founder and chairman before becoming the nation's top health official in the second Trump administration.",
      "She is joining the CDC office responsible for overseeing most of the agency's work and data to probe potential safety risks from vaccines, including databases used by health officials to collect and analyze reports from the public and health care systems.",
      "Redwood is expected to be hired as a special government employee, the CDC officials said, a status often afforded to advisers and other temporary experts brought on for specific projects or committees.",
      "The CDC and Redwood did not respond to CBS News' requests for comment.",
      "Redwood is also scheduled to present Thursday to the agency's new roster of outside vaccine advisers, who were replaced earlier this month by Kennedy with his own picks, about her concerns about the vaccine preservative thimerosal causing autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders.",
      "The CDC and outside groups have debunked fears about thimerosal causing autism in the past. In a report briefly published on the CDC's website before this week's vaccines meeting, the agency cited several studies turning up no evidence of thimerosal causing neurodevelopmental disorders, and warned of significant methodological issues with a handful of studies that did.",
      "\"Considering the breadth of evidence and consistency in results from multiple population-based studies conducted in several countries with various study designs, the evidence does not support an association between thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism spectrum disorder or other neurodevelopmental disorders,\" the CDC said in its now-deleted report.",
      "Children's Health Defense in the past has criticized the CDC Immunization Safety Office for its efforts to debunk concerns about thimerosal, accusing the office in 2018 of attempting \"to pull the wool over the public's eyes\" about the preservative. Kennedy echoed some of those claims in a post late Tuesday on X.",
      "\"Removing a known neurotoxin from being injected into our most vulnerable populations is a good place to start with Making America Healthy Again,\" Redwood said in prepared slides released by the agency ahead of the Thursday meeting.",
      "Redwood's addition to the agenda sparked a renewed round of criticism for Kennedy, who medical groups worry is dismantling a key component of how the U.S. develops influential vaccine recommendations tied to insurance coverage and federal policies.",
      "\"Even though the prevalence of thimerosal in flu vaccines is low and it hasn't been linked to developmental issues, the public confusion and over ethylmercury remains \u2014 confusion that anti-vaccine activists, such as Lyn Redwood, have sought to stoke,\" the University of Minnesota's Vaccine Integrity Project wrote Monday.",
      "Beyond thimerosal, which the CDC says data suggests is used in less than 0.3% of flu vaccines given to moms during pregnancy, Redwood has raised concerns about other vaccine ingredients.",
      "In an interview with Kennedy published in October last year, Redwood said aluminum had been found in the brains of children with autism at \"some of the highest levels ever documented.\"",
      "The FDA has said aluminum added to some vaccines has \"a demonstrated safety profile of over many decades of use,\" and that aluminum exposure is most commonly from eating food or drinking water.",

      "The Danish drugmaker said\u00a0Monday that Wegovy will no longer be available on Hims & Hers and that it is ending the collaboration because the San Francisco-based online health company sold \"illegitimate, knockoff versions of Wegovy that put patient safety at risk.\"",
      "Novo Nordisk's move to dissolve the partnership came less than two months after the companies\u00a0said\u00a0they were entering a \"long-term collaboration\" to make obesity treatment more accessible.",
      "Shares of Hims & Hers plunged more than $20, or roughly 31%, to $44.10 following Novo Nordisk's announcement.",
      "Hims & Hers did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The company had expected to make more than $700 million this year on weight-loss services, a target that could be difficult to reach without Wegovy sales.",
      "Novo Nordisk said it began selling Wegovy via telehealth companies, including Hims & Hers, after a nationwide shortage. In offering the drug through more retailers, Novo Nordisk said it wanted to shift patients from using \"knock-off, compounded versions\" of Wegovy to the Food and Drug Administration-approved semaglutide drug.",
      "This followed an order from the FDA that sought to restrict compounding pharmacies from selling copycat weight-loss drugs, a move that's expected to drive up prices.",
      "\"After over one month into the collaboration, Hims & Hers Health, Inc. has failed to adhere to the law which prohibits mass sales of compounded drugs under the false guise of 'personalization' and are disseminating deceptive marketing that put patient safety at risk,\" a Novo Nordisk spokesperson told CBS MoneyWatch. \"This is unacceptable, and that is why we have decided to end the collaboration.\"",
      "The FDA approved Wegovy for adults with obesity in March 2024, adding it to an expanding market of weight-loss drugs that include Ozempic and Mounjaro. Demand for GLP-1 drugs, which are used to treat diabetes and weight loss, has surged in recent years, with one in eight U.S. adults saying they've used the treatments, according to health research publisher KFF.",

    "story": [
      "The S&P 500 is approaching a record high, marking a stunning turnaround from April when stocks nosedived after President Donald Trump unveiled a flurry of tariffs on so-called \"Liberation Day.\"",
      "The S&P 500 has jumped 23% since closing at its 2025 low on April 8. On Thursday, it closed up 9 points, or 0.8%, to 6,141, just three points shy of its record closing high of 6,144 on February 19. The tech-heavy Nasdaq also flirted with its previous record of 20,174, set in December 2024, inching up 195 points, or 1%, on Thursday to close at 20,167.",
      "The market could surpass those previous records on Friday or early next week, analysts told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Wall Street has largely shrugged off concerns about tariffs and geopolitical tensions since early April, although there have been periods of volatility along the way. While these issues continue to pose risks to the U.S. economy, many investors are confident they'll skirt any major market downturns, at least in the short-term, experts say.",
      "\"We hear all those narratives of what could go wrong, or what is going wrong,\" said Bret Kenwell, an investment analyst at eToro. \"But the market doesn't seem to care. It's looking forward. It's plowing ahead, and it's been trading really well.\"",
      "Still, Wall Street is awaiting more news on Mr. Trump's tariffs, with a 90-day pause on his so-called reciprocal tariffs slated to end on July 9. And Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned last week that tariffs are likely to drive up inflation later this year, slowing economic growth.",
      "Here are three reasons why experts say the market is rebounding.",
      "Easing concerns about tariffs",
      "Since April, the markets have whipsawed in response to the Trump administration's on-again, off-again tariff policies.",
      "While uncertainty around the impact of the levies remains, analysts say investor concern has faded as trade negotiations have entered a quieter phase after the Trump administration\u00a0struck a deal with China earlier this month.",
      "\"We've gone into a period where we haven't had a lot of disruptive noise coming either out of Washington or among our trading partners,\" said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott. \"I think that's helped to sort of cool anxieties, at least for the time being.\"",
      "The next benchmark will be July 9, when the president's 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs comes to an end. If the U.S. slips back into a more intense trade situation, the markets could show more volatility, Kenwell said.",
      "So far, data suggests a resilient economy, although some Wall Street economists have warned the economy may soon face headwinds.",
      "A\u00a0report from the Wells Fargo Investment Institute released Thursday predicts that the brunt of the tariffs impact will hit in the third quarter. The analysis also warns the tariffs could leave the U.S. with \"historically high and potentially debilitating levies.\"",
      "Optimism about tech stocks",
      "Technology stocks, dominated by the so-called \"magnificent 7\" \u2014 consisting of Nvidia, Apple, Amazon and other tech giants\u2014 have been integral in driving the market rebound, analysts say.",
      "Tech has become the best performing sector so far in the second quarter, a period which spans April through June. Financial companies such as banks and insurance firms have also been performing well, he added. According to Kenwell, those two sectors alone represent over 40% of the S&P 500.",
      "Chip company Nvidia closed at a record high on Thursday, allowing the company to retake its crown as the world's most valuable company. The tech giant's stock has soared almost 62% since the market's 2025 bottom on April 8.",
      "AI-powered companies have gained momentum in recent weeks, with Micron Technology, which sells computer memory and data storage, beating earnings expectations for the latest quarter, Vital Knowledge analyst Adam Crisafulli pointed out.",
      "Investors have gravitated towards tech stocks, Luschini said, given their high free cash flow and potential for strong earnings growth.",
      "\"I think investors are looking at them as sort of a bastion of safety,\" he said.",
      "Signs of a potential rate cut",
      "Investors have been buoyed by forecasts for more rate cuts from the Federal Reserve.",
      "At the Fed's June meeting, the central bank said it would\u00a0hold rates steady but pencilled in two cuts for the remainder of the year. A rate cut could come as soon as the next meeting, July 29-30, but it's more likely it will happen during the September meeting, experts say.",
      "\"I think investors are kind of looking through the next several months to a period in which we're likely to see more accommodative monetary policy,\" said Luschini.",

      "Stephanie Ivory counts on Medicaid to get treated for gastrointestinal conditions and a bulging disc that makes standing or sitting for long periods painful. Her disabilities keep her from working, she said.",
      "Ivory, 58, of Columbus, Ohio, believes she would be exempt from a requirement that adult Medicaid recipients work, but she worries about the reporting process. \"It's hard enough just renewing Medicaid coverage every six months with the phone calls and paperwork,\" she said.",
      "In Warrenton, Missouri, Denise Sommer hasn't worked in five years and relies on Medicaid to get care for anxiety, high blood pressure, and severe arthritis in her back and knees.",
      "Sommer, 58, assumes she could easily qualify for an exemption with a doctor's note. \"There's too much abuse in the system,\" she said. She added that she doesn't worry about others losing coverage for failing to meet reporting requirements.",
      "\"That's their own fault, because they should just keep their address updated with the state and read their mail,\" she said.",
      "President Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act, sprawling legislation to extend his tax cuts and enact much of his domestic agenda, would require 40 states and the District of Columbia, all of which expanded Medicaid, to add a work requirement to the program. Enrollees would have to regularly file paperwork proving that they are working, volunteering, or attending school at least 80 hours a month, or that they qualify for an exemption.",
      "Many Republicans say nondisabled adults should not be on Medicaid, arguing the work requirement will incentivize more people to get jobs. House Speaker Mike Johnson has said it would help preserve Medicaid \"for people who rightly deserve\" coverage, \"not for 29-year-old males sitting on their couches playing video games.\"",
      "Last month, Johnson claimed 4.8 million Medicaid enrollees are choosing not to work, a figure disputed by health policy experts. Spokespeople for Johnson did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Studies by the Urban Institute and KFF show that, among working-age enrollees who do not receive federal disability benefits, more than 90% already work or are looking for work, or have a disability, go to school, or care for a family member and are unable to work.",
      "Most Medicaid enrollees who are employed hold low-wage jobs, often with long or irregular hours and limited benefits, if any. Notably, their jobs often do not provide health insurance.",
      "A new Urban Institute study found 2% of Medicaid expansion enrollees without dependents, about 300,000 people, report a lack of interest in working as the reason for not having employment.",
      "The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates the work requirement in the House version of the legislation would lead to about 5 million adults losing Medicaid coverage by 2034; it has not yet analyzed the Senate bill. The Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning research organization, estimates that the Senate's version could cause as many as 380,000 more people to lose coverage.",
      "According to the CBO, the work-requirement provision represents the largest cut to Medicaid in the House bill \u2014 about $300 billion over a decade, reflecting the savings from no longer covering millions of current enrollees.",
      "The projected savings are telling, said Anthony Wright, executive director of Families USA, a consumer policy and advocacy organization. \"That gives a sense of the order of its magnitude and harshness,\" he said.",
      "Wright said that Republican-led states are likely to impose more burdensome reporting requirements. But even a less stringent approach, he said, will impose paperwork mandates that cause eligible beneficiaries to lose coverage.",
      "Stephanie Carlton, chief of staff for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, said June 24 at the Aspen Ideas: Health in Colorado that Trump administration officials believe the CBO is overstating the impact of the work requirement.",
      "\"We're making it easy\" for people to report their work hours using technology, she said. She defended the proposed requirement as a way of better integrating Medicaid beneficiaries into their communities.",
      "\"We're a society, especially through covid, that disengaged from communities. We spend a lot of time online, on social media, and we lose that human-to-human interaction,\" Carlton said. \"We're asking folks to engage in their communities. That's a fundamentally good thing to do that's part of getting benefits.\"",
      "Under the GOP proposal, people would have to meet the new work requirements when they initially sign up for Medicaid, then report their work or exemption status at least every six months \u2014 and potentially as frequently as every month.",
      "\"This is not a conversation America should be in,\" said Leslie Dach, founder and chair of Protect Our Care, an advocacy group that supports the Affordable Care Act. \"Think of real life. People are seasonal workers, or they work in retail, and it goes out of business or hours change. If you miss one month, you're kicked off.\"",
      "The GOP legislation lists disability as an exemption, along with circumstances such as being incarcerated or being the parent of a dependent child. (The Senate bill, released on June 16, would exempt only the parents of children 14 and under.)",
      "But even existing state and federal programs serving those with disabilities have different standards for determining eligibility.",
      "Kevin Corinth, a senior fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said states may face challenges because many Medicaid enrollees with disabilities do not get Social Security Disability Insurance.",
      "The federal government provides what's called Supplemental Security Income to those who meet certain thresholds for being low-income and disabled, and states are required to enroll SSI recipients in Medicaid.",
      "But about two-thirds of adult enrollees who are under age 65 and disabled \u2014 that is, have difficulties with vision, hearing, mobility, or cognitive function, or in other areas \u2014 do not receive SSI, according to KFF.",
      "\"It's hard to know where to draw the line on who is disabled enough\" to be exempt from the work requirement, Corinth said. \"Some people will fall through the cracks, and states will have to do the best job they can.\"",
      "He said states will be expected to rely on government databases, such as those maintained by their labor departments, to determine whether enrollees are working. But proving a disability could be more taxing for enrollees themselves, he said.",
      "Two states that previously tried enacting Medicaid work requirements created strict rules for people with disabilities to get an exemption.",
      "In Arkansas, the Medicaid work requirement had a 10-step online exemption process for individuals who were not automatically exempted by the state.",
      "Consequently, although 30% of people subject to the requirement reported one or more serious health limitations, only 11% obtained a long-term exemption, according to the National Health Law Program.",
      "Medicaid enrollees in Arkansas described a poorly functioning web-based reporting portal, inadequate outreach, and widespread confusion, according to focus-group interviews conducted by KFF.",
      "Georgia's Medicaid work requirement also has presented challenges for people seeking an exemption based on a disability. They must request a \"modification\" from the state on its online portal, then wait for a phone call from the state to set up an interview to review the application. Then they must enroll in the state's job-training program before being allowed to sign up for Medicaid, according to the National Health Law Program.",
      "Georgia has not disclosed how many people have applied for an exemption because of a disability or how many were approved.",
      "Over 1 in 5 Medicaid enrollees have a disability, including 22% of those ages 19 to 49 and 43% of those 50 to 64, according to KFF.",
      "Michael Karpman, principal research associate for the Urban Institute, said his group's findings \u2014 that only a small fraction of Medicaid enrollees are unemployed because they aren't interested in a job \u2014 explain why work-requirement programs in Arkansas and Georgia had no significant effect on employment even as they increased the number of uninsured adults.",
      "\"Many people fall off the Medicaid rolls due to red-tape reasons,\" he said, noting challenges requesting exemptions or reporting work. \"People struggle with the documentation process.\"",
      "Karpman said many people rely on Medicaid when they lose jobs that provide health coverage. The GOP work requirement, though, would deny them coverage while they're seeking new jobs.",
      "Chris Bryant, a Medicaid enrollee in Lexington, Kentucky, has a bleeding disorder and lives in government housing on $1,100 per month in federal disability payments. He said adding a work requirement to Medicaid will only add barriers for people whose health issues prevent them from working. \"It will be messy,\" he said.",
      "Bryant, 39, said he knows people on Medicaid who could work but don't, though he surmises it's a small portion of the population. \"People are on Medicaid because they have to have it and have no other option.\"",

      "The U.S. economy shrank faster than previously thought during the first three months of 2025, with growth contracting for the first time in three years.",
      "The country's gross domestic product fell at an annual rate of 0.5% from January through March, the Commerce Department reported Thursday in its third and final GDP report\u00a0for the period. The agency's\u00a0initial first-quarter GDP report, issued in April, estimated a 0.3% decline, which was later revised to a 0.2% dip in its second print.",
      "First-quarter growth was weighed down by a surge of imports as U.S. companies and households rushed to buy foreign goods before the Trump administration's tariffs went into effect. Although a surge in imports can appear to lower economic growth because it shows a shift away from domestic consumption, that doesn't tell the whole story about the U.S. economy, experts say.",
      "A category within the GDP data called \"real final sales to private domestic purchasers,\" which measures the economy's underlying strength, rose at a 1.9% annual rate from January through March. While that represents a solid number, it's down from the 2.9% pace in the fourth quarter of 2024 and from the Commerce Department's previous estimate of 2.5% January-March growth.",
      "The new data also shows that consumers sharply pared spending earlier this year, with growth at 0.5%, down from a robust 4% during the last three months of 2024. First-quarter consumer spending fell to its lowest level since the pandemic ended, with Americans particularly cutting back on recreation and dining, Greg Daco, EY-Parthenon chief economist, said in a research note.",
      "\"What we're witnessing is an economy temporarily buffered from the tariff shock by smart logistics maneuvers, proactive pricing strategies and some foreign exporter concessions,\" Daco said.",
      "On Tuesday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told a House committee that businesses' rush to build their inventories earlier this year ahead of tariffs taking effect has helped delay any inflationary impacts from the import duties.",
      "Because tariffs are paid by domestic importers, all or some of the costs are typically passed onto consumers. Stocking up on inventory early in the year has allowed companies to sell those goods without the added costs of tariffs, Powell noted.",
      "\"The things that are being sold at retail now, they might have been put into inventory before the tariffs in February or March,\" the Fed chief said. \"We think we should start to see this over the summer, in the June numbers and in the July numbers.\"",
      "Second-quarter rebound?",
      "The category of real final sales to private domestic purchasers includes consumer spending and private investment, but excludes volatile items like exports, inventories and government spending. Ryan Sweet of Oxford Economics called the decline in that figure \"troubling,\u2033 though he doesn't expect to make a significant change to his near-term economic forecast.",

      "Here's what to know about the three-day wedding celebration, as well as the protests unfolding in the background.",
      "Where and when is the wedding?",
      "Bezos, 61, and Sanchez's wedding extravaganza kicks off in Venice this Thursday, with the ceremony scheduled to take place Saturday at an undisclosed location.",
      "The duo were sighted earlier this week as they arrived via taxi-boat at the Aman Hotel, a five-star hotel on the Grand Canal in Venice.",
      "The nuptials will mark Bezos' second marriage, after his first marriage to philanthropist Mackenzie Scott ended in 2019. Sanchez, 55, was previously married to Patrick Whitesell, the executive chair of talent firm Endeavor, with their marriage also ending in 2019.",
      "The wedding ceremony is likely to be held on San Giorgio Maggiore,\u00a0according to CNN. One of the islands that make up Venice, San Giorgio Maggiore is known for the Church of San Giorgio Maggiore, designed by the architect Andrea Palladio in the 1500s.",
      "A protest group called \"No Space for Bezos\" declared victory this week, saying that the couple has moved their planned post-wedding party on June 28 to a shipyard on the outskirts of Venice rather than the 14th-century\u00a0Grande Scuola Misericordia in central Venice, CNN reported.",
      "How much will the Bezos-Sanchez wedding cost?",
      "The three-day event could cost between about $64 million to $76 million, Luca Zaia, president of the Veneto regional government that comprises Venice, told reporters on Tuesday, according to The Globe and Mail.",
      "About 80% of the wedding provisions will be sourced from Venetian vendors, the Associated Press reported, citing people close to the couple. These products include locally made pastries and hand-blown glass from Murano, an island known for its long history of glassmaking.",
      "Bezos has a net worth of $230 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. That ranks him No. 3 on the index's list of the world's richest people, after Mark Zuckerberg ($246 billion) and Elon Musk ($385 billion)",
      "Who is attending?",
      "Bezos and Sanchez invited some 200 guests to celebrate with them in the Italian city, according to media reports. And the event is expected to draw plenty of star power, with guests including Oprah Winfrey; Tom Brady; Leonardo DiCaprio; Orlando Bloom; Mick Jagger; Katy Perry; and President Trump's daughter, Ivanka Trump, and her husband, Jared Kushner, the Associated Press reported. Italian media also covered the arrival of Microsoft founder Bill Gates, Kim Kardashian and fashion designer Diane von Furstenberg.",
      "According to the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera, at least 95 private planes have requested permission to land at Venice's Marco Polo airport.",
      "Who is Lauren Sanchez?",
      "Jeff Bezos, the Amazon founder and owner of The Washington Post, is marrying Lauren Sanchez, a former journalist turned children's book author. The couple went public with their relationship in 2019 and became engaged in 2023.",
      "Sanchez recently participated in Blue Origin's first all-women's space flight, which included \"CBS Mornings\" anchor Gayle King and singer-songwriter Katy Perry. A licensed pilot, Sanchez pitched the\u00a0idea for a female-led flight to Bezos, the founder of Blue Origin, shortly after he completed his own trip to space in 2021.",
      "Sanchez's bachelorette party in Paris last month included Perry, Kardashian, Kris Jenner and Eva Longoria, according to AFP.",
      "What are the wedding protests about?",
      "Some Venice locals are expressing frustration over the city's decision to welcome wealthy tourists while failing to meet residents' needs.",
      "This comes amid a broader pushback against tourism in parts of Europe. Last week, protestors gathered in Venice\u00a0and other popular European destinations to protest a flood of visitors, who some critics blame for driving up housing costs and pushing out local residents. For the second year, Venice is requiring people visiting the city for a day to pay a tax to enter on certain summer dates.",
      "Among those protesting the wedding are the organizers of the \"No Space for Bezos\" campaign, which has the backing of a dozen different local organizations including housing advocates and university groups.",

    "summary": "Anthropic didn't violate U.S. copyright law when the AI company used millions of legally purchased books to train its chatbot, judge rules.",
    "story": [
      "Anthropic has won a major legal victory in a case over whether the artificial intelligence company was justified in hoovering up millions of copyrighted books to train its chatbot.",
      "In a ruling that could set an important precedent for similar disputes, Judge William Alsup of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California on Tuesday said Anthropic's use of legally purchased books to train its AI model, Claude, did not violate U.S. copyright law.",
      "Anthropic, which was founded by former executives with ChatGPT developer OpenAI,\u00a0introduced Claude in 2023. Like other generative AI bots, the tool lets users ask natural language questions and then provides neatly summarized answers using AI trained on millions of books, articles and other material.",
      "Alsup ruled that Anthropic's use of copyrighted books to train its language learning model, or LLM, was \"quintessentially transformative\" and did not violate \"fair use\" doctrine under copyright law.",
      "\"Like any reader aspiring to be a writer, Anthropic's LLMs trained upon works not to race ahead and replicate or supplant them, but to turn a hard corner and create something different,\" his decision states.",
      "By contrast, Alsup also found that Anthropic may have broken the law when it separately downloaded millions of pirated books and said it will face a separate trial in December over this issue.",
      "Court documents revealed that Anthropic employees expressed concern about the legality of using pirate sites to access books. The company later shifted its approach and hired a former Google executive in charge of Google Books, a searchable library of digitized books that successfully weathered years of copyright battles.",
      "Authors had filed suit",
      "Anthropic cheered the ruling.",
      "\"We are pleased that the Court recognized that using 'works to train LLMs (language learning models) was transformative \u2014 spectacularly so,\" an Anthropic spokesperson told CBS News in an email.",
      "The ruling stems from a case filed last year by three authors in federal court. After Anthropic used copies of their books to train Claude, Andrea Bartz, Charles Graeber and Kirk Wallace Johnson sued Anthropic for alleged copyright infringement, claiming the company's practices amounted to \"large-scale theft.\"",
      "The authors also alleged that Anthropic\u00a0\"seeks to profit from strip-mining the human expression and ingenuity behind each one of those works.\"",
      "CBS News reached out to the authors for comment, but did not hear back from Bartz or Wallace Johnson. Graeber declined to comment.",
      "Other AI companies have also come under fire over the material they use to build their language learning models. The New York Times, for example, sued Open AI and Microsoft in 2023, claiming that the tech companies used millions of its articles to train their automated chatbots.",
      "At the same time, some media companies and publishers are also seeking compensation by licensing their content to companies like Anthropic and OpenAI.",
      "Meta also won a major victory this week after a federal judge dismissed a lawsuit challenging the methods the company used to train its artificial intelligence technology. The case was brought by a group of well-known authors, including comedian Sarah Silverman and writer Jacqueline Woodson, who alleged Meta was \"liable for massive copyright infringement\" when it used copies of their books to train Meta's generative AI system Llama.",

    "published": "Thu, 26 Jun 2025 05:00:12 -0400",
    "summary": "Older, wealthier Americans would see the biggest lifetime benefit from the Republican budget bill, while younger generations could see losses, a new analysis says.",
    "story": [
      "The Republican\u00a0budget package\u00a0aims to make President Donald Trump's tax cuts permanent while offering a host of new financial breaks. Yet the \"big, beautiful bill,\" as the legislation is dubbed, could also effectively transfer wealth from younger generations to older Americans over their lifetimes, a recent study finds.",
      "Long-term, the primary beneficiaries of the GOP bill would be older, wealthier Americans, while younger, middle- to low-income people would see fewer benefits, according to the analysis from the Penn Wharton Budget Model, a University of Pennsylvania think tank that studies the fiscal issues.",
      "The group's projection assesses the impact of proposed tax cuts under the bill, as well as reductions in federal programs such as Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, better known as food stamps. Penn Wharton also factors in the long-term fiscal impact of the debt the U.S. would likely have to issue to pay for the bill's tax cuts, the group said.",
      "\"Somebody has to pay\"",
      "Younger Americans would bear the brunt of the nation's spiraling debt, Kent Smetters, director of the Penn Wharton Budget Model, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"Somebody has to pay \u2014 nothing is for free. In this case, that's the future generations,\" he said. \"We have finally reached this inflection point where under any reasonable estimation, younger people are going to be worse off in the future\" if the current version of the bill is passed.",
      "For example, the bill would cost an infant born into a low-income family $14,100 over their lifetime. This loss stems from factors including reduced social safety net benefits and lower wages resulting from slower economic growth driven by increased national debt and deficits.",
      "On the other hand, a high-income 70-year-old stands to gain $120,000 over his remaining years due to the proposed legislation's tax cuts and other benefits, the analysis found.",
      "The House narrowly passed the legislation in May. Senate lawmakers are pressing to vote on the measure by the end of the week.",
      "The White House took issue with Penn Wharton's analysis.",
      "\"So-called 'experts' panning the One, Big, Beautiful Bill without a smidge of humility should remember that they made these same exact gloomy predictions about President Trump's tax cuts during his first term \u2013 tax cuts that helped usher in historic job, wage, investment and economic growth along with the first decline in wealth inequality in decades,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Biggest winners",
      "Like Penn Wharton, other researchers have said the Republican bill is likely to benefit wealthy Americans at the expense of people lower down the ladder.",
      "The measure would likely reduce the financial resources available to the lowest-earning 10% of U.S. households by $1,600 per year, or almost 4% of their annual income, according to a report published earlier this month by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. White House officials have previously questioned the CBO's scoring of the bill.",
      "But the highest-earning 10% of households would see a gain of $12,000 per year in resources, while middle-income households would see a gain of $500 to $1,000, the CBO projected. Its analysis is based on the bill's tax breaks, as well as reductions for federal programs and reductions in state funds for safety net programs such as Medicaid and food stamps.",
      "In considering the impact of higher U.S. debt on future generations, the cost would come in the form of lower wages and higher costs, such as more expensive mortgages, Smetters said.",
      "Already, the U.S. is spending more than $1 trillion a year to service its debt \u2014 almost double the amount it was paying five years ago, according to Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis data. That's more than the nation currently spends on defense,\u00a0data\u00a0from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute shows.",
      "Clock ticking",
      "Taking on more debt to pay for the GOP bill could make it tougher for the federal government to pay for programs like Social Security as more of its budget is eaten up by interest payments. Higher debt would also likely result in higher interest rates, as well as slowing economic growth, the Yale Budget Lab projects.",
      "Elements of the bill are still under debate on Capitol Hill, with congressional Republicans racing to meet a self-imposed July 4 deadline to send the package to President Trump for his signature. The last scheduled day in session for both the House and Senate before they leave town for the holiday is Friday, leaving little time to reach a deal.",
      "Some Republicans are at loggerheads over certain provisions, such as the state and local tax deduction, known as SALT, with House lawmakers pushing for a bigger deduction than in the Senate.",
      "If the bill moves ahead, the long-term combination of benefit reductions and swelling federal debt could outweigh the benefits of tax cuts for younger Americans, the Penn Wharton analysis said.",
      "\"Sometimes people say, 'If I'm in 40th-60th [percentile of income], I won't get SNAP or Medicaid,' but actually there is a chance that you could still,\" Smetters said. \"There is a chance anybody could be unemployed or be on food stamps.\"",

      "Nestle said Wednesday it will eliminate artificial colors from its U.S. food and beverages by the middle of 2026.",
      "It's the latest big food company making that pledge. Last week, Kraft Heinz and General Mills said they would remove artificial dyes from their U.S. products by 2027. General Mills also said it plans to remove artificial dyes from its U.S. cereals and from all foods served in K-12 schools by the middle of 2026.",
      "The move has broad support. About two-thirds of Americans favor restricting or reformulating processed foods to remove ingredients like added sugar or dyes, according to an AP-NORC poll. Both California and West Virginia have recently banned artificial dyes in foods served in schools.",
      "On Sunday, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas signed a bill requiring foods made with artificial dyes or additives to contain a new safety label starting in 2027. The label would say they contain ingredients \"not recommended for human consumption\" in Australia, Canada, the European Union or the U.K.",
      "The federal government is also stepping up its scrutiny of artificial colors. In January, days before President Trump took office, U.S. regulators banned the dye called Red 3 from the nation's food supply, nearly 35 years after it was barred from cosmetics because of its potential cancer risk.",
      "In April, Trump's Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and FDA Commissioner Marty Makary said the agency would take steps to eliminate synthetic dyes by the end of 2026, largely by relying on voluntary efforts from the food industry.",
      "Nestle has pledged to remove artificial dyes before. Early in 2015, the company said it would remove artificial flavors and colors from its products by the end of that year. But the promise didn't hold.",
      "Nestle said Wednesday it's been removing synthetic dyes from its products over the last decade, and 90% of its U.S. portfolio doesn't contain them. Among those that do is Nesquik Banana Strawberry milk, which is made with Red 3.",
      "Nestle said Wednesday it wants to evolve with its U.S. customers' changing nutritional needs and preferences. \"We are always looking for different ways to offer great tasting, compelling choices for our consumers. As their diverse dietary preferences and nutritional needs evolve, we evolve with them,\" Nestle's U.S. CEO Marty Thompson said in a statement.",

    "summary": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, who is testifying before Congress this week, said tariffs are \"likely to push up prices.\"",
    "story": [
      "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reiterated his view that the central bank should keep interest rates steady for now, citing inflation risks from U.S. tariffs.",
      "Powell, who made his remarks in prepared testimony\u00a0Tuesday before the House Committee on Financial Services, has been under pressure from President Trump\u00a0to cut rates, which would make it cheaper for consumers and businesses to borrow money. At its June 18 meeting, the Fed maintained its benchmark rate in a range of 4.25% to 4.5%, where it's been parked since December.",
      "In his semiannual testimony, Powell cited uncertainty over the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs, noting that any resulting inflation \"could be short lived\" or \"could instead be more persistent.\" So far, data tracked by the Fed shows that tariffs have had little impact on overall consumer prices.",
      "By contrast, the U.S. labor market is showing signs of a slowdown, prompting some Fed officials to signal it could be time to cut rates.\u00a0But Powell reiterated his previous stance that it would be premature to push down borrowing costs for consumers and businesses.",
      "\"For the time being, we are well positioned to wait to learn more about the likely course of the economy before considering any adjustments to our policy stance,\" Powell said in the testimony.",
      "He added that tariffs are likely to weigh on economic activity and that the Federal Reserve's goal is to ensure that any tariff-related price increases don't become \"an ongoing inflation problem.\"",
      "Powell is \"unbending under pressure,\" noted Sal Guatieri, senior economist at investment advisory firm BMO, in a research note. \"Powell needs more data to assess whether tariffs will have a greater negative impact on growth/ labor markets or on inflation, and whether any lift to the latter will be temporary or longer-lasting should it influence expectations.\"",
      "Fed officials push for cut",
      "Two Fed officials \u2014 Federal Reserve governors Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller \u2014 have in recent days said the central bank should consider cutting its benchmark rate as soon as its next meeting, scheduled for July 29-30.",
      "On Friday, Waller told CNBC he doesn't believe the tariffs will cause inflation to rise meaningfully, opening the door to a rate cut next month. And on Monday, Bowman said Mr. Trump's tariffs have so far not caused the jump in inflation that many economists feared, while also expressing the view that any increase in prices would likely be just a one-time rise.",
      "\"It is likely that the impact of tariffs on inflation may take longer, be more delayed and have a smaller effect than initially expected,\" Bowman said in a speech Monday in Prague. \"Should inflation pressures remain contained, I would support lowering the policy rate as soon as our next meeting.\"",
      "Although Powell didn't touch on those comments during his testimony, he noted his concerns that tariffs could lead to higher inflation, likely starting this summer, although he said the central bank will be open to policy changes if price hikes don't materialize.",
      "\"The things that are sold at retail now might have been put into inventory before the tariffs, so we think we should see [higher prices] over the summer,\" Powell said. But, he added later, if inflation remains contained, \"We will get to a place where we cut rates.\"",
      "At the moment, most economists believe there's a roughly 20% chance of rate cut in July, according to financial data firm FactSet. It's more likely that the next reduction could occur at the Fed's September 17 meeting, with economists giving it a probability of about 80%, FactSet data shows.",
      "\"Compared to the recent Waller/Bowman comment about how a July cut could be possible, this Powell language might sound a tiny bit hawkish, but in reality the Fed has been fairly consistent: They are waiting to see what happens with government policy, specifically tariffs, before acting,\" Adam Crisafulli, an analyst with Vital Knowledge, said in a client note. \"The most likely next date for a cut is 9/17 or 10/29.\"",

To feel rich, over half said they would need annual income of at least $200,000, while 25% put the figure at $1 million, according to the personal finance firm.",
      "Bankrate researchers polled 2,260 adults across the U.S. for the survey which measures Americans' attitudes toward financial security. The upshot: Many people are increasingly unsure of whether they'll be able to get a leg up in today's economy. The share of Americans who describe themselves as not financially secure reached 77% this year, up from 75% in 2024 and 72% in 2023, according to Bankrate.",
      "\"Times have shifted,\" Bankrate economic analyst Sarah Foster said in the analysis. \"Getting rich may have once been what many Americans fantasized about, but now simply living comfortably feels like the new aspiration, as economic challenges make financial stability a rare luxury.\"",
      "As of 2023 (the most recent data available), median U.S. income in the U.S. was just over $60,000 for a full-time worker, according to Census figures. If there's a silver lining, it's that average wage growth continues to surpass inflation, which has been on a downward trend since a pandemic-induced peak in 2022. The Consumer Price Index in May rose 2.4%, up just slightly from April's 2.3% rate.",
      "According to Bankrate's findings, Gen Xers (ages 45 to 60) were the most likely generation, at 84%, to say they're not where they want to be financially. Gen X also reported needing the highest income to feel financially comfortable, with 35% saying they need to make $150,000 or more.",
      "By comparison, 80% of Gen Z (ages 18 to 28) respondents to the survey said they don't feel financially secure.",
      "Women and men also differed in their views on financial security. Bankrate's findings reflect that women feel less confident about their financial position than men. More than 1 in 3 (35%) said they aren't financially secure and never will be, according to the survey.",

    "summary": "The Trump administration plans to rescind the \"roadless rule\" that impedes logging on 59 million acres of national forests, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins says.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration plans to rescind a nearly quarter-century-old rule that blocked logging on national forest lands, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins announced Monday.",
      "The \"roadless rule\" adopted in the last days of Bill Clinton's presidency in 2001 long has chafed Republican lawmakers, especially in the West where national forests sprawl across vast, mountainous terrain and the logging industry has waned.",
      "The rule impeded road construction and \"responsible timber production\" that would have helped reduce the risk of major wildfires, Rollins said at the annual meeting of the Western Governors Association.",
      "\"This move opens a new era of consistency and sustainability for our nation's forests,\" Rollins said.",
      "Scientists say worsening wildfires are driven by a combination of climate change that warms and dries out forests, less logging and decades of fire suppression that has enabled fuels to build up.",
      "The roadless rule has affected 30% of national forest lands nationwide, or about 59 million acres, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the agency over the Forest Service.",
      "State roadless-area rules in Idaho and Colorado supersede the boundaries of the 2001 roadless rule, according to the USDA, meaning not all national forest land would be affected by a rescission.",
      "Rollins' announcement Monday was a first step in a process to rescind the roadless rule to be followed by a formal notice in coming weeks, the Agriculture Department said in a statement.",
      "The announcement comes amid recent talk of selling off federal lands in part to improve housing affordability, an idea criticized by Democrats as a public land grab.",
      "Selling public lands drew a mixed reception from governors at the same meeting. They expressed enthusiasm for economic development and worries about curtailing public access to shared lands.",
      "Speaking to a panel of governors and hotel-ballroom audience, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum described a new \"era of abundance\" on public lands under President Trump's administration in the development of natural resources, including energy and critical minerals needed for domestic production of cellphones, computers and vehicles.",
      "Immediate opposition appears",
      "Outside the hotel entrance in downtown Santa Fe, several hundred protesters filled the street to denounce efforts that might privatize federal public lands, chanting \"not for sale\" and carrying signs that read, \"This land belongs to you and me\" and \"keep our public land free for future generations.\"",
      "On social media, Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy, a Trump ally, called the reversal on roadless areas \"another example of President Trump fulfilling his campaign promise to open up resources for responsible development.\"",
      "The roadless area change meanwhile marks a sharp turnaround from the Biden administration, which far from opening up more areas to timber harvesting sought to do more to restrict logging and protect old-growth forests.",
      "Environmental groups, who want to keep restrictions on logging and road-building for places such as Alaska's Tongass National Forest, criticized the possibility of rolling back the protections.",
      "\"Any attempt to revoke it is an attack on the air and water we breathe and drink, abundant recreational opportunities which millions of people enjoy each year, havens for wildlife and critical buffers for communities threatened by increasingly severe wildfire seasons,\" Josh Hicks, conservation campaigns director at The Wilderness Society, said in a statement on the USDA's plans.",
      "Contrary to what Rollins said about reducing wildfire risk, logging exacerbates climate change and makes wildfires more intense, said Center for Western Priorities political director Rachael Hamby.",
      "\"This is nothing more than a massive giveaway to timber companies at the expense of every American and the forests that belong to all of us,\" Hamby said in a statement.",
      "In Alaska, home of the country's largest national forest, the Tongass, the roadless rule has long been a focus of litigation, with state political leaders supporting an exemption to the rule that they argue impedes economic opportunities.",
      "During the latter part of Mr. Trump's first term, the federal government lifted restrictions on logging and road-building in the Tongass, something the Biden administration later reversed.",
      "Mr. Trump in January called for reverting to the policy from his first term as part of an Alaska-specific executive order aimed at boosting oil and gas development, mining and logging in the state.",

    "published": "Tue, 24 Jun 2025 06:46:22 -0400",
    "summary": "Global crude prices jumped on Sunday but have since retreated. Here's what experts say about the outlook for oil and gas.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. military strikes in Iran are raising questions about the impact on supplies of oil and gas, including whether the widening conflict could result in higher energy prices for Americans.",
      "The price of the West Texas Intermediate crude, the U.S. benchmark, jumped 4% on Sunday night shortly after the start of trading, but fell more than 7% on Monday afternoon. The decline came as experts speculated that Iran is unlikely to close the Strait of Hormuz, a major commercial waterway that the country partly controls and that is strategically vital for the flow of crude into global markets.",
      "Iran's parliament on Sunday approved cutting off the Strait, leaving the final decision to the country's national security council. A ceasefire agreement between Israel and Iran announced by President Trump early Tuesday appeared to falter within a couple hours.",
      "The geopolitical crisis is sparking concerns that worsening hostilities could squeeze the world's supply of oil, which would likely drive up gas and other energy costs, as well for other products refined from crude. Iran said Monday that it launched an attack on the U.S. Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar.",
      "Iran, a major producer of crude, controls the northern side of the Strait of Hormuz, which is used by ships carrying roughly 20% of the world's daily supply of oil.",
      "\"In practice, Iranian efforts to 'close' the Strait could encompass a number of actions including attacking and detaining ships using the waterway, impeding navigability through the strait and, at the most extreme, laying mines in the sea,\" noted David Oxley, chief climate and commodities economist at Capital Economics, in a report.",
      "But, he added, \"[S]o long as the conflict does not become a long-lasting war with no 'off ramp,' and disruption in the Strait remains limited to the lower-level actions seen up to now, we suspect that any initial spikes in global energy prices would dissipate before long.\"",
      "Here's what to know about the Iran conflict's potential impact on oil and gas prices.",
      "What's the impact so far on oil prices?",
      "After surging in early trading on Monday, prices of Brent crude, the international standard, dipped 0.1% to $76.98 by midday. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude, the U.S. benchmark, fell 3.8% to $71.06.",
      "Still, oil prices remain above their level before the hostilities between Israel and Iran began over a week ago, when a barrel of WTI crude was close to $68.",
      "Although Wall Street experts predict that Iran is unlikely to close the Strait of Hormuz, they note that ongoing tensions in the region could disrupt the energy market and send prices soaring.",
      "\"Perhaps a bigger risk to the region's oil supply would be Israeli air strikes on Iran's oil production and export facilities, and/or attacks by Iranian proxy groups on oil production and export facilities in Iraq,\" Eurasia Group analysts said in a June 23 report.",
      "Israel so far has avoided targeting Iran's oil export industry. But if it were to do so, such strikes could disrupt the flow of several million barrels per day, sending Brent crude prices above $80 per barrel, according to the political risk consultancy.",
      "What would happen if the Strait of Hormuz is closed?",
      "Because the Strait of Hormuz is just 21 miles wide at its narrowest point, it's vulnerable to disruption. The channel connects the Persian Gulf to the Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Sea.",
      "Although energy experts believe a closure of the Strait is unlikely, noting the adverse economic and geopolitical impact on Iran, they underline that a disruption to the flow of oil through the passage would send energy prices soaring.",
      "Interruptions to oil passing through the channel would severely impact markets in China, India, Japan and South Korea, according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA), a branch of the U.S. Department of Energy.",
      "The U.S. imports only about 7% of its oil through the Strait of Hormuz. But any interference with shipments passing through the area could impact the global oil market by stifling supplies, according to experts.",
      "\"[W]hile Iran has not yet targeted the route, even a limited disruption would severely impact global supply,\" Oxford Economics analysts said in a June 20 client note. \"In a worst-case scenario, prices could spike to $130 per barrel and shave 0.8 percentage points off global GDP.\"",
      "The last time Brent crude topped $130 was in 2008, the result of a spike in energy demand and uncertainty in world energy supplies, according to the EIA. At the time, gasoline prices peaked at about $4.11 per gallon, or about $6.26 per gallon today after adjusting for inflation.",
      "What's the forecast for U.S. gas prices?",
      "American drivers are likely to see higher gas prices at the pump over the next week, with prices jumping between 10 cents and 15 cents a gallon, GasBuddy analyst Patrick DeHaan said.",
      "\"Most/all of the recent and expected rise is due to the Middle East tensions/situation,\" he said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Even with that increase, U.S. drivers would still likely be paying less at the pump than they were a year ago. The average U.S. gas price now stands at $3.22 per gallon, down from $3.45 per gallon a year earlier, according to AAA.",

The airline operates only a single route into Miami International, offering one to two daily flights between the city and Boston's Logan International Airport, according to JetBlue spokesperson Derek Dombrowski. JetBlue serves over three dozen cities in the U.S., according to its route\u00a0map.",
      "For passengers heading to South Florida, JetBlue will continue to operate out of nearby Palm Beach International Airport and Fort Lauderdale\u2013Hollywood International Airport.

      "JetBlue will also suspend its year-round service between Boston and Seattle starting October 25, offering flights between the two cities solely during the summer season, according to Dombrowski.",
      "The shift in services align with changes outlined by JetBlue CEO Joanna Geraghty in an internal memo shared with CBS News last week. In it, Geraghty said the company would \"wind down underperforming routes\" as part of a larger effort to reduce costs amid softening demand for travel.",
      "\"We're hopeful demand and bookings will rebound, but even a recovery won't fully offset the ground we've lost this year, and our path back to profitability will take longer than we'd hoped,\" she said in the memo. \"That means we're still relying on borrowed cash to keep the airline running.\"",

      "\"After over one month into the collaboration, Hims & Hers Health, Inc. has failed to adhere to the law which prohibits mass sales of compounded drugs under the false guise of 'personalization' and are disseminating deceptive marketing that put patient safety at risk,\" a Novo Nordisk spokesperson told CBS MoneyWatch. \"This is unacceptable, and that is why we have decided to end the collaboration.\"",
      "The FDA approved Wegovy for adults with obesity in March 2024, adding it to an expanding market of weight-loss drugs that include Ozempic and Mounjaro. Demand for GLP-1 drugs, which are used to treat diabetes and weight loss, has surged in recent years, with one in eight U.S. adults saying they've used the treatments, according to health research publisher KFF.",

    "summary": "Real estate company Compass claims Zillow is illegally undermining competition by banning property listings if they don't appear on Zillow within 24 hours.",
    "story": [
      "Real estate giant Compass is suing Zillow, alleging that the online property website is violating antitrust laws with a new rule that bans home listings from its platform if they appear on any other service for more than 24 hours before being posted on Zillow.",
      "Zillow's rule, announced by the company in April, took effect on May 28, with the company saying that the new standard is necessary to ensure that listings are \"marketed to every buyer\" to give house-hunters \"fair access to listings without having to get access behind a velvet rope controlled by any one company.\"",
      "But Compass, which seeks to give some clients a competitive advantage by posting homes before they appear on Zillow and other sites, is alleging that what it calls the \"Zillow ban\" violates federal antitrust laws. The real estate company claims that ZIllow is leveraging its market dominance to impose the block on listings outside of its website, and that it is aimed at hobbling competition, according to the lawsuit.",
      "\"This lawsuit is about protecting consumer choice,\" Compass CEO Robert Reffkin said in a statement. \"No one company should have the power to ban agents or listings simply because they don't follow that company's business model.\"",
      "He added, \"That's not competition. It's coercion. Imagine if Amazon banned a seller for offering a product on their own website first. That's what Zillow is doing in real estate. Consumers should have the right to choose how they sell their homes.\"",
      "Compass said it has hired Ken Dintzer, a partner in the antitrust division of law firm Crowell & Moring who led the U.S. government's antitrust lawsuit against Google, to represent it in the lawsuit.",
      "In an emailed statement to CBS MoneyWatch, a Zillow spokesperson said Compass' claims \"are unfounded\" and that it will fight the lawsuit.",
      "The spokesperson added, \"At the heart of this issue is a simple principle: When a listing is publicly marketed, it should be accessible to all buyers \u2014 across all platforms, including Zillow. Hiding listings creates a fragmented market, limits consumer choice and creates barriers to homeownership, which is bad for buyers, sellers and the industry at large, especially in this inventory and affordability-constrained environment.\"",
      "Private exclusives",
      "With the lawsuit, Compass is defending its three-pronged marketing strategy for home listings that it says can better serve sellers. The first step in the strategy is a \"private exclusive\" listing that is available on Compass' internal platform, which allows its agents to share information about the home with possible buyers.",
      "The second step involves a \"coming soon\" listing on Compass's website, available to anyone who searches online for properties. The third element involves moving the listing to multiple listing services, or MLS, and onto aggregation sites like Zillow.",
      "\"For Zillow, every home buyer search conducted on Compass instead of Zillow is a lost opportunity for Zillow to lock that prospective home buyer into Zillow's ecosystem and make money selling her information to real estate agents for a lead fee \u2014 Zillow's central business model,\" the lawsuit claims.",
      "The complaint alleges that \"Zillow doesn't like the 3-phased marketing strategy because Zillow can't make money selling leads off listings in Phase 1 and Phase 2 where they don't have the listings.\"",
      "Compass, which has more than 33,000 real estate agents, said that almost half of all sellers who signed with them relied on its three-step listing strategy in the first quarter.",
      "\"In a free and competitive market, competitors' products and strategies should rise and fall on merit \u2014 not the whims of a monopolist gatekeeper like Zillow,\" Compass claims in the suit.",

      "Prior authorization requests can be time-consuming for doctors, resulting in frustrating delays for patients in obtaining essential medical care. According to a survey from the American Medical Association, physicians' offices spend an average of 12 hours per week seeking approval for services from insurers, administrative hurdles that critics say take time away from providing care.",
      "As part of the new agreement, participating insurers have committed to a series of steps they say will speed up the sluggish process. That includes creating a standardized system for submitting prior authorization online, reducing the amount of claims subject to prior authorization and ramping up real-time responses to requests. Such changes are scheduled to take effect in 2026 and 2027.",
      "\"The health care system remains fragmented and burdened by outdated manual processes, resulting in frustration for patients and providers alike,\" AHIP CEO Mike Tuffin said in a statement. \"Health plans are making voluntary commitments to deliver a more seamless patient experience and enable providers to focus on patient care, while also helping to modernize the system.\"",
      "Shawn Martin, CEO of the American Academy of Family Physicians, said in a statement that the insurance industry initiative is a \"step in the right direction,\" but that the real test will be the impact it has on the experiences of patients and physicians.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Some Senate Democrats cast doubt on the Trump administration's characterization of the strikes against Iran's nuclear facilities after top officials briefed senators Thursday.",
      "In recent days, President Trump repeatedly declared \"total obliteration\" after three nuclear sites were bombed in a secret attack by the U.S. Meanwhile, an initial classified assessment found that the strikes set back Tehran's nuclear program by a matter of months, while Mr. Trump said the nuclear program was set back \"basically decades.\"",
      "Democrats questioned assertions regarding how much Iran's nuclear program has been hindered.",
      "\"I walk away from that briefing still under the belief that we have not obliterated the program,\" Sen. Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat, told reporters. \"The president was deliberately misleading the public when he said the program was obliterated. It is certain that there is still significant capability, significant equipment that remain.\"",
      "\"You cannot bomb knowledge out of existence \u2014 no matter how many scientists you kill,\" Murphy added. \"There are still people in Iran who how to work centrifuges. And if they still have enriched uranium and they still have the ability to use centrifuges, then you're not setting back the program by years. You're setting back the program by months.\"",
      "Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, suggested that administration jumped to a conclusion too soon.",
      "\"Listen, I hope that is the final assessment,\" Warner said. \"But if not, does that end up providing a false sense of comfort to the American people?\"",
      "Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, said he did not receive adequate answers about whether the nuclear stockpile was obliterated.",
      "\"What was clear is that there was no coherent strategy, no end game, no plan, no specific, no detailed plan on how Iran does not attain a nuclear weapon,\" Schumer said.",
      "Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut said only a final battle damage assessment confirming the assertions \"would enable us to be comfortable or complacent about what has been done.\"",
      "\"The point is, we don't know. Anybody who says we know with certainty is making it up because we don't have a final battle damage assessment,\" he said. \"I think 'obliterated' is much too strong of word because it implies that it couldn't be reconstituted or somehow it was completely eliminated.\"",
      "Still, Blumenthal praised the military action as \"one that will go down in the annals of military history.\"",
      "\"Certainly, this mission was successful insofar as it extensively destroyed and perhaps severely damaged and set back the Iranian nuclear arms program. But how long and how much really remains to be determined by the intelligence community itself,\" he said.",
      "Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina stood behind the administration's characterization, but acknowledged that Iran's capabilities could eventually be restored.",
      "\"The real question is, have we obliterated their desire to have a nuclear weapon,\" Graham said after the classified briefing. \"I don't want people to think that the site wasn't severely damaged or obliterated. It was. But having said that, I don't want people to think the problem is over, because it's not.\"",
      "Graham said he believed the program had been set back by years. Republican Sen. Kevin Cramer of North Dakota said he was confident \"it's been set way back \u2014 a year, at minimum.\"",
      "Republican Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said the strikes \"effectively destroyed Iran's nuclear program.\" Cotton added that the initial assessment had several intelligence gaps and \"assumed the worst-case scenario with perfect conditions in Iran.\"",
      "Top intelligence officials said Wednesday that new intelligence showed the nuclear program had been \"severely damaged\" and its facilities \"destroyed.\" It would take the Iranians \"years\" to rebuild the facilities, CIA Director John Ratcliffe and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said.",
      "Ratcliffe was among those who briefed senators Thursday, along with Secretary of State and national security adviser Marco Rubio and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Dan Caine.",

    "published": "Thu, 26 Jun 2025 18:02:00 -0400",
    "summary": "It's the latest legal strategy for environmental groups as they try to claw back terminated grants.",
    "story": [
      "When Donald Trump won reelection, Jennifer Hadayia knew she'd need a good lawyer. As the executive director of Air Alliance Houston, an environmental nonprofit advocacy organization that works to reduce the risks of air pollution on public health, she had fought the first Trump administration in court already on a variety of issues.",
      "But when Lee Zeldin, the Environmental Protection Agency administrator, began terminating environmental justice grants awarded by the Biden-era EPA in January and announced \"the greatest day of deregulation\" in mid-March to dismantle dozens of environmental policies, Hadaiya was gobsmacked: \"We are in the very worst possible situation to couple regulatory rollbacks with funding decimation.\"",
      "Hadayia isn't the only one in this position. Zeldin's immediate termination of some $3 billion from the Environmental and Climate Justice block program impacted 350 environmental organizations, cities and tribes that all saw their grants evaporate without warning.",
      "Environmental justice grants are intended to help protect people from disproportionate exposure to industrial pollutants or environmental hazards and ensure everyone has access to a healthy living environment. For instance, lower-income communities that live near factories are often more exposed to pollutants that may damage their health.",
      "Rather than sue the agency on its own, as many others are currently doing, Air Alliance Houston will be trying a new legal tactic: joining a first-of-its-kind proposed\u00a0class action lawsuit against the EPA and Zeldin to restore funding.",
      "\"We're not in it just for us,\" Hadayia told CBS News, \"Communities across the country that were\u00a0 selected for these funds all have needs. The class action benefits the greater good.\"",
      "EPA cut funding to program that tracks permits for pollution",
      "Air Alliance Houston was awarded a $3.1-million \"community change grant\" by the Biden EPA in 2024 to expand a program it created to bring more transparency to the Texas state environmental permitting process. The program, called Air Mail, tracks permits for pollution and alerts communities in Harris County, Texas, when a company requests a permit, so people know what may be emitted into the air and water near their home. Hadayia planned to expand the program to 10 other counties in Texas.",
      "She was one of 2,700 applicants who applied for the award. In fact, it was the first time Hadayia had ever tried to win a federal grant for Air Alliance Houston, and she was thrilled to receive the government's support.",
      "\"We didn't want to have to rely on private philanthropy forever,\" she said.",
      "She filled out 20 pages of forms detailing requirements, compliance certification, underwent rigorous vetting and completed numerous checklists and reviews. In February, she said she seemed to lose consistent access to the grant money without warning, although at times, it would appear again in the nonprofit's accounts.",
      "\"Randomly with no notice, I would get access to the money again,\" Hadayia said.",
      "Between February and May, she checked her account twice a day, every day. On four occasions, she said she successfully accessed funds, withdrawing a total of $60,000 to reimburse eligible expenses before she finally received a termination letter on May 1.",
      "The EPA did not respond to questions about why it terminated the grants.",
      "\"We believe that our contract was illegally terminated. There was nothing in our terms and conditions that allows an administration \u2014 Trump or otherwise \u2014 to cancel a federal contract because they don't like what the contract is about,\" Hadayia told CBS News. \"There was no noncompliance. There was no fraud, waste and abuse. We were selected rigorously and\u00a0 appropriately. We met all of the requirements. We were doing everything right.\"",
      "The new legal strategy for environmental groups",
      "Air Alliance Houston is one of 23 plaintiffs in the suit, and together, they are hoping the court will grant their request to certify and move forward as a class action. The other plaintiffs include environmental organizations, as well as local city governments, like Kalamazoo County, Michigan, and federally recognized tribes such as the Native Village of Kipnuk in Alaska.",
      "Like Air Alliance Houston, all of the plaintiffs were awarded grants of various amounts through the Environmental and Climate Justice Program, which was funded with $3 billion from the Inflation Reduction Act. The purpose of the grants is to address the climate crisis and various environmental harms at the local level.",
      "The grants were awarded to groups in rural and urban communities throughout the United States for a variety of initiatives including air quality monitoring, tree planting in urban heat areas, lead pipes replacement to improve community drinking water systems and resilience projects to bolster communities against intensifying extreme weather.",
      "CBS News contacted the EPA about the lawsuit, but the agency responded in an email saying it does not comment on current or pending litigation.",
      "Suing the Trump administration has become a full-time job for many environmental organizations affected by its funding cuts. Major groups like the Environmental Defense Fund, or the Natural Resources Defense Council, which employs hundreds of people and generate roughly $200 million in annual revenue, can sustain prolonged legal challenges to the federal government. Since 2025, the NRDC has been involved in 11 cases against the Trump administration.",
      "The nonprofits say that utilizing the court system is the only check on power they can lean on, and to date, the Trump administration has not prevailed in any of the environmental lawsuits filed. It is currently appealing the rulings, many of which would restore funding to environmental groups.",
      "Some nonprofits have been successful in getting their funding restarted, even during the appeals process. But not all nongovernmental organizations have the resources for a sustained legal battle.",
      "Air Alliance Houston is a small group that employs just 13 people, Hadaiya included, and it often spends more money than it makes. In 2023, according to available tax records, it generated $2.5 million in revenue, but had more than $2.7 million in expenses.",
      "The class action lawsuit would make it possible for Air Alliance Houston and smaller nonprofits to win broad relief, rather than piecemeal outcomes, and to pool their resources for what may be a long legal fight against the Trump EPA.",
      "Jillian Blanchard, a vice president at the Climate Change and Environmental Justice program at Lawyers for Good Government, called the termination of the EPA grants \"unconstitutional\" and said in a statement it was \"not only destabilizing local projects addressing pollution, public health, and climate resilience,\" but also violates \"core principles of administrative law and the separation of powers.\"",
      "Her group joined EarthJustice, the Southern Environmental Law Center and the Public Rights Project to file the case on behalf of the plaintiffs.",
      "Blanchard told CBS News she's never seen a class action lawsuit filed against the federal government over environmental funding issues. By bringing the class action case, the hope is to provide relief to the full class of eligible recipients, rather than forcing individual groups to seek pro bono legal assistance or spend their own limited budgets navigating their case through the court system.",
      "Hadayia considers herself fortunate, since she hasn't needed to furlough staff after her funds were cut. But she hopes the lawsuit can reinstate the grant, so she can finish the work. She wants the same for the other 349 eligible class members of the suit, who also spent significant time applying for awards to support communities that are struggling to address environmental pollution and climate change impacts.",
      "\"It is the one-two punch of this administration to 'unleash American energy' by taking all of the\u00a0 roadblocks away,\" said Hadayia. \"And at the same time, pulling out the resources from groups like mine whose mission is to advocate for the opposite, whose mission is to be the watchdog for those industries.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump called the legislation the \"ultimate codification of our agenda\" to \"make America great again.\"",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The White House made a push for the centerpiece legislation of President Trump's second term, hosting a \"One, Big, Beautiful Event\" on Thursday highlighting the bill amid intraparty disagreements and roadblocks in the Senate as lawmakers near a Fourth of July deadline.",
      "After the House narrowly approved the legislation that addresses the president's tax, defense, border and energy priorities last month, Senate GOP leaders are working to pass the bill in the upper chamber. The bill would then be sent back to the House to approve the changes before it can reach Mr. Trump's desk for his signature. But the\u00a0self-imposed July 4 deadline looms large over the effort, with key disagreements remaining.",
      "With an array of working-class Americans standing behind him, from farmers to electrical workers, the president claimed the bill would lower Americans' tax burdens, make permanent his first administration's tax cuts and eliminate taxes on tips.",
      "\"This is the ultimate codification of our agenda to \u2014 very simply, a phrase that's been used pretty well by me over the past 10 years, but maybe even before that \u2014 make America great again,\" Mr. Trump said in the White House East Room.",
      "He also called the legislation the \"single-most important piece of border legislation ever to cross the floor of Congress,\" pointing to the bill's pledge to hire thousands of new border patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. The president reiterated his administration's goal of deporting at least 1 million undocumented immigrants every year.",
      "It was Tom Homan, Mr. Trump's border czar, who had the strongest words for Congress at the White House, saying he's tired of meeting parents whose children have been killed by someone in the country illegally, or parents whose children have been killed by drugs brought into the country.",
      "\"What the hell is the matter with everybody up in Congress? People are dying every day. \u2026 Pass the bill so we can make this country safe.\"",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt met with House Republicans on the conservative Republican Study Committee on Wednesday and told reporters that the administration is working to \"make sure everyone understands this bill needs to be back on the president's desk by July 4.\"",
      "\"The White House and the president have been consistently engaged in this process since the very beginning, both on the House side and on the Senate side,\" Leavitt said, adding that Mr. Trump \"is always willing to make calls, and we're going to get this bill done.\"",
      "But as the deadline approaches, Republicans in Congress have squabbled over key provisions in the legislation, like Medicaid restrictions used to pay for the bill's new spending.",
      "Shortly before the president's afternoon event, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said he's asking Congress to remove a tax provision that targets dividends, royalties, interest and business profits earned by individuals and institutions abroad. Complying with Bessent's request would make the legislation more expensive.",
      "Senate Republicans have proposed steeper cuts to Medicaid funding in part by lowering provider taxes \u2014 which states use to help fund their share of Medicaid costs \u2014 from 6% to 3.5% by 2031. The House sought to lower federal costs by freezing states' provider taxes at current rates and prohibiting them from establishing new provider taxes. The Senate's move has sparked pushback, and threatened to complicate the delicate balance reached in the House.",
      "Then on Thursday morning, Senate Democrats on the Budget Committee announced that the provider tax plan was among a handful of key provisions that the Senate's rulekeeper had determined would violate what's known as the Byrd Rule, which requires that the legislation only include provisions that have a direct impact on federal spending.",
      "The parliamentarian's rulings",
      "Senate parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough has been examining the legislation to determine whether any provisions violate Senate rules. Any that are in violation are subject to a 60-vote threshold, rather than the simple majority required under the reconciliation process.",
      "Senate Democrats said the parliamentarian also weighed in on a measure cutting federal funds to states that use Medicaid infrastructure to provide health care coverage to undocumented immigrants, along with banning Medicaid from covering gender transition services.",
      "The announcement on the rulings came days after the parliamentarian determined that Republicans can't include language that would make it harder to challenge the government's actions in court, along with a section barring immigrants who are not citizens or lawful permanent residents from receiving food assistance benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.",
      "The parliamentarian also rejected a proposal that would have sold off millions of acres of public lands. She struck provisions regarding the sale of electric vehicles used by the U.S. Postal Service and several immigration-related measures, including limiting certain funding for \"sanctuary cities\" and allowing states to conduct border security and immigration enforcement.",
      "Senate Republicans are working to bring some of the measures into compliance with the parliamentarian's rulings; her deliberations on other parts of the legislation are ongoing.",
      "GOP Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana called the parliamentarian's decision on the provider tax a \"setback,\" adding that Senate Republicans would decide whether to rewrite the details of the provision to comply with the Byrd Rule \u2014 or move forward without the provider tax.",
      "The move sparked pushback among some congressional Republicans. Rep. Greg Steube, a Florida Republican, said Vice President JD Vance, the president of the Senate, should overrule the parliamentarian. And GOP Sen. Tommy Tuberville of Alabama said she should be fired.",
      "Sen. Rick Scott, a Florida Republican, told reporters Thursday that the parliamentarian's ruling was \"pretty frustrating.\" But he said he's \"optimistic that we can come up with ways to make sure we fulfill the Trump agenda and also have fiscal sanity.\" And Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, said he expected the conference would try to retool the provision. Although he doesn't agree with the ruling, Graham said he has \"no intention of overruling her.\"",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune, who was asked about the possibility of overruling the parliamentarian earlier this month, said \"we're not going there.\"",
      "But Thune faced difficulties even before the rulekeeper's decisions, as he worked to keep his conference together on the massive legislation. On Wednesday, he told reporters, \"We're working with all of our members to try to get people comfortable with the bill.\"",
      "With a 53-seat majority, Senate GOP leaders can afford to lose just three Republicans on the bill, with all Democrats expected to oppose.",
      "Thune said earlier in the week that \"when push comes to shove, you're looking at whether or not you're going to allow the perfect to become the enemy of the good.\"",
      "\"You have to recognize that this is a process whereby everybody doesn't get everything they want,\" Thune said. \"But I think we've produced a bill working with the House, working with the White House, that will get the requisite number of Republican senators to vote for it so that we can pass it.\"",

      "\"We don't have anything scheduled as of now,\" Leavitt told reporters during Thursday's press briefing, adding that she spoke with Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff on Thursday morning and the administration continues to be in \"close communication\" with the Iranians and intermediaries such as the Qataris.",
      "\"We are in touch, and if there is a meeting, we will let you know, as we always do,\" Leavitt said.",
      "Witkoff said earlier this week that his interactions with the Iranians had been \"promising\" and that the U.S. was \"hopeful that we can have a long-term peace agreement that resurrects Iran.\"",
      "The president floated talks during a Wednesday news conference at the NATO summit in The Hague, Netherlands, where he touted the success of a weekend Pentagon operation targeting Iranian nuclear sites.",
      "\"We're going to talk to them next week, with Iran,\" the president told reporters Wednesday. \"We may sign an agreement, I don't know. ... If we got a document it wouldn't be bad. We're going to meet with them, actually. We're going to meet with them.\"",
      "The president at the time didn't specify who would be involved in such a meeting or where it would take place, and the White House didn't offer further details. On Thursday, Leavitt explained the basic goal of any future meetings.",
      "\"We want to ensure we can get to a place where Iran agrees to a non-enrichment, civil nuclear program,\" Leavitt said. \"And there are many other requests that the United States has.\"",
      "The Trump administration is considering a range of options to entice Iran back to the negotiating table, a source familiar with the planning told CBS News.",
      "Options include helping Iran to access $20 billion to $30 billion, so it can build a civilian, non-enrichment, energy-producing nuclear program, the source said. The funds would come not from the U.S., but from U.S. allies in the Middle East.",
      "Sanctions relief is also under discussion \u2014 provided that Iran commits to zero enrichment of uranium. Another possibility is allowing Iranian authorities to access the $6 billion currently sitting in restricted foreign bank accounts. Administration officials have even considered encouraging Middle Eastern partners to pay for Iran to rebuild the Fordo nuclear facility as a non-enrichment operation. CNN first reported the potential options.",
      "The Pentagon held a news conference Thursday morning defending the success of the strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities over the weekend, and administration officials were set to brief lawmakers on Capitol Hill on Thursday afternoon.",
      "The U.S. has been pushing for a direct meeting with Iran since the strikes, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio telling \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday that \"we have bent over backwards to create a deal with these people.\"",

      "Rep. Kat Cammack said late Wednesday her offices were evacuated due to \"imminent death threats\" against her and her family.",
      "The Florida Republican said on X the threats began after a recent Wall Street Journal story about her experience with an ectopic pregnancy last year. She told the paper that emergency room doctors were hesitant to treat the life-threatening complication because they were worried about running afoul of Florida's strict six-week abortion ban \u2014 an incident she blamed on \"fearmongering\" by opponents of the state law.",
      "\"Since then, we've [received] thousands of hate-filled messages and dozens of credible threats from pro-abortion activists, which law enforcement is actively investigating,\" Cammack wrote in her post, which also included screenshots of several social media comments.",
      "Cammack added on X, \"To those spreading misinformation: I did not vote for Florida's heartbeat law; I serve in the U.S. House of Representatives, not the Florida Legislature.\"",
      "Cammack said in a statement to CBS News that her district offices were evacuated due to death threats.",
      "\"This is the unacceptable reality we're facing: sharing a personal health story in an effort to improve healthcare for women and their children can lead to threats, harassment, and evacuation orders,\" her statement read.",
      "the U.S. Capitol Police told CBS News in a statement it has a \"zero-tolerance policy for threats against the Members of Congress. Our Tampa field office, which was set up to quickly respond to threats in the region, immediately started coordinating with local and federal agencies in the area. We appreciate their partnership as we continue to investigate this case. For safety reasons, we cannot discuss the specifics about our investigations.\"",
      "Concerns about medical treatment for pregnancy complications \u2014 including ectopic pregnancies \u2014 have spiked since 2022, when the reversal of Roe v. Wade led dozens of states to ban or heavily restrict abortion.",
      "State-level abortion bans generally allow for exceptions when a mother's life is at risk. And officials in Florida and other states say terminating an ectopic pregnancy \u2014 a condition in which an embryo implants outside the uterus \u2014 is not considered an abortion. But critics argue confusion about those exceptions has put patients at risk, as medical providers may be wary of taking action that could later be found to violate their state's abortion ban.",
      "Florida state regulators issued a\u00a0notice\u00a0last year that said \"abortion is permissible at any stage of pregnancy in Florida to save the life and health of the mother,\" including for women with ectopic pregnancies. The state called claims to the contrary \"misinformation.\"",
      "Meanwhile, threats against members of Congress, judges, prosecutors and other public officials have grown in recent years, federal law enforcement agencies say. The Capitol Police said it investigated 9,474 \"concerning statements and direct threats\" last year against lawmakers, their families and their staff.",

      "General Dan Caine, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on Thursday released video of the tests of the type of \"bunker-buster\" bombs that were dropped on Iranian nuclear facilities over the weekend as he and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth sought to illustrate the severity of the strikes amid the leak of an initial intelligence report.",
      "Caine showed the video of a massive bomb striking an underground target at the joint press conference with Hegseth, saying it was the \"culmination of over 15 years of development and testing.\"",
      "But Hegseth and Caine provided few new details about the impact of the strikes during the news conference.\u00a0 For his part, Hegseth devoted much of his remarks to the media, slamming its coverage of a leaked Defense Intelligence Agency report that said an initial assessment suggested the strikes had only set back Iran's nuclear program by months.",
      "The Defense Intelligence Agency's initial assessment, according to a senior DIA official, was considered to be a \"preliminary, low confidence assessment.\"",
      "\"This report acknowledges it's likely severe damage,\" Hegseth said. \"Again, this is preliminary, leaked \u2014 because someone had an agenda to try to muddy the waters and make it look like this historic strike wasn't successful.\" But while Hegseth disputed the significance of the report's conclusions, he did not deny that the leaked assessment was authentic.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Thursday rejected Planned Parenthood's challenge to South Carolina's attempt to bar the organization from participating in its Medicaid program, clearing the way for the state to strip the organization of Medicaid funds.",
      "The Supreme Court ruled 6-3 in the case of Medina v. Planned Parenthood South Atlantic to find that Planned Parenthood and a patient cannot sue the state of South Carolina under federal civil rights law to enforce a provision of the Medicaid Act that aims to ensure a beneficiary can obtain medical care from the provider of their choosing. Justice Neil Gorsuch delivered the opinion for the court. The three liberal justices, Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson, were in dissent.",
      "The court's conservative majority reversed a decision from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit that allowed Planned Parenthood's lawsuit against state officials to move forward and prevented South Carolina from excluding the organization from its Medicaid program.",
      "The ruling is likely to pave the way for more states to exclude Planned Parenthood from their Medicaid programs, a move that anti-abortion rights have been pushing for several years.",
      "\"[T]he decision whether to let private plaintiffs enforce a new statutory right poses delicate questions of public policy. New rights for some mean new duties for others. And private enforcement actions, meritorious or not, can force governments to direct money away from public services and spend it instead on litigation,\" Gorsuch wrote. \"The job of resolving how best to weigh those competing costs and benefits belongs to the people's elected representatives, not unelected judges charged with applying the law as they find it.\"",
      "In a dissent joined by Sotomayor and Kagan, Jackson accused the court's majority of weakening landmark civil rights protections that Congress enacted after the Civil War, which allow citizen to seek redress in federal court for alleged deprivation of their rights.",
      "\"[T]oday's decision is likely to result in tangible harm to real people,\" Jackson wrote. \"At a minimum, it will deprive Medicaid recipients in South Carolina of their only meaningful way of enforcing a right that Congress has expressly granted to them. And, more concretely, it will strip those South Carolinians \u2014 and countless other Medicaid recipients around the country \u2014 of a deeply personal freedom: the 'ability to decide who treats us at our most vulnerable.' The court today disregards Congress's express desire to prevent that very outcome.\"",
      "The White House applauded the Supreme Court's decision, with spokesman Harrison Fields calling it a \"major victory for common sense\" that \"underscores the president's longstanding position that abortion policies should be determined by the states and that taxpayers should never be responsible for funding elective abortions.\"",
      "Medina v. Planned Parenthood South Atlantic",
      "The question before the court was a narrow one, involving whether a Medicaid beneficiary could sue to enforce their ability to seek care from the qualified and willing provider of their choosing, known as the any-qualified-provider requirement.",
      "The legal wrangling over South Carolina's attempt to stop public dollars from going to a Planned Parenthood affiliate in the state began in 2018, four years before the Supreme Court overturned Roe. v. Wade.",
      "In South Carolina, abortion is banned after six weeks gestation, and Planned Parenthood provides abortion services outside of Medicaid only as allowed under state law. Additionally, federal law bars Medicaid from paying for abortions except in cases of rape or incest, or to save the life of the mother.",
      "But seven years ago, South Carolina's Republican governor, Henry McMaster, issued an executive order that directed the state's health department to deem abortion providers unqualified to provide family-planning services under Medicaid and terminate their enrollment agreements.",
      "In response, the South Carolina Department of Health and Human Services notified Planned Parenthood South Atlantic that its provider agreements were being cancelled because it was no longer qualified to provide medical services to Medicaid beneficiaries. The affiliate has clinics in Charleston and Columbia, and offers prenatal and postpartum services, along with physical exams and screenings for cancer and other health conditions.",
      "In the wake of the state's decision to boot Planned Parenthood from its Medicaid program, Julie Edwards, a patient who received medical services from the organization, and Planned Parenthood filed a lawsuit under federal civil rights law to challenge the move.",
      "Edwards argued that South Carolina's termination of Planned Parenthood's agreement violated her right to choose her provider under the Medicaid Act.",
      "A federal district judge ruled in favor of Planned Parenthood, finding that South Carolina likely violated the any-qualified-provider provision when it excluded Planned Parenthood from its Medicaid program. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit ultimately allowed the suit to proceed and prevented South Carolina from keeping Planned Parenthood out of its Medicaid program.",
      "The dispute before the Supreme Court did not involve abortion, but it came to the high court amid a push by several Republican-led states to block Planned Parenthood from receiving Medicaid funds.",
      "Paige Johnson, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood South Atlantic, criticized the ruling but said the clinic will continue to offering care in South Carolina, including to Medicaid beneficiaries.",
      "\"Today's decision is a grave injustice that strikes at the very bedrock of American freedom and promises to send South Carolina deeper into a health care crisis,\" she said in a statement. \"Twice, justices of this Court denied to even hear this case because Gov. McMaster's intent is clear: weaponize anti-abortion sentiment to deprive communities with low incomes of basic health care.\"",
      "Alexis McGill Johnson, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, warned that attacks on the organization will likely continue and put at risk patients' access to health care services.",
      "\"Today, the Supreme Court once again sided with politicians who believe they know better than you, who want to block you from seeing your trusted health care provider and making your own health care decisions,\" she said in a statement. \"And the consequences are not theoretical in South Carolina or other states with hostile legislatures. Patients need access to birth control, cancer screenings, STI testing and treatment, and more. And right now, lawmakers in Congress are trying to 'defund' Planned Parenthood as part of their long-term goal to shut down Planned Parenthood and ban abortion nationwide.\"",

The Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning research organization, estimates that the Senate's version could cause as many as 380,000 more people to lose coverage.",
      "According to the CBO, the work-requirement provision represents the largest cut to Medicaid in the House bill \u2014 about $300 billion over a decade, reflecting the savings from no longer covering millions of current enrollees.",

We spend a lot of time online, on social media, and we lose that human-to-human interaction,\" Carlton said. \"We're asking folks to engage in their communities. That's a fundamentally good thing to do that's part of getting benefits.\"",
      "Under the GOP proposal, people would have to meet the new work requirements when they initially sign up for Medicaid, then report their work or exemption status at least every six months \u2014 and potentially as frequently as every month.",
      "\"This is not a conversation America should be in,\" said Leslie Dach, founder and chair of Protect Our Care, an advocacy group that supports the Affordable Care Act. \"Think of real life. People are seasonal workers, or they work in retail, and it goes out of business or hours change. If you miss one month, you're kicked off.\"",
      "The GOP legislation lists disability as an exemption, along with circumstances such as being incarcerated or being the parent of a dependent child. (The Senate bill, released on June 16, would exempt only the parents of children 14 and under.)",
      "But even existing state and federal programs serving those with disabilities have different standards for determining eligibility.",
      "Kevin Corinth, a senior fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said states may face challenges because many Medicaid enrollees with disabilities do not get Social Security Disability Insurance.",
      "The federal government provides what's called Supplemental Security Income to those who meet certain thresholds for being low-income and disabled, and states are required to enroll SSI recipients in Medicaid.",
      "But about two-thirds of adult enrollees who are under age 65 and disabled \u2014 that is, have difficulties with vision, hearing, mobility, or cognitive function, or in other areas \u2014 do not receive SSI, according to KFF.",
      "\"It's hard to know where to draw the line on who is disabled enough\" to be exempt from the work requirement, Corinth said. \"Some people will fall through the cracks, and states will have to do the best job they can.\"",
      "He said states will be expected to rely on government databases, such as those maintained by their labor departments, to determine whether enrollees are working. But proving a disability could be more taxing for enrollees themselves, he said.",
      "Two states that previously tried enacting Medicaid work requirements created strict rules for people with disabilities to get an exemption.",
      "In Arkansas, the Medicaid work requirement had a 10-step online exemption process for individuals who were not automatically exempted by the state.",
      "Consequently, although 30% of people subject to the requirement reported one or more serious health limitations, only 11% obtained a long-term exemption, according to the National Health Law Program.",
      "Medicaid enrollees in Arkansas described a poorly functioning web-based reporting portal, inadequate outreach, and widespread confusion, according to focus-group interviews conducted by KFF.",
      "Georgia's Medicaid work requirement also has presented challenges for people seeking an exemption based on a disability. They must request a \"modification\" from the state on its online portal, then wait for a phone call from the state to set up an interview to review the application. Then they must enroll in the state's job-training program before being allowed to sign up for Medicaid, according to the National Health Law Program.",
      "Georgia has not disclosed how many people have applied for an exemption because of a disability or how many were approved.",
      "Over 1 in 5 Medicaid enrollees have a disability, including 22% of those ages 19 to 49 and 43% of those 50 to 64, according to KFF.",
      "Michael Karpman, principal research associate for the Urban Institute, said his group's findings \u2014 that only a small fraction of Medicaid enrollees are unemployed because they aren't interested in a job \u2014 explain why work-requirement programs in Arkansas and Georgia had no significant effect on employment even as they increased the number of uninsured adults.",
      "\"Many people fall off the Medicaid rolls due to red-tape reasons,\" he said, noting challenges requesting exemptions or reporting work. \"People struggle with the documentation process.\"",
      "Karpman said many people rely on Medicaid when they lose jobs that provide health coverage. The GOP work requirement, though, would deny them coverage while they're seeking new jobs.",
      "Chris Bryant, a Medicaid enrollee in Lexington, Kentucky, has a bleeding disorder and lives in government housing on $1,100 per month in federal disability payments. He said adding a work requirement to Medicaid will only add barriers for people whose health issues prevent them from working. \"It will be messy,\" he said.",
      "Bryant, 39, said he knows people on Medicaid who could work but don't, though he surmises it's a small portion of the population. \"People are on Medicaid because they have to have it and have no other option.\"",

    "story": [
      "The State Department may begin laying off hundreds of Washington, D.C.,-based employees as soon as this Friday, according to internal correspondence among staff that was shared with CBS News, amid an effort by Secretary of State Marco Rubio to streamline what he has called a \"bloated\" bureaucracy.",
      "The precise timing of the cuts could be affected by a looming decision by the Supreme Court which could soon hand down a ruling on whether to leave in place a lower court's order that temporarily paused government-wide layoffs. The Justice Department asked the high court earlier this month to lift the district court's injunction and allow it to move forward with the administration's plans for reductions in force, or layoffs.",
      "In a statement issued Wednesday, the president of the American Foreign Service Association, which represents American foreign service officers, said the association \"urgently calls on the Department of State to comply with a federal court order that prohibits federal agencies from executing mass layoffs while litigation is ongoing.\"",
      "\"Sources inside the department tell us that layoffs will be announced as soon as the end of this week or early next week,\" AFSA President Tom Yazdgerdi said. \"Unless the Supreme Court intervenes, the department is legally barred from taking any action outlined in its reorganization plans.\"",
      "But a senior State Department official told CBS News, \"AFSA's statement is false, and the Department has no plans to violate a court order.\"",
      "Multiple sources shared internal correspondence between State Department staffers that described the potential impending cuts. Some sent screen shots of what employees had been told by the department.",
      "Some of the internal notes circulated within State Department ranks said that the notices of reduction in force \u2014 or RIF \u2014 could impact over 2,000 staffers, including 700 D.C.-based foreign service officers, and could begin Friday, likely in the morning.",
      "The same internal notes said large conference rooms inside the department's Washington headquarters have been reserved for Friday morning \"with no reason given,\" but with the expectation that they would be used to process the terminated staffers.",
      "A notice circulated Wednesday in the department's Bureau of Overseas Building Operations \u2014 which manages the department's overseas diplomatic property \u2014 contained instructions on how to process terminated employees. The email, which was reviewed by CBS News, has a checklist \u2014 one item directed departing employees to turn in their badges and IT equipment issued by the State Department.",
      "The State Department aims to reduce its domestic workforce by up to 3,448 personnel \u2014 according to a more than 130-page notification it had submitted to Congress last month that affected around 18% of its existing staff.",
      "The notification included a deadline of July 1, 2025, for the reductions.",
      "Rubio first announced in April that the department, which he described as \"bloated\" and \"bureaucratic,\" would undergo \"comprehensive reorganization.\"",
      "An AFSA official also noted that the department had made unilateral changes to the Foreign Affairs Manual \u2014 which the State Department describes as the \"single, comprehensive, and authoritative source for the Department's organization structures, policies, and procedures\" \u2014 without the association's agreement.",
      "\"While the Secretary of State holds legal authority to implement RIFs, long-standing procedures were based on a transparent, merit-based process that ranked employees globally. The department's recent changes bypass these norms, penalizing employees based solely on their current domestic assignments,\" the AFSA statement reads.",

    "story": [
      "Los Angeles \u2014 Outside the federal Metropolitan Detention Center in downtown Los Angeles, a 26-year-old man stood waiting, hoping to deliver blood pressure medicine to his father, who was detained last Thursday by federal immigration officials.",
      "The man, who asked that CBS News not use his name, said his father, Rafael Hurtado, needs to take the medication daily to control his blood pressure. The staff turned Hurtado's son away, but asked him to leave the pills behind.",
      "\"My dad told me it's horrible inside and they've kept him standing,\" he said, adding his father managed to make his first phone call on Sunday. \"They're not feeding him and there are no blankets inside.\"",
      "Hurtado was taken into custody while he was working \u2014 picking up trash. His son says he doesn't have a criminal record or a removal order.",
      "Hurtado is a Mexican national and a father of three children, all U.S. citizens, including one with special medical needs.",
      "\"My dad suffers from high blood pressure and we haven't heard from him since Sunday,\" Hurtado's son said. \"I only had a few seconds to speak with him on the phone before the call was cut off so I've been coming every day to see if I can get any news of him.\"",
      "Longtime food vendor and community activist Emma De Paz, 58, is also being held here. She was detained last week when federal officers conducted an operation at a Home Depot in Hollywood where De Paz was selling carne asada. According to her family, De Paz was recently diagnosed with Hepatitis B and needs daily medication to treat her high blood pressure. She was transferred to White Memorial Hospital during her detention to undergo care.",
      "\"My sister called us to say they're treating them really bad,\" said Carlos Barrera De Paz during a Wednesday press conference outside of the Guatemalan consulate in Los Angeles. \"They are in a cold room, no food, they're given a pack of cookies and a juice per day.\"",
      "De Paz added his sister claims agents are pressuring her to sign deportation paperwork and has had to sleep in a chair.",
      "Immigration lawyers in L.A. tell CBS News, they've been receiving more and more calls about medical needs that aren't being addressed at the Metropolitan Detention Center. One lawyer, who chose not to identify herself because she has clients inside the detention center, said there are reports of \"inhumane\" conditions \u2014 food shortages, cramped confinement, freezing temperatures and environments that are a \"ticking-time bomb.\"",
      "\"There is limited and very erratic access to food,\" Kristen Hunsberger, an attorney with the Immigrant Defenders Law Center, told CBS News during a phone interview. \"I spoke with one individual detained in downtown Los Angeles who reported being woken up at 2 a.m. or 4 a.m., was given food, and they wouldn't have their next meal until 14 hours later.\"",
      "Hunsberger described similar conditions at the Immigration and Customs Enforcement processing center in Adelanto, California, where some migrants detained in the latest rounds of raids have been transferred.",
      "Hunsberger says her clients have been denied access to medication, some have been kept in temporary holding areas with no air circulation and have at times been left without communication because of the lack of working phones.",
      "\"I would describe it as very chaotic \u2014 it's really an emerging crisis,\" Hunsberger said. \"I'm concerned that if left unaddressed, that we will start hearing about, God forbid, people start dying or having health crises in these detention centers because of the delay in access or just complete denial of access.\"",
      "Government data obtained by CBS News reveals ICE is holding around 59,000 detainees in facilities across the country. On Monday, ICE detention levels reached over 140% capacity, since Congress last allocated 41,500 detainee beds for the agency.",
      "In a statement earlier this week, ICE said its effort to target a \"massive backlog of illegal criminal aliens and public safety threats from the United States\" has led to \"a significant number of arrests, requiring greater detention capacity.\"",
      "\"ICE is implementing various options to meet its current and future detention needs, but more space for apprehended illegal aliens is needed as they await deportation,\" ICE added, noting the \"One Big Beautiful Bill\" backed by the president would fund 100,000 more detention beds.",
      "Immigration lawyers also say that as the Trump administration ramps up its deportation efforts, a lack of due process is widespread across the L.A. area, in particular because of the lack of phone access inside detention centers.",
      "On Tuesday, CBS News spoke with a family of four that was deported to Peru last week. The Peruvian family was scheduled for a court hearing on June 25 for their asylum case, but received a notification from ICE to attend a check-in appointment on June 5 instead. It was during that check-in that Ever Cardenas said he was detained at the Metropolitan Detention Center for over 12 hours, along with his wife and two daughters, ages 9 and 14, and forced to sign their deportation paperwork.",
      "\"I told them we had rights and didn't have to sign anything,\" Cardenas told CBS News in Spanish during a phone interview from Peru. \"I begged them for hours to let me call a lawyer, but they refused to let us use a phone. Eventually we were left with no options and signed.\"",
      "According to Cardenas, his family was transferred out of the downtown facility to a nearby hotel and placed in a room with other families overnight. The family was eventually put on a flight, transferred to Texas and has since been deported to Peru.",
      "\"I just wanted to talk to a lawyer,\" Cardenas said. \"I kept telling agents that my daughter was going to miss her middle school graduation the following day, but that didn't matter.\"",
      "CBS News has reached out to the Department of Homeland Security and ICE with questions about current conditions and whether detention facilities in Los Angeles are over capacity.",
      "Earlier this month, some members of Congress attempted to visit the Metropolitan Detention Center to conduct oversight of the facility, but they were denied access. Until recently, they were allowed by law to enter any DHS facility \"used to detain or otherwise house aliens\" for inspection purposes, and no prior notice was necessary.",
      "But DHS issued new guidance last week for lawmakers visiting ICE facilities, requiring 72-hour notice and blocking U.S. lawmakers from visiting field offices, such as the facilities in downtown L.A. As of Wednesday, however, that memo has been removed from ICE's website.",
      "According to Democratic Rep. Jimmy Gomez of California, he has been denied entry to the downtown facility three times despite representing that area of L.A..",
      "\"DHS has illegally blocked me from entering this facility three times\u2014even though I'm authorized under federal law to conduct oversight. Also egregious is that they've already cancelled a scheduled inspection,\" Gomez told CBS News in a statement Wednesday evening. \"Now they're telling my office I need a week's notice, which sounds more like they're giving themselves time to hide any signs of abuse or move the detainees altogether. If these reports aren't true, then let us in. But this administration continues to operate outside the bounds of the law. That's why I'm going to keep fighting to conduct oversight and hold them accountable.\"",

Under the ban, only U.S. citizens can apply to sponsor relatives from Cuba, not green card holders like Llanes.",

      "CIA Director John Ratcliffe said in a statement Wednesday that \"a body of credible intelligence indicates Iran's Nuclear Program has been severely damaged by the recent, targeted strikes.\"",
      "\"This includes new intelligence from a historically reliable and accurate source/method that several key Iranian nuclear facilities were destroyed and would have to be rebuilt over the course of years,\" Ratcliffe's statement said.",

      "Neither of the statements directly addressed some of the questions raised by lawmakers and nonproliferation experts in the aftermath of the strikes about what kinds of residual nuclear capabilities Iran may have retained.",
      "There are also conflicting views about whether Iranian officials had managed to transport enriched uranium away from the sites before they were bombed. The DIA assessment indicated at least some of the enriched uranium had been moved, according to one source familiar with it.",

Witkoff has spoken with the Iranian foreign minister, and recently, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Vice President JD Vance have also become more involved in the diplomacy, a U.S. and regional diplomat told CBS News.",
      "Both Ratcliffe and Gabbard were slated to participate in a classified Senate briefing on Tuesday on the U.S. strikes in Iran, but the session was cancelled and rescheduled for Thursday. The House is expected to be briefed on Friday. It is unclear whether both leaders will still participate in both briefings.",
      "Ratcliffe and Gabbard's statements on Wednesday also included criticism of the leak to media outlets of the DIA assessment, which a spokesperson for that agency later said was issued with low confidence and would be refined as additional intelligence becomes available.",
      "The initial DIA report said the entrances to two Iranian nuclear sites \u2014 including the Fordo facility \u2014 were sealed off in the strikes, but that Iran could reconstitute elements of its program once it dug out and made repairs to water and electrical systems, according to sources familiar with it.",
      "The assessment also provided a range of possibilities for how long it could take for Iran to regain access to the underground facilities and resume some operations, ranging from a few months to less than a year, one source familiar with the assessment told CBS News.",
      "Administration officials have blasted those findings, which are at odds with Mr. Trump's repeated assertions that Saturday night's airstrikes \"obliterated\" Iran's nuclear facilities.",
      "Speaking from the NATO summit, Mr. Trump said the airstrikes set back Iran's program by \"basically decades.\"",
      "\"They said it could be limited or it could be very severe. They really didn't know,\" Mr. Trump said of the U.S. intelligence assessments.",

If we got a document, it wouldn't be bad.\"",
      "The president met with other world leaders on the sidelines of the summit, amid cautious optimism about the ceasefire the Trump administration brokered. The 12-day conflict left 28 people dead in Israel and hundreds in Iran.",
      "\"It was a 12-day war. And we think it's over,\" Mr. Trump said during the press conference. \"I don't think they're going to be going back at each other, I don't think so.\"",
      "\"Because I dealt with both, and they're both tired, exhausted,\" Mr. Trump said. \"They fought very, very hard and very viciously, very violently, and they were both satisfied to go home and get out. And can it start again? I guess some day it can, it could maybe start soon.\"",
      "At the summit, Mr. Trump said Iran's enrichment efforts were set back \"basically decades.\" The U.S.\u00a0strikes\u00a0on Iranian nuclear facilities were \"very, very successful. It's called 'obliteration,'\" he said at the news conference.\u00a0An initial classified assessment\u00a0by the Defense Intelligence Agency, however, estimated the strikes only set back Tehran's nuclear program by a matter of months, according to three sources familiar with its contents.",
      "Regarding the Israel-Hamas conflict, Mr. Trump expressed optimism and said there's been \"great progress.\"",
      "\"I think great progress is being made on Gaza,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I think because of this attack that we made, I think we're going to have some very good news.\"",
      "On Wednesday, Mr. Trump met with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, who complimented the president on his efforts to boost other countries' defense spending and on his efforts in the Middle East.",
      "\"You are a man of strength and also a man of peace,\" Rutte told Mr. Trump.",
      "Mr. Trump also met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Zelenskyy said they discussed \"how to achieve a ceasefire and a real peace deal.\"",
      "\"We appreciate the attention and the readiness to help bring peace close,\" Zelenskyy wrote on X, adding, \"Details will follow.\"",
      "The president said of his conversation with Zelenskyy, \"I took from the meeting that he'd like to see it end. I think it's a great time to end it. I'm going to speak to Vladimir Putin and see if we can get it ended.\"",
      "A Ukrainian BBC reporter, who said her husband is a soldier in Ukraine, asked the president whether the U.S. would provide Ukraine with Patriot missile defense systems, which intercept ballistic missiles.",
      "\"They do want to have the anti-missile missiles \u2026 the Patriots,\" Mr. Trump replied, \"and we're going to see if we can make some available.\" He said the missiles were \"hard to get,\" and the U.S. has been providing them to Israel. \"They're very effective \u2014 100% effective.\"",
      "The president, upon learning that the reporter was living with her children in Warsaw while her husband fights in Ukraine, said, \"That's rough stuff, right?\" And after he answered her question, he wished her luck and offered his regards to her husband.",
      "NATO members, with the exceptions of Spain and Slovakia, have agreed to a dramatic increase in their defense spending, to 5% of GDP, a goal pressed by Mr. Trump, though the U.S. defense spending is short of that target. Before leaving for the summit, Mr. Trump said the U.S. shouldn't have to reach that target, since it's contributed so much to NATO in the past.",
      "\"This week, the NATO allies committed to dramatically increase their defense spending to that 5% of GDP, something that no one really thought possible,\" Mr. Trump said at his press conference, adding that it will be known as \"The Hague defense commitment.\"",
      "Asked about Spain's refusal to commit to the 5% threshold, Mr. Trump said he liked Spain and its people, \"But Spain is the only country \u2014 out of all other countries \u2014 that refuses to pay,\" and he said it was getting \"a little bit of a free ride.\" The president went on to say that the U.S. is negotiating with Spain on trade, and \"we're going to make them pay twice as much.\"",
      "It was a whirlwind trip for Mr. Trump, who arrived in the Netherlands on Tuesday and is scheduled to fly back to Washington on Wednesday.",
      "The president said he's leaving NATO with a different perspective about Article 5 \u2014 the agreement that the allies will come to each other's aid when attacked \u2014 after hearing about it directly from fellow leaders. The president told reporters he no longer considers the alliance a \"rip-off,\" and wants the U.S. to help defend other NATO nations.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The FBI is intensifying its focus and resources on counterterrorism threats after the United States\u00a0carried out strikes\u00a0on three Iranian nuclear facilities over the weekend, and Iran countered with an attack of its own on an American air base in Qatar.",
      "Two sources told CBS News that a memo was distributed to FBI field office directors in the past 48 hours instructing them to focus resources on terror threats, including domestically.",
      "The memo follows a separate, unrelated internal report sent earlier this month in which the FBI forecasted that it would need to concentrate resources on Iran in the coming months. The report stated that a priority would be \"helping to apply maximum pressure on the Islamic Republic of Iran and its terror proxies. This includes investigating, prosecuting, and otherwise disrupting financial and logistical networks, operatives, and front groups; targeting related foreign-based hacking operations; targeting the leaders and members of terrorist groups and terror proxies responsible for capturing, harming, or killing American citizens, and seizing illicit Iranian oil exports.\"",
      "It comes after the FBI has received multiple internal complaints from employees about being pulled off counterterrorism and counterintelligence tasks to focus on immigration enforcement, according to two other sources who spoke to CBS News. The complaints warned of pressure being placed on FBI agents to \"maximize the number of immigration arrests.\"",
      "An FBI spokesperson said the bureau \"does not comment on specific operational adjustments or personnel decisions. However, we continuously assess and realign our resources to respond to the most pressing threats to our national security and to ensure the safety of the American people.\"",
      "President Trump has made a crackdown on illegal immigration and mass deportations a focal point of his second term. He has\u00a0invoked a wartime law\u00a0known as the Alien Enemies Act to swiftly deport migrants,\u00a0rolled back\u00a0programs\u00a0shielding people\u00a0from the threat of deportation, and approached other countries about\u00a0accepting migrants who are not their citizens.",
      "Workplace arrests by immigration authorities in Los Angeles County earlier this month sparked protests and\u00a0led the president to call\u00a0roughly 4,000 members of the California National Guard into federal service under a law known as\u00a0Title 10. His administration has also\u00a0deployed more than 700 active-duty Marines\u00a0to Los Angeles.",

      "The National Terrorism Advisory System issued a\u00a0bulletin\u00a0Sunday\u00a0warning that the Iran conflict\u00a0has created a \"heightened threat environment\" in the U.S.",
      "\"Since the start of the conflict, we have seen media releases by foreign terrorist organizations ... some of which have called for violence against US assets and personnel in the Middle East,\" the advisory warned. \"Multiple recent Homeland terrorist attacks have been motivated by anti-Semitic or anti-Israel sentiment, and the ongoing Israel-Iran conflict could contribute to US-based individuals plotting additional attacks.\"",
      "The U.S. carried out precision strikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities, Mr. Trump announced in an address to the nation Saturday night. He said the assault, dubbed Operation Midnight Hammer, aimed to cripple Iran's nuclear program.",
      "In response to the strikes, Iran\u00a0launched a ballistic missile attack\u00a0targeting the U.S. Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar on Monday. Mr. Trump indicated that the U.S. was given advance warning of the Iranian attack, and there were no American or Qatari casualties.",
      "The attack came after Israel\u00a0launched strikes\u00a0against Iranian nuclear and military targets starting June 13, which prompted missile counterattacks by Iran. As of Tuesday,\u00a0at least 974 people\u00a0have been killed in Iran, according to the organization Human Rights Activists in Iran.

    "story": [
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is hiring Lyn Redwood, a nurse and the former head of a group critics have denounced as anti-vaccine, to work in its vaccine safety office, multiple CDC officials tell CBS News.",
      "Redwood was the president of the group now called Children's Health Defense, which lists as its founder Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who now oversees the CDC as secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services. Children's Health Defense has sued to curb vaccine requirements, petitioned federal agencies to revoke vaccine authorizations and spread misinformation about vaccines. Kennedy was listed as the group's founder and chairman before becoming the nation's top health official in the second Trump administration.",
      "She is joining the CDC office responsible for overseeing most of the agency's work and data to probe potential safety risks from vaccines, including databases used by health officials to collect and analyze reports from the public and health care systems.",
      "Redwood is expected to be hired as a special government employee, the CDC officials said, a status often afforded to advisers and other temporary experts brought on for specific projects or committees.",
      "The CDC and Redwood did not respond to CBS News' requests for comment.",
      "Redwood is also scheduled to present Thursday to the agency's new roster of outside vaccine advisers, who were replaced earlier this month by Kennedy with his own picks, about her concerns about the vaccine preservative thimerosal causing autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders.",
      "The CDC and outside groups have debunked fears about thimerosal causing autism in the past. In a report briefly published on the CDC's website before this week's vaccines meeting, the agency cited several studies turning up no evidence of thimerosal causing neurodevelopmental disorders, and warned of significant methodological issues with a handful of studies that did.",
      "\"Considering the breadth of evidence and consistency in results from multiple population-based studies conducted in several countries with various study designs, the evidence does not support an association between thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism spectrum disorder or other neurodevelopmental disorders,\" the CDC said in its now-deleted report.",
      "Children's Health Defense in the past has criticized the CDC Immunization Safety Office for its efforts to debunk concerns about thimerosal, accusing the office in 2018 of attempting \"to pull the wool over the public's eyes\" about the preservative. Kennedy echoed some of those claims in a post late Tuesday on X.",
      "\"Removing a known neurotoxin from being injected into our most vulnerable populations is a good place to start with Making America Healthy Again,\" Redwood said in prepared slides released by the agency ahead of the Thursday meeting.",
      "Redwood's addition to the agenda sparked a renewed round of criticism for Kennedy, who medical groups worry is dismantling a key component of how the U.S. develops influential vaccine recommendations tied to insurance coverage and federal policies.",
      "\"Even though the prevalence of thimerosal in flu vaccines is low and it hasn't been linked to developmental issues, the public confusion and over ethylmercury remains \u2014 confusion that anti-vaccine activists, such as Lyn Redwood, have sought to stoke,\" the University of Minnesota's Vaccine Integrity Project wrote Monday.",
      "Beyond thimerosal, which the CDC says data suggests is used in less than 0.3% of flu vaccines given to moms during pregnancy, Redwood has raised concerns about other vaccine ingredients.",
      "In an interview with Kennedy published in October last year, Redwood said aluminum had been found in the brains of children with autism at \"some of the highest levels ever documented.\"",
      "The FDA has said aluminum added to some vaccines has \"a demonstrated safety profile of over many decades of use,\" and that aluminum exposure is most commonly from eating food or drinking water.",
      "Redwood said she had worked with one of the heads of the CDC's Immunization Safety Office in the past over her concerns about mercury in vaccines.",

    "summary": "The Trump administration has filed a lawsuit against all 15 federal judges in Maryland, ratcheting up a fight with the federal judiciary over President Trump's executive powers.",
    "story": [
      "In an unusual move, the Trump administration on Tuesday filed a lawsuit against all 15 federal judges in Maryland over an order blocking the immediate deportation of migrants challenging their removals.",
      "At issue is a May order signed by Chief Judge George L. Russell III blocking the administration from immediately removing from the U.S. any immigrants who file paperwork with the Maryland district court seeking a review of their detention. The order blocks the removal until 4 p.m. on the second business day after the habeas corpus petition is filed.",
      "The administration says the automatic pause on removals violates a Supreme Court ruling and impedes the president's authority to enforce immigration laws.",
      "It's rare for anyone \u2014 especially the federal government \u2014 to sue the entire federal bench in a state. The action ratchets up a fight with the federal judiciary over President Trump's immigration policies, and underscores the administration's growing exasperation with federal judges who have turned aside executive branch actions.",
      "\"It's extraordinary,\" Laurie Levenson, a professor at Loyola Law School, told the Associated Press of the Justice Department's lawsuit. \"And it's escalating DOJ's effort to challenge federal judges.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has been locked for weeks in a growing showdown with the federal judiciary amid a barrage of legal challenges to the president's policies, especially his efforts to rapidly ramp up deportations. The Justice Department has grown increasingly frustrated by rulings blocking the president's agenda, accusing judges of improperly impeding the president's powers.",
      "\"President Trump's executive authority has been undermined since the first hours of his presidency by an endless barrage of injunctions designed to halt his agenda,\" Attorney General Pamela Bondi said in a statement Wednesday. \"The American people elected President Trump to carry out his policy agenda: this pattern of judicial overreach undermines the democratic process and cannot be allowed to stand.\"",
      "A spokesman for the Maryland district court declined to comment to the AP.",
      "Mr. Trump has railed against unfavorable judicial rulings, and in one case called for the impeachment of a federal judge in Washington, D.C., who ordered planeloads of deported immigrants to be turned around \u2014 and later threatened to hold government officials in contempt for defying his orders. That led Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts to issue a rare statement saying, \"impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision.\"",
      "Among the judges named in the Trump administration's lawsuit is U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis, who has called the administration's deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia to El Salvador illegal. Attorneys for Abrego Garcia have asked Xinis to impose fines against the administration for contempt, arguing that it ignored court orders for weeks to return him to the U.S.",
      "The government acknowledged that Abrego Garcia was deported by mistake, and a Justice Department lawyer said in Xinis' courtroom that the department didn't give him sufficient information about the case. That lawyer, Erez Reuveni, was later fired, and filed a whistleblower complaint obtained by CBS News this week that alleged top officials at the department talked about ignoring court orders and withholding information from judges. Justice Department officials denied the allegations.",
      "Abrego Garcia was ultimately returned to the U.S. earlier this month and hit with smuggling charges. A judge declined the government's request to detain him pre-trial last weekend, but he will remain in federal custody at least until Friday.",
      "The order signed by Russell that led to this week's lawsuit says it aims to maintain existing conditions and the potential jurisdiction of the court, ensure immigrant petitioners are able to participate in court proceedings and access attorneys and give the government \"fulsome opportunity to brief and present arguments in its defense.\"",
      "In an amended order, Russell said the court had received an influx of habeas petitions after-hours that \"resulted in hurried and frustrating hearings in that obtaining clear and concrete information about the location and status of the petitioners is elusive.\"",
      "But the Trump administration says the judge cannot issue a standing order that automatically enjoins the government from removing people who file habeas petitions. The lawsuit called the order \"lawless\" and \"judicial overreach.\"",
      "The Trump administration has asked the Maryland judges to recuse themselves from the case. It wants a clerk to have a federal judge from another state hear it.",
      "James Sample, a constitutional law professor at Hofstra University, described the lawsuit as further part of the erosion of legal norms by the administration. Normally when parties are on the losing side of an injunction, they appeal the order \u2014 not sue the court or judges, he said.",
      "On one hand, he said, the Justice Department has a point that injunctions should be considered extraordinary relief; it's unusual for them to be granted automatically in an entire class of cases. But, he added, it's the administration's own actions in repeatedly moving detainees to prevent them from obtaining writs of habeas corpus that prompted the court to issue the order.",
      "\"The judges here didn't ask to be put in this unenviable position,\" Sample told the Associated Press. \"Faced with imperfect options, they have made an entirely reasonable, cautious choice to modestly check an executive branch that is determined to circumvent any semblance of impartial process.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the Salvadoran man who was deported back to his home country and then returned to the U.S. for federal prosecution, is set to remain in jail until at least Friday, as lawyers debate whether the Justice Department can stop him from being deported if he is released from federal custody pending his trial on human smuggling charges.",
      "Lawyers for Abrego Garcia and federal prosecutors met in court in Nashville on Wednesday for a hearing to discuss the conditions of his release after U.S. Magistrate Judge Barbara Holmes on Sunday denied a Justice Department request to keep Abrego Garcia detained while awaiting a criminal trial.",
      "After Wednesday's hearing, Holmes ordered Abrego Garcia's lawyers to file court papers laying out their arguments by noon on Thursday, and gave the government until noon on Friday to respond. Holmes said she will issue a ruling at some point after that. Until then, Abrego Garcia will remain in the custody of the U.S. Marshals.",
      "In her decision over the weekend, Holmes said Abrego Garcia should be released, with certain conditions. But she noted, and lawyers for both sides acknowledged, that the Salvadoran man would likely be detained by federal immigration authorities for removal proceedings if released on criminal charges.",
      "The Justice Department has appealed Holmes' release order, but a federal district judge on Wednesday declined to pause that decision.",
      "The judge, Waverly Crenshaw, set a hearing for July 16 to consider the government's bid to revoke the release order.",
      "\"The government emphasizes that absent a stay, it will incur the irreparable injury of Abrego possibly facing deportation from the United States pursuant to the immigration detainer lodged against him by DHS,\" Crenshaw wrote in his decision denying the Justice Department's stay request. \"If deported, the government argues, the Department of Justice will be deprived of the opportunity to pursue its criminal charges against Abrego. At bottom, the government asks the court to save it from itself because it may suffer irreparable harm completely of its own making.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia was charged with two counts arising out of what federal prosecutors said was his participation in a yearslong conspiracy to smuggle migrants into the U.S. unlawfully. He pleaded not guilty to both charges at a hearing earlier this month.",
      "Holmes' acknowledged in her order that Abrego Garcia was likely to remain in custody \u2014 either of the U.S. Marshals or Immigration and Customs Enforcement \u2014 regardless of how she ruled on the detention request, and said her analysis was \"little more than an academic exercise.\" But in a filing with the court, the Justice Department said that a release of Abrego Garcia into custody of immigration authorities \"poses potentially irreparable problems\" for the prosecution of his case and the public.",
      "If the court refuses to pause Holmes' release order and Abrego Garcia is moved to ICE custody and deported, \"the prosecution would lose the meaningful opportunity to try its case,\" prosecutors said, acknowledging that his potential deportation would not be \"instantaneous.\"",
      "But Abrego Garcia's lawyers called the Justice Department's concerns about his potential deportation while awaiting trial a \"possible self-inflicted injury by its executive branch colleagues at the Department of Homeland Security.\"",
      "Abrego Garcia's case garnered significant public attention after a Trump administration immigration official acknowledged in a court filing that his deportation to El Salvador was an \"administrative error.\" A Salvadoran native, Abrego Garcia came to the U.S. illegally in 2011 and has resided in Maryland for more than a decade.",
      "He was placed on a removal flight in March as part of President Trump's crackdown on illegal immigration and promise of mass deportations, and sent with hundreds of other migrants to El Salvador. Abrego Garcia, however, had been granted a legal status known as withholding of removal in 2019, which prevented the Department of Homeland Security from deporting him to his home country of El Salvador because of likely persecution by gangs.",
      "A federal judge in April ordered the Trump administration to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return to the U.S., and that portion of her order was affirmed by the Supreme Court later that month. While the Trump administration resisted efforts to bring Abrego Garcia back to the U.S. for weeks, it finally did so earlier this month so he could face prosecution for alleged human smuggling.",
      "A federal grand jury in Tennessee returned the indictment against Abrego Garcia in late May. The charges stem from a November 2022 traffic stop in Tennessee, when he was pulled over by the state Highway Patrol for speeding. Abrego Garcia had at least eight people in the car with him when he was stopped and said they had been performing construction work in St. Louis, according to body camera footage released by the Highway Patrol.",
      "An April report from the Department of Homeland Security regarding the incident said Abrego Garcia was suspected of human trafficking, though he was not arrested or charged with any crime. He was given a warning citation by the Tennessee officers.",
      "Abrego Garcia was arraigned earlier this month, and Holmes held a hearing to determine whether he should be detained or released ahead of his trial.",
      "In finding that Abrego Garcia should be released, the magistrate judge said that she \"cannot find from the evidence presented that Abrego's release clearly and convincingly poses an irremediable danger to other persons or to the community.\"",
      "Holmes called the government's evidence \"unreliable\" and claims of Abrego Garcia's alleged membership in the gang MS-13 \"simply insufficient,\" as government cooperating witnesses gave an ICE investigator \"conflicting\" information.",
      "The judge said the government put forth \"hearsay statements\" from cooperating witnesses who stand \"to gain something from their testimony in this case.\"",
      "One of the cooperators has two felony convictions, has been deported five times and was released early from a 30-month federal prison sentence for human smuggling for providing information to the government in Abrego Garcia's case, Holmes wrote. He is also the purported \"domestic leader\" of the human smuggling organization that prosecutors allege Abrego Garcia participated in, the judge said.",
      "The second cooperator is an \"avowed member of the human smuggling organization,\" according to the judge, and is in custody charged with a federal crime \"for which he hopes to be released in exchange for\" his testimony before the grand jury. Holmes said the second man has also been deported before and has now requested deferred action on his removal in exchange for his cooperation with the government in Abrego Garcia's case.",
      "Holmes said their statements about Abrego Garcia \u2014 namely regarding his alleged smuggling trips from Maryland to Houston and back \u2014 \"defy common sense.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 25 Jun 2025 15:09:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Federal appeals court nominee Emil Bove, denying a whistleblower's account, says he never told DOJ attorneys to ignore court orders.",
    "story": [
      "Top Justice Department official Emil Bove, who has been nominated for the federal appeals bench, testified before the Senate Wednesday that he never told department attorneys to ignore court orders, denying the account of a whistleblower.",
      "Bove, a former criminal defense attorney who represented President Trump, rejected suggestions by Democrats that the claims of whistleblower, former Justice Department attorney Erez Reuveni, render him unfit to serve on the appeals court. His nomination has come under scrutiny after Reuveni\u00a0said in a complaint made public Tuesday that in one meeting, Bove had used an expletive when saying the Trump administration might need to ignore judicial commands.",
      "\"I have never advised a Department of Justice attorney to violate a court order,\" Bove told the Senate Judiciary Committee. He added, \"I don't think there's any validity to the suggestion that that whistleblower complaint filed yesterday calls into question my qualifications to serve as a circuit judge.\"",
      "Bove was nominated last month by Mr. Trump to the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which hears cases from Delaware, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. A former federal prosecutor in the Southern District of New York, Bove was on Mr. Trump's defense team for his New York hush money trial and defended him in the two federal criminal cases brought by the Justice Department.",
      "The White House said Bove \"is unquestionably qualified for the role and has a career filled with accolades, both academically and throughout his legal career, that should make him a shoo-in for the Third Circuit.\"",
      "\"The President is committed to nominating constitutionalists to the bench who will restore law and order and end the weaponization of the justice system, and Emil Bove fits that mold perfectly,\" White House spokesperson Harrison Fields said in an email.",
      "Reuveni, a 14-year veteran of the Justice Department, was fired in April after conceding in court that Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran man who had been living in Maryland, was mistakenly deported to an El Salvador prison. He sent a letter on Tuesday to members of Congress and the Justice Department's inspector general seeking an investigation into allegations of wrongdoing by Bove and other officials in the weeks leading up to his firing.",
      "Reuveni described a Justice Department meeting in March about Mr. Trump's plans to invoke the Alien Enemies Act, citing a claim of a U.S. invasion by the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. Reuveni says Bove raised the possibility that a court might block the deportations before they could happen. He claims Bove used a profanity in saying the department would need to consider telling the courts what to do and \"ignore any such order,\" his lawyers said in the letter.",
      "Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche called the allegations \"utterly false.\" He said he was at the March meeting, and \"at no time did anyone suggest a court order should not be followed.\"",
      "\"Planting a false hit piece the day before a confirmation hearing is something we have come to expect from the media, but it does not mean it should be tolerated,\" Blanche wrote in a post on X on Tuesday.",
      "Bove has been a central figure in other controversial moves by the Justice Department in recent months, including the order to dismiss New York City Mayor Eric Adams' federal corruption case. Bove's order prompted the resignation of several Justice Department officials, including Manhattan's top federal prosecutor, who accused the department of acceding to a quid pro quo \u2014 dropping the case to ensure Adams' help with Mr. Trump's immigration agenda.",

    "story": [
      "As the public assesses the U.S. airstrikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, at least three things are in play.",
      "One, there's a largely bipartisan view that any Iranian nuclear weapon would pose a threat to the U.S. Second, there are bipartisan concerns that the U.S. could get involved in a wider war with Iran. And third, there are differing perceptions of just how effective those strikes will ultimately prove to be.",
      "Amid that, it is Republicans, including MAGA Republicans, who overwhelmingly back the airstrikes, and they comprise the bulk of those who do. For the rest of the public, however \u2014 and netting out to a majority overall \u2014 there is disapproval of those airstrikes and still-greater concern about a potential wider war.",
      "Going forward, the nation divides over whether it has confidence in the Trump administration's handling of the situation (here again, Republicans do, others do not) and on whether the strikes will actually make it less likely Iran develops a weapon.",
      "Then, as Congress returns to session, a sizable two-thirds of the country say President Trump does need congressional authorization to conduct military action against Iran.",
      "Concern about the U.S. possibly becoming involved in a wider war with Iran does span partisan lines. For most Republicans, though, there is relatively less such concern.",
      "Polling was mostly conducted prior to reports regarding a ceasefire between Iran and Israel.",
      "Republicans show overwhelming confidence in the administration's handling of the situation with Iran, which nets out to the nation being split on that overall.",
      "A large two-thirds say Mr. Trump does need congressional approval for action against Iran. That includes a third of Republicans. MAGA Republicans, in particular, though, are more likely than other Republicans to say Mr. Trump does not need congressional approval for action against Iran.",
      "Right now MAGA rank-and-file are no more concerned about a wider war than Republicans overall.",
      "Most Americans do think Iran will probably try to launch attacks against the U.S. or its interests now as opposed to negotiating. (Polling was being conducted while Iran launched missiles toward a U.S. base in Qatar. And was mostly completed prior to reports of a cease fire between Israel and Iran.)",
      "The more likely people are to think Iran will try to attack the U.S. now (as opposed to negotiating), the more concerned they are about a wider war.",
      "Large majorities would see the prospect of Iran having a nuclear weapon as a threat, both to the U.S. and to Israel.",
      "Much of this, beyond the partisanship, also centers on views about effectiveness: whether or not Iran is now less likely to develop a nuclear weapon.",
      "Meanwhile, on the home front, perceptions of the U.S. economy remain bad in the eyes of most, as they have for years, with most still saying prices are still going up. Even as current ratings remain stable, the outlook remains overall negative. Just over half the country says the economy is getting worse; just over half continue to think the year ahead will bring at least a slowdown or recession. That sentiment has not abated in recent months.",

      "Whitson thanked Onishi, saying \"you guys are exceptional hosts and hopefully, you'll think we're exceptional guests at the end of a couple of weeks! We're looking forward to getting a lot of work done with you guys.\"",
      "All told, researchers from 31 countries will be helping evaluate data from the Ax-4 experiments and technology demonstrations. Whitson said before launch the mission \"opens up access to countries that might not normally get access to space. So this is very exciting.\"",
      "Before they reached the space station, the Ax-4 crew beamed down televised comments describing the flight and their expectations.",
      "\"Welcome, earthlings, from Grace,\" Whitson radioed. She revealed the name of the new Crew Dragon moments after reaching orbit Wednesday.",
      "\"We are in the newest Dragon capsule, and we are very happy with her,\" Whitson said. \"She's got a little bit of a new-spacecraft smell, and we're loving her a bunch. It's so much fun to be up in space again, always fun to be in space, but it's really fun to be in space with three new astronauts.\"",
      "Uzna\u0144ski-Wi\u015bniewski said \"it's an amazing feeling to be in orbit for the first time. When I unbuckled for the first time, I didn't feel 100 percent, but then everything settled and when I looked out the window, the view was just stunning.\"",

      "NASA's Curiosity rover has captured the first close-up images of a part of Mars that scientists say provide evidence of how water once flowed on the red planet.",
      "There were once rivers, lakes and possibly an ocean on Mars, but they eventually dried up and the planet became the desert it is currently, according to NASA.",
      "The new images by Curiosity show \"dramatic evidence\" of ancient groundwater in crisscrossing low ridges, arranged in \"a boxwork pattern,\" stretching across miles of a mountain on Mars, the space agency said.",
      "\"The bedrock below these ridges likely formed when groundwater trickling through the rock left behind minerals that accumulated in those cracks and fissures, hardening and becoming cementlike,\" NASA said in a news release.",
      "The ridges look like spiderweb patterns from space and had previously only been observed from orbit, NASA said.",
      "\"A big mystery is why the ridges were hardened into these big patterns and why only here,\" Curiosity's project scientist, Ashwin Vasavada, said. \"As we drive on, we'll be studying the ridges and mineral cements to make sure our idea of how they formed is on target.\"",
      "The ridges have small fractures filled with calcium sulfate, left behind by groundwater, which had not been found before in this part of Mount Sharp, the 3-mile-tall mountain Curiosity is currently climbing, NASA said.",
      "\"That's really surprising,\" said Curiosity's deputy project scientist, Abigail Fraeman. \"These calcium sulfate veins used to be everywhere, but they more or less disappeared as we climbed higher up Mount Sharp. The team is excited to figure out why they've returned now.\"",
      "Curiosity landed in the planet's Gale Crater in 2012. It has been climbing the foothills of Mount Sharp since 2014, searching for signs of environments that could have supported life, according to NASA.",

      "Strapped into a new SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule making its maiden flight, Whitson, test pilot Shubhanshu Shukla of India, European Space Agency astronaut S\u0142awosz Uzna\u0144ski-Wi\u015bniewski of Poland and Hungarian engineer Tibor Kapu roared away from pad 39A at the Kennedy Space Center at  2:31 a.m. EDT.",
      "Lighting up the overnight sky for miles around, the Falcon 9 first stage propelled the Crew Dragon out of the lower atmosphere along a northeasterly trajectory paralleling the East Coast of the United States.",

      "The Crew Dragon spacecraft, serial number C213, is the fifth and final addition to SpaceX's fleet of astronaut ferry ships built for NASA trips to the space station and for privately-funded commercial missions to low-Earth orbit.",
      "The climb to orbit went smoothly, and the capsule was released to fly on its own about nine-and-a-half minutes after liftoff. Whitson then revealed the name of the new spacecraft: Crew Dragon Grace.",
      "\"We  had an incredible ride uphill, and now we'd like to set our course for  the International Space Station aboard the newest member of the Dragon  fleet, our spacecraft named Grace. ... Grace reminds us that spaceflight  is not just a feat of engineering,  but an act of goodwill to the  benefit of every human everywhere.\"",
      "Axiom Space provides \"private astronaut missions,\" or PAMs, to the International Space Station on a commercial basis. As the company's director of human spaceflight, Whitson, a retired astronaut with three NASA flights to her credit, is making her second flight for Axiom Space.",
      "It's not known what her crew's space agencies or governments paid for their flights, but Axiom passenger seats for space station visits typically sell for around $65 million to $70 million each. That covers the cost of nearly a year of NASA-sanctioned astronaut training, launch and a two-week stay aboard the station before returning to Earth with an ocean splashdown.",
      "The crew originally hoped to begin their mission on June 10, but the flight was held up by high winds offshore and then by work to resolve an oxygen leak in the Falcon 9's first stage plumbing. It was delayed again by renewed concern about small-but-persistent air leaks in a Russian compartment aboard the space station that connects the lab's aft docking port to the Zvezda service module.",
      "The leakage in the PrK vestibule was first noticed in 2019 and has been closely monitored ever since. The compartment is closed off unless a Russian spacecraft is using that docking port.",
      "NASA has not explained what led to the latest concern, or what was done to resolve it, other than saying the Russians agreed to lower air pressure in the closed-off PrK compartment to about 1.9 pounds per square inch.",
      "That presumably ensures the higher sea-level pressure in Zvezda and the rest of the station creates a tighter-than-usual seal between the service module's aft hatch and the PrK, isolating it from the rest of the station. But NASA has not confirmed the reason for the pressure change.",
      "Plans for the Ax-4 mission",
      "If all goes well, Crew Dragon Grace will catch up with the space station after a  28-hour rendezvous, moving in for docking at the space-facing port or  the station's forward Harmony module at 7 a.m. Thursday.",
      "They'll be welcomed aboard by NASA Crew 10 commander Anne McClain, pilot Nicole Ayers, Russian cosmonaut Kirill Peskov and Japanese flier Takuya Onishi, along with Soyuz MS-27 crewmates Sergey Ryzhikov, Alexey Zubritsky and NASA's Jonny Kim.",
      "With a doctorate in biochemistry, Whitson, 65, retired from NASA in 2018 after three flights to the space station. Going into the Ax-4 flight, she had logged 675 days in space, including one post-retirement mission for Axiom Space.",
      "She ranks ninth in the world for cumulative time in space, No. 1 in the world among female astronauts and No. 1 overall among U.S. astronauts.",
      "As if all that's not enough, she's also the world's most experienced female spacewalker \u2014 seventh in the world overall \u2014 with 10 excursions totaling 60 hours and 21 minutes. She was the first female and non-military chief of NASA's astronaut office and served as the first female commander of the International Space Station.",
      "\"I think I'm somewhat addicted to space,\" she said in an interview with CBS News. \"I really like being there, and it's just exhilarating living in an environment so different than what we have here on Earth. And having adapted to that environment, it is fun for me to share my experience with the rookie flyers that are going with me.",
      "\"I get to share in their experience of the first time, all over again,\" she added.",
      "Uzna\u0144ski-Wi\u015bniewski summed up the feelings of his Ax-4 crewmates, saying \"we consider ourselves extremely lucky to be flying with Peggy, the best commander we could have wished for.\"",

      "Anthropic has won a major legal victory in a case over whether the artificial intelligence company was justified in hoovering up millions of copyrighted books to train its chatbot.",
      "In a ruling that could set an important precedent for similar disputes, Judge William Alsup of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California on Tuesday said Anthropic's use of legally purchased books to train its AI model, Claude, did not violate U.S. copyright law.",
      "Anthropic, which was founded by former executives with ChatGPT developer OpenAI,\u00a0introduced Claude in 2023. Like other generative AI bots, the tool lets users ask natural language questions and then provides neatly summarized answers using AI trained on millions of books, articles and other material.",
      "Alsup ruled that Anthropic's use of copyrighted books to train its language learning model, or LLM, was \"quintessentially transformative\" and did not violate \"fair use\" doctrine under copyright law.",
      "\"Like any reader aspiring to be a writer, Anthropic's LLMs trained upon works not to race ahead and replicate or supplant them, but to turn a hard corner and create something different,\" his decision states.",
      "By contrast, Alsup also found that Anthropic may have broken the law when it separately downloaded millions of pirated books and said it will face a separate trial in December over this issue.",
      "Court documents revealed that Anthropic employees expressed concern about the legality of using pirate sites to access books. The company later shifted its approach and hired a former Google executive in charge of Google Books, a searchable library of digitized books that successfully weathered years of copyright battles.",

      "\"We are pleased that the Court recognized that using 'works to train LLMs (language learning models) was transformative \u2014 spectacularly so,\" an Anthropic spokesperson told CBS News in an email.",
      "The ruling stems from a case filed last year by three authors in federal court. After Anthropic used copies of their books to train Claude, Andrea Bartz, Charles Graeber and Kirk Wallace Johnson sued Anthropic for alleged copyright infringement, claiming the company's practices amounted to \"large-scale theft.\"",
      "The authors also alleged that Anthropic\u00a0\"seeks to profit from strip-mining the human expression and ingenuity behind each one of those works.\"",

      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's panel of vaccine advisers voted Thursday in their first official move after Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. fired the committee's previous experts and replaced them with his own picks.",
      "A majority of the committee approved updated recommendations for a new shot for respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, and voted to urge Americans to avoid a small number of flu vaccines that use the preservative thimerosal despite evidence of its safety.",
      "Votes by the panel are closely watched by health authorities because they are tied to federal policies and programs that enable access to vaccines, including requirements for insurance coverage and funding to provide shots for uninsured children.",
      "Other vaccines were also being discussed by the panel, but not voted on, including those for COVID-19, measles, chikungunya and anthrax.",
      "Kennedy's new committee also announced Wednesday that it would start a renewed review of all recommended pediatric vaccines, over fears about the \"cumulative effect\" that the shots could be having on children. That includes weighing changes to recommendations for hepatitis B and measles vaccines given early in life.",
      "The American Academy of Pediatrics, or AAP, denounced the move as sowing distrust in safe and effective immunizations, and warned Wednesday against curbing hepatitis B recommendations.",
      "\"Secretary Kennedy has given this committee a clear mandate to use evidence-based medicine when making vaccine recommendations, and that is what we will do. Vaccines are not all good or bad,\" Dr. Martin Kulldorff, the panel's chair, said Wednesday.",
      "Flu vaccines and thimerosal",

      "\"Ethylmercury is excreted much more quickly from the body. It is not associated with the high neurotoxicity that methylmercury is,\" Meissner said.",
      "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration states that a \"robust body of peer-reviewed scientific studies conducted in the U.S. and other countries support the safety of thimerosal-containing vaccines.\"",
      "Anti-vaccine groups have falsely tied thimerosal to autism. However, well-designed studies have found no evidence that thimerosal causes autism.",
      "CDC officials told CBS News they saw the meeting as an early test case demonstrating how Kennedy has tightened his grip over the federal vaccine recommendations process and eroded its credibility.",
      "Multiple liaison members of the panel, representing outside groups, objected to the committee bypassing the rigorous, usually monthslong CDC systemic review process that studies evidence on the need, impact and feasibility of new recommendations. Some worried re-debating settled science could contribute to unnecessary fears or doubts around vaccines that have long been considered safe.",
      "\"This selective use of data and omission of established science undermines public trust and fuels misinformation. The science on thimerosal is settled, and the rhetoric being used to suggest otherwise is misleading and harmful,\" Dr. Sean O'Leary, head of the AAP's infectious diseases committee, said in a statement.",
      "Instead, the vote was based mainly on a presentation by Lyn Redwood, the former head of a group founded by Kennedy that has lobbied against vaccine authorizations and requirements. Redwood has been hired to work in the agency's vaccine safety office, though she said Thursday she was speaking only as a private citizen.",
      "\"I think it's inappropriate to dismiss a presentation, just because the person does not have a PhD or an MD. There are a lot of knowledgeable people who we would like to hear from, and we want to hear from a variety of viewpoints,\" Kulldorff said.",
      "Ahead of the meeting, the CDC removed a review the agency previously posted on its website that debunked claims about how the preservative could cause autism or other neurodevelopmental disorders.",
      "\"My understanding is that article was not authorized by the Office of the Secretary, and has been removed consequent. I'm sure that the Office of the Secretary will make note of your comment,\" panelist Dr. Robert Malone said.",
      "Malone was responding to a question from Phyllis Arthur of Bio, a trade group that represents vaccinemakers, who had called for the CDC's evidence review to be restored to the website.",
      "Molly Howell of the Association of Immunization Managers worried the move could also impact plans for a potential pandemic influenza vaccine, which currently rely on the potential use of the preservative.",
      "\"Future meetings of ACIP and CDC will have to consider those things,\" Kulldorff said.",
      "RSV shot",
      "An RSV vaccine during pregnancy and another antibody shot called clesrovimab that can be given to newborns have previously been approved by the Food and Drug Administration and recommended by the CDC to prevent the disease.",
      "The committee Thursday voted by a majority \u2014 five in favor, two against \u2014 to recommend a shot for newborns, branded as Enflonsia by Merck, adding another option to the already approved immunizations.",
      "Two of the panel's new members \u2014 Retsef Levi, an operations management professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Vicki Pebsworth, the research director of a group focused on preventing vaccine injuries and deaths \u2014 voted against recommendations for the shot.",
      "Pebsworth said she worried about coadministration of the shot with other childhood vaccines, despite data presented by the CDC's Vaccine Safety Datalink showing that RSV antibody shots being given alongside other vaccines are not resulting in a safety risk.",
      "Levi said that he was uncomfortable with clinical trial data he claimed suggested that deaths could be more frequent after use of the shots. He cited his experience as a parent, saying that \"as a father, I can feel that I would be concerned.\"",
      "\"I don't feel this is ready to be administered to all healthy babies. I think we should take a more precautionary approach to this,\" Levi said.",
      "That was at odds with reviews by the CDC and FDA, which did not turn up evidence of this risk. An FDA official told the panel that the death rates \u2014 0.3% after the shot versus 0.2% without \u2014 were not significant, and that careful reviews of the deaths concluded that their causes were not related to the drug.",
      "Meissner disagreed with Levi, warning that 80% of children hospitalized with RSV are healthy with no underlying conditions.",
      "Meissner had previously participated in the deliberations of the committee's work group as an outside adviser, before Kennedy purged its voting members.",
      "\"The work group has spent an enormous amount of time, the FDA has spent an enormous effort looking at safety and efficacy, and it is simply not an issue here,\" he said.",

      "Federal prosecutors made their closing arguments Thursday in the sex trafficking trial against Sean \"Diddy\" Combs\u00a0in New York.",
      "\"Over the last several weeks, you've learned a lot about Sean Combs,\" Assistant U.S. Attorney Christy Slavik said to the jury at the beginning of her presentation, which lasted about five hours. \"He's the leader of a criminal enterprise. He doesn't take no for an answer. And now you know about many crimes he committed with members of his enterprise.\"",
      "Slavik said Combs used \"power, violence and fear\" to rule a criminal enterprise, which allegedly facilitated brutal sex crimes. Slavik said Combs \"counted on silence and shame\" to allow his abuse to continue. She also said he used a \"small army\" of employees to harm women and then cover it up.",
      "\"He thought that his fame, wealth and power put him above the law,\" Slavik said.",
      "Combs, 55, has denied the allegations against him. He is facing 15 years to life in prison if he's convicted. The high-profile trial, which began May 12 in federal court in Manhattan, is one of the most closely watched celebrity cases in recent years.",
      "Combs' attorneys will make their closing arguments on Friday, followed by an hour of prosecution rebuttal. The judge will then instruct the jury on relevant legal standards they should apply to reach a verdict. Jury deliberations might not start till next week.",
      "After calling on 34 witnesses over seven weeks \u2014 including Combs' ex-girlfriend, R&B singer Cassie Ventura Fine, and rapper Kid Cudi \u2014 the prosecution rested Tuesday. The defense also\u00a0rested that same day without calling any witnesses, presenting its case for less than 30 minutes. The hip-hop mogul\u00a0didn't take the stand.",
      "As is common after prosecutors rest at criminal trials, Combs' lawyers made arguments to toss out the charges, arguing the charges weren't proven. The judge said he'll rule at a later date.",
      "Charges against Sean \"Diddy\" Combs",
      "Combs has\u00a0pleaded not guilty\u00a0to five counts.",
      "The first count is racketeering conspiracy, which alleges he \"abused, threatened and coerced women and others around him to fulfill his sexual desires, protect his reputation, and conceal his conduct.\"",
      "Prosecutors allege Combs relied on employees, resources and influence of his business empire to create a criminal enterprise that engaged in, or attempted to engage in, \"sex trafficking, forced labor, interstate transportation for the purposes of prostitution, coercion and enticement to engage in prostitution, narcotics offenses, kidnapping, arson, bribery and obstruction of justice.\"",
      "The other four counts allege sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution.",
      "Prosecutors said in a court filing Wednesday that jury instructions would not need to address allegations regarding attempted arson, attempted kidnapping, or aiding and abetting sex trafficking, since the government \"is no longer planning to proceed on these theories of liability.\"",
      "Sean \"Diddy\" Combs decided to not testify",
      "Combs told U.S. District Judge Arun Subramanian on Tuesday that after thorough discussions with his attorneys, he decided he wouldn't testify.",
      "\"That is my decision, your honor,\" Combs said, adding: \"That is solely my decision.\"",
      "Prodded by the judge, he clarified further: \"I mean, it's my decision with my lawyers. ... My decision to make. I'm making it.\"",
      "Combs has been active in his defense, often writing notes to his lawyers and sometimes helping them decide when to stop questioning a witness. Earlier this month, Subramanian threatened to potentially have Combs removed from court after the judge said Combs kept making expressions to the jury, including looking at them and \"nodding vigorously\" during the testimony of graphic designer Bryana \"Bana\" Bongolan, a friend of Ventura Fine's.",
      "Prosecutors say Combs used connections to orchestrate \"freak-offs\"",
      "During the first week of the trial, Cassie Ventura Fine was called to the witness stand and testified that Combs pressured her into participating in \"freak-offs,\" drug-fueled episodes where Combs is accused of forcing attendees to perform sex acts with hired sex workers.",
      "Prosecutors have cited the events as evidence of sex trafficking and racketeering conspiracy, alleging that Combs relied on employees, associates and his business accounts to fly male sex workers to Miami, Los Angeles, Las Vegas and New York, where his staff set up hotel rooms for the encounters and cleaned up afterward.",
      "Over the decade of her on-and-off relationship with Combs, from 2007 until 2018, Ventura Fine said she was part of hundreds of such events.",
      "She also testified that Combs was psychologically and physically abusive, as seen in\u00a0security footage of a 2016 Los Angeles hotel incident in which Combs is shown punching and kicking her.",
      "Other early witnesses included a former security director at the hotel who testified that Combs bribed him over the incident, but he didn't accept. Another witness was a manager for a male stripper show who said he was contracted by Combs and Ventura Fine in 2012 to participate in \"freak-offs.\"",
      "Combs' attorneys presented the jury with mostly loving messages between Combs and Ventura Fine and argued that she was a willing participant. They said Combs' sexual habits and his \"kinky\" swinger lifestyle don't amount to sex trafficking.",
      "Another ex-girlfriend of Combs,\u00a0who testified for six days under the pseudonym \"Jane,\" said she felt pressured by Combs to do \"hotel nights\" with him. She testified she told Combs many times she didn't like the hotel events involving drugs and, at times, multiple male entertainers.",

On Thursday, it closed up 9 points, or 0.8%, to 6,141, just three points shy of its record closing high of 6,144 on February 19. The tech-heavy Nasdaq also flirted with its previous record of 20,174, set in December 2024, inching up 195 points, or 1%, on Thursday to close at 20,167.",
      "The market could surpass those previous records on Friday or early next week, analysts told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Wall Street has largely shrugged off concerns about tariffs and geopolitical tensions since early April, although there have been periods of volatility along the way. While these issues continue to pose risks to the U.S. economy, many investors are confident they'll skirt any major market downturns, at least in the short-term, experts say.",
      "\"We hear all those narratives of what could go wrong, or what is going wrong,\" said Bret Kenwell, an investment analyst at eToro. \"But the market doesn't seem to care. It's looking forward. It's plowing ahead, and it's been trading really well.\"",
      "Still, Wall Street is awaiting more news on Mr. Trump's tariffs, with a 90-day pause on his so-called reciprocal tariffs slated to end on July 9. And Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned last week that tariffs are likely to drive up inflation later this year, slowing economic growth.",
      "Here are three reasons why experts say the market is rebounding.",
      "Easing concerns about tariffs",
      "Since April, the markets have whipsawed in response to the Trump administration's on-again, off-again tariff policies.",
      "While uncertainty around the impact of the levies remains, analysts say investor concern has faded as trade negotiations have entered a quieter phase after the Trump administration\u00a0struck a deal with China earlier this month.",
      "\"We've gone into a period where we haven't had a lot of disruptive noise coming either out of Washington or among our trading partners,\" said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott. \"I think that's helped to sort of cool anxieties, at least for the time being.\"",
      "The next benchmark will be July 9, when the president's 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs comes to an end. If the U.S. slips back into a more intense trade situation, the markets could show more volatility, Kenwell said.",
      "So far, data suggests a resilient economy, although some Wall Street economists have warned the economy may soon face headwinds.",
      "A\u00a0report from the Wells Fargo Investment Institute released Thursday predicts that the brunt of the tariffs impact will hit in the third quarter. The analysis also warns the tariffs could leave the U.S. with \"historically high and potentially debilitating levies.\"",
      "Optimism about tech stocks",
      "Technology stocks, dominated by the so-called \"magnificent 7\" \u2014 consisting of Nvidia, Apple, Amazon and other tech giants\u2014 have been integral in driving the market rebound, analysts say.",
      "Tech has become the best performing sector so far in the second quarter, a period which spans April through June. Financial companies such as banks and insurance firms have also been performing well, he added. According to Kenwell, those two sectors alone represent over 40% of the S&P 500.",
      "Chip company Nvidia closed at a record high on Thursday, allowing the company to retake its crown as the world's most valuable company. The tech giant's stock has soared almost 62% since the market's 2025 bottom on April 8.",
      "AI-powered companies have gained momentum in recent weeks, with Micron Technology, which sells computer memory and data storage, beating earnings expectations for the latest quarter, Vital Knowledge analyst Adam Crisafulli pointed out.",
      "Investors have gravitated towards tech stocks, Luschini said, given their high free cash flow and potential for strong earnings growth.",
      "\"I think investors are looking at them as sort of a bastion of safety,\" he said.",
      "Signs of a potential rate cut",
      "Investors have been buoyed by forecasts for more rate cuts from the Federal Reserve.",
      "At the Fed's June meeting, the central bank said it would\u00a0hold rates steady but pencilled in two cuts for the remainder of the year. A rate cut could come as soon as the next meeting, July 29-30, but it's more likely it will happen during the September meeting, experts say.",

      "Hadayia isn't the only one in this position. Zeldin's immediate termination of some $3 billion from the Environmental and Climate Justice block program impacted 350 environmental organizations, cities and tribes that all saw their grants evaporate without warning.",
      "Environmental justice grants are intended to help protect people from disproportionate exposure to industrial pollutants or environmental hazards and ensure everyone has access to a healthy living environment. For instance, lower-income communities that live near factories are often more exposed to pollutants that may damage their health.",
      "Rather than sue the agency on its own, as many others are currently doing, Air Alliance Houston will be trying a new legal tactic: joining a first-of-its-kind proposed\u00a0class action lawsuit against the EPA and Zeldin to restore funding.",
      "\"We're not in it just for us,\" Hadayia told CBS News, \"Communities across the country that were\u00a0 selected for these funds all have needs. The class action benefits the greater good.\"",
      "EPA cut funding to program that tracks permits for pollution",
      "Air Alliance Houston was awarded a $3.1-million \"community change grant\" by the Biden EPA in 2024 to expand a program it created to bring more transparency to the Texas state environmental permitting process. The program, called Air Mail, tracks permits for pollution and alerts communities in Harris County, Texas, when a company requests a permit, so people know what may be emitted into the air and water near their home. Hadayia planned to expand the program to 10 other counties in Texas.",
      "She was one of 2,700 applicants who applied for the award. In fact, it was the first time Hadayia had ever tried to win a federal grant for Air Alliance Houston, and she was thrilled to receive the government's support.",
      "\"We didn't want to have to rely on private philanthropy forever,\" she said.",
      "She filled out 20 pages of forms detailing requirements, compliance certification, underwent rigorous vetting and completed numerous checklists and reviews. In February, she said she seemed to lose consistent access to the grant money without warning, although at times, it would appear again in the nonprofit's accounts.",
      "\"Randomly with no notice, I would get access to the money again,\" Hadayia said.",
      "Between February and May, she checked her account twice a day, every day. On four occasions, she said she successfully accessed funds, withdrawing a total of $60,000 to reimburse eligible expenses before she finally received a termination letter on May 1.",
      "The EPA did not respond to questions about why it terminated the grants.",
      "\"We believe that our contract was illegally terminated. There was nothing in our terms and conditions that allows an administration \u2014 Trump or otherwise \u2014 to cancel a federal contract because they don't like what the contract is about,\" Hadayia told CBS News. \"There was no noncompliance. There was no fraud, waste and abuse. We were selected rigorously and\u00a0 appropriately. We met all of the requirements. We were doing everything right.\"",
      "The new legal strategy for environmental groups",
      "Air Alliance Houston is one of 23 plaintiffs in the suit, and together, they are hoping the court will grant their request to certify and move forward as a class action. The other plaintiffs include environmental organizations, as well as local city governments, like Kalamazoo County, Michigan, and federally recognized tribes such as the Native Village of Kipnuk in Alaska.",
      "Like Air Alliance Houston, all of the plaintiffs were awarded grants of various amounts through the Environmental and Climate Justice Program, which was funded with $3 billion from the Inflation Reduction Act. The purpose of the grants is to address the climate crisis and various environmental harms at the local level.",
      "The grants were awarded to groups in rural and urban communities throughout the United States for a variety of initiatives including air quality monitoring, tree planting in urban heat areas, lead pipes replacement to improve community drinking water systems and resilience projects to bolster communities against intensifying extreme weather.",
      "CBS News contacted the EPA about the lawsuit, but the agency responded in an email saying it does not comment on current or pending litigation.",
      "Suing the Trump administration has become a full-time job for many environmental organizations affected by its funding cuts. Major groups like the Environmental Defense Fund, or the Natural Resources Defense Council, which employs hundreds of people and generate roughly $200 million in annual revenue, can sustain prolonged legal challenges to the federal government. Since 2025, the NRDC has been involved in 11 cases against the Trump administration.",
      "The nonprofits say that utilizing the court system is the only check on power they can lean on, and to date, the Trump administration has not prevailed in any of the environmental lawsuits filed. It is currently appealing the rulings, many of which would restore funding to environmental groups.",
      "Some nonprofits have been successful in getting their funding restarted, even during the appeals process. But not all nongovernmental organizations have the resources for a sustained legal battle.",
      "Air Alliance Houston is a small group that employs just 13 people, Hadaiya included, and it often spends more money than it makes. In 2023, according to available tax records, it generated $2.5 million in revenue, but had more than $2.7 million in expenses.",
      "The class action lawsuit would make it possible for Air Alliance Houston and smaller nonprofits to win broad relief, rather than piecemeal outcomes, and to pool their resources for what may be a long legal fight against the Trump EPA.",
      "Jillian Blanchard, a vice president at the Climate Change and Environmental Justice program at Lawyers for Good Government, called the termination of the EPA grants \"unconstitutional\" and said in a statement it was \"not only destabilizing local projects addressing pollution, public health, and climate resilience,\" but also violates \"core principles of administrative law and the separation of powers.\"",
      "Her group joined EarthJustice, the Southern Environmental Law Center and the Public Rights Project to file the case on behalf of the plaintiffs.",
      "Blanchard told CBS News she's never seen a class action lawsuit filed against the federal government over environmental funding issues. By bringing the class action case, the hope is to provide relief to the full class of eligible recipients, rather than forcing individual groups to seek pro bono legal assistance or spend their own limited budgets navigating their case through the court system.",
      "Hadayia considers herself fortunate, since she hasn't needed to furlough staff after her funds were cut. But she hopes the lawsuit can reinstate the grant, so she can finish the work. She wants the same for the other 349 eligible class members of the suit, who also spent significant time applying for awards to support communities that are struggling to address environmental pollution and climate change impacts.",
      "\"It is the one-two punch of this administration to 'unleash American energy' by taking all of the\u00a0 roadblocks away,\" said Hadayia. \"And at the same time, pulling out the resources from groups like mine whose mission is to advocate for the opposite, whose mission is to be the watchdog for those industries.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump called the legislation the \"ultimate codification of our agenda\" to \"make America great again.\"",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The White House made a push for the centerpiece legislation of President Trump's second term, hosting a \"One, Big, Beautiful Event\" on Thursday highlighting the bill amid intraparty disagreements and roadblocks in the Senate as lawmakers near a Fourth of July deadline.",
      "After the House narrowly approved the legislation that addresses the president's tax, defense, border and energy priorities last month, Senate GOP leaders are working to pass the bill in the upper chamber. The bill would then be sent back to the House to approve the changes before it can reach Mr. Trump's desk for his signature. But the\u00a0self-imposed July 4 deadline looms large over the effort, with key disagreements remaining.",
      "With an array of working-class Americans standing behind him, from farmers to electrical workers, the president claimed the bill would lower Americans' tax burdens, make permanent his first administration's tax cuts and eliminate taxes on tips.",
      "\"This is the ultimate codification of our agenda to \u2014 very simply, a phrase that's been used pretty well by me over the past 10 years, but maybe even before that \u2014 make America great again,\" Mr. Trump said in the White House East Room.",
      "He also called the legislation the \"single-most important piece of border legislation ever to cross the floor of Congress,\" pointing to the bill's pledge to hire thousands of new border patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. The president reiterated his administration's goal of deporting at least 1 million undocumented immigrants every year.",
      "It was Tom Homan, Mr. Trump's border czar, who had the strongest words for Congress at the White House, saying he's tired of meeting parents whose children have been killed by someone in the country illegally, or parents whose children have been killed by drugs brought into the country.",
      "\"What the hell is the matter with everybody up in Congress? People are dying every day. \u2026 Pass the bill so we can make this country safe.\"",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt met with House Republicans on the conservative Republican Study Committee on Wednesday and told reporters that the administration is working to \"make sure everyone understands this bill needs to be back on the president's desk by July 4.\"",
      "\"The White House and the president have been consistently engaged in this process since the very beginning, both on the House side and on the Senate side,\" Leavitt said, adding that Mr. Trump \"is always willing to make calls, and we're going to get this bill done.\"",
      "But as the deadline approaches, Republicans in Congress have squabbled over key provisions in the legislation, like Medicaid restrictions used to pay for the bill's new spending.",
      "Shortly before the president's afternoon event, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said he's asking Congress to remove a tax provision that targets dividends, royalties, interest and business profits earned by individuals and institutions abroad. Complying with Bessent's request would make the legislation more expensive.",
      "Senate Republicans have proposed steeper cuts to Medicaid funding in part by lowering provider taxes \u2014 which states use to help fund their share of Medicaid costs \u2014 from 6% to 3.5% by 2031. The House sought to lower federal costs by freezing states' provider taxes at current rates and prohibiting them from establishing new provider taxes. The Senate's move has sparked pushback, and threatened to complicate the delicate balance reached in the House.",
      "Then on Thursday morning, Senate Democrats on the Budget Committee announced that the provider tax plan was among a handful of key provisions that the Senate's rulekeeper had determined would violate what's known as the Byrd Rule, which requires that the legislation only include provisions that have a direct impact on federal spending.",
      "The parliamentarian's rulings",
      "Senate parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough has been examining the legislation to determine whether any provisions violate Senate rules. Any that are in violation are subject to a 60-vote threshold, rather than the simple majority required under the reconciliation process.",
      "Senate Democrats said the parliamentarian also weighed in on a measure cutting federal funds to states that use Medicaid infrastructure to provide health care coverage to undocumented immigrants, along with banning Medicaid from covering gender transition services.",
      "The announcement on the rulings came days after the parliamentarian determined that Republicans can't include language that would make it harder to challenge the government's actions in court, along with a section barring immigrants who are not citizens or lawful permanent residents from receiving food assistance benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.",
      "The parliamentarian also rejected a proposal that would have sold off millions of acres of public lands. She struck provisions regarding the sale of electric vehicles used by the U.S. Postal Service and several immigration-related measures, including limiting certain funding for \"sanctuary cities\" and allowing states to conduct border security and immigration enforcement.",
      "Senate Republicans are working to bring some of the measures into compliance with the parliamentarian's rulings; her deliberations on other parts of the legislation are ongoing.",
      "GOP Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana called the parliamentarian's decision on the provider tax a \"setback,\" adding that Senate Republicans would decide whether to rewrite the details of the provision to comply with the Byrd Rule \u2014 or move forward without the provider tax.",
      "The move sparked pushback among some congressional Republicans. Rep. Greg Steube, a Florida Republican, said Vice President JD Vance, the president of the Senate, should overrule the parliamentarian. And GOP Sen. Tommy Tuberville of Alabama said she should be fired.",
      "Sen. Rick Scott, a Florida Republican, told reporters Thursday that the parliamentarian's ruling was \"pretty frustrating.\" But he said he's \"optimistic that we can come up with ways to make sure we fulfill the Trump agenda and also have fiscal sanity.\" And Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, said he expected the conference would try to retool the provision. Although he doesn't agree with the ruling, Graham said he has \"no intention of overruling her.\"",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune, who was asked about the possibility of overruling the parliamentarian earlier this month, said \"we're not going there.\"",
      "But Thune faced difficulties even before the rulekeeper's decisions, as he worked to keep his conference together on the massive legislation. On Wednesday, he told reporters, \"We're working with all of our members to try to get people comfortable with the bill.\"",
      "With a 53-seat majority, Senate GOP leaders can afford to lose just three Republicans on the bill, with all Democrats expected to oppose.",
      "Thune said earlier in the week that \"when push comes to shove, you're looking at whether or not you're going to allow the perfect to become the enemy of the good.\"",
      "\"You have to recognize that this is a process whereby everybody doesn't get everything they want,\" Thune said. \"But I think we've produced a bill working with the House, working with the White House, that will get the requisite number of Republican senators to vote for it so that we can pass it.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bill-moyers-dies-at-91/",
    "published": "Thu, 26 Jun 2025 17:15:59 -0400",
    "summary": "A former White House press secretary, Bill Moyers also worked as a correspondent for CBS News during his long career in TV journalism.",
    "story": [
      "Bill Moyers, the former White House press secretary who became one of television's most honored journalists, masterfully using a visual medium to illuminate a world of ideas, died Thursday at age 91. His former producer, Judy Doctoroff, confirmed his death to CBS News.",
      "Moyers died in a New York City hospital, according to longtime friend Tom Johnson, the former CEO of CNN and an assistant to Moyers during Lyndon B. Johnson's administration. Moyers' son, William Cope Moyers, said his father died at Memorial Sloan Kettering in New York after a long illness.",
      "Moyers' career ranged from youthful Baptist minister to deputy director of the Peace Corps, from Johnson's press secretary to newspaper publisher, senior news analyst for \"The CBS Evening News\" and chief correspondent for \"CBS Reports.\"",
      "But it was for public television that Moyers produced some of TV's most cerebral and provocative series. In hundreds of hours of PBS programs, he proved at home with subjects ranging from government corruption to modern dance, from drug addiction to media consolidation, from religion to environmental abuse.",
      "In 1988, Moyers produced \"The Secret Government\" about the Iran-Contra scandal during the Reagan administration and simultaneously published a book under the same name. Around that time, he galvanized viewers with \"Joseph Campbell and the Power of Myth,\" a series of six one-hour interviews with the prominent religious scholar. The accompanying book became a best-seller.",
      "His televised chats with poet Robert Bly almost single-handedly launched the 1990s Men's Movement, and his 1993 series \"Healing and the Mind\" had a profound impact on the medical community and on medical education.",
      "In a medium that supposedly abhors \"talking heads\" - shots of subject and interviewer talking - Moyers came to specialize in just that. He once explained why: \"The question is, are the talking heads thinking minds and thinking people? Are they interesting to watch? I think the most fascinating production value is the human face.\"",
      "Demonstrating what someone called \"a soft, probing style\" in the native Texas accent he never lost, Moyers was a humanist who investigated the world with a calm, reasoned perspective, whatever the subject.",
      "From some quarters, he was blasted as a liberal thanks to his links with Johnson and public television, as well as his no-holds-barred approach to investigative journalism. It was a label he didn't necessarily deny.",
      "\"I'm an old-fashioned liberal when it comes to being open and being interested in other people's ideas,\" he said during a 2004 radio interview. But Moyers preferred to term himself a \"citizen journalist\" operating independently, outside the establishment.",
      "Public television (and his self-financed production company) gave him free rein to throw \"the conversation of democracy open to all comers,\" he said in a 2007 interview with The Associated Press.",
      "\"I think my peers in commercial television are talented and devoted journalists,\" he said another time, \"but they've chosen to work in a corporate mainstream that trims their talent to fit the corporate nature of American life. And you do not get rewarded for telling the hard truths about America in a profit-seeking environment.\"",
      "Over the years, Moyers was showered with honors, including more than 30 Emmys, 11 George Foster Peabody awards, three George Polks and, twice, the Alfred I. duPont-Columbia University Gold Baton Award for career excellence in broadcast journalism. In 1995, he was inducted into the Television Hall of Fame.",
      "Born in Hugo, Oklahoma, on June 5, 1934, Billy Don Moyers was the son of a dirt farmer-truck driver who soon moved his family to Marshall, Texas. High school led him into journalism.",
      "\"I wanted to play football, but I was too small. But I found that by writing sports in the school newspaper, the players were always waiting around at the newsstand to see what I wrote,\" he recalled.",
      "He worked for the Marshall News Messenger at age 16. Deciding that Bill Moyers was a more appropriate byline for a sportswriter, he dropped the \"y\" from his name.",
      "He graduated from the University of Texas and earned a master's in divinity from Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary. He was ordained and preached part time at two churches but later decided his call to the ministry \"was a wrong number.\"",
      "His relationship with Johnson began when he was in college; he wrote the then-senator offering to work in his 1954 re-election campaign. Johnson was impressed and hired him for a summer job. He was back in Johnson's employ as a personal assistant in the early 1960s and for two years, he worked at the Peace Corps, eventually becoming deputy director.",
      "On the day John F. Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas, Moyers was in Austin helping with the presidential trip. He flew back to Washington on Air Force One with newly sworn-in President Johnson, for whom he held various jobs over the ensuing years, including press secretary.",
      "Moyers' stint as presidential press secretary was marked by efforts to mend the deteriorating relationship between Johnson and the media. But the Vietnam war took its toll and Moyers resigned in December 1966.",
      "Of his departure from the White House, he wrote later, \"We had become a war government, not a reform government, and there was no creative role left for me under those circumstances.\"",
      "He conceded that he may have been \"too zealous in my defense of our policies\" and said he regretted criticizing journalists such as Pulitzer Prize-winner Peter Arnett, then a special correspondent with the AP, and CBS's Morley Safer for their war coverage.",
      "In 1967, Moyers became publisher of Long Island-based Newsday and concentrated on adding news analyses, investigative pieces and lively features. Within three years, the suburban daily had won two Pulitzers. He left the paper in 1970 after the ownership changed. That summer, he traveled 13,000 miles around the country and wrote a best-selling account of his odyssey: \"Listening to America: a Traveler Rediscovers His Country.\"",
      "His next venture was in public television and he won critical acclaim for \"Bill Moyers Journal,\" a series\u00a0in which interviews ranged from Gunnar Myrdal, the Swedish economist, to poet Maya Angelou. He was chief correspondent of \"CBS Reports\" from 1976 to 1978, went back to PBS for three years, and then was senior news analyst for CBS from 1981 to 1986.",
      "When CBS cut back on documentaries, he returned to PBS for much less money. \"If you have a skill that you can fold with your tent and go wherever you feel you have to go, you can follow your heart's desire,\" he once said.",
      "Then in 1986, he and his wife, Judith Davidson Moyers, became their own bosses by forming Public Affairs Television,\u00a0an independent shop\u00a0that has not only produced programs such as the 10-hour \"In Search of the Constitution,\" but also paid for them through its own fundraising efforts.",
      "His projects in the 21st century included \"Now,\" a weekly PBS public affairs program; a new edition of \"Bill Moyers Journal\" and a podcast covering racism, voting rights and the rise of Donald Trump, among other subjects.",
      "Moyers married Judith Davidson, a college classmate, in 1954, and they raised three children. Judith eventually became her husband's partner, creative collaborator and president of their production company.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Thursday that the Trump administration doesn't have any meetings scheduled with Iran, one day after President Trump said that the U.S. and Iran would talk and meet \"next week.\"",
      "\"We don't have anything scheduled as of now,\" Leavitt told reporters during Thursday's press briefing, adding that she spoke with Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff on Thursday morning and the administration continues to be in \"close communication\" with the Iranians and intermediaries such as the Qataris.",
      "\"We are in touch, and if there is a meeting, we will let you know, as we always do,\" Leavitt said.",
      "Witkoff said earlier this week that his interactions with the Iranians had been \"promising\" and that the U.S. was \"hopeful that we can have a long-term peace agreement that resurrects Iran.\"",
      "The president floated talks during a Wednesday news conference at the NATO summit in The Hague, Netherlands, where he touted the success of a weekend Pentagon operation targeting Iranian nuclear sites.",
      "\"We're going to talk to them next week, with Iran,\" the president told reporters Wednesday. \"We may sign an agreement, I don't know. ... If we got a document it wouldn't be bad. We're going to meet with them, actually. We're going to meet with them.\"",
      "The president at the time didn't specify who would be involved in such a meeting or where it would take place, and the White House didn't offer further details. On Thursday, Leavitt explained the basic goal of any future meetings.",
      "\"We want to ensure we can get to a place where Iran agrees to a non-enrichment, civil nuclear program,\" Leavitt said. \"And there are many other requests that the United States has.\"",
      "The Trump administration is considering a range of options to entice Iran back to the negotiating table, a source familiar with the planning told CBS News.",
      "Options include helping Iran to access $20 billion to $30 billion, so it can build a civilian, non-enrichment, energy-producing nuclear program, the source said. The funds would come not from the U.S., but from U.S. allies in the Middle East.",
      "Sanctions relief is also under discussion \u2014 provided that Iran commits to zero enrichment of uranium. Another possibility is allowing Iranian authorities to access the $6 billion currently sitting in restricted foreign bank accounts. Administration officials have even considered encouraging Middle Eastern partners to pay for Iran to rebuild the Fordo nuclear facility as a non-enrichment operation. CNN first reported the potential options.",
      "The Pentagon held a news conference Thursday morning defending the success of the strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities over the weekend, and administration officials were set to brief lawmakers on Capitol Hill on Thursday afternoon.",
      "The U.S. has been pushing for a direct meeting with Iran since the strikes, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio telling \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday that \"we have bent over backwards to create a deal with these people.\"",

It happened at a baggage claim area where EgyptAir Flight 981 luggage was being deposited after arriving at the Washington, D.C.-area airport.",

    "summary": "The Supreme Court rejected Planned Parenthood's challenge to South Carolina's attempt to bar the organization from participating in its Medicaid program.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Thursday rejected Planned Parenthood's challenge to South Carolina's attempt to bar the organization from participating in its Medicaid program, clearing the way for the state to strip the organization of Medicaid funds.",
      "The Supreme Court ruled 6-3 in the case of Medina v. Planned Parenthood South Atlantic to find that Planned Parenthood and a patient cannot sue the state of South Carolina under federal civil rights law to enforce a provision of the Medicaid Act that aims to ensure a beneficiary can obtain medical care from the provider of their choosing. Justice Neil Gorsuch delivered the opinion for the court. The three liberal justices, Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson, were in dissent.",
      "The court's conservative majority reversed a decision from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit that allowed Planned Parenthood's lawsuit against state officials to move forward and prevented South Carolina from excluding the organization from its Medicaid program.",
      "The ruling is likely to pave the way for more states to exclude Planned Parenthood from their Medicaid programs, a move that anti-abortion rights have been pushing for several years.",
      "\"[T]he decision whether to let private plaintiffs enforce a new statutory right poses delicate questions of public policy. New rights for some mean new duties for others. And private enforcement actions, meritorious or not, can force governments to direct money away from public services and spend it instead on litigation,\" Gorsuch wrote. \"The job of resolving how best to weigh those competing costs and benefits belongs to the people's elected representatives, not unelected judges charged with applying the law as they find it.\"",
      "In a dissent joined by Sotomayor and Kagan, Jackson accused the court's majority of weakening landmark civil rights protections that Congress enacted after the Civil War, which allow citizen to seek redress in federal court for alleged deprivation of their rights.",
      "\"[T]oday's decision is likely to result in tangible harm to real people,\" Jackson wrote. \"At a minimum, it will deprive Medicaid recipients in South Carolina of their only meaningful way of enforcing a right that Congress has expressly granted to them. And, more concretely, it will strip those South Carolinians \u2014 and countless other Medicaid recipients around the country \u2014 of a deeply personal freedom: the 'ability to decide who treats us at our most vulnerable.' The court today disregards Congress's express desire to prevent that very outcome.\"",
      "The White House applauded the Supreme Court's decision, with spokesman Harrison Fields calling it a \"major victory for common sense\" that \"underscores the president's longstanding position that abortion policies should be determined by the states and that taxpayers should never be responsible for funding elective abortions.\"",
      "Medina v. Planned Parenthood South Atlantic",
      "The question before the court was a narrow one, involving whether a Medicaid beneficiary could sue to enforce their ability to seek care from the qualified and willing provider of their choosing, known as the any-qualified-provider requirement.",
      "The legal wrangling over South Carolina's attempt to stop public dollars from going to a Planned Parenthood affiliate in the state began in 2018, four years before the Supreme Court overturned Roe. v. Wade.",
      "In South Carolina, abortion is banned after six weeks gestation, and Planned Parenthood provides abortion services outside of Medicaid only as allowed under state law. Additionally, federal law bars Medicaid from paying for abortions except in cases of rape or incest, or to save the life of the mother.",
      "But seven years ago, South Carolina's Republican governor, Henry McMaster, issued an executive order that directed the state's health department to deem abortion providers unqualified to provide family-planning services under Medicaid and terminate their enrollment agreements.",
      "In response, the South Carolina Department of Health and Human Services notified Planned Parenthood South Atlantic that its provider agreements were being cancelled because it was no longer qualified to provide medical services to Medicaid beneficiaries. The affiliate has clinics in Charleston and Columbia, and offers prenatal and postpartum services, along with physical exams and screenings for cancer and other health conditions.",
      "In the wake of the state's decision to boot Planned Parenthood from its Medicaid program, Julie Edwards, a patient who received medical services from the organization, and Planned Parenthood filed a lawsuit under federal civil rights law to challenge the move.",
      "Edwards argued that South Carolina's termination of Planned Parenthood's agreement violated her right to choose her provider under the Medicaid Act.",
      "A federal district judge ruled in favor of Planned Parenthood, finding that South Carolina likely violated the any-qualified-provider provision when it excluded Planned Parenthood from its Medicaid program. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit ultimately allowed the suit to proceed and prevented South Carolina from keeping Planned Parenthood out of its Medicaid program.",
      "The dispute before the Supreme Court did not involve abortion, but it came to the high court amid a push by several Republican-led states to block Planned Parenthood from receiving Medicaid funds.",
      "Paige Johnson, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood South Atlantic, criticized the ruling but said the clinic will continue to offering care in South Carolina, including to Medicaid beneficiaries.",
      "\"Today's decision is a grave injustice that strikes at the very bedrock of American freedom and promises to send South Carolina deeper into a health care crisis,\" she said in a statement. \"Twice, justices of this Court denied to even hear this case because Gov. McMaster's intent is clear: weaponize anti-abortion sentiment to deprive communities with low incomes of basic health care.\"",
      "Alexis McGill Johnson, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, warned that attacks on the organization will likely continue and put at risk patients' access to health care services.",
      "\"Today, the Supreme Court once again sided with politicians who believe they know better than you, who want to block you from seeing your trusted health care provider and making your own health care decisions,\" she said in a statement. \"And the consequences are not theoretical in South Carolina or other states with hostile legislatures. Patients need access to birth control, cancer screenings, STI testing and treatment, and more. And right now, lawmakers in Congress are trying to 'defund' Planned Parenthood as part of their long-term goal to shut down Planned Parenthood and ban abortion nationwide.\"",

    "summary": "New GDP data shows the U.S. economy shrank at an 0.5% annual pace from January through March, the first quarterly drop in three years.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. economy shrank faster than previously thought during the first three months of 2025, with growth contracting for the first time in three years.",
      "The country's gross domestic product fell at an annual rate of 0.5% from January through March, the Commerce Department reported Thursday in its third and final GDP report\u00a0for the period. The agency's\u00a0initial first-quarter GDP report, issued in April, estimated a 0.3% decline, which was later revised to a 0.2% dip in its second print.",
      "First-quarter growth was weighed down by a surge of imports as U.S. companies and households rushed to buy foreign goods before the Trump administration's tariffs went into effect. Although a surge in imports can appear to lower economic growth because it shows a shift away from domestic consumption, that doesn't tell the whole story about the U.S. economy, experts say.",
      "A category within the GDP data called \"real final sales to private domestic purchasers,\" which measures the economy's underlying strength, rose at a 1.9% annual rate from January through March. While that represents a solid number, it's down from the 2.9% pace in the fourth quarter of 2024 and from the Commerce Department's previous estimate of 2.5% January-March growth.",
      "The new data also shows that consumers sharply pared spending earlier this year, with growth at 0.5%, down from a robust 4% during the last three months of 2024. First-quarter consumer spending fell to its lowest level since the pandemic ended, with Americans particularly cutting back on recreation and dining, Greg Daco, EY-Parthenon chief economist, said in a research note.",
      "\"What we're witnessing is an economy temporarily buffered from the tariff shock by smart logistics maneuvers, proactive pricing strategies and some foreign exporter concessions,\" Daco said.",
      "On Tuesday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told a House committee that businesses' rush to build their inventories earlier this year ahead of tariffs taking effect has helped delay any inflationary impacts from the import duties.",
      "Because tariffs are paid by domestic importers, all or some of the costs are typically passed onto consumers. Stocking up on inventory early in the year has allowed companies to sell those goods without the added costs of tariffs, Powell noted.",
      "\"The things that are being sold at retail now, they might have been put into inventory before the tariffs in February or March,\" the Fed chief said. \"We think we should start to see this over the summer, in the June numbers and in the July numbers.\"",
      "Second-quarter rebound?",
      "The category of real final sales to private domestic purchasers includes consumer spending and private investment, but excludes volatile items like exports, inventories and government spending. Ryan Sweet of Oxford Economics called the decline in that figure \"troubling,\u2033 though he doesn't expect to make a significant change to his near-term economic forecast.",
      "Sweet noted that he'll be looking Friday's release of personal consumption expenditures, or PCE, because it will \"show how the revisions impacted the trajectory of consumption headed into this quarter.\"",
      "The PCE, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation measure, shows household spending on goods and services.",
      "Economists are forecasting that the first-quarter's influx in imports won't be repeated in the second quarter, which spans April through June, and shouldn't weigh on GDP during the period.",
      "Economic growth is forecast to bounce back to 3% in the second quarter, according to economists polled by financial data firm FactSet. The Commerce Department will release its first estimate of second-quarter GDP on July 30.",

      "The precise timing of the cuts could be affected by a looming decision by the Supreme Court which could soon hand down a ruling on whether to leave in place a lower court's order that temporarily paused government-wide layoffs. The Justice Department asked the high court earlier this month to lift the district court's injunction and allow it to move forward with the administration's plans for reductions in force, or layoffs.",
      "In a statement issued Wednesday, the president of the American Foreign Service Association, which represents American foreign service officers, said the association \"urgently calls on the Department of State to comply with a federal court order that prohibits federal agencies from executing mass layoffs while litigation is ongoing.\"",

      "Where and when is the wedding?",
      "Bezos, 61, and Sanchez's wedding extravaganza kicks off in Venice this Thursday, with the ceremony scheduled to take place Saturday at an undisclosed location.",
      "The duo were sighted earlier this week as they arrived via taxi-boat at the Aman Hotel, a five-star hotel on the Grand Canal in Venice.",
      "The nuptials will mark Bezos' second marriage, after his first marriage to philanthropist Mackenzie Scott ended in 2019. Sanchez, 55, was previously married to Patrick Whitesell, the executive chair of talent firm Endeavor, with their marriage also ending in 2019.",
      "The wedding ceremony is likely to be held on San Giorgio Maggiore,\u00a0according to CNN. One of the islands that make up Venice, San Giorgio Maggiore is known for the Church of San Giorgio Maggiore, designed by the architect Andrea Palladio in the 1500s.",
      "A protest group called \"No Space for Bezos\" declared victory this week, saying that the couple has moved their planned post-wedding party on June 28 to a shipyard on the outskirts of Venice rather than the 14th-century\u00a0Grande Scuola Misericordia in central Venice, CNN reported.",
      "How much will the Bezos-Sanchez wedding cost?",
      "The three-day event could cost between about $64 million to $76 million, Luca Zaia, president of the Veneto regional government that comprises Venice, told reporters on Tuesday, according to The Globe and Mail.",
      "About 80% of the wedding provisions will be sourced from Venetian vendors, the Associated Press reported, citing people close to the couple. These products include locally made pastries and hand-blown glass from Murano, an island known for its long history of glassmaking.",
      "Bezos has a net worth of $230 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. That ranks him No. 3 on the index's list of the world's richest people, after Mark Zuckerberg ($246 billion) and Elon Musk ($385 billion)",
      "Who is attending?",
      "Bezos and Sanchez invited some 200 guests to celebrate with them in the Italian city, according to media reports. And the event is expected to draw plenty of star power, with guests including Oprah Winfrey; Tom Brady; Leonardo DiCaprio; Orlando Bloom; Mick Jagger; Katy Perry; and President Trump's daughter, Ivanka Trump, and her husband, Jared Kushner, the Associated Press reported. Italian media also covered the arrival of Microsoft founder Bill Gates, Kim Kardashian and fashion designer Diane von Furstenberg.",
      "According to the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera, at least 95 private planes have requested permission to land at Venice's Marco Polo airport.",
      "Who is Lauren Sanchez?",
      "Jeff Bezos, the Amazon founder and owner of The Washington Post, is marrying Lauren Sanchez, a former journalist turned children's book author. The couple went public with their relationship in 2019 and became engaged in 2023.",
      "Sanchez recently participated in Blue Origin's first all-women's space flight, which included \"CBS Mornings\" anchor Gayle King and singer-songwriter Katy Perry.

      "Sanchez's bachelorette party in Paris last month included Perry, Kardashian, Kris Jenner and Eva Longoria, according to AFP.",
      "What are the wedding protests about?",
      "Some Venice locals are expressing frustration over the city's decision to welcome wealthy tourists while failing to meet residents' needs.",
      "This comes amid a broader pushback against tourism in parts of Europe. Last week, protestors gathered in Venice\u00a0and other popular European destinations to protest a flood of visitors, who some critics blame for driving up housing costs and pushing out local residents. For the second year, Venice is requiring people visiting the city for a day to pay a tax to enter on certain summer dates.",
      "Among those protesting the wedding are the organizers of the \"No Space for Bezos\" campaign, which has the backing of a dozen different local organizations including housing advocates and university groups.",
      "Greenpeace joined the mix on Monday, with a handful of activists unfurling a giant banner in Venice's St. Mark's Square with a photo of Bezos and text that read: \"IF YOU CAN RENT VENICE FOR YOUR WEDDING YOU CAN PAY MORE TAX.\" Local police folded up the banner and took it away.",
      "Venetian officials have stood their ground, even as criticism of the event escalated.",

    "summary": "Older, wealthier Americans would see the biggest lifetime benefit from the Republican budget bill, while younger generations could see losses, a new analysis says.",
    "story": [
      "The Republican\u00a0budget package\u00a0aims to make President Donald Trump's tax cuts permanent while offering a host of new financial breaks. Yet the \"big, beautiful bill,\" as the legislation is dubbed, could also effectively transfer wealth from younger generations to older Americans over their lifetimes, a recent study finds.",
      "Long-term, the primary beneficiaries of the GOP bill would be older, wealthier Americans, while younger, middle- to low-income people would see fewer benefits, according to the analysis from the Penn Wharton Budget Model, a University of Pennsylvania think tank that studies the fiscal issues.",
      "The group's projection assesses the impact of proposed tax cuts under the bill, as well as reductions in federal programs such as Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, better known as food stamps. Penn Wharton also factors in the long-term fiscal impact of the debt the U.S. would likely have to issue to pay for the bill's tax cuts, the group said.",
      "\"Somebody has to pay\"",
      "Younger Americans would bear the brunt of the nation's spiraling debt, Kent Smetters, director of the Penn Wharton Budget Model, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"Somebody has to pay \u2014 nothing is for free. In this case, that's the future generations,\" he said. \"We have finally reached this inflection point where under any reasonable estimation, younger people are going to be worse off in the future\" if the current version of the bill is passed.",
      "For example, the bill would cost an infant born into a low-income family $14,100 over their lifetime. This loss stems from factors including reduced social safety net benefits and lower wages resulting from slower economic growth driven by increased national debt and deficits.",
      "On the other hand, a high-income 70-year-old stands to gain $120,000 over his remaining years due to the proposed legislation's tax cuts and other benefits, the analysis found.",
      "The House narrowly passed the legislation in May. Senate lawmakers are pressing to vote on the measure by the end of the week.",
      "The White House took issue with Penn Wharton's analysis.",
      "\"So-called 'experts' panning the One, Big, Beautiful Bill without a smidge of humility should remember that they made these same exact gloomy predictions about President Trump's tax cuts during his first term \u2013 tax cuts that helped usher in historic job, wage, investment and economic growth along with the first decline in wealth inequality in decades,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Biggest winners",
      "Like Penn Wharton, other researchers have said the Republican bill is likely to benefit wealthy Americans at the expense of people lower down the ladder.",
      "The measure would likely reduce the financial resources available to the lowest-earning 10% of U.S. households by $1,600 per year, or almost 4% of their annual income, according to a report published earlier this month by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. White House officials have previously questioned the CBO's scoring of the bill.",
      "But the highest-earning 10% of households would see a gain of $12,000 per year in resources, while middle-income households would see a gain of $500 to $1,000, the CBO projected. Its analysis is based on the bill's tax breaks, as well as reductions for federal programs and reductions in state funds for safety net programs such as Medicaid and food stamps.",
      "In considering the impact of higher U.S. debt on future generations, the cost would come in the form of lower wages and higher costs, such as more expensive mortgages, Smetters said.",
      "Already, the U.S. is spending more than $1 trillion a year to service its debt \u2014 almost double the amount it was paying five years ago, according to Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis data. That's more than the nation currently spends on defense,\u00a0data\u00a0from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute shows.",
      "Clock ticking",
      "Taking on more debt to pay for the GOP bill could make it tougher for the federal government to pay for programs like Social Security as more of its budget is eaten up by interest payments. Higher debt would also likely result in higher interest rates, as well as slowing economic growth, the Yale Budget Lab projects.",
      "Elements of the bill are still under debate on Capitol Hill, with congressional Republicans racing to meet a self-imposed July 4 deadline to send the package to President Trump for his signature. The last scheduled day in session for both the House and Senate before they leave town for the holiday is Friday, leaving little time to reach a deal.",
      "Some Republicans are at loggerheads over certain provisions, such as the state and local tax deduction, known as SALT, with House lawmakers pushing for a bigger deduction than in the Senate.",
      "If the bill moves ahead, the long-term combination of benefit reductions and swelling federal debt could outweigh the benefits of tax cuts for younger Americans, the Penn Wharton analysis said.",
      "\"Sometimes people say, 'If I'm in 40th-60th [percentile of income], I won't get SNAP or Medicaid,' but actually there is a chance that you could still,\" Smetters said. \"There is a chance anybody could be unemployed or be on food stamps.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Trump says the U.S. will meet with Iran next week, as a\u00a0tenuous ceasefire\u00a0between Israel and Iran holds for now.",
      "During a news conference Wednesday to cap off the NATO summit in The Hague, Netherlands, the president said there may be a formal agreement at some point with Iran, but he doesn't believe one is necessary because their nuclear sites were \"blown up to kingdom come.\"",
      "\"We're going to talk to them next week, with Iran,\" the president told reporters at the press conference, adding that the U.S. is going to \"meet\" with them, although he didn't specify who will be involved in the meeting or where it will take place.",
      "\"I don't care if I have an agreement or not,\" he said. \"The only thing we'd be asking for is what we were asking for before about, 'we want no nuclear.' But we destroyed the nuclear. In other words, that's destroyed. I said, 'Iran will not have nuclear.' Well, we blew it up. It's blown up to kingdom come. And so I don't feel very strongly about it. If we got a document, it wouldn't be bad.\"",
      "The president met with other world leaders on the sidelines of the summit, amid cautious optimism about the ceasefire the Trump administration brokered. The 12-day conflict left 28 people dead in Israel and hundreds in Iran.",
      "\"It was a 12-day war. And we think it's over,\" Mr. Trump said during the press conference. \"I don't think they're going to be going back at each other, I don't think so.\"",
      "\"Because I dealt with both, and they're both tired, exhausted,\" Mr. Trump said. \"They fought very, very hard and very viciously, very violently, and they were both satisfied to go home and get out. And can it start again? I guess some day it can, it could maybe start soon.\"",
      "At the summit, Mr. Trump said Iran's enrichment efforts were set back \"basically decades.\" The U.S.\u00a0strikes\u00a0on Iranian nuclear facilities were \"very, very successful. It's called 'obliteration,'\" he said at the news conference.\u00a0An initial classified assessment\u00a0by the Defense Intelligence Agency, however, estimated the strikes only set back Tehran's nuclear program by a matter of months, according to three sources familiar with its contents.",
      "Regarding the Israel-Hamas conflict, Mr. Trump expressed optimism and said there's been \"great progress.\"",
      "\"I think great progress is being made on Gaza,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I think because of this attack that we made, I think we're going to have some very good news.\"",
      "On Wednesday, Mr. Trump met with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, who complimented the president on his efforts to boost other countries' defense spending and on his efforts in the Middle East.",
      "\"You are a man of strength and also a man of peace,\" Rutte told Mr. Trump.",
      "Mr. Trump also met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Zelenskyy said they discussed \"how to achieve a ceasefire and a real peace deal.\"",
      "\"We appreciate the attention and the readiness to help bring peace close,\" Zelenskyy wrote on X, adding, \"Details will follow.\"",
      "The president said of his conversation with Zelenskyy, \"I took from the meeting that he'd like to see it end. I think it's a great time to end it. I'm going to speak to Vladimir Putin and see if we can get it ended.\"",
      "A Ukrainian BBC reporter, who said her husband is a soldier in Ukraine, asked the president whether the U.S. would provide Ukraine with Patriot missile defense systems, which intercept ballistic missiles.",
      "\"They do want to have the anti-missile missiles \u2026 the Patriots,\" Mr. Trump replied, \"and we're going to see if we can make some available.\" He said the missiles were \"hard to get,\" and the U.S. has been providing them to Israel. \"They're very effective \u2014 100% effective.\"",
      "The president, upon learning that the reporter was living with her children in Warsaw while her husband fights in Ukraine, said, \"That's rough stuff, right?\" And after he answered her question, he wished her luck and offered his regards to her husband.",
      "NATO members, with the exceptions of Spain and Slovakia, have agreed to a dramatic increase in their defense spending, to 5% of GDP, a goal pressed by Mr. Trump, though the U.S. defense spending is short of that target. Before leaving for the summit, Mr. Trump said the U.S. shouldn't have to reach that target, since it's contributed so much to NATO in the past.",
      "\"This week, the NATO allies committed to dramatically increase their defense spending to that 5% of GDP, something that no one really thought possible,\" Mr. Trump said at his press conference, adding that it will be known as \"The Hague defense commitment.\"",
      "Asked about Spain's refusal to commit to the 5% threshold, Mr. Trump said he liked Spain and its people, \"But Spain is the only country \u2014 out of all other countries \u2014 that refuses to pay,\" and he said it was getting \"a little bit of a free ride.\" The president went on to say that the U.S. is negotiating with Spain on trade, and \"we're going to make them pay twice as much.\"",
      "It was a whirlwind trip for Mr. Trump, who arrived in the Netherlands on Tuesday and is scheduled to fly back to Washington on Wednesday.",
      "The president said he's leaving NATO with a different perspective about Article 5 \u2014 the agreement that the allies will come to each other's aid when attacked \u2014 after hearing about it directly from fellow leaders. The president told reporters he no longer considers the alliance a \"rip-off,\" and wants the U.S. to help defend other NATO nations.",

      "In recent days, President Trump repeatedly declared \"total obliteration\" after three nuclear sites were bombed in a secret attack by the U.S. Meanwhile, an initial classified assessment found that the strikes set back Tehran's nuclear program by a matter of months, while Mr. Trump said the nuclear program was set back \"basically decades.\"",
      "Democrats questioned assertions regarding how much Iran's nuclear program has been hindered.",
      "\"I walk away from that briefing still under the belief that we have not obliterated the program,\" Sen.

It is certain that there is still significant capability, significant equipment that remain.\"",
      "\"You cannot bomb knowledge out of existence \u2014 no matter how many scientists you kill,\" Murphy added. \"There are still people in Iran who how to work centrifuges.

      "\"Listen, I hope that is the final assessment,\" Warner said. \"But if not, does that end up providing a false sense of comfort to the American people?\"",
      "Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, said he did not receive adequate answers about whether the nuclear stockpile was obliterated.",
      "\"What was clear is that there was no coherent strategy, no end game, no plan, no specific, no detailed plan on how Iran does not attain a nuclear weapon,\" Schumer said.",

      "\"The point is, we don't know. Anybody who says we know with certainty is making it up because we don't have a final battle damage assessment,\" he said. \"I think 'obliterated' is much too strong of word because it implies that it couldn't be reconstituted or somehow it was completely eliminated.\"",

    "story": [
      "\"I offer my congratulations on the victory over the fallacious Zionist regime,\" a message posted Thursday on Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's X account declared. Another post added the bold claim that Israel's government \"was practically knocked out and crushed under the blows of the Islamic Republic.\"",
      "In a recorded video address to his nation \u2014 his first public remarks since the U.S.-brokered ceasefire with Israel took effect on Tuesday \u2014 Khamenei went further, suggesting a \"large number of military and other targets\" in Israel had been targeted by Iran's missiles.",
      "They may have been targeted, but in reality, Iran's 12 days of missile launches saw relatively few rockets evade Israel's air defenses. A total of 28 people were killed, and none of them have been identified as government officials, but rather civilians killed when missiles struck apartment buildings and cities.",
      "Israel's strikes on Iran killed at least 30 military commanders, on the other hand, and, in combination with the U.S. strikes over the weekend, \"obliterated\" the country's nuclear program, according to President Trump. The U.S.-based group Human Rights Activists in Iran, which relies on a network of sources in the country, said Wednesday that the strikes had killed at least 1,054 people in Iran, including a total of 318 military personnel.",
      "Khamenei also claimed Iran had given \"the U.S. a big slap in the face\" by attacking the Al-Udeid Air Base in Qatar, which is home to thousands of American forces.",
      "But none of the roughly dozen missiles Iran fired at the sprawling base hit it. They were intercepted, despite the ayatollah's assertion of \"lots of damage\" to the site.",
      "Iranian government spokeswoman Fatemeh Mohajerani met with CBS News at her offices in Tehran on Thursday and said Iran would continue to pursue its nuclear program.",
      "\"We had no intention to move towards a nuclear bomb,\" Mohajerani said. \"It's Israel that has 90 nuclear warheads, but we did not want to go that way. Nonetheless, we will obtain the scientific knowledge to do what we want with our program.\"",
      "Assessing Iran's nuclear program, and cooperation with the IAEA",
      "While full assessments of the damage inflicted are still being compiled, the heads of two U.S. intelligence agencies said Wednesday that\u00a0\"new\" intelligence indicated\u00a0the Iranian nuclear enrichment program was likely set back by \"years.\" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said earlier Wednesday that the country's own intelligence assessment showed Iran's nuclear program was put back \"many years.\"",
      "Khamenei offered a very different take on Thursday \u2014 again, without any specifics or evidence. He claimed the U.S. had joined in Israel's strikes \"as it felt if it did not do so, the Zionist regime would get totally annihilated, so they entered the war to prevent this.\"",
      "\"They did not manage to do anything important to our nuclear facilities,\" he claimed, adding that Mr. Trump had \"overplayed the whole thing.\"",
      "Mohajerani on Thursday acknowledged to CBS News that the nuclear sites targeted by the U.S. strikes \"have been seriously damaged,\" adding, \"Any further reports should come from technical experts in the field.\"",
      "When pressed on the possibility the sites were completely destroyed, Mohajerani responded: \"I want to stress that these facilities have been seriously damaged. However, we must wait for the reports of our technical experts and specialists.\"",
      "Iran, in the wake of the ceasefire, has adopted legislation that will effectively forbid the country's government from cooperating in any way with the International Atomic Energy Agency. The United Nations' nuclear watchdog agency has for decades been the only outside entity given access to Iran's nuclear facilities, for monitoring purposes, and it has experts still in the country.",
      "Iranian state media said Thursday that the legislation was approved by the senior clerics of the Guardian Council and thus had the \"weight of law.\" Khamenei, who has the ultimate say on all matters in Iran, did not mention the IAEA in his video address on Thursday.",
      "On Thursday, IAEA Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi told a\u00a0French news podcast that the agency's assessment, based largely on photographic evidence and its unique and deep familiarity with Iran's nuclear sites, was that the U.S. and Israeli strikes had caused \"very significant physical damage to three sites: Natanz, Isfahan, and Fordo, where Iran had concentrated most of its activities related to uranium enrichment and conversion.\"",
      "He said he was still in communication with senior Iranian officials and had suggested a meeting with the country's foreign minister, \"to begin evaluating the arrangements for the [IAEA] inspectors' return to the [nuclear] sites.\"",
      "Grossi said he had yet to receive any reply, noting \"some tension right now\" between the agency and Iran's leadership, given \"political voices in Iran who believe the agency hasn't been impartial.\"",
      "The IAEA chief said he was \"enormously\" concerned by the Iranian government's decision to halt cooperation with the IAEA.",
      "\"The agency's presence in Iran is not some kind of generous gesture. It is an international responsibility. Iran is a member of the\u00a0Non-Proliferation Treaty and therefore must have an inspection system. It is a legal obligation from the point of view of international law, which cannot be suspended unilaterally,\" Grossi said. \"I hope that will not be the case, because otherwise we would be on the verge of a new major crisis.\"",
      "Anxiety in Iran fueling the ayatollah's claims?",
      "Khamenei's remarks on Thursday were heavy on rhetorical flourish and virtually devoid of any facts, and they may have been aimed more at Iran's people than the wider world.",
      "Iran's theocratic rulers, who swept to power with the 1979 Islamic Revolution that toppled a pro-Western government led by the royal family of the shah, have long maintained tight control over all media in the country, and many Iranians have little access to outside information.",
      "Still, especially among younger, more tech-savvy generations, there is an understanding of the degree to which Iran's people do not enjoy the freedoms that many other countries guarantee \u2014 and it has led to several popular protest uprisings over the last decade. All of them have been brutally quashed by the authorities, but Netanyahu called very quickly after Israel started bombing Iran for new anti-government protests in the country, urging Iranians to take advantage of the attacks, which he said had put the ayatollah in his weakest position ever.",
      "Khamenei has yet to be seen live or in public since the ceasefire, and his precise whereabouts remained unclear Thursday after the pre-recorded video message was released.",
      "While the ceasefire enabled Israelis to revel on Wednesday in a return to normalcy, with the lifting of 12 days of war-time security measures, in Tehran, anxiety still appeared rife.",
      "CBS News correspondent Imtiaz Tyab and his team were granted Iranian visas to enter the country earlier in the week, and they were the first American broadcast network to enter Tehran since the war began. But it took them an arduous journey through arid landscapes and across the border from Turkey to reach Iran's capital, as the country's airspace had been closed.",

    "story": [
      "Wander Franco, the suspended Tampa Bay Rays shortstop charged in a sexual abuse case, was found guilty on Thursday in the Dominican Republic but received a two-year suspended sentence.",
      "Franco was arrested last year after being accused of having a four-month relationship with a girl who was 14 at the time, and of transferring thousands of dollars to her mother to consent to the illegal relationship.",
      "Franco, now 24, also faced charges of sexual and commercial exploitation against a minor, and human trafficking, but was found not guilty of those.",
      "Judge Jakayra Veras Garc\u00eda said Franco made a bad decision as she addressed him during the ruling.",
      "\"Look at us, Wander,\" she said. \"Do not approach minors for sexual purposes. If you don't like people very close to your age, you have to wait your time.\"",
      "Prosecutors had requested a five-year prison sentence against Franco and a 10-year sentence against the girl's mother, who was found guilty and will serve the full term.",
      "\"Apparently she was the one who thought she was handling the bat in the big leagues,\" Veras said of the mother and her request that Franco pay for her daughter's schooling and other expenses.",
      "Franco's attorney, Irina Ventura, said she would appeal the judge's ruling: \"Evidently, justice was not done.\"",
      "Meanwhile, prosecutor Luis Mart\u00ednez said he was pleased with the rulings but did not say whether the government would appeal.",
      "Before the three judges issued their unanimous ruling, Veras orally reviewed the copious amount of evidence that prosecutors presented during trial, including certain testimony from 31 witnesses.",
      "\"This is a somewhat complex process,\" Veras said.",
      "More than an hour into her presentation, Veras said: \"The court has understood that this minor was manipulated.\"",
      "As the judge continued her review, Franco looked ahead expressionless, leaning forward at times.",
      "Franco, who was once the team's star shortstop, had signed a $182 million, 11-year contract through 2032 in November 2021 but saw his career abruptly halted in August 2023 after authorities in the Dominican Republic announced they were investigating him for an alleged relationship with a minor. Franco was 22 at the time.",
      "In January 2024, authorities arrested Franco in the Dominican Republic. Six months later, Tampa Bay placed him on the restricted list, which cut off the pay he had been receiving while on administrative leave.",
      "He was placed on that list because he has not been able to report to the team and would need a new U.S. visa to do so.",
      "While Franco awaited trial on conditional release, he was arrested again in November last year following what Dominican authorities called an altercation over a woman's attention. He was charged with illegally carrying a semiautomatic Glock 19 that police said was registered to his uncle.",
      "That case is still pending in court.",
      "After the ruling, Major League Baseball issued a brief statement noting it had collectively bargained a joint domestic violence, sexual assault and child abuse policy \"that reflects our commitment to these issues.\"",

    "summary": "North Korea's Wonsan-Kalma coastal tourist zone has hotels and other accommodations for nearly 20,000 guests.",
    "story": [
      "North Korea next week will open a signature coastal tourist site that it says will usher in a new era in its tourism industry, though there is no word on when the country will fully reopen to foreign visitors.",
      "The Wonsan-Kalma coastal tourist zone has hotels and other accommodations for nearly 20,000 guests who can swim in the sea, engage in sports and recreation activities and eat at restaurants and cafeterias on site, state media said.",
      "North Korean leader Kim Jong Un toured the site and cut the inaugural tape at a lavish ceremony Tuesday, the official Korean Central News Agency reported Thursday.",
      "Kim said its construction would be recorded as \"one of the greatest successes this year\" and called the site \"the proud first step\" toward realizing the government's policy of developing tourism, according to KCNA.",
      "North Korea will open the site to domestic tourists first",
      "The Wonsan-Kalma beach resort is North Korea's biggest tourist site. KCNA said North Korea will begin service for domestic tourists next Tuesday. It didn't say when North Korea will start receiving foreign tourists, but Russian officials said later Thursday that the first Russian tour to the site will happen in July.",
      "Observers say the resort likely required a huge investment from North Korea's limited budget, so it eventually will have to accept Chinese and other foreign tourists too to break even.",
      "Kim has been pushing to make the country a tourism hub as part of efforts to revive the ailing economy, and the Wonsan-Kalma zone is one of his most talked-about tourism projects. KCNA reported North Korea will confirm plans to build large tourist sites in other parts of the country, too.",
      "But North Korea hasn't fully lifted a ban on foreign tourists that it imposed in early 2020 to guard against the COVID-19 pandemic. Experts say North Korea has been slow to resume its international tourism because of remaining pandemic curbs, a flare-up of tensions with the U.S. and South Korea in recent years and worries about Western tourists spreading a negative image of its system.",
      "Russian tourists expected soon",
      "Russia's Primorsky region, which borders North Korea, said that the first group of Russian tourists to the resort will depart on July 7. The region's press service said that during their eight-day trip, Russian tourists will also have an opportunity to visit major attractions in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, according to Russian state news agency Tass.",
      "Starting from February 2024, North Korea has already been accepting Russian tourists to other areas amid the booming military and other partnerships between the two countries, but Chinese group tours, which made up more than 90% of visitors before the pandemic, remain stalled.",
      "In February this year, a small group of international tourists visited North Korea for the first time in five years, but tourist agencies said in March that their tours to North Korea were paused.",
      "Kim's recent foreign policy prioritizes relations with Russia as he's been supplying troops and conventional weapons to support its war against Ukraine in return for economic and military assistance. But North Korea's ties with China, which has long been its biggest trading partner and aid benefactor, have apparently cooled as China is reluctant to join an anti-Western alliance with North Korea and Russia, analysts say.",
      "Tuesday's ceremony that marked the completion of the resort's construction drew the Russian ambassador to North Korea and his embassy staff, KCNA said. But it didn't say whether any Chinese diplomats were also invited.",
      "\"There seems to be issues that North Korea hasn't yet resolved in its relations with China. But North Korea has put in too much money on tourism and plans to spend more. Subsequently, to get its money's worth, North Korea can't help receiving Chinese tourists,\" Lee Sangkeun, an expert at the Institute for National Security Strategy, a think tank run by South Korea's intelligence agency.",
      "Lim Eul-chul, a professor at Kyungnam University's Institute for Far Eastern Studies in Seoul, also said that foreign tourism to the Wonsan-Kalma site will begin with Russians. But he said Chinese tours to the zone, a sort of civilian exchange, will also begin soon, adding bilateral trade between China and North Korea has been recovering.",
      "South Korean and American tours won't likely happen soon",
      "Lim said that South Korean and American tours to North Korea won't likely restart anytime soon, though both new liberal South Korean President Lee Jae Myung and U.S. President Trump have expressed hopes to revive dialogue with North Korea.",
      "In January, when Mr. Trump boasted about his ties with Kim, he said \"I think he has tremendous condo capabilities. He's got a lot of shoreline,\" a likely reference to Wonsan-Kalma.",
      "North Korea hasn't publicly responded to Mr. Trump's outreach. It has repeatedly rejected Washington and Seoul's dialogue offers and focused on expanding its nuclear weapons program since Kim's high-stakes nuclear diplomacy with Mr. Trump collapsed in 2019.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rfk-us-funding-gavi-vaccine-alliance-travesty-experts-warn/",
    "published": "Thu, 26 Jun 2025 13:32:21 -0400",
    "summary": "RFK Jr. announced a halt to all U.S. funding for the global Gavi vaccine alliance. One expert calls it a \"travesty and a nightmare.\"",
    "story": [
      "Johannesburg \u2014\u00a0Every four years, representatives to the global alliance of governments, pharmaceutical makers, United Nations agencies and philanthropic organizations known as Gavi, which helps get vaccines to people who need them, meet to lock in new funding pledges. Just as this year's meeting in Brussels was drawing to a close on Wednesday, U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced that all funding from Washington would cease.",
      "In a three-and-a-half-minute video message that Kennedy\u00a0shared on social media, he said the Trump administration was halting funding to the organization because it had \"neglected the key issue of vaccine safety.\"",
      "Kennedy, who has sought to distance himself from the \"anti-vaccine\" label, has a history of making\u00a0misleading statements about\u00a0vaccine safety and has been tied to\u00a0anti-vaccine activism groups.",
      "Gavi says it has helped vaccinate more than 1.1 billion children in 78 low income countries and prevented more than 18.8 million deaths since its creation 25 years ago. Its focus is getting vaccines, especially new vaccines, to populations that would struggle to afford them or access them otherwise.",
      "Kennedy argued in the video that GAVI \"has neglected the key issue of vaccine safety,\" and that \"when vaccine safety issues have come before Gavi, Gavi has treated them not as a patient health problem, but as a public relations problem.\"",
      "Kennedy accused GAVI of ignoring the science and said the alliance must \"justify the $8 billion the U.S. has given it since 2001.\"",
      "The U.S. has long been among the top government contributors to Gavi's funding, which also comes from private organizations.",
      "The Biden administration had committed to $1.6 billion in funding for the organization from 2026 through 2030 \u2014 an amount roughly equal to the funding pledged by the private Gates Foundation \u2014 and shock and outrage reverberated across the conference in Brussels after Kennedy's announcement.",
      "Bill Gates, co-founder of Microsoft and the Gates Foundation, said on social media that the move would have \"devastating consequences.\" He called on the U.S. Congress to keep funding Gavi, warning that if it did not, \"more sick kids will fall behind in school,\" and there would be \"more overcrowded hospital wards and eventually more grieving parents.\"",
      "\"If Congress allows this to happen, the consequences will be devastating,\" Gates Foundation CEO Mark Suzman said. \"Hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of preventable deaths will occur, especially among mothers and children.\"",
      "Dr. Atul Gawande, a public health researcher and surgeon at the Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston who previously held a seat on the Gavi board, said Kennedy would be held personally responsible for the results of halted U.S. government funding, which he called a \"travesty and a nightmare.\"",
      "\"I would expect to see significant changes and reductions in access to safe and effective vaccines to children, in the poorest and most vulnerable countries of the world,\" one U.S. official with decades of experience in global health and vaccination programs told CBS News on the condition of anonymity. \"Kennedy's rhetoric on vaccine safety is not helpful and is likely to fuel vaccine hesitancy in the minds of people across the world, where we will surely now see more uncontrolled outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases. This is very unfortunate.\"",
      "The U.N.'s World Health Organization has warned since 2019 that vaccine hesitancy and mistrust is one of the leading threats to global public health.",
      "The goal of this year's conference was to secure funding to reach the organization's target of over 90% global coverage with essential vaccines for a wide range of diseases such as diphtheria, tetanus and measles. Gavi received more than $9 billion in funding commitments on Wednesday, but it had hoped to garner $11.9 billion for the next five years, with the goal of immunizing 500 million children globally.",
      "Other countries acknowledged Gavi's importance, and increased their contributions at the conference on Wednesday.",
      "Topping that list was the U.K.",
      "British Foreign Secretary David Lammy announced $1.7 billion for the coming five years, making the U.K. Gavi's new largest donor.",
      "Ghana's President John Darami Mahama, addressing the Gavi conference on Wednesday, began by detailing his younger brother's struggle with polio, and the stigma associated with the disease, which has been virtually eradicated worldwide thanks to vaccination programs launched in the late 1980s.",
      "\"I understand the importance of vaccines,\" Mahama told the delegations.",
      "When his brother was diagnosed, vaccine access in Ghana was close to zero, but the president said that, through partnership with Gavi, 97% of the population was now vaccinated.",
      "He said officials were still working to reach the last 3% \u2014   about \"65,000 children who are in remote areas, difficult to reach for life saving vaccines\" \u2014 and that Ghana planned to no longer need Gavi's support by 2030.",
      "Mahama concluded his remarks with a topical comparison, saying: \"One B-2 Spirit Bomber that dropped bombs on Iran cost $2.13 billion,\" and that he had done the math, adding: \"Surely the world can afford the value of four B-2 bombers to save 500 million children. It's a choice we have to make.\"",

      "Deep beneath the surface where a villa previously existed, archaeologists in the 18th century found 1,800 papyrus scrolls in the only ancient library in the world that is still intact. Attempts to unravel some of the scrolls ended in ashes as the library was carbonized, Brent Seales, a computer scientist from the University of Kentucky, explained.",

      "Miami \u2014 A former Venezuelan spymaster who was close to the country's late President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez pleaded guilty Wednesday to drug trafficking charges a week before his trial was set to begin in a Manhattan federal court.",
      "Retired Maj. Gen. Hugo Carvajal was extradited from Spain in 2023 after more than a decade on the run from U.S. law enforcement, including a botched arrest in Aruba while he was serving as a diplomat representing current Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro's government.",
      "Carvajal pleaded guilty in court to all four criminal counts, including narco-terrorism, in an indictment accusing him of leading a cartel made up of senior Venezuelan military officers that attempted to \"flood\" the U.S. with cocaine in cahoots with leftist guerrillas from neighboring Colombia.",
      "In a letter this week to defense counsel, prosecutors said they believe federal sentencing guidelines call for the 65-year-old Carvajal to serve a mandatory minimum of 50 years in prison.",
      "Nicknamed \"El Pollo,\" Spanish for \"the chicken,\" Carvajal advised Ch\u00e1vez for more than a decade. He later broke with Maduro, Ch\u00e1vez's handpicked successor, and threw his support behind the U.S.-backed political opposition - in dramatic fashion.",
      "In a recording made from an undisclosed location, Carvajal called on his former military cohorts to rebel a month into mass protests seeking to replace Maduro with lawmaker Juan Guaid\u00f3, whom the first Trump administration recognized as Venezuela's legitimate leader as head of the democratically elected National Assembly.",
      "The hoped-for barracks revolt never materialized, and Carvajal fled to Spain. In 2021, he was captured hiding out in a Madrid apartment after he defied a Spanish extradition order and disappeared.",
      "Carvajal's straight-up guilty plea, without any promise of leniency, could be part of a gamble to win credit down the line for cooperating with U.S. efforts against a top foreign adversary that sits atop the world's largest petroleum reserves.",
      "Although Carvajal has been out of power for years, his backers say he can provide potentially valuable insights on the inner workings of the spread of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua into the U.S. and spying activities of the Maduro-allied governments of Cuba, Russia, China and Iran.",
      "He may also be angling for President Trump's attention with information about voting technology company Smartmatic. One of Carvajal's deputies was a major player in Venezuela's electoral authority when the company was getting off the ground.",
      "Florida-based Smartmatic says its global business was decimated when Fox News aired false claims by Trump allies that it helped rig the 2020 U.S. election. One of the company's Venezuelan founders was later charged in the U.S. in a bribery case involving its work in the Philippines.",
      "Gary Berntsen, a former CIA officer in Latin America who oversaw commandos that hunted al-Qaeda, sent a public letter this week to Mr. Trump urging the Justice Department to delay the start of Carvajal's trial so officials could debrief the former spymaster.",
      "\"He's no angel, he's a very bad man,\" Berntsen said in an interview. \"But we need to defend democracy.\"",
      "Carvajal's attorney, Robert Feitel, said prosecutors announced in court this month that they never extended a plea offer to his client or sought to meet with him.",
      "\"I think that was an enormous mistake,\" Feitel told The Associated Press while declining further comment. \"He has information that is extraordinarily important to our national security and law enforcement.\"",
      "In 2011, prosecutors alleged that Carvajal used his office to coordinate the smuggling of approximately 5,600 kilograms (12,300 pounds) of cocaine aboard a jet from Venezuela to Mexico in 2006. In exchange, he accepted millions of dollars from drug traffickers, prosecutors said.",
      "He allegedly arranged the shipment as one of the leaders of the so-called Cartel of the Suns - a nod to the sun insignias affixed to the uniforms of senior Venezuelan military officers. The cocaine was sourced by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, which the U.S. has designated as a terrorist organization and which for years took refuge in Venezuela as it sought to overthrow Colombia's government.",
      "Carvajal \"exploited his position as the director of Venezuela's military intelligence and abandoned his responsibility to the people of Venezuela in order to intentionally cause harm to the United States,\" DEA Acting Administrator Robert Murphy said. \"After years of trying to evade law enforcement, (he) will now likely spend the rest of his life in federal prison.\"",
      "Carjaval's \"guilty plea demonstrates our commitment to holding accountable foreign officials who abuse their power to poison our citizens,\" U.S. Attorney Jay Clayton was quoted as saying in a Justice Department statement.",

    "summary": "Jos\u00e9 Adolfo Mac\u00edas, who led a gang called \"Los Choneros\" in Ecuador, was captured in the Ecuadorian city of Manta, his hometown, officials said.",
    "story": [
      "Jos\u00e9 Adolfo Mac\u00edas Villamar, a fugitive drug trafficker known as Fito and wanted by authorities in Ecuador and the United States, was recaptured more than a year after he escaped from prison in the Andean nation, Ecuadorian President Daniel Noboa announced Wednesday.",
      "Mac\u00edas, who led a gang called \"Los Choneros\" in Ecuador, was captured in the Ecuadorian city of Manta, his hometown, officials in Ecuador said. In April, He was indicted in New York City on charges he imported thousands of pounds of cocaine into the United States.",
      "\"More will fall, we will reclaim the country. No truce,\" Noboa said in an X post announcing Mac\u00edas' arrest. \"We have done our part to proceed with Fito's extradition to the United States, we are awaiting their response.\"",
      "Interpol had issued an arrest warrant for Macias after his mysterious prison escape in early 2024 from the Guayaquil Regional Prison, where he was serving a 34-year sentence for drug trafficking. Ecuadorian authorities have yet to explain how he escaped from one of the country's notoriously violent prisons. They only learned of his escape when a military contingent arrived to transfer him to another maximum-security prison but didn't find him in his cell.",
      "The Ecuadorian army confirmed Macias' recapture in what appeared to be the basement of a house. A video provided by the army showed the moment of the arrest, with a uniformed officer aiming a gun at the head of the drug trafficker, who gave his full name. The officers had found him hiding in a small hole beneath what appeared to be a kitchen counter.",
      "Wednesday's announcement of his arrest comes in the same week that Federico G\u00f3mez, alias \"Fede,\" the leader of another gang called Las Aguilas, was confirmed to have escaped from an Ecuadorian prison.",
      "Last year, U.S. Attorney John Durham said in a news release that Macias led Los Choneros and its \"network of assassins and drug and weapon traffickers\" since at least 2020.",
      "With an extensive criminal record including charges of murder and organized crime, Mac\u00edas has cultivated a cult status among fellow gang members and the public in his home country.",
      "While behind bars in 2023, he released a video addressed to \"the Ecuadorian people\" while flanked by armed men. He also threw parties in prison, where he had access to everything from liquor to roosters for cockfighting matches. He also had been running Los Choneros from his jail cell, authorities allege.",
      "Mac\u00edas' escape \"triggered widespread riots, bombings, kidnappings, the assassination of a prominent prosecutor, and an armed attack on a TV network during a live broadcast,\" the U.S. Embassy and Consulate in Ecuador said last year.",
      "The Ecuadorian government and drug mafias also declared war on each other, and Noboa gave orders to \"neutralize\" criminal gangs after\u00a0gunmen stormed and opened fire in the TV studio and bandits threatened random executions of civilians and security forces.",
      "The seven-count indictment unsealed in Brooklyn charges Mac\u00edas and an unidentified co-defendant with international cocaine distribution, conspiracy and weapons counts, including smuggling firearms from the United States.",
      "Los Choneros employed people to buy firearms, components and ammunition in the United States and smuggle them into Ecuador, according to the indictment. Cocaine would flow into the United States with the help of Mexican cartels.",
      "\"Los Choneros operated a vast network responsible for the shipment and distribution of multi-ton quantities of cocaine from South America through Central America and Mexico to the United States and elsewhere,\" the indictment says.",
      "Last year, the U.S. classified Los Choneros as one of the most violent gangs and affirmed its connection to powerful\u00a0Mexican drug cartels who threaten Ecuador and the surrounding region.",
      "Authorities in Ecuador have classified the gang as a terrorist organization. Earlier this month, the Ecuadorian government announced the reward for the capture of Mac\u00edas would be increased to\u00a0$1 million."

    "story": [
      "The heads of two key American intelligence agencies issued statements Wednesday on what they said was \"new\" intelligence on the damage resulting from the recent U.S. strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, each noting the Iranian program was likely to have been set back by \"years.\"",
      "The statements were released after President Trump decried a leaked, preliminary assessment produced by the Defense Intelligence Agency that said Tehran's nuclear program had only been pushed back by a matter of months.",
      "Mr. Trump had ordered airstrikes on three Iranian nuclear facilities late Saturday, adding to a more than weeklong Israeli campaign against targets in Iran.",
      "CIA Director John Ratcliffe said in a statement Wednesday that \"a body of credible intelligence indicates Iran's Nuclear Program has been severely damaged by the recent, targeted strikes.\"",
      "\"This includes new intelligence from a historically reliable and accurate source/method that several key Iranian nuclear facilities were destroyed and would have to be rebuilt over the course of years,\" Ratcliffe's statement said.",
      "It added the agency would continue to collect \"additional reliably sourced information\" to share with policymakers, and, when possible, to provide updates to the public.",
      "A CIA spokesperson declined to elaborate on the intelligence referenced by Ratcliffe's statement, including the confidence level associated with it or whether it included Israeli or other foreign intelligence.",
      "Earlier on Wednesday, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard also wrote on X that \"new intelligence confirms what President Trump has stated numerous times: Iran's nuclear facilities have been destroyed.\"",
      "\"If the Iranians chose to rebuild, they would have to rebuild all three facilities (Natanz, Fordow, Esfahan) entirely, which would likely take years to do,\" Gabbard's statement read.",
      "An intelligence official later confirmed to CBS News that the information shared by Gabbard was based on new American intelligence, but declined to specify its confidence level.",
      "Neither of the statements directly addressed some of the questions raised by lawmakers and nonproliferation experts in the aftermath of the strikes about what kinds of residual nuclear capabilities Iran may have retained.",
      "There are also conflicting views about whether Iranian officials had managed to transport enriched uranium away from the sites before they were bombed. The DIA assessment indicated at least some of the enriched uranium had been moved, according to one source familiar with it.",
      "But when asked whether enriched material was successfully moved during a press availability following the NATO summit in the Netherlands on Wednesday, President Trump said, \"We think we hit them so hard and so fast, they didn't get to move.\"",
      "The president also said the U.S. and Iran were expected to hold talks \"next week.\" The format remains unclear, for now, but special envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff is expected to lead the talks, if they happen, two U.S. officials told CBS News. Witkoff has spoken with the Iranian foreign minister, and recently, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Vice President JD Vance have also become more involved in the diplomacy, a U.S. and regional diplomat told CBS News.",
      "Both Ratcliffe and Gabbard were slated to participate in a classified Senate briefing on Tuesday on the U.S. strikes in Iran, but the session was cancelled and rescheduled for Thursday. The House is expected to be briefed on Friday. It is unclear whether both leaders will still participate in both briefings.",
      "Ratcliffe and Gabbard's statements on Wednesday also included criticism of the leak to media outlets of the DIA assessment, which a spokesperson for that agency later said was issued with low confidence and would be refined as additional intelligence becomes available.",
      "The initial DIA report said the entrances to two Iranian nuclear sites \u2014 including the Fordo facility \u2014 were sealed off in the strikes, but that Iran could reconstitute elements of its program once it dug out and made repairs to water and electrical systems, according to sources familiar with it.",
      "The assessment also provided a range of possibilities for how long it could take for Iran to regain access to the underground facilities and resume some operations, ranging from a few months to less than a year, one source familiar with the assessment told CBS News.",
      "Administration officials have blasted those findings, which are at odds with Mr. Trump's repeated assertions that Saturday night's airstrikes \"obliterated\" Iran's nuclear facilities.",
      "Speaking from the NATO summit, Mr. Trump said the airstrikes set back Iran's program by \"basically decades.\"",
      "\"They said it could be limited or it could be very severe. They really didn't know,\" Mr. Trump said of the U.S. intelligence assessments.",
      "Appearing alongside the president, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said Wednesday the damage to the sites was extensive.",
      "\"If you want to make an assessment of what happened at Fordo, you'd better get a big shovel and go really deep, because Iran's nuclear program is obliterated,\" he told reporters.",
      "Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Dan Caine said in a press availability on Sunday following the strikes that a full battle damage assessment of the strikes \"will take some time.\"",

      "During a news conference Wednesday to cap off the NATO summit in The Hague, Netherlands, the president said there may be a formal agreement at some point with Iran, but he doesn't believe one is necessary because their nuclear sites were \"blown up to kingdom come.\"",
      "\"We're going to talk to them next week, with Iran,\" the president told reporters at the press conference, adding that the U.S. is going to \"meet\" with them, although he didn't specify who will be involved in the meeting or where it will take place.",
      "\"I don't care if I have an agreement or not,\" he said. \"The only thing we'd be asking for is what we were asking for before about, 'we want no nuclear.' But we destroyed the nuclear. In other words, that's destroyed. I said, 'Iran will not have nuclear.' Well, we blew it up. It's blown up to kingdom come. And so I don't feel very strongly about it. If we got a document, it wouldn't be bad.\"",
      "The president met with other world leaders on the sidelines of the summit, amid cautious optimism about the ceasefire the Trump administration brokered. The 12-day conflict left 28 people dead in Israel and hundreds in Iran.",
      "\"It was a 12-day war. And we think it's over,\" Mr. Trump said during the press conference. \"I don't think they're going to be going back at each other, I don't think so.\"",
      "\"Because I dealt with both, and they're both tired, exhausted,\" Mr. Trump said. \"They fought very, very hard and very viciously, very violently, and they were both satisfied to go home and get out. And can it start again? I guess some day it can, it could maybe start soon.\"",
      "At the summit, Mr. Trump said Iran's enrichment efforts were set back \"basically decades.\" The U.S.\u00a0strikes\u00a0on Iranian nuclear facilities were \"very, very successful. It's called 'obliteration,'\" he said at the news conference.\u00a0An initial classified assessment\u00a0by the Defense Intelligence Agency, however, estimated the strikes only set back Tehran's nuclear program by a matter of months, according to three sources familiar with its contents.",
      "Regarding the Israel-Hamas conflict, Mr. Trump expressed optimism and said there's been \"great progress.\"",
      "\"I think great progress is being made on Gaza,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I think because of this attack that we made, I think we're going to have some very good news.\"",
      "On Wednesday, Mr. Trump met with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, who complimented the president on his efforts to boost other countries' defense spending and on his efforts in the Middle East.",
      "\"You are a man of strength and also a man of peace,\" Rutte told Mr. Trump.",

      "The president, upon learning that the reporter was living with her children in Warsaw while her husband fights in Ukraine, said, \"That's rough stuff, right?\" And after he answered her question, he wished her luck and offered his regards to her husband.",
      "NATO members, with the exceptions of Spain and Slovakia, have agreed to a dramatic increase in their defense spending, to 5% of GDP, a goal pressed by Mr. Trump, though the U.S. defense spending is short of that target. Before leaving for the summit, Mr. Trump said the U.S. shouldn't have to reach that target, since it's contributed so much to NATO in the past.",
      "\"This week, the NATO allies committed to dramatically increase their defense spending to that 5% of GDP, something that no one really thought possible,\" Mr. Trump said at his press conference, adding that it will be known as \"The Hague defense commitment.\"",
      "Asked about Spain's refusal to commit to the 5% threshold, Mr. Trump said he liked Spain and its people, \"But Spain is the only country \u2014 out of all other countries \u2014 that refuses to pay,\" and he said it was getting \"a little bit of a free ride.\" The president went on to say that the U.S. is negotiating with Spain on trade, and \"we're going to make them pay twice as much.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nato-members-defense-spending-countries-list/",
    "published": "Wed, 25 Jun 2025 18:07:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Leaders agreed to boost their defense spending goals significantly during Wednesday's NATO summit.",
    "story": [
      "NATO leaders agreed on Wednesday to an increased defense spending goal of 5% of each country's economic output by 2035, more than doubling the previous target of 2%.",
      "President Trump praised the new defense agreement, calling it a \"monumental win for the United States\" during a speech at the NATO summit in the Netherlands. Mr. Trump has repeatedly demanded that NATO allies boost their defense spending, arguing that other countries disproportionately rely on the U.S..",
      "In 2024, NATO member countries spent an average of 2.61% of their gross domestic product (GDP) on defense, but the figures vary widely across the alliance.",
      "According to NATO estimates, 22 of the alliance's 32 members met or exceeded the 2% benchmark, with nine falling short of the goal. Iceland is not included in the estimates as it has no armed forces.",
      "What NATO countries spend on defense",
      "Defense spending covers a nation's armed forces, including personnel, equipment, ammunition and more.",
      "NATO estimates show Poland spent the highest percentage of its GDP on defense and was the only country estimated to spend more than 4%. Estonia and Latvia followed, each allocating around 3.4%.",
      "The United States, by comparison, was estimated to spend 3.2% of its (much larger) GDP on defense.",
      "Nine countries did not reach the alliance's previous 2% target, which had been agreed to\u00a0at a summit in 2014.",
      "Canada, Portugal and Italy each spent an estimated 1.5% of their GDP on defense. Slovenia, Belgium and Luxembourg came in a bit lower.",
      "Spain allocated the smallest share of its GDP, at 1.2%.",
      "At the summit on Wednesday, President Trump singled out Spain for criticism over its spending level, saying \"they want a little bit of a free ride.\" Mr. Trump threatened to make Spain \"pay twice as much\" during trade negotiations.",
      "Spain's Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez said his country will not meet the 5% defense spending goal, calling the 2% target \"sufficient\" and \"realistic\" for the country.",
      "Since NATO set its defense spending targets in 2014, overall average spending among member states, excluding the United States,\u00a0has risen from 1.4% of GDP to 2% in 2024. The targets, however, are not legally binding.",
      "Rachel Rizzo of the Atlantic Council's Europe Center said the language of the 5% agreement \"may leave just enough wiggle room for some allies (such as Spain) to opt out.\"",

    "title": "Poll: U.S. airstrikes on Iran backed by Republicans, but disapproval overall",
    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-strikes-iran-cbs-news-opinion-poll/",
    "published": "Tue, 24 Jun 2025 17:58:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Most would see an Iranian nuclear weapon as a serious threat but also voice concern about a wider war.",
    "story": [
      "As the public assesses the U.S. airstrikes on Iran's nuclear facilities, at least three things are in play.",
      "One, there's a largely bipartisan view that any Iranian nuclear weapon would pose a threat to the U.S. Second, there are bipartisan concerns that the U.S. could get involved in a wider war with Iran. And third, there are differing perceptions of just how effective those strikes will ultimately prove to be.",
      "Amid that, it is Republicans, including MAGA Republicans, who overwhelmingly back the airstrikes, and they comprise the bulk of those who do. For the rest of the public, however \u2014 and netting out to a majority overall \u2014 there is disapproval of those airstrikes and still-greater concern about a potential wider war.",
      "Going forward, the nation divides over whether it has confidence in the Trump administration's handling of the situation (here again, Republicans do, others do not) and on whether the strikes will actually make it less likely Iran develops a weapon.",
      "Then, as Congress returns to session, a sizable two-thirds of the country say President Trump does need congressional authorization to conduct military action against Iran.",
      "Concern about the U.S. possibly becoming involved in a wider war with Iran does span partisan lines. For most Republicans, though, there is relatively less such concern.",
      "Polling was mostly conducted prior to reports regarding a ceasefire between Iran and Israel.",
      "Republicans show overwhelming confidence in the administration's handling of the situation with Iran, which nets out to the nation being split on that overall.",
      "A large two-thirds say Mr. Trump does need congressional approval for action against Iran. That includes a third of Republicans. MAGA Republicans, in particular, though, are more likely than other Republicans to say Mr. Trump does not need congressional approval for action against Iran.",
      "Right now MAGA rank-and-file are no more concerned about a wider war than Republicans overall.",
      "Most Americans do think Iran will probably try to launch attacks against the U.S. or its interests now as opposed to negotiating. (Polling was being conducted while Iran launched missiles toward a U.S. base in Qatar. And was mostly completed prior to reports of a cease fire between Israel and Iran.)",
      "The more likely people are to think Iran will try to attack the U.S. now (as opposed to negotiating), the more concerned they are about a wider war.",
      "Large majorities would see the prospect of Iran having a nuclear weapon as a threat, both to the U.S. and to Israel.",
      "Much of this, beyond the partisanship, also centers on views about effectiveness: whether or not Iran is now less likely to develop a nuclear weapon.",
      "Meanwhile, on the home front, perceptions of the U.S. economy remain bad in the eyes of most, as they have for years, with most still saying prices are still going up. Even as current ratings remain stable, the outlook remains overall negative. Just over half the country says the economy is getting worse; just over half continue to think the year ahead will bring at least a slowdown or recession. That sentiment has not abated in recent months.",
      "This CBS News/YouGov survey was conducted with a nationally representative sample of 1,720 U.S. adults interviewed between June 22-24, 2025. The sample was weighted to be representative of adults nationwide according to gender, age, race, and education, based on the U.S. Census American Community Survey and Current Population Survey, as well as 2024 presidential vote. The margin of error is \u00b13.0 points.",

      "The updated request from the government more than seven weeks after the trial began gave pause for concern about the status of the case.

      "\"In order to find Diddy guilty of RICO, the jury has to find him guilty of at least two underlying crimes in connection with the alleged criminal enterprise, Bad Boy Entertainment,\" Faddis told Fox News Digital. \"This move by the prosecution significantly limits the underlying crimes the jury can consider in deciding if Diddy is guilty of RICO, thereby reducing the scope of the RICO charge and the case more generally. All things considered, I think it makes it less likely that Diddy will be found guilty of RICO.\"",

      "\"Specifically, the Government has removed instructions from the charge relating to (i) attempted kidnapping under both California and New York law, (ii) attempted arson under California law, and (iii) aiding and abetting sex trafficking. The Government is no longer planning to proceed on these theories of liability so instructions are no longer necessary.\"",

      "\"On the other hand, it could damage the government\u2019s credibility, as they promised this jury at the beginning of trial that they could prove crimes they now are dismissing,\" Faddis noted. \"The jury might feel misled, see this is a partial surrender and view the remaining allegations with even more skepticism.\"",

      "\"The same applies to the sex trafficking counts. The government is arguing that Diddy sex trafficked the victims, not that he aided and embedded others to do so. The prosecution is just simplifying the charges for the jury to avoid confusion. This doesn't really change anything, and the legal arguments they're going to make during closing will remain the same.\"",

      "\"The trial seems like it will come down to one central question: Were the women coerced or did they voluntarily participate in the prodigious sexual escapades called 'freak offs?'\" Capozzolo told Fox News Digital. \"It would seem that if the jury believes that Cassie Ventura and the other women were coerced, then Combs may likely face a conviction on one or more of the charges.",

      "\"In most racketeering cases, like mob cases, the government calls several co-conspirators, usually cooperators, who get on the stand and admit that they are part of a racketeering conspiracy \u2014 in that they agreed to participate in an ongoing \u2018enterprise\u2019 understanding that its purpose was to commit certain crimes,\" Capozzolo said.",

      "\"Even if prosecutors fail to convict on the top racketeering charge, the sex trafficking charges carry significant penalties, including a mandatory minimum 15-year sentence,\" Capozzolo said. \"So even a 'compromise' verdict, rather than a straight acquittal, may prove costly to Combs.\"",
      "A federal RICO violation can result in a 20-year sentence per charge, the U.S. Code 2421 transportation charge can carry a sentence of up to 10 years, while U.S. Code 2422 Coercion and enticement may carry a 20-year sentence. Each of the violations may also include monetary fines.",

      "\"Keep in mind, the prosecution only needs to prove a single charge about one of the several alleged victims in this case for Diddy to be facing significant prison time,\" Pointer told Fox News Digital. \"So essentially, the prosecution only needs to win on a single charge, while Diddy needs to run the table on all the charges to avoid prison time.\"",

This case is about voluntary adult choices made by capable adults and consensual relationships.

      "\"He is not charged with being a jerk. He's charged with running a racketeering enterprise,\" Teny said. \"And though there was violence that you are going to hear about, you already have, that violence is not part of any RICO.

      "Some may assume that losing teeth is just part of growing older.",
      "Around 11% of adults between the ages of 65 and 74 have lost all of their teeth, according to 2020 data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) \u2014 and that number rises to one in five at age 75 and older.",
      "But according to experts, this isn\u2019t inevitable. Dental professionals shared the following tips to prevent tooth loss and boost overall health.",
      "1. Protect gum health",
      "About two in three adults over age 65 are dealing with some form of gum disease, according to a recently published AARP report.",
      "6 SIMPLE WAYS TO PROTECT YOUR HEARING NOW BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE, ACCORDING TO EXPERTS",
      "Clinical experts cited in the report, including Dr. Uchenna Akosa, assistant professor and director at Rutgers Health University Dental Associates in New Jersey, warn that bleeding gums can signal a much deeper problem.",
      "\"Even if you have not lost any teeth, gum disease impairs your ability to chew hard food,\" Akosa told AARP. \"That will affect your nutrition and can put you at risk of malnutrition in the future.\"",
      "If your gums bleed when brushing, or if you notice sensitivity or recession, those are signs to schedule a dental visit.\u00a0 (iStock)",
      "Left untreated, gum disease can also destroy the bones that hold teeth in place and may interfere with nutrition and chewing.",
      "Gum disease is also a source of chronic inflammation in the body, which can contribute to dementia risk, studies have shown. A meta-analysis of about 34,000 people found that older adults who had lost all of their teeth had a 1.4 times greater risk of developing dementia, as cited by AARP.",
      "The publication also points to previous research linking gum disease to other health risks, such as heart attack, stroke and cancer.",
      "Around 11% of adults between the ages of 65 and 74 have lost all of their teeth.",
      "Experts recommend focusing on early prevention. If your gums bleed when brushing, or if you notice sensitivity or recession, those are signs to schedule a dental visit.",
      "Regular professional cleanings and checkups can catch gum problems before they lead to tooth loss or other health effects.",
      "People who had lost all of their teeth had a 1.4 times greater risk of developing dementia, according to the AARP. (iStock)",
      "AARP reports that switching to an electric toothbrush, brushing twice daily for two minutes and using a water flosser are all effective ways to protect gum health.",
      "Dr. David Frey, a physiologic dentist at Perfect White Smile in Beverly Hills, California, said that he often recommends water flossers \u2013 particularly the Sonic-Fusion by Waterpik \u2013 to older patients.",
      "\"It\u2019s especially valuable for patients with arthritis, limited mobility or trouble using traditional floss,\" Frey told Fox News Digital.",
      "2. Take steps to prevent dry mouth",
      "Saliva plays an essential role in neutralizing acids and protecting tooth enamel, but dry mouth affects nearly six in 10 older adults, according to AARP.",
      "Many common medications \u2014 including antihistamines, antidepressants and blood pressure drugs \u2014 can reduce saliva production, making the mouth more prone to tooth decay, infection and gum disease, WebMD states.",
      "IS OZEMPIC RUINING YOUR TEETH? WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT IMPACT ON DENTAL HEALTH",
      "To prevent dry mouth, AARP recommends sipping water regularly, rinsing the mouth after eating, asking your dentist about prescription-strength fluoride toothpaste, and using dry mouth rinses like Biotene or Act.",
      "3. Personalize your dental visits",
      "Contrary to the standard six-month checkup rule, AARP notes that dental care schedules should be personalized.",
      "One doctor in the report noted that there\u2019s \"nothing magical about a six-month checkup\" \u2014 some people may only need to go once a year, while others, especially those with chronic conditions, may need more frequent visits.",
      "The recommended frequency of dental visits is not one-size-fits-all, according to AARP. Some people may only need to go once a year, while others, especially those with chronic conditions, may need more frequent visits. (iStock)",
      "Oral health issues in older adults often go unnoticed, especially those related to bite alignment, according to Frey.",
      "\"Bite-related issues are often an overlooked source of headaches and neck pain,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"The public simply hasn\u2019t been informed that tension, misalignment and jaw dysfunction can manifest in ways that seem unrelated at first glance.\"",

      "Evaluating bite position and jaw health can sometimes reveal the root causes of chronic discomfort, Frey noted.",
      "\"When I combine 3D imaging with a close exam of the teeth \u2014 worn surfaces, tiny fractures and chipping \u2014 it often reveals that the muscles around the head and neck aren\u2019t in harmony with the bite.\"",
      "4. Explore options for financial help",
      "Only three in 10 adults over 65 have dental insurance, per the American Dental Association, and Medicare may not cover all necessary procedures.",
      "Many common medications can reduce saliva production, making the mouth more prone to decay, experts say. (iStock)",
      "This financial gap often leads people to skip dental care altogether, which can cause more serious (and expensive) problems in the future.",
      "AARP suggests looking into dental savings plans, local dental schools or sliding-scale community clinics if coverage is an issue.",
      "5. Adopt healthy habits",
      "Smoking is a major contributor to tooth loss.",
      "CDC data shows that smokers are up to three times more likely to lose all their teeth than non-smokers.",
      "CDC data shows that smokers are up to three times more likely to lose all of their teeth than non-smokers. (iStock)",
      "And while sugary cough drops or hard candies may seem harmless, they can be damaging to tooth enamel over time, experts warn.",
      "Switching to sugar-free gum or candies containing xylitol may help prevent cavities and support better oral health, Akosa told AARP.",
      "6. Restore appearance",
      "One of the biggest misconceptions about aging and dental health is that worn, discolored teeth are something to simply accept, according to Frey.",
      "\"It\u2019s not just about revitalizing the teeth \u2014 it\u2019s about revitalizing the person.\"",
      "\"A delicate, thin porcelain veneer can restore the vitality, color and shape your teeth once had, enhancing your smile and overall appearance,\" he told Fox News Digital.",
      "\"And it\u2019s not just cosmetic \u2014 it\u2019s about restoring health, confidence and proper function.\"",

      "Traditional vs. deep plane facelift",
      "With a standard or traditional facelift \u2014 also known as a SMAS facelift, or a Superficial Musculoaponeurotic System facelift \u2014 the surgeon makes incisions behind the hairline and around the front of the ear, lifting and tightening the deeper tissues and muscles and then removing excess skin.",

      "It is important that the surgeon goes over these risks with the patient in person, according to Davis.",

      "\"The role of federal government contracting officers is not ceremonial or self-dealing; rather, it is a position of immense authority and fiduciary responsibility,\" said Loeffler. \"The contracting process must be transparent and built on merit, not personal gain.\"",
      "This comes after USAID, an agency tasked with administering civilian foreign aid, was essentially dismantled by the DOGE waste, fraud and abuse cuts made under Elon Musk and President Donald Trump.

    "story": [
      "The 'Outnumbered' panel discusses the Supreme Court ruling and why it is considered a major victory for the Trump administration's crackdown on illegal immigration.",
      "The Supreme Court installed a tighter timeline for removable migrants to challenge their deportations as part of its decision on Thursday in a case involving a Jamaican immigrant who had tried to avoid being sent back to his home country.",
      "The Supreme Court found that once migrants receive a final order of removal, a 30-day window for them to seek review of that order is triggered.",
      "The ruling was roughly 5-4, with the three liberal justices dissenting and Justice Neil Gorsuch joining most of the dissent.",
      "Pierre Riley, the Jamaican national at the center of the case, had followed the law and challenged his final removal order in the immigration court system. But when he attempted to seek review from the appellate court of the immigration court findings, the appellate court said its hands were tied because it had been more than a year since Riley had received his initial removal orders.",

      "Riley came to the United States on a six-month visa three decades ago. He never left, was arrested and convicted of drug felonies, and served in prison until 2021.",
      "Immigration and Customs Enforcement moved to deport him to Jamaica in January that year, kicking off the weedy legal process involving Riley challenging his removal.",
      "The chain of events that ensued showcases how migrants facing removal can end up going down a windy due process road in the immigration and federal courts.",
      "In this case, Riley argued to an immigration court that although he was removable, returning to Jamaica would put his life at risk, because a drug kingpin there had killed two of his cousins and would likely go after him, too.",
      "Riley invoked what is known as a \"convention against torture\" rule, which migrants can use to contest being deported to a country.",
      "An immigration judge, who is an administrative judge working within the Department of Justice, granted Riley \"withholding of removal\" to Jamaica, meaning he could be deported, just not to Jamaica.",
      "GORSUCH, ROBERTS SIDE WITH LEFT-LEANING SUPREME COURT JUSTICES IN IMMIGRATION RULING",
      "Justices Samuel Alito and Sonia Sotomayor. (Getty)",
      "The government appealed the immigration ruling to the Board of Immigration Appeals, which overturned the immigration judge\u2019s finding, meaning Riley could once again be deported to Jamaica.",
      "Migrants\u2019 next avenue of appeal is to ask a federal circuit court to review their deportation order, and Riley did this.",
      "But upon reviewing Riley\u2019s case, the appellate court found Riley was too late. The appellate court said that it had no jurisdiction to help him because the original removal orders he received in January 2021, more than a year ago, are what set off the 30-day clock to seek review of his deportation.",
      "Writing for the majority, Justice Samuel Alito acknowledged the \"legitimate practical concerns\" of Riley's case but said the law assumed immigration cases would be handled expeditiously and that the 30-day deadline being triggered right at the time a migrant is ordered removed should, in theory, be a non-issue.",
      "\"The Government reminds us that such proceedings have often lasted many months and even years. . . . That is surely not what Congress anticipated when it enacted the streamlined procedure,\" Alito wrote in a footnote.",
      "Attorney Dilan Esper noted on X that Thursday's order could shed light on a recent controversial emergency order the Supreme Court issued this week that cleared the way for the Trump administration to deport migrants, including a group of men bound for South Sudan, to countries they are not from.",

      "The order on Thursday indicated that the law does not offer a clear avenue for migrants to raise convention against torture claims for third countries if they have already received final removal orders and raised challenges to being removed to their home country.",
      "Justice Sonia Sotomayor said in her dissent the majority opinion in Riley's case did not make logistical sense.",
      "\"In holding that Riley was required to file his appeal 16 months before the order he sought to challenge existed, the court surely moves from the border well into the heartland of illogic and absurdity,\" Sotomayor wrote.",

      "A person trying a Tesla vehicle. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How the Elon Musk Tesla Facebook scam works",
      "This type of scam often begins after someone posts about Musk, Tesla or cryptocurrency. Scammers monitor public Facebook activity, then send a friend request from an account using Musk\u2019s name and photo. The profile may look legitimate, with copied images, reposted news articles or AI-generated content.",
      "Once the request is accepted, the impersonator encourages the victim to continue the conversation on WhatsApp. From there, the scam unfolds in a way that feels casual but calculated. The victim is congratulated on being randomly selected to win a brand-new Tesla and a large cash prize, often around $250,000. But before the reward can be delivered, they are told to cover \"delivery fees\" using an Apple Gift Card.",
      "In the case of the woman from Jensen Beach, she sent multiple gift cards totaling $800 before realizing the story was a setup. After claiming that a delivery truck had broken down, the scammer requested even more money. That's when she recognized the pattern and blocked the account. But unfortunately, by then, the funds were already gone.",

      "Gift cards are one of the most common tools used in scams because they are fast, anonymous, and nearly impossible to recover once the code is shared. Scammers often claim that the cards are needed to cover fees, unlock a prize or verify your identity. Once a scammer has the code, they can do a few things:",

      "Launder the funds through reselling sites or gaming platforms.",
      "Apple Gift Cards are frequently used because they are easy to find in stores and can be used for high-value digital purchases. But scammers also use Google Play, Amazon, Steam and Visa prepaid cards, depending on what they think the victim can access. These requests usually come with urgency. Victims may be told to stay on the phone while buying the cards or to scratch off the back and send a photo of the code right away. That sense of pressure is designed to override second thoughts. If anyone you do not know asks for payment in gift cards, it is a scam. No legitimate organization or contest will ever ask for them as payment or verification.",

Once they have your attention, they use that trust to steal money or personal information. Musk is one of the most frequently impersonated figures in scam campaigns. His name is widely associated with innovation, crypto and high-value giveaways, which makes him a perfect target for fraudsters trying to appear legitimate. Some of the most common Elon-related scams include:",

The scammer may use deepfake video, AI-generated voice clips or doctored screenshots to make the offer feel more real. Once the target engages, the pressure begins.

      "1. Never send gift card codes to anyone you do not know: If someone asks for Apple, Amazon or Google Play cards as payment or verification, it is a scam. No real prize, agency or company will request gift cards.",
      "2. Be skeptical of prize claims from celebrity accounts: Musk is not messaging people on Facebook to give away Teslas or cash. If the profile is unverified or the offer feels random, trust your instincts and ignore it.",
      "3. Do not move conversations to private apps like WhatsApp or Telegram: Scammers often push for this because these platforms have fewer safeguards, no public comment threads and limited reporting tools. Once the chat moves off Facebook, it becomes much harder to verify or report what\u2019s happening. If someone you do not know insists on switching platforms, it\u2019s usually a sign they are hiding something.",
      "4. Consider using a data removal service: If a scammer has targeted you or impersonated you online, chances are your personal information is floating around on data broker websites. These sites collect and sell everything from your home address to your family members\u2019 names, making you a bigger target for future scams. Data removal services can help you scan the web and request the deletion of your info from these brokers. While you can do this manually, it\u2019s time-consuming. Services like\u00a0Incogni offer subscriptions that automate the process and monitor for new exposures. If you\u2019ve been scammed or suspect your information was leaked, using a data removal service adds another layer of protection and peace of mind.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "5. Watch for common red flags: Be cautious of sudden friend requests from unfamiliar accounts, vague messages that mention surprise winnings, poor grammar or any pressure to act quickly. Scammers often use emotional triggers to override your judgment. If something feels off or too convenient, it probably is.",
      "6. Install strong antivirus software on all devices: Some impersonation scams include links to phishing pages or malware. Antivirus tools can block these threats before they reach your inbox. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "7. Use two-factor authentication and a password manager: If a scam compromises your login credentials,\u00a0two-factor authentication (2FA) can block unauthorized access. A password manager also helps protect against reused or weak passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",
      "8. Report the scam right away: Use\u00a0Facebook\u2019s reporting tools to flag fake profiles or messages. You can also file a complaint with the FTC at\u00a0ReportFraud.ftc.gov to help warn others.",

This makes the scope of the exposure particularly dangerous because attackers can use this central trove for targeted attacks, including credential stuffing.",

This technique involves using stolen login details across multiple sites, exploiting the fact that many users reuse the same credentials.

Cybercriminals rely on stolen usernames and passwords to break into accounts, but with 2FA enabled, they cannot gain access without the additional security step. Make sure to enable 2FA on important accounts like email, banking, and work-related logins.",
      "3. Use strong antivirus software and be cautious with downloads and links: Infostealer malware often spreads through malicious downloads, phishing emails, and fake websites. Avoid downloading software or files from untrusted sources, and always double-check links before clicking them. Attackers disguise malware as legitimate software, game cheats, or cracked applications, so it is best to stick to official websites and app stores for downloads.",

      "4. Keep software updated:\u00a0 Cybercriminals exploit outdated software to deliver malware.\u00a0Keeping your operating system, browsers, and security software up to date ensures that known vulnerabilities are patched. Enable automatic updates whenever possible, and install reputable antivirus or endpoint protection software that can detect and block infostealer threats before they compromise your system.",
      "5. Consider a personal data removal service: The massive leak of 16 billion credentials shows just how far your personal information can spread and how easily it can resurface years later in aggregated hacker databases. Even if your passwords were part of an old breach, data like your name, email, phone number, or address may still be available through data broker sites. Personal data removal services can help reduce your exposure by scrubbing this information from hundreds of these sites. While no service can guarantee total removal, they drastically reduce your digital footprint, making it harder for scammers to cross-reference leaked credentials with public data to impersonate or target you. These services monitor and automatically remove your personal info over time, which gives me peace of mind in today\u2019s threat landscape.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "BeBot operates entirely on electric power, relying on batteries and, in some versions, solar panels. This approach ensures there are no emissions, so the robot does not contribute to greenhouse gases or other forms of pollution. Unlike traditional gas-powered beach-cleaning equipment such as tractors, BeBot is quiet and unobtrusive, which allows it to work at any time without disturbing wildlife or beach visitors. Its cleaning capacity is impressive. BeBot can cover up to 32,200 square feet of beach in a single hour, which is 20 to 30 times more effective than manual trash collection. The robot can remove up to 200 pounds of debris in one session, targeting items like plastic bottles, cigarette butts, food packaging, and cotton buds. BeBot's design allows it to dig up to about four inches into the sand, and its sifting grids, which measure roughly half an inch by half an inch, capture even the smallest pieces of plastic and trash that would be difficult for people to collect by hand.",
      "Remote operation is another standout feature. BeBot can be controlled from up to 950 feet away, giving operators the flexibility to clean large or crowded beaches safely. Its unique track system distributes pressure evenly across the sand, which helps prevent beach erosion and protects sensitive habitats such as turtle nesting sites. The robot's battery can last up to three hours on a full charge, and some models can run for as long as eight hours.",

    "story": [
      "Hackers are using Captchas to infect your PC with malware",
      "ClickFix, a social engineering tactic that has been targeting both Windows and Mac users since early 2024, continues to evolve.",
      "Just last month, I reported on how attackers were using fake CAPTCHA prompts to\u00a0trick Windows users into installing malware themselves.",
      "Now, that same trick is being turned against macOS. Cybersecurity researchers have uncovered a new campaign using ClickFix to deliver Atomic macOS Stealer (AMOS), a powerful information-stealing malware targeting Apple systems.",
      "SPOT FAKE ONLINE STORES, AVOID FACEBOOK SUBSCRIPTION SCAMS",
      "Illustration of a hacker at work. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What is ClickFix malware, and how does it work?",
      "Security researchers at\u00a0CloudSEK have identified a new threat targeting macOS users through imitation and deception. The campaign uses a technique known as ClickFix to lure victims through fake online verification prompts. This time, attackers are spoofing Spectrum, a major telecom provider in the United States. They use fraudulent domains that closely resemble Spectrum\u2019s real support portals. These include misleading addresses like panel spectrum net and spectrum ticket net.",
      "Visitors to these sites are shown a standard-looking CAPTCHA box, asking them to verify their identity. When they do, the site displays a fake error message that says the CAPTCHA failed. Users are encouraged to click a button labeled \"Alternative Verification.\" This triggers a command to be copied silently to their clipboard. What happens next depends on the user\u2019s operating system. On macOS, instructions guide the user to paste and run the command in Terminal. That command is actually a shell script designed to steal information and download malware.",
      "The script is particularly dangerous because it uses legitimate macOS system commands. It asks for the system password, harvests credentials and disables security protections. It then downloads AMOS. This is a known information stealer with a history of targeting Apple devices. The malware collects sensitive data like passwords, cryptocurrency wallet keys, browser autofill data and saved cookies.",
      "Researchers believe the campaign was created by Russian-speaking attackers. Clues include comments written in Russian found within the malware\u2019s code. Analysts also noted that the delivery infrastructure was poorly assembled. Mismatched instructions appeared across devices. For example, Linux users were shown Windows commands. Mac users were told to press keys that only exist on Windows machines.",

      "OUTSMART HACKERS WHO ARE OUT TO STEAL YOUR IDENTITY",
      "Why ClickFix attacks are so effective",
      "ClickFix is a social engineering method that has rapidly gained popularity among cybercriminals. It relies on users trusting what they see and blindly following simple instructions. In this campaign, the attacker\u2019s goal is to make the victim execute the infection process themselves. Once the user follows through, the system is compromised without needing a traditional exploit.",
      "Researchers believe ClickFix has been active since at least March 2024. I first reported on it in June 2024, when\u00a0attackers used fake error messages from Google Chrome, Microsoft Word and OneDrive to push their payloads. Victims were shown prompts offering a \"fix,\" which copied a malicious PowerShell command to their clipboard. They were then instructed to paste and run it in PowerShell or through the Run dialog.",
      "By November 2024, the method had evolved further. A\u00a0new wave of attacks targeted Google Meet users, beginning with phishing emails that mimicked internal meeting invites. These emails contained links that redirected to fake Meet landing pages designed to look like they came from the victim\u2019s own organization.",

      "1. Be skeptical of CAPTCHA prompts: Legitimate CAPTCHA tests never require you to paste anything into Terminal. If a website instructs you to do this, it\u2019s likely a scam. Close the page immediately and avoid interacting with it.",
      "2. Don\u2019t click links from unverified emails and use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Many ClickFix attacks also start with phishing emails that impersonate trusted services like Booking.com or Google Meet. Always verify the sender before clicking on links. If an email seems urgent or unexpected, go directly to the company\u2019s official website instead of clicking any links inside the email.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "3. Enable two-factor authentication:\u00a0Enable two-factor authentication whenever possible. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as a code sent to your phone, in addition to your password.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "4. Keep devices updated: Regularly\u00a0updating your operating system, browser, and security software ensures you have the latest patches against known vulnerabilities. Cybercriminals exploit outdated systems, so enabling automatic updates is a simple but effective way to stay protected.",
      "5. Monitor your accounts for suspicious activity and change your passwords:\u00a0If you\u2019ve interacted with a suspicious website, phishing email, or fake login page, check your online accounts for any unusual activity. Look for unexpected login attempts, unauthorized password resets, or financial transactions that you don\u2019t recognize. If anything seems off, change your passwords immediately and report the activity to the relevant service provider. Also, consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",
      "6. Invest in personal data removal service: Consider using a service that monitors your personal information and alerts you to potential breaches or unauthorized use of your data. These services can provide early warning signs of identity theft or other malicious activities resulting from ClickFix or similar attacks. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

The attack didn't just exploit a vulnerability in macOS, but also your familiarity with verification flows. As long as security instructions look like part of the usual experience, people will continue to run malicious code themselves.

      "While Plus Automation's vision is ambitious, it is not without critics. The autonomous trucking industry continues to face scrutiny from regulators, labor unions, and some logistics professionals who question whether the technology is truly ready for wide-scale deployment.",
      "Regulatory uncertainty remains one of the biggest obstacles. Fully autonomous, driver-out operations like\u00a0Plus is testing raise complex questions about safety, liability, and insurance. Many policymakers are cautious, arguing that current oversight and laws have not yet adapted to the fast-moving landscape of vehicle automation.",
      "Labor organizations, particularly the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, have voiced strong opposition. They warn that the widespread adoption of autonomous trucks could displace tens of thousands of human drivers and impact job security across the freight industry. These groups are pushing for more transparency, safety assurances, and legal protections for workers as automation expands. In a public statement opposing the rapid rollout of autonomous trucks, Sean M. O'Brien, General President of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, said this:",
      "\"We are not going to sit back and watch as automation threatens the livelihood of millions of truck drivers across America.\"",
      "This quote underscores the growing tension between innovation and labor rights. For many in the workforce, autonomous trucking is seen less as a technological leap forward and more as a potential disruption to long-standing jobs and livelihoods.",
      "Even within the logistics industry itself, some operators remain skeptical about the pace of adoption. Questions remain about how autonomous systems will handle unpredictable real-world conditions such as bad weather, complex intersections, and rural roadways where sensor performance can vary.",
      "In response, Plus emphasizes its phased approach to automation. Rather than replacing drivers overnight, the company positions its SuperDrive system as a way to augment human capabilities, improve safety, and reduce fatigue. Its deep partnerships with trusted manufacturers and logistics providers are also aimed at easing the transition and building confidence across the industry.",
      "As Plus prepares to go public, how it addresses these concerns from regulators, workers, and industry stakeholders will be critical. Earning trust may prove just as important as advancing the technology itself.",

      "Self-driving truck\u00a0 (Plus Automation)",
      "The long road to autonomous safety",
      "According to Linda Garner-Bunch, managing editor of The\u00a0Trucker Media Group:",
      "\"The idea of developing viable \u2014 and safe \u2014 autonomous Class 8 trucks has been around since the 1990s, with lots of tech firms tossing their hats in the ring. Many of those firms have failed, often because of a lack of funding. In addition, both the general public and the trucking industry have expressed concerns about the safety of current autonomous technology. After all, an 80,000-pound driverless truck can do a lot more damage than a 6,000-pound passenger car if something goes wrong!",
      "To address this, legislation has been introduced requiring that a qualified human operator be present in autonomous heavy-duty trucks to take over manual control as needed. Even so, autonomous tech is becoming increasingly common in both commercial and private vehicles \u2014 think anti-lock brakes, adaptive cruise control, automatic emergency braking, lane assist, camera systems \u2026 the list goes on and on.",
      "Autonomy may be the future of the trucking industry, but it\u2019s not ready for full deployment at this time. Adequate funding is needed to ensure that the development and testing of autonomous technology is done properly and safely. The merger between Plus and Churchill Capital Corp IX will help ensure the company has the necessary capital to conduct research, development, and testing while ensuring the safety of everyone on the road.\"",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Autonomous trucking might still sound futuristic to some, but companies like Plus Automation are proving it's already becoming a reality. With real-world testing, major industry partnerships, and a smart approach to scaling, Plus is putting itself in a strong position to lead this next chapter in logistics. That said, the journey won't be without its challenges. From regulatory roadblocks to concerns about the impact on jobs, there's still a lot to figure out. But if Plus can keep building trust and showing that its tech really does make trucking safer and more efficient, it could help reshape how freight moves across the U.S. and beyond.",

Consider using a personal data removal service:\u00a0 If you're receiving password reset emails from accounts you don't remember signing up for, or from multiple services, there's a good chance your personal information is exposed on data broker sites. These companies collect and sell your data, including your email, phone number, home address and even login information from old accounts. Using a reputable data removal service can help you automatically identify and request the removal of your personal data from these sites.

When 2FA is active, anyone trying to log in must also complete a second verification step, usually through an app on your phone. If an attacker triggers a login attempt, you will receive a prompt to approve or deny it. This gives you the power to block the attempt in real time and confirms that 2FA is working as intended.",

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaways",
      "It's easy to brush off an unexpected password reset message, especially if nothing else seems out of place. But these alerts are often the digital equivalent of a knock at the door when you weren't expecting anyone. Whether it's a hacker probing for a way in or a scammer trying to bait you, the smartest move is to treat every unexpected security message as a wake-up call. Taking just a few minutes to check your login history, secure your accounts and update your passwords can make all the difference. Cybersecurity isn't just for experts anymore. It's an integral part of everyday life. And the more proactive you are now, the less likely you'll be dealing with damage control later.",

In recent years, tax preparation companies, accounting software vendors and data brokers have all found themselves in the crosshairs of increasingly aggressive ransomware gangs. These attacks don\u2019t just disrupt operations but also expose deeply personal financial information that can fuel identity theft, fraud and long-term reputational damage.",
      "Now, Optima Tax Relief, one of the most prominent tax resolution firms in the U.S., has joined that growing list. A ransomware group called Chaos claims to have breached Optima\u2019s systems, stealing 69 GB of data before encrypting internal servers.",

      "If your information was part of the Optima breach or any similar one, it\u2019s worth taking a few steps to protect yourself.",
      "1. Consider identity theft protection services: Since the Optima data breach exposed personal and financial information, it\u2019s crucial to stay proactive against identity theft. Identity theft protection services offer continuous monitoring of your credit reports, Social Security number and even the dark web to detect if your information is being misused.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "2. Monitor your accounts and transactions:\u00a0The Optima data breach might have revealed bank details to attackers, which means they can misuse those details to steal your money. You should check your online accounts and transactions regularly for any suspicious or unauthorized activity. If you notice anything unusual, immediately report it to the service provider or authorities. You should also review your credit reports and scores to see if there are any signs of identity theft or fraud. To report identity theft, visit the FTC\u2019s\u00a0IdentityTheft.gov.",
      "3. \u00a0Contact your bank and credit card companies:\u00a0Since Optima hackers might have obtained bank and credit card information, they could use it to make purchases or withdrawals without your consent. You should inform your bank and credit card companies of the situation. They can help you freeze or cancel your cards, dispute any fraudulent charges and issue new cards for you. You should also contact one of the three major credit reporting agencies \u2014 Equifax, Experian or TransUnion \u2014 and request a fraud alert to be placed on your credit file. This will make it more difficult for identity thieves to open new accounts in your name without verification.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "4. Use personal data removal services:\u00a0The data breach leaks loads of information about you, and all this could end up in the public domain, which essentially gives anyone an opportunity to scam you. One proactive step is to consider personal data removal services, which specialize in continuously monitoring and removing your information from various online databases and websites.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Get a\u00a0free scan\u00a0to find out if your personal information is already out on the web.",
      "5. Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0Optima hackers most likely have people\u2019s email addresses and full names, which makes it easy for them to send you a phishing link that installs malware and steals all your data. These messages are socially engineered to catch them, and catching them is nearly impossible if you\u2019re not careful. However, you\u2019re not without defenses.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "6. Enable two-factor authentication:\u00a0While passwords weren\u2019t part of the data breach, you still need to enable\u00a0two-factor authentication (2FA). It gives you an extra layer of security on all your important accounts, including email, banking and social media. Two-factor authentication requires you to provide a second piece of information, such as a code sent to your phone, in addition to your password when logging in. This makes it significantly harder for hackers to access your accounts, even if they have your password. Enabling 2FA can greatly reduce the risk of unauthorized access and protect your sensitive data.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The Optima breach is not an isolated event, but part of a larger failure to adapt to the sophistication of modern ransomware groups. When companies with access to tax and identity data are compromised, it\u2019s not just an internal issue; it becomes a national one. For an industry built on trust, breaches like this erode public confidence in systems that are already strained. Attacks like these raise fresh concerns about the cybersecurity preparedness of companies that handle tax and financial data. Unlike login credentials or email addresses, stolen tax information cannot be easily reset. For victims, the consequences of such a breach could stretch across years.",

      "After strikes on Iran\u2019s key nuclear sites by U.S. forces Saturday, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) issued a National Terrorism Advisory System Bulletin warning of the heightened risk of domestic terrorism from Iranian-backed or domestic attackers.",

      "Sleeper cells are groups planted within a country by a foreign government to live and work among citizens with the ultimate goal of eventually carrying out a terror attack or politically motivated act of violence.",
      "Due to depleted funding and resources, terror organizations such as Hezbollah and Hamas have been forced to \"sit this one out\" when it comes to aiding Iran in its attacks, significantly depleting the regime\u2019s show of force when looking to retaliate against the U.S. and Israel, according to Barak Seener, a senior fellow at the Henry Jackson Society.",

      "The threat to Americans\u2019 safety has U.S. officials on high alert, and DHS and the FBI are ramping up security measures throughout the country.

      "However, Seener also raised the possibility of Iranian operatives commandeering anti-Israel campus protests throughout the U.S. while using cyber warfare to launch disinformation campaigns on social media.",
      "\"Much of the opposition to U.S. foreign policy toward Israel and Gaza has been people that have been coming to the [country] on student visas,\" Seener said. \"They\u2019re not U.S. nationals. And, yet, they\u2019re able to create a disturbance and contribute to an enormous disruption.\"",

      "While the bulletin released by DHS does not cite any specific threats to the American people, local, state and federal law enforcement agencies throughout the country are on high alert as they encourage people to remain vigilant with tensions between the U.S. and Iran continuing to rise.",
      "\"There are no rules of engagement to a rogue regime like Iran,\" Seener said. \"Everything is fair game. Western democracies don\u2019t operate in that manner, and it\u2019s alien to us, but that is how Iran operates.\"",

Nuclear proliferation is nonpartisan, and this was an apolitical win.\" Even after Iran struck a U.S. base in Qatar, he added, \"the President showed immense restraint and kept focus on the broader goal: preventing Iran from getting a nuclear weapon and continuing its terror campaign.\"",
      "Despite the violence that followed the announcement \u2014 including an Iranian strike that killed four civilians in Israel \u2014 Spencer believes the ceasefire will hold. \"Both countries have now said we\u2019re absolutely going to do it,\" he said. \"And yes, President Trump is very atypical in the way he communicates with the ceasefire\u2026 with the \u2018don\u2019t drop a single bomb.\u2019\"",

      "\"Iran cannot win this war,\" said Danny Orbach, a military historian at Hebrew University. \"They\u2019ve lost roughly 60% of their launchers. Even if they still have around 1,000 long-range missiles, without enough functioning launchers, they can\u2019t deploy them effectively.\"",

      "\"What has largely remained intact is Iran\u2019s short-range capability,\" said Blaise Misztal, vice president of policy at the Jewish Institute for National Security of America (JINSA). \"These are thousands of rockets, missiles, and drones that can\u2019t reach Israel, but can absolutely hit U.S. bases in Qatar, Iraq, Bahrain, and the UAE. That\u2019s what we saw in the strike on Al Udeid.\"",

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The White House plans to limit intelligence sharing with members of Congress after an early assessment of damage caused by U.S. strikes on Iran\u2019s nuclear sites leaked this week, a senior White House official confirmed to NBC News.",
      "The administration specifically plans to post less information on CAPNET, the system used to share classified material with Congress, the official said.",
      "The decision, which almost certainly won\u2019t sit well with Democrats, comes as top Cabinet officials are set to provide a classified briefing to members of the Senate on Thursday afternoon about the strikes.",
      "\u201cThe administration should immediately undo this decision,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., told NBC News Thursday. \u201cThey seem not to want to see the facts to get out. Just Trump\u2019s version of the facts, which we know is often false.\"",
      "Axios first reported the administration\u2019s intention of limiting the information provided to Congress.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., echoed outrage from President Donald Trump and his allies Thursday over the reporting of the Defense Intelligence Agency's early assessment of the U.S. strikes on Iran, which said that its nuclear program had been sent back by only three to six months.",
      "\u201cThere was a leak, and we\u2019re trying to get down to the bottom of that. It\u2019s dangerous and ridiculous that happened. We\u2019re going to solve that problem, and we\u2019ll keep the coordination,\u201d Johnson told NBC News. When asked if he thought the leak came from Congress, the speaker replied, \u201cThat\u2019s my suspicion.\u201d",
      "Despite the administration\u2019s crackdown and Johnson's suspicions, it\u2019s not known whether the leak came from a member of Congress.",
      "Lawmakers had access to the initial assessment regarding the strikes from the Defense Intelligence Agency and were able to view it in a secure location in the Capitol, known as a SCIF, as NBC News previously reported. The assessment was transmitted to leadership through these official channels.",
      "The Senate is expected to receive a classified briefing on Capitol Hill on Thursday afternoon, which was originally scheduled for  Tuesday. Democrats have decried the administration\u2019s delay as an effort to hide information about the strikes from Congress.",
      "The White House is expected to send four senior administration officials to brief senators Thursday including, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, CIA Director John Ratcliffe, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Gen. Dan Caine, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, two sources with knowledge of the matter said Wednesday.",
      "Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard won't be present at the briefing. \u201cCIA Director Ratcliffe will represent the intelligence community tomorrow while Tulsi Gabbard continues her critical work at DNI. The media is turning this into something it\u2019s not,\" a senior administration official said.",
      "Trump administration officials have been engaged in a full-court press since the strikes \u2014 and the early assessment \u2014 defending the military's targeting of three major nuclear facilities in Iran and claiming their total \"obliteration.\"",
      "Hegseth and Caine held a briefing with reporters at the Pentagon on Thursday morning in which the defense secretary scolded reporters for publishing information about the classified early assessment and Caine detailed what went into the operation and the impact the strikes were expected to have in Iran.",
      "Hegseth emphasized that the assessment was preliminary and pointed to a statement Ratcliffe issued Wednesday saying that Iran's nuclear program had been \"severely damaged\" by the strikes and that several key sites had been \"destroyed.\""

    "summary": "Iranian lawmakers voted to suspend cooperation with the IAEA, as Ayatollah Ali Khamenei made his first comments in more than a week.",
    "story": [
      "Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, broke his weeklong silence Thursday, claiming in a televised speech that his country had secured a victory over Israel and delivered a \"slap in the face\" to Washington.",
      "Hours earlier, Iran's government also approved legislation to suspend cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency, a move that will stymie efforts to assess the damage from U.S. airstrikes and monitor uranium enrichment.",
      "\u201cThe Islamic Republic emerged victorious and, in return, delivered a harsh slap to America\u2019s face,\u201d Khamenei said after eight days of silence.",
      "The United States had \u201centered a direct war\u201d because it felt like Israel would be \u201ccompletely destroyed\u201d if it didn\u2019t, he said, adding that \u201cit gained nothing from this war.\u201d Israel \"had to understand that attacking Iran would come at a heavy cost and thanks to God, that\u2019s exactly what happened,\u201d he said.",
      "Israel's strikes have killed a slew of top Iranian military officials and nuclear scientists. There is still debate, within the U.S. and internationally, about the extent of the damage of American strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities.",
      "Khamenei claimed that \"the Americans failed to achieve anything significant in their attack on nuclear facilities.\" On assertions by President Donald Trump that Iran's nuclear sites were \"obliterated,\" the supreme leader added, \"It\u2019s clear that the American president needs to exaggerate, they resort to exaggeration to cover up the truth.\u201d",
      "On Wednesday, the Iranian Parliament voted to suspend IAEA cooperation with only one abstention among the 223 lawmakers and none voting against it. Thursday saw the bill's approval by the country's powerful Guardian Council, which includes theologians selected by the supreme leader.",
      "\"Iran\u2019s peaceful nuclear program will continue with greater speed,\" Speaker Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf said later. While Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmail Baghaei said the bill \u201cis a clear response to the illegal attacks against our country.\"",
      "It would mean IAEA inspectors \u201cwill not be allowed entry into the country unless the security of nuclear sites and the peaceful nature of Iran\u2019s nuclear activities are guaranteed,\u201d he said. And any inspections would also be \u201csubject to approval by the Supreme National Security Council,\u201d he added.",
      "It would thwart efforts by IAEA Director Rafael Grossi, who told the French radio station RFI that he was \"enormously\" concerned at the development.",
      "\"The agency\u2019s presence in Iran is not some kind of generous gesture,\" he said. \"It is an international responsibility.\"",
      "The CIA has cited credible intelligence that Iran\u2019s nuclear program was \u201cseverely damaged.\u201d While a Defense Intelligence Agency initial assessment leaked Tuesday found it may have only been set back several months, less than claimed by Trump.",
      "At a Pentagon news conference, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth hailed a \"historically successful strike\" and criticized the media for what he said were overly negative reports of the strikes.",
      "Iran says it is not trying to build a nuclear weapon, and it had been complying with the landmark 2015 nuclear deal, which most experts said was successful in limiting its program, until that was effectively axed by Trump in 2018.",
      "After that, Iran began enriching uranium to much higher grades, more than needed for energy and approaching the potency required for a bomb, the IAEA said.",
      "Grossi also said the country, as a member of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, is required have an inspection system.",
      "\"It is a legal obligation from the point of view of international law, which cannot be suspended unilaterally,\" he said. \"I hope that will not be the case, because otherwise we would be on the verge of a new major crisis.\"",
      "This 1970 international agreement says that any signatory is barred from developing a nuclear weapon and must be subject to IAEA inspections. Iran, which signed the deal in 1968, says it does not have nuclear weapons; Israel, which is estimated to have around 90 warheads, has never signed the pact.",
      "Iran hard-liners in Washington and elsewhere have been pushing to impose a \u201czero enrichment\u201d ban on Iran \u2014 meaning it would be prevented even from using enriched uranium for nuclear power. Iranian officials point to these arguments as reasons why the country should renege.",
      "\u201cIf we are to remain a member of this treaty, we cannot accept only its obligations while being deprived of the rights it guarantees,\u201d Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Baghaei said Wednesday. \u201cThese rights are clearly defined: the right to peaceful nuclear energy for non-military purposes.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian held a call with his Egyptian counterpart, Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi. \u201cIran is ready to cooperate in enhancing regional security and strengthening peace and stability,\u201d Pezeshkian said, according to state media. \u201cWe support the establishment of a region free of nuclear weapons and even weapons of mass destruction.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to launch airstrikes on several nuclear facilities in Iran has divided Americans and exposed fault lines within the coalitions of both parties, according to an NBC News Decision Desk Poll powered by SurveyMonkey.",
      "Among U.S. adults, 45% oppose the airstrikes, versus 38% who support them. An additional 18% of Americans said they neither support nor oppose the strikes, illustrating how fluid the situation is.",
      "While this survey was in the field from Monday through Wednesday, Iran launched a retaliatory missile barrage at a U.S. military site in Qatar. Trump then announced a ceasefire between Israel and Iran, chastised both countries for appearing to break the terms and then congratulated them for stopping attacks. Meanwhile, questions remain about the ultimate consequences of the U.S. strikes, including exactly what damage they did to Iran\u2019s nuclear program.",
      "Support for the airstrikes divided predictably along partisan lines. Among Democrats, 77% oppose the airstrikes, with 61% strongly opposed. In a near-mirror image, 78% of Republicans support the airstrikes, with 60% strongly supporting them.",
      "Independents are much more divided, with 45% opposing the airstrikes, 21% supporting and 34% who neither support nor oppose the move \u2014 almost twice the share of the overall population who took the neutral position.",
      "The lead-up to the strikes on Saturday exposed a split in the Republican Party between those with isolationist tendencies in the MAGA wing of the GOP and those with more hawkish, traditionalist Republican Party foreign policy positions. A testy exchange between right-wing commentator Tucker Carlson and Sen. Ted Cruz, of Texas, illustrated the divide, with Carlson forcefully arguing that attacking Iran would betray the president\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d promises.",
      "But while there is a split among Republicans in the poll, it is an exact inversion of the public debate between prominent pro-Trump figures.",
      "While all Republican factions support the airstrikes, respondents who identify with the MAGA movement are significantly more supportive of them than those who identify as traditional Republicans. Though there are some high-profile dissenters on Iran within the MAGA movement, the movement's rank and file is firmly in favor of the strikes.",
      "Fully 84% of Republicans who identify with the MAGA movement support the strikes, including 70% who strongly support them. In contrast, 72% of Republicans who identify themselves more as supporters of the party support the strikes, with 49% strongly supporting them.",
      "What happens next",
      "While more Americans oppose the airstrikes than support them, a majority (60%) also support a continuation in military action if Iran\u2019s nuclear program remains intact. Initial intelligence assessments indicate that the strikes only set Iran\u2019s nuclear program back three to six months, though it will take more time to make a final assessment. Trump and his administration have pushed back against those conclusions.",
      "Overall, 26% of Americans say that the U.S. should consider all options for future military action, including the use of ground troops. A slightly higher 34% say they support continued military operations, but only through airstrikes. The remainder of Americans (41%) believe the U.S. should not take further military action in Iran.",
      "The question of how to proceed with military action in Iran also splits the Democratic coalition, with a large divide between those who identify themselves more as supporters of the party versus those who identify themselves more as supporters of the progressive movement.",
      "Among progressives, 75% say the U.S. should not take any further military action in Iran. Meanwhile, supporters of the traditional wing of the Democratic Party are nearly evenly split, with 54% saying that no further action should be taken, and 45% supporting some degree of further action if Iran maintains its nuclear program. Nearly one-fifth \u2014 19% \u2014 of  traditional Democrats believe that the U.S. should consider all options, including the use of ground forces.",
      "Tempering this support for continued military action in Iran is a deep concern about the conflict escalating into a broader regional conflict in the Middle East. A full 78% of Americans are very or somewhat concerned about the conflict escalating. This includes 55% of Republicans, 83% of independents and 95% of Democrats.",
      "The role of Congress",
      "Members of Congress from both parties have questioned the legality of Trump\u2019s decision to launch the military strikes on Iran. Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., called the strikes unconstitutional, and he had joined with Democrats to introduce a bipartisan resolution before the attacks to block such action without congressional authorization. (He later said that the cessation of hostilities after the strikes would remove the need for a vote on the resolution.)",
      "A majority (60%) of Americans say that Trump should have received congressional authorization before launching the strikes.",
      "While responses to this question were deeply divided along partisan lines, 19% of Republicans agreed that Trump should have received congressional approval first. And 92% of Democrats agreed with the need for authorization, as did 71% of independents.",
      "The NBC News Decision Desk Poll powered by SurveyMonkey was conducted online June 23-25 among a national sample of 5,448 adults ages 18 and over. The margin of error is plus or minus 3.1 percentage points."

      "A Defense Intelligence Agency initial assessment leaked Tuesday found that the U.S. bombing of three Iranian nuclear sites may have set back the country's nuclear program by only several months, a more limited impact than President Donald Trump stated after the strikes.",
      "The precise damage inflicted on Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities and the viability of its broader program have become politically charged issues, with Trump and his deputies denouncing the leak of the DIA report and the news outlets that reported it. Democratic lawmakers have accused the White House of possibly overstating the effect of the strikes.",
      "Ratcliffe said on social media that the CIA\u2019s findings were based on \u201ccredible intelligence\u201d and that they contradicted what he called \u201cillegally sourced public reporting regarding the destruction of key Iranian nuclear facilities.\u201d",
      "Ratcliffe cited new intelligence from a \"historically reliable and accurate source/method that several key Iranian nuclear facilities were destroyed and would have to be rebuilt over the course of years.\u201d",
      "Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, offered a similar assessment earlier in the day.",
      "Arms control experts and former intelligence officials say Iran could revive its nuclear program even without the three nuclear sites that were targeted if it managed to safeguard a sufficient supply of highly enriched uranium and advanced centrifuges.",
      "Rafael Grossi, head of the United Nations atomic watchdog agency, said Wednesday in Vienna that it was possible Iran still had a stockpile of highly enriched uranium despite a 12-day Israeli air campaign and the U.S. air raids over the weekend. Tehran may have moved the uranium soon after the first bombing raids by Israel, he said.",
      "Before Ratcliffe released his statement, Trump dismissed the DIA assessment as inconclusive and premature and said repeatedly that Iran\u2019s nuclear sites and nuclear program had been \u201cobliterated.\u201d",
      "The DIA labeled its initial assessment as being of \u201clow confidence,\u201d according to three sources with knowledge of the matter.",
      "Intelligence analysts typically present their findings with varying levels of confidence, depending on the quality and credibility of the information available.",
      "The initial DIA assessment was based on findings from Sunday night, about 24 hours after the U.S. bombing raid against three Iranian nuclear facilities, one of the sources said.",
      "A full battle damage assessment is still underway, the report also said, and it will take days to weeks to complete, according to one of the sources.",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth told reporters at the NATO summit in the Netherlands that the DIA assessment was marked as being of \u201clow confidence\" because the evidence of what was bombed \u201cis buried under a mountain, devastated and obliterated.\u201d",
      "NBC News reported Tuesday that the initial assessment found that the strikes had most likely set back Iran\u2019s nuclear program by about three to six months but did not definitively destroy Iran\u2019s nuclear program as Trump has asserted.",
      "Initial intelligence reporting does not indicate that all of Iran\u2019s stockpile of highly enriched uranium has been destroyed or accounted for, and there are still questions about Iran\u2019s advanced centrifuges, which were not found at the nuclear sites bombed by U.S. aircraft, NBC News also reported Tuesday.",
      "The Israeli Atomic Energy Commission said Wednesday that the U.S. bombing had rendered the Fordo underground enrichment site \u201cinoperable.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe assess that the American strikes on Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities, combined with Israeli strikes on other elements of Iran\u2019s military nuclear program, has set back Iran\u2019s ability to develop nuclear weapons by many years,\u201d the commission said in a statement.",

    "story": [
      "A longtime anti-vaccine activist gave a presentation at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s vaccine advisory committee meeting Thursday about an issue that has long been considered settled science.",
      "It was perhaps the clearest sign of how meetings of the panel, called the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, have already changed drastically under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who recently fired all 17 members of the panel and replaced them with his own appointees.",
      "The presenter, nurse practitioner Lyn Redwood, is the president emerita of Children\u2019s Health Defense, the anti-vaccine group founded by Kennedy. Her presentation focused on thimerosal, a mercury-based preservative that had previously been used in some vaccines. Since 2001, however, nearly all vaccines made in the United States contain no thimerosal or only trace amounts. The exceptions are multi-dose flu shot vials, though most flu shots now come in single-dose packaging that doesn\u2019t contain the preservative.",
      "Anti-vaccine activists have long claimed that thimerosal is linked to autism, but the link has been widely debunked. Redwood referred to \u201cneurodevelopmental disorders\u201d rather than autism in her presentation, but after the presentation she asserted links between thimerosal and brain inflammation, which she called \u201cone of the hallmarks that we see in autism.\u201d",
      "A background briefing document that was available on the CDC\u2019s website Tuesday said a summary of studies found \u201cno association between prenatal exposure to thimerosal-containing vaccinations and autism spectrum disorder in children.\u201d The document was taken down Wednesday without explanation. An ACIP member, Dr. Robert Malone, said Thursday at the meeting that, based on his understanding, \u201cthat article was not authorized by the office of the secretary and has been removed.\u201d",
      "Dr. David Higgins, a pediatrician and preventive medicine specialist at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, decried the document\u2019s removal.",
      "\u201cDecades of evidence were ignored or even hidden,\u201d said Higgins, who wasn\u2019t a part of the meeting. \u201cThat\u2019s not being transparent. That\u2019s not scientific integrity.\u201d",
      "After the presentation, the committee voted 5-1 to recommend that children, adults and pregnant women get single-dose thimerosal-free flu vaccines. One member, Vicky Pebsworth, abstained.",
      "Before ACIP recommendations are implemented, the CDC director must sign off on them. However, there is no director, as the nominee for the position, Susan Monarez, awaits confirmation by the Senate. In the absence of a director, Kennedy has the authority to adopt the ACIP\u2019s recommendations. ACIP recommendations don\u2019t mean the multi-dose vials are banned; for that to happen, the Food and Drug Administration would need to revoke approval.",
      "Thimerosal-free flu shots account for the majority of the doses given in the United States. Just 4% to 5% of flu vaccines used during the 2024-25 season were multi-dose, thimerosal-containing vaccines, Tracey Beth H\u00f8eg, a special adviser to the FDA commissioner, said during the meeting.",
      "Dr. Cody Meissner, a pediatrician, was the lone dissenting vote.",
      "\u201cThe risk from influenza is so much greater than the nonexistent, as far as we know, risk from thimerosal,\u201d Meissner said of his vote. \u201cI would hate for a person not to receive the influenza vaccine because the only available preparation contains thimerosal. I find that very hard to justify.\u201d",
      "Meissner had initially followed up Redwood\u2019s presentation by saying he wasn\u2019t sure how to respond to it. \u201cThis is an old issue that has been addressed in the past,\u201d he said.",
      "Multiple infectious disease experts said on a media call Thursday after the ACIP meeting that multi-dose vaccines can be useful for vaccinating large groups such as workers. The decision not to recommend thimerosal-containing vaccines could also dissuade other countries \u2014 where multi-dose vials are more common \u2014 from using them, thereby reducing vaccine access, they added.",
      "Dr. Sean O\u2019Leary, the American Academy of Pediatrics\u2019 liaison to ACIP, called Redwood\u2019s presentation \u201cunprecedented.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat was a highly biased presentation full of cherry-picked data and junk science,\u201d O\u2019Leary said. \u201cThe vast majority of it wasn\u2019t actually relevant to thimerosal in vaccines.\u201d",
      "O\u2019Leary told reporters in a call Thursday that the AAP chose not to participate in the meeting, which it usually does. \u201cThis meeting showcased an ACIP that has drifted so far from its long-standing focus on science, evidence and public health. When that focus returns, we will, too,\u201d he said.",
      "Higgins, the Colorado pediatrician who wasnot part of the meeting, said, \u201cIt\u2019s outrageous that a decision as consequential as this would be decided based on a single presentation from someone who arguably is not an expert in the field.\u201d",
      "Redwood\u2019s presentation also triggered a slew of responses from representatives of major medical organizations participating in the meeting, who questioned the veracity of the data that was presented and asked to see credible scientific evidence.",
      "\u201cWill there be an actual CDC presentation done by staff scientists, physicians and those who are subject matter experts with accurate, peer-reviewed scientific data,?\u201d Dr. Jason Goldman, the American College of Physicians\u2019 liaison to ACIP, asked the committee, \u201cor will we have lay person presentations only?\u201d",
      "Committee Chair Martin Kulldorff, a biostatistician who has criticized pandemic lockdowns and Covid vaccines, scolded those representatives for their pushback.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s inappropriate to dismiss a presentation just because the person does not have a Ph.D. or an M.D.,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are a lot of knowledgeable people who we would like to hear from, and we want to hear from a variety of viewpoints. And I think today\u2019s discussion is a very good example that we have received input from a variety of people on this topic.\u201d",
      "In a separate vote, the committee reaffirmed the existing recommendation that people ages 6 months and older should get annual flu shots, with six votes in favor. Pebsworth again chose to abstain.",
      "Votes in favor of RSV drug",
      "Earlier Thursday, the committee voted on whether to recommend an RSV drug for infants younger than 8 months. Five members voted in favor and two voted against, providing the majority needed for the recommendation to pass.",
      "The drug up for a vote Thursday, clesrovimab, is a monoclonal antibody injection that can prevent lower respiratory disease in infants during or before their first RSV season, which typically starts in the fall and peaks in the winter. RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus, leads to up to 300 deaths a year among those younger than 5 in the United States. A dramatic spike in severe RSV overwhelmed children\u2019s hospitals in late 2022.",
      "The FDA approved clesrovimab this month. A similar drug, nirsevimab, has also been approved for infants and some young children since 2023. A vaccine for pregnant women that also protects newborns is approved, as well.",
      "Meissner, who was part of the committee\u2019s work group on RSV, fielded questions from fellow members about the trial data and the disease itself. He explained how newborns\u2019 tiny airways put them at higher risk for severe illness. That risk, he said, falls in their second year of life, when the airways are larger. The work group determined that the drug was effective at preventing severe RSV in young infants and had a favorable safety profile.",
      "\u201cThese are truly remarkable products. They are safe, and they\u2019re effective,\u201d Meissner said. \u201cThe FDA has spent an enormous amount of time looking at safety and efficacy.\u201d",
      "Even so, two members of the group, Pebsworth and Retsef Levi, questioned the drug\u2019s safety and voted not to recommend it."

    "published": "Thu, 26 Jun 2025 20:00:40 GMT",
    "summary": "Zohran Mamdani\u2019s online videos have echoes of the meme-fueled Kamala Harris presidential campaign, but there were key differences.",
    "story": [
      "Sitting on the subway and holding a MetroCard as a microphone, Zohran Mamdani had a hot take for New York City: He should be its next mayor.",
      "The scene was from a June \u201cSubway Takes\u201d TikTok video that amassed more than 3 million views  \u2014 part of a broader push by Mamdani to meet voters where they lived online. By the time his grassroots campaign reached primary day, he had won the backing of major social media figures like Emily Ratajkowski and engaged with voters through popular accounts like Pop Crave.",
      "Thousands expressed enthusiasm for his candidacy in comments on his dozens of social media videos, which experts say pitched his platform and personality to voters so convincingly that he outpaced former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo in polls before beating him in first-choice votes in the ranked-choice primary. (It may take a week or longer for the winner to be declared.)",
      "When Mamdani, a 33-year-old state lawmaker, announced his mayoral candidacy last fall, he was little-known and considered a long shot. He was a self-described democratic socialist and deeply critical of Israel\u2019s actions in Gaza \u2014 factors that made him an unlikely Democratic candidate at a time when the party was  veering away from left-leaning values.",
      "But in the months leading up to Tuesday\u2019s election, Mamdani skyrocketed from obscurity to internet fame, amassing more than 1 million followers on Instagram, as well as hundreds of thousands on TikTok and X. Though his viral social media campaign has echoes of Kamala Harris\u2019 own meme-filled presidential run, analysts say Mamdani\u2019s exhibited key differences that helped usher him to an apparent victory.",
      "\u201cIf you ask voters, \u2018Why did you vote for Mamdani?\u2019 ... I don\u2019t think they\u2019re going to tell us, \u2018Oh, because I saw some cute thing on social media,\u2019\u201d said Jonathan Nagler, a politics professor at New York University and the co-director of its Center for Social Media and Politics. \u201cI think they\u2019re going to say what actually influenced them is because they learned something on social media about policies he had that mattered to them.\u201d",
      "In his viral videos, Mamdani makes his hopes for the city clear: to lower the cost of living by raising taxes on the richest New Yorkers. His core campaign promises \u2014 rent freezes, fast and free buses, universal child care \u2014 have been the bedrock of his online platform. The more policy-focused online discussion stands apart from the content that defined Harris\u2019 online campaign, which included the aesthetics of Charli XCX\u2019s Brat and viral nonpolicy soundbites like Harris\u2019 reference to falling out of a \u201ccoconut tree.\u201d But along with policy, Mamdani also added personal flair to his online campaigning.",
      "In one recent video, Mamdani dapped up New Yorkers as he walked Manhattan from tip to tip, saying that residents \u201cdeserve a mayor they can see, they can hear, they can even yell at.\u201d He explained ranked-choice voting while speaking fluent Hindi in another video, complete with playful South Asian pop culture references. And when his campaign became the first to reach the $8 million spending cap in this year\u2019s mayoral race, Mamdani posted a video urging viewers to stop donating and volunteer to canvass instead.",
      "Anthony DiMieri, a filmmaker who works on Mamdani\u2019s campaign videos, said part of the mayoral candidate\u2019s popularity comes from the consistency of his character on and off camera. Mamdani is also highly involved in the video ideation process, he said, and will often add in spontaneous jokes or ideas during shooting.",
      "\u201cWe met people on the campaign trail who said they joined because of the videos. We were like, \u2018What brought you here?\u2019 and they\u2019re like, \u2018I just loved his videos\u2019 and \u2018I haven\u2019t seen anybody like this,\u2019\u201d DiMieri said. \u201cWe\u2019ve all had a lot of fun doing this work, and I think the fun we\u2019re having is translating to audiences.\u201d",
      "The momentum grew offline, too, as tens of thousands of volunteers showed up to door-knock for Mamdani in their neighborhoods. Online, his supporters shared stories of how they convinced their family, friends and neighbors to rank him first.",
      "Pranjal Jain, a digital strategist who worked on influencer strategy for Harris\u2019 vice presidential campaign in 2020, said Mamdani\u2019s social presence \u201cdismantles the ivory tower\u201d that so many politicians keep themselves in. He\u2019s meeting New Yorkers on the streets with a warm smile, she said, and speaking to them like they\u2019re his peers.",
      "\u201cHe is so smiley, he\u2019s so giggly. He\u2019s always hugging people,\u201d Jain said. \u201cHe\u2019s just running a grassroots and community-driven campaign, and I think his body language embodies that. Like, I\u2019ve never seen Cuomo hug anyone in my entire life.\u201d",
      "Experts agreed that the personality that shone through in Mamdani\u2019s videos effectively captured his audience in a way that Cuomo couldn\u2019t.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not only about online or social media presence and filming spectacular actions,\u201d said Magdalena Wojcieszak, a communication professor at the University of California Davis. \u201cIt\u2019s also the fact that Mamdani is a very young \u2018digital native\u2019 outsider who has the charisma, humor, and personable nature that many politicians across the political aisle lack partly due to their age, political experience, and being seen as part of the \u2018establishment.\u2019\u201d",
      "Similar to Harris and President Donald Trump during their presidential campaigns, Mamdani has also been backed by online influencers and celebrities, appearing in videos with personalities ranging from \"Saturday Night Live\" cast member Sarah Sherman to left-wing Twitch streamer Hasan Piker.",
      "But Jain said Mamdani\u2019s influencer collaborations worked because these videos still incorporated talk of his policies and positions as opposed to relying on \u201cfluff.\u201d He took a different approach to Harris\u2019 campaign, which she said failed despite being backed by \u201cBrat summer\u201d and celebrity appearances because those partnerships didn\u2019t meaningfully showcase why they aligned with Harris as a candidate.",
      "Throughout his campaign, clips of his mayoral debates, including his handling of questions pressing him on his opinions on Israel and his searing critiques of Cuomo, also became fodder for memes and discourse that propelled him further into online popularity.",
      "Meanwhile, Mamdani has remained firm on some of the most controversial stances in establishment American politics: He has characterized Israel\u2019s actions in Gaza as \u201cgenocide\u201d and described the phrase \u201cglobalize the intifada\u201d as capturing \u201ca desperate desire for equality and equal rights in standing up for Palestinian human rights\u201d \u2014 positions that have garnered him accusations of antisemitism.",
      "\u201cIt pains me to be painted as if I am somehow in opposition to the very Jewish New Yorkers that I know and love and that are such a key part of this city,\u201d Mamdani said last week at an event in Manhattan, where he also shared that he has gotten anti-Muslim death threats to himself and his family.",
      "Online, Mamdani has also faced increasing Islamophobic rhetoric from right-wing commentators and politicians. After his victory Tuesday, X was inundated with posts calling him a \u201cMuslim jihadist\u201d and comparing his win to the 9/11 terror attacks.",
      "To Jain, Tuesday\u2019s election was proof that Mamdani\u2019s viability as a candidate didn\u2019t hinge on his willingness to budge on his beliefs, such as his democratic socialist agenda and his support for Palestinians.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s really admirable that he stuck to his values. And I think that\u2019s what people want to see. No more of this centrist bulls---, right? It\u2019s important that we are able to see our politicians\u2019 opinions so we know if they\u2019re reflected in us or not,\u201d Jain said. \u201cI feel like he ran a campaign because he believes that he as his most authentic self, really following his values, can help New York, rather than just pandering to try to get in office.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Kenneth Chesebro, a former legal adviser for Donald Trump's 2020 presidential campaign, is now barred from practicing law in New York over his role in a scheme to overturn Trump's election loss five years ago.",
      "In an order Thursday, a state appeals court in New York said Chesebro's criminal conduct, namely conspiring to commit filing false documents in connection with efforts to negate Trump's 2020 defeat in Georgia to Joe Biden, \u201cundercuts the very notion of our constitutional democracy that he, as an attorney, swore an oath to uphold.\u201d",
      "Chesebro was first admitted to practice law in New York in 2007. His disbarment is effective immediately, the order says.",
      "Follow live politics coverage here",
      "Chesebro struck a plea deal with Georgia prosecutors in 2023, when he pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit filing false documents after he was indicted on seven counts.",
      "Trump pleaded not guilty in the case, which included indictments against him, Chesebro and 17 others. The case stalled this year, in large part because of Trump's election win in November and the removal of Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis as prosecutor.",
      "The court, which had initially suspended Chesebro from practicing law in the New York last year, said in Thursday's order that Chesebro's \"cavalier attitude regarding his actions, particularly in the face of his extensive background in the areas of constitutional and election law, largely aggravates his conduct.\"",
      "According to the order, an official tasked with putting together a report on evidence and testimony also disputed an argument from Chesebro's attorney that it was incorrect to characterize his client as the architect of Trump\u2019s plans to overturn the election.",
      "The court said the official noted that \u201cdespite efforts to combat the description that respondent was the \u2018architect\u2019 of Trump\u2019s efforts to overturn the 2020 election, the testimony and documentary evidence produced at the hearing fully support such a claim, inasmuch as respondent\u2019s legal analysis and implementation guidelines fueled the effort.\u201d",
      "An attorney for Chesebro did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday night.",
      "Chesebro is one of many Trump-allied attorneys who were penalized for their involvement in Trump's election interference efforts.",

    "story": [
      "Welcome to the online version of From the Politics Desk, an evening newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team\u2019s latest reporting and analysis from the White House, Capitol Hill and the campaign trail.",
      "In today\u2019s edition, Lawrence Hurley previews a major Supreme Court decision day. Plus, Natasha Korecki explores the 2028 implications of Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker\u2019s decision to seek a third term.",

      "\u2014 Adam Wollner",
      "How JB Pritzker\u2019s decision to run for re-election could impact his 2028 aspirations",
      "From Chicago\u2019s South Side, JB Pritzker, who has emerged as a prominent national voice of resistance to President Donald Trump, announced today he was running \u2014 for a third term as governor of Illinois.",
      "It\u2019s no secret Pritzker has White House ambitions, with his frequent cable news interviews, political investments in national battlegrounds and visits to states likely to be early on a presidential primary calendar.",
      "Appearing on the ballot in November 2026 doesn\u2019t preclude him from running for president. But it does push Pritzker into a potentially precarious position as other Democrats begin dipping their toes into the 2028 waters.",
      "As the sure-to-be-packed field ramps up, Pritzker will be stumping in one of the bluest states in the nation. As he does, he will have to answer if he plans to stick around for all four years of his state job. If he\u2019s re-elected, he\u2019ll have to wait a requisite amount of time before shifting into White House mode. By then, will a newcomer capture the Democratic energy? Will potential opponents get a leg up on out-organizing and defining him?",
      "GOP Gov. Ron DeSantis found himself in this predicament when he first sought re-election in Florida in 2022 before announcing a 2024 bid. By the time DeSantis entered the race, Trump had already established a foothold in the contest.",
      "Of course, Democrats\u2019 dynamic heading into 2028 is markedly different from that of the GOP primary that featured a former president who led one of the biggest movements in modern politics.",
      "But already, former Chicago mayor and ex-White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel \u2014 who hails from Pritzker\u2019s state \u2014 is openly exploring a presidential bid. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., has spent months drawing progressive crowds on the road with Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. Democratic governors like Gavin Newsom and Gretchen Whitmer, who are bound by term limits and will be out of office come early 2027, will be free to begin building organizations and raising money for potential White House bids.",
      "Pritzker would be far from the first politician who held office while running for president. And as a billionaire who has bankrolled his own campaigns, he is uniquely situated to shift into a national posture.",
      "A veteran Illinois political operative and Pritzker ally said running for a national post while holding state office could be an asset.",
      "\u201cI see it completely opposite. You\u2019re better off running with the platform as Illinois governor,\u201d this person said. \u201cThis is his third term, and so he can walk and chew gum. He can do events as Illinois governor. And we know that 50% of JB will make a better governor than anybody else out there. I don\u2019t see it as remotely problematic or complicated at all.\u201d",
      "But as another Democratic strategist put it to us earlier this week: \u201cThe minute JB announces he\u2019s running, JB would have taken himself out of the presidential conversation from June 2025 to November 2026. Do you really want to cede the field for a year and five months?\u201d",
      "Tomorrow is shaping up to be a big day at the Supreme Court",
      "The Supreme Court is set to conclude its nine-month term tomorrow with a flurry of rulings. The court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, has six cases left to decide of those in which it heard oral arguments in the current term.",
      "The one that has attracted the most attention is President Donald Trump\u2019s attempt to end automatic birthright citizenship. The case focuses not on the lawfulness of the proposal itself but whether federal judges had the power to block it nationwide while litigation continues.",
      "What the court says about so-called nationwide injunctions could have wide-ranging impacts, with judges frequently ruling against Trump on his broad use of executive power. The court also has the option of sidestepping a decision on that issue and instead taking up the merits of the plan.",
      "Birthright citizenship is conferred under the Constitution\u2019s 14th Amendment. The long-standing interpretation of the provision as understood by generations of Americans, including legal scholars on the left and right, is that anyone born on U.S. soil is an American citizen with a few minor exceptions, including people who are the children of diplomats.",
      "Along with birthright citizenship, the other five cases the court has to decide concern:",

    "summary": "As attorneys try to free  a 6-year-old boy treated for blood and bone marrow cancer, his mother and sibling, they're challenging the Trump administration\u2019s immigration court arrests.",
    "story": [
      "Attorneys are pleading for the release from immigration detention of a 6-year-old boy treated for cancer of the blood and bone marrow, who is being held in Texas with his mother and sibling.",
      "The boy, his mother and his 9-year-old sibling, originally from Honduras, were seized after the three attended their May 29 immigration hearing in Los Angeles last month. Attorneys say the family could be deported within days because their attempt to secure asylum in the U.S. was cut short.",
      "Their arrests are among many that Immigration and Customs Enforcement has carried out at immigration courts to shuffle more immigrants into a speeded-up removal from the country known as expedited removal. Many are like the mother and her children and were granted legal entry to the U.S. during the Biden administration.",
      "The Trump administration has directed judges to dismiss the cases of immigrants who have been in the country less than two years, so ICE can more quickly remove them from the country.",
      "As attorneys try to free the family from detention and get medical care for the child with cancer, they also are challenging the Trump administration\u2019s growing practice of making arrests at immigration courts. Attorneys believe this is the first case to challenge the administration\u2019s use of this tactic on children.",
      "\u201cA federal district court has already ruled that the ICE courthouse arrest policy announced last month is illegal and unconstitutional and I think applying it to children is particularly abhorrent and unconscionable,\u201d said attorney Elora Mukherjee, who is part of the team representing the family.",
      "Last week, several groups filed a lawsuit challenging the arrest of Oliver Eloy Mata Velasquez, originally from Venezuela, after his immigration court hearing in Buffalo, New York. He also had entered the country legally through the CBP One process.",
      "In this case, the mother had been instructed to bring her children, who are out of school, to the immigration hearing, said Kate Gibson Kumar, an attorney with the Texas Civil Rights Project who is also representing the family.",
      "\u201cThey arrested the family in the hallway as they were leaving ... The children were really scared. They were crying,\u201d Gibson Kumar said.",
      "The family was arrested and then taken to an immigration processing center. Attorneys said that during that time, an agent lifted his shirt as he was changing and one of the children, the 6-year-old boy, saw his gun. He became frightened and urinated on himself and remained in the soaked clothing for hours, said Mukherjee.",
      "There were no clothes the boy's size until the next morning, when the family was about to be put on a plane and flown to Dilley, Texas, a detention facility near San Antonio, she said.",
      "The 6-year-old, identified as N.M.Z in a habeas corpus complaint, was diagnosed in Honduras with acute lymphoblastic leukemia when he was 3 and has been undergone two of the required two-and-a-half years of treatment, according to the court filing. He missed a June 5 medical appointment because he was in detention.",
      "Because it is acute, the cancer can progress rapidly without treatment. It affects the blood cells and immune system. It is considered curable in most children.",
      "However, attorneys said that the detention may be taking a toll on the children's health. Gibson Kumar said the children are really scared, are crying daily and barely eating.",
      "Mukherjee said that when she visited the family earlier this week, the 6-year-old exhibited some conditions that are known symptoms of his cancer.",
      "\"He has easy bruising. ... His right leg had a lot of black-and-blue marks on it, his left leg had black and blue marks on it, he had black-and-blue marks on his arms. He has bone pain occasionally, He has lost his appetite. These are all pretty concerning things,\" Mukherjee said.",
      "In an email, Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said the \"minor child has not undergone chemotherapy in over a year, and has been seen regularly by medical personnel since arriving\" at Dilley.",
      "McLaughlin said that detained individuals are at no time denied emergency care and any implication that ICE would deny a child needed medical care is \"flatly FALSE\" and \"an insult to federal law enforcement officers.\"",
      "\"ICE always prioritizes the health, safety and well-being of all detainees in its care,\" McLaughlin stated.",
      "Illnesses of children held at Dilley in past years, as well as the 2018 death of a toddler after release from Dilley, have raised concerns about previous medical care for children confined there.",
      "The family was paroled into the U.S. on Oct. 26 through the CBP One app. They fled Honduras after being subjected to \"imminent and menacing death threats,\" according to the habeas corpus petition.",
      "Once in the country, the U.S. government determined they were not a flight risk and not a danger to the community. The mother was not put on an electronic monitor. DHS gave them a notice to appear at the May 29 court hearing to pursue their claims for humanitarian relief, Mukherjee said.",
      "Attorneys have appealed the dismissal to the Board of Immigration Appeals, which is part of the Justice Department. McLaughlin said that because the family has \u201cchosen to appeal their case \u2014 which had already been thrown out by an immigration judge\u201d \u2014 the mother and children will remain in ICE custody until the case is resolved.",
      "The attorneys said the family was becoming deeply rooted in their community. The children attended a local public school that focused on the arts and had made friends. The 6-year-old loved playing soccer in the local park. The family attended church every Sunday and they were learning English, they said.",
      "\"This is that family that was literally trying to do everything right and the forced disappearances of so many of our neighbors and community members, especially those who are law-abiding, should shock us all,\" Mukherjee said.",
      "The attorneys are arguing that the administration has illegally placed the mother and children in expedited removal and should at least offer them a chance for bond.",
      "The family should be in what is considered full-removal proceedings, which provides a longer, multistep process leading to a trial opportunity where they could submit evidence supporting their claim and present witnesses, Mukherjee said.",
      "\"As DHS determined when it paroled them into the United States, the family is not a flight risk nor are they a danger to the community,\" the attorneys said in the habeas corpus petition, adding that their detention is unjustified. \"Accordingly, the family is being detained in violation of their constitutional right to Due Process under the Fifth Amendment, and they should be released immediately.\"",
      "On June 21, the government conducted a credible fear interview \u2014 to determine if they fear persecution, harm or death if returned to Honduras \u2014 but Mukherjee said she was not informed of the hearing. Mukherjee said this happened even though ICE was well aware she and others were representing the family.",
      "\"There are extremely, serious concerns about the government illegally subjecting them to a credible fear interview and denying of the opportunity to have counsel on the line, when DHS has been on notice for weeks that I'm representing the family,\" Mukherjee said."

    "story": [
      "Both the House and Senate versions of the budget reconciliation bill include an increase to the child tax credit, but the House\u2019s version gives a larger payout to families.",
      "The child tax credit is a partially refundable tax credit available to taxpayers with children or dependents under age 17. Parents and guardians earning $200,000 a year or less are eligible to claim the full $2,000 credit per child through tax year 2025. Without new legislation, that limit will revert to $1,000 per qualifying child after the expiration of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in 2025.",
      "Congress is trying to increase the maximum credit amount through its budget reconciliation process, but the chambers differ on proposed maximum amounts. The House proposal would increase the maximum credit to $2,500 per child, while the Senate\u2019s version provides up to $2,200 per qualifying dependent.",
      "Under the House\u2019s plan, the $2,500 limit would remain in place until 2028, then drop to an estimated $2,100 and be indexed for inflation in subsequent years, according to the Tax Policy Center. The Senate\u2019s plan would also adjust the maximum credit amount for inflation after 2026. Both proposals keep the maximum refundable portion of the credit at $1,700.",
      "Regardless of the bill\u2019s final maximum credit figure, an estimated 17 million children still wouldn\u2019t qualify for the full benefit, according to an analysis by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.",
      "That\u2019s because the child tax credit isn\u2019t fully refundable. As of 2025, families who who don\u2019t owe income taxes and earn less than $2,500 cannot claim any portion of the child tax credit. Those earning more than $2,500 may qualify for the additional child tax credit \u2014 the refundable portion of the credit worth up to $1,700. Families with incomes over $2,500 can receive up to $1,700 as a refund if the rest of the child tax credit covers their tax liability.",
      "Around 2 million children don\u2019t currently qualify for any of the child tax credit because their families earn less than $2,500, according to the Tax Policy Center. Another 15 million receive some, but not the full credit, because their families make more than $2,500, but not enough that their income taxes exceed the amount that enables them to claim the full credit.",
      "New and continuing restrictions on who can claim the child tax credit",
      "Both the Senate and House proposals for the child tax credit would continue a restriction introduced in 2018 that requires children to have Social Security numbers in order for their families to be able to claim the credit. Around 1 million children lost their eligibility when this rule went into effect in 2018, according to the Tax Policy Center.",

    "story": [
      "Apple Thursday made changes to its App Store European policies, saying it believes the new rules will help the company avoid a fine of 500 million euro ($585 million) from the EU for violating the Digital Markets Act.",
      "The new policies are a complicated system of fees and programs for app makers, with some developers now paying three separate fees for one download. Apple also is going to introduce a new set of rules for all app developers in Europe, which includes a fee called the \u201ccore technology commission\u201d of 5% on all digital purchases made outside the App Store.",
      "The changes Apple announced are not a complete departure from the company\u2019s previous policy that drew the European Commission\u2019s attention in the first place.",
      "Apple said it did not want to make the changes but was forced to by the European Commission\u2019s regulations, which threatened fines of up to 50 million euros per day. Apple said it believed its plan is in compliance with the DMA and that it will avoid fines.",
      "\u201cThe European Commission is requiring Apple to make a series of additional changes to the App Store,\u201d an Apple spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cWe disagree with this outcome and plan to appeal.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for the European Commission did not say that Apple was no longer subject to the fine. He said in a statement that the EC is looking at Apple\u2019s new terms to see if the company is in compliance.",
      "\u201cAs part of this assessment the Commission considers it particularly important to obtain the views of market operators and interested third parties before deciding on next steps,\u201d the spokesperson said in a statement.",
      "The saga in Brussels is the latest example of Apple fiercely defending its App Store policies, a key source of profit for the iPhone maker through fees of between 15% and 30% on downloads through its App Store.",
      "It also shows that Apple is continuing to claim it is owed a commission when iPhone apps link to websites for digital purchases overseas despite a recent court ruling that barred the practice in the U.S.",
      "Steering rules no longer in effect in U.S.",
      "Under the Digital Markets Act, Apple was required to allow app developers more choices for how they distribute and promote their apps. In particular, developers are no longer prohibited from telling their users about cheaper alternatives to Apple\u2019s App Store, a practice called \u201csteering\u201d by regulators.",
      "In early 2024, Apple announced its changes, including a 50 cent fee on off-platform app downloads.",
      "Critics, including Sweden\u2019s Spotify, pushed back on Apple\u2019s proposed changes, saying that the tech firm chose an approach that violated the spirit of the rules, and that its fees and commissions challenge the viability of the alternative billing system. The European Commission investigated for a year, and it said on Thursday that it would again seek feedback from Apple\u2019s critics.",
      "\u201cFrom the beginning, Apple has been clear that they didn\u2019t like the idea of abiding by the DMA,\u201d Spotify said last year.",
      "Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney, whose company successfully changed Apple\u2019s steering rules in the U.S. earlier this year, accused Apple of \u201cmalicious compliance\u201d in its approach to the DMA.",
      "\u201cApple\u2019s new Digital Markets Act malicious compliance scheme is blatantly unlawful in both Europe and the United States and makes a mockery of fair competition in digital markets,\u201d Sweeney posted on social media on Thursday. \u201cApps with competing payments are not only taxed but commercially crippled in the App Store.\u201d",
      "The European Commission announced the 500 million euro fine in April. The commission at the time said that the tech company might still be able to make changes to avoid the fine.",
      "Apple\u2019s restrictions on steering in the United States were tossed earlier this year, following a court order in the long-running Epic Games case. A judge in California found that Apple had purposely misled the court about its steering concessions in the United States and instructed it to immediately stop asking charging a fee or commission on for external downloads.",
      "The order is currently in effect in the United States as it is being appealed and has already shifted the economics of app development. As a result, companies like Amazon and Spotify in the U.S. can direct customers to their own websites and avoid Apple\u2019s 15% to 30% commission.",
      "In the U.S., Amazon\u2019s iPhone Kindle app now shows an orange \u201cGet Book\u201d button that links to Amazon.com.",

      "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell mostly breezed through two hearings on Capitol Hill this week but now heads into a much bigger challenge: a potential threat that President Donald Trump could undermine his authority by soon naming his pick to head the central bank next year.",
      "As Powell testified Wednesday before the Senate Banking Committee, holding generally cordial exchanges with lawmakers, Trump was at the NATO summit in The Hague lobbing his latest attacks on a man he had nominated for the Fed job nearly eight years ago.",
      "\u201cI think he\u2019s terrible,\u201d Trump said when asked during a news conference about his intentions for the next Fed leader. Trump then called Powell a \u201cvery average mentally person,\u201d adding he has \u201ca low IQ for what he does\u201d and is \u201ca very political guy.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think he is a very stupid person, actually,\u201d Trump said.",
      "While Trump\u2019s name-calling of Powell isn\u2019t particularly new, the words now could signal action.",
      "Potential candidates",
      "In the wake of the intense criticism, Wall Street has been buzzing over the potential for a \u201cshadow chair,\u201d or someone Trump could install as a central bank gadfly until Powell\u2019s term expires in May 2026.",
      "The talk has impacted markets: Traders on Thursday accelerated bets on rate cuts this year, with three reductions now at about a 60% odds, compared to a strong likelihood of two just a few days ago, according to CME Group data. Treasury yields tumbled at the shorter end of the curve, which is where the Fed has its influence, falling much more than those at the long end. The dollar also was down sharply against its global counterparts.",
      "Trump confirmed that he has a list of potential Powell successors down to \u201cthree or four people,\u201d without naming the finalists.",
      "The cadre of potential candidates has become familiar: Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett, former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, and as a dark horse in-house pick Christopher Waller, who is a Trump appointee serving as governor and as of late has been an advocate for lower interest rates.",
      "In some circles, Bessent has been considered a front-runner, though sources familiar with Trump\u2019s thinking say that is not necessarily the case. Bessent himself has said he\u2019s not interested in the job, though that could change if Trump would ask him to take it.",
      "A report in The Wall Street Journal Wednesday evening suggested that former World Bank President David Malpass also is in the running. The Journal report indicated that Trump is considering naming the successor sooner than expected in an attempt to influence interest rate policy.",
      "White House officials did not respond to a request for comment beyond Trump\u2019s remarks at the news conference.",
      "An active Fed",
      "There are several issues making Trump\u2019s desire to name a chair now problematic. For one, there are no immediate open positions, though Governor Adriana Kugler\u2019s term ends in January 2026. Powell\u2019s term as governor itself doesn\u2019t expire until 2028, though the chair term runs out next year.",
      "\u201cThis plan probably isn\u2019t constitutional and would politicize the Fed for a few months before stability is restored next May,\u201d Greg Valliere, chief strategist at AGF Perspectives, observed Thursday. \u201cBut the damage to the Fed\u2019s independence would be considerable if Trump becomes a monetary back-seat driver, second-guessing Fed policies this fall.\u201d",
      "The latest Trump-Powell tumult comes during a busy time for the central bank.",
      "Over the past several days, the Fed has taken two significant steps aimed at banking: removing \u201creputational risk\u201d as a criteria for bank exams, a seeming nod to Trump\u2019s complaint over politically motivated de-banking at large institutions, and the relaxing of reserve capital rules for systemically important banks. The latter measure was pushed by Vice Chair for Supervision Michelle Bowman, also a Trump appointee but someone who is thought to be at best an outside hopeful for \u201cshadow chair\u201d finalist.",
      "Nevertheless, Trump\u2019s biggest gripe, namely the Powell-led Federal Open Market Committee\u2019s refusal to lower interest rates, remains a sticking point.",
      "Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee told CNBC in a Thursday interview that the political waves are not a factor in decision-making, nor would be the naming of a shadow chair.",
      "\u201cThat would have no effect on the FOMC itself,\u201d Goolsbee said. \u201cJust look at the minutes and transcripts. You can see, word for word, what the rationale are in making the decisions, and they\u2019re not about elections and they\u2019re not about partisan politics.\u201d",

      "This is a free article for Diddy on Trial newsletter subscribers. Sign up to get exclusive reporting and analysis throughout Sean Combs\u2019 federal trial.",
      "Today, U.S. government prosecutor Christy Slavik delivered closing arguments to the jury. Slavik, who addressed jurors for nearly five hours, painted a scathing portrait of Diddy, casting the defendant as \u201cthe leader of a criminal enterprise\u201d who did \u201cnot take no for an answer\u201d and \u201cused power, violence and fear to get what he wanted.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt was his kingdom,\u201d Slavik said. \u201cEveryone was there to serve him.\u201d",
      "In painstaking detail, Slavik walked the 12-person panel through the federal government\u2019s three charges against Diddy. She asserted that the evidence, when tied together, showed beyond a reasonable doubt that the music mogul was guilty of one count of racketeering conspiracy, two counts of sex trafficking and two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution.",
      "He has pleaded not guilty to the charges.",
      "The center of the government\u2019s case: drug-fueled \u201cfreak offs.\u201d Slavik detailed how Diddy relied on his inner circle to force ex-girlfriends Cassie Ventura and \u201cJane\u201d into participating in marathon sexual encounters with male escorts. She argued that Diddy\u2019s employees carried out an array of crimes to \u201cmake him happy,\u201d including kidnapping, arson and bribery.",
      "\u201cHe was able to get away with it due to his money, power and influence, and that stops now,\u201d Slavik said in closing. \u201cIt is time to hold him accountable. It is time for justice. It is time to find him guilty.\u201d",
      "\ud83d\udd0e The view from inside",
      "We felt nervous energy coursing through the packed courtroom this morning as Diddy\u2019s family members took their seats and Slavik prepared to deliver her closing argument. Diddy, wearing light pants and a white sweater, entered a short time later. He looked at his family and put his hand to his heart. At one point, Diddy\u2019s twin daughters passed a note to defense attorney Teny Geragos. She handed it to Diddy, who smiled.",
      "In the second hour of Slavik\u2019s summation, Diddy started to take on a noticeably more downcast appearance. He sat back in his chair with his head down while Slavik detailed the government\u2019s sex trafficking charges, looking completely dejected \u2014 even defeated. Later, he kept his eyes on the floor when Slavik played the infamous video recording of Diddy kicking and dragging Ventura in a hallway at the InterContinental Hotel in Los Angeles in 2016.",
      "PSA: Every night during Diddy\u2019s trial, NBC\u2019s \u201cDateline\u201d will drop special episodes of the \u201cTrue Crime Weekly\u201d podcast to get you up to speed. \u201cDateline\u201d correspondent Andrea Canning chats with NBC News\u2019 Chloe Melas and special guests \u2014 right in front of the courthouse.

    "story": [
      "Bill Moyers, the former White House press secretary who became one of television\u2019s most honored journalists, masterfully using a visual medium to illuminate a world of ideas, died Thursday at age 91.",
      "Moyers died in a New York City hospital, according to longtime friend Tom Johnson, the former CEO of CNN and an assistant to Moyers during Lyndon B. Johnson\u2019s administration. Moyers\u2019 son William said his father died at Memorial Sloan Kettering in New York after a \u201clong illness.\u201d",
      "Moyers\u2019 career ranged from youthful Baptist minister to deputy director of the Peace Corps, from Johnson\u2019s press secretary to newspaper publisher, senior news analyst for \u201cThe CBS Evening News\u201d and chief correspondent for \u201cCBS Reports.\u201d",
      "But it was for public television that Moyers produced some of TV\u2019s most cerebral and provocative series. In hundreds of hours of PBS programs, he proved at home with subjects ranging from government corruption to modern dance, from drug addiction to media consolidation, from religion to environmental abuse.",
      "In 1988, Moyers produced \u201cThe Secret Government\u201d about the Iran-Contra scandal during the Reagan administration and simultaneously published a book under the same name. Around that time, he galvanized viewers with \u201cJoseph Campbell and the Power of Myth,\u201d a series of six one-hour interviews with the prominent religious scholar. The accompanying book became a best-seller.",
      "His televised chats with poet Robert Bly almost single-handedly launched the 1990s Men\u2019s Movement, and his 1993 series \u201cHealing and the Mind\u201d had a profound impact on the medical community and on medical education.",
      "In a medium that supposedly abhors \u201ctalking heads\u201d \u2014 shots of subject and interviewer talking \u2014 Moyers came to specialize in just that. He once explained why: \u201cThe question is, are the talking heads thinking minds and thinking people? Are they interesting to watch? I think the most fascinating production value is the human face.\u201d",
      "(Softly) speaking truth to power",
      "Demonstrating what someone called \u201ca soft, probing style\u201d in the native Texas accent he never lost, Moyers was a humanist who investigated the world with a calm, reasoned perspective, whatever the subject.",
      "From some quarters, he was blasted as a liberal thanks to his links with Johnson and public television, as well as his no-holds-barred approach to investigative journalism. It was a label he didn\u2019t necessarily deny.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m an old-fashion liberal when it comes to being open and being interested in other people\u2019s ideas,\u201d he said during a 2004 radio interview. But Moyers preferred to term himself a \u201ccitizen journalist\u201d operating independently, outside the establishment.",
      "Public television (and his self-financed production company) gave him free rein to throw \u201cthe conversation of democracy open to all comers,\u201d he said in a 2007 interview with The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cI think my peers in commercial television are talented and devoted journalists,\u201d he said another time, \u201cbut they\u2019ve chosen to work in a corporate mainstream that trims their talent to fit the corporate nature of American life. And you do not get rewarded for telling the hard truths about America in a profit-seeking environment.\u201d",
      "Over the years, Moyers was showered with honors, including more than 30 Emmys, 11 George Foster Peabody awards, three George Polks and, twice, the Alfred I. duPont-Columbia University Gold Baton Award for career excellence in broadcast journalism. In 1995, he was inducted into the Television Hall of Fame.",
      "From sports to sports writing",
      "Born in Hugo, Oklahoma, on June 5, 1934, Billy Don Moyers was the son of a dirt farmer-truck driver who soon moved his family to Marshall, Texas. High school led him into journalism.",
      "\u201cI wanted to play football, but I was too small. But I found that by writing sports in the school newspaper, the players were always waiting around at the newsstand to see what I wrote,\u201d he recalled.",
      "He worked for the Marshall News Messenger at age 16. Deciding that Bill Moyers was a more appropriate byline for a sportswriter, he dropped the \u201cy\u201d from his first name.",
      "He graduated from the University of Texas and earned a master\u2019s in divinity from Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary. He was ordained and preached part time at two churches but later decided his call to the ministry \u201cwas a wrong number.\u201d",
      "His relationship with Johnson began when he was in college; he wrote the then-senator offering to work in his 1954 re-election campaign. Johnson was impressed and hired him for a summer job. He was back in Johnson\u2019s employ as a personal assistant in the early 1960s and for two years, he worked at the Peace Corps, eventually becoming deputy director.",
      "On the day John F. Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas, Moyers was in Austin helping with the presidential trip. He flew back to Washington on Air Force One with newly sworn-in President Johnson, for whom he held various jobs over the ensuing years, including press secretary.",
      "Moyers\u2019 stint as presidential press secretary was marked by efforts to mend the deteriorating relationship between Johnson and the media. But the Vietnam war took its toll and Moyers resigned in December 1966.",
      "Of his departure from the White House, he wrote later, \u201cWe had become a war government, not a reform government, and there was no creative role left for me under those circumstances.\u201d",
      "He conceded that he may have been \u201ctoo zealous in my defense of our policies\u201d and said he regretted criticizing journalists such as Pulitzer Prize-winner Peter Arnett, then a special correspondent with the AP, and CBS\u2019s Morley Safer for their war coverage.",
      "A long run on television",
      "In 1967, Moyers became publisher of Long Island-based Newsday and concentrated on adding news analyses, investigative pieces and lively features. Within three years, the suburban daily had won two Pulitzers. He left the paper in 1970 after the ownership changed. That summer, he traveled 13,000 miles around the country and wrote a best-selling account of his odyssey: \u201cListening to America: A Traveler Rediscovers His Country.\u201d",
      "His next venture was in public television and he won critical acclaim for \u201cBill Moyers Journal,\u201d a series in which interviews ranged from Gunnar Myrdal, the Swedish economist, to poet Maya Angelou. He was chief correspondent of \u201cCBS Reports\u201d from 1976 to 1978, went back to PBS for three years, and then was senior news analyst for CBS from 1981 to 1986.",
      "When CBS cut back on documentaries, he returned to PBS for much less money. \u201cIf you have a skill that you can fold with your tent and go wherever you feel you have to go, you can follow your heart\u2019s desire,\u201d he once said.",
      "Then in 1986, he and his wife, Judith Davidson Moyers, became their own bosses by forming Public Affairs Television, an independent shop that has not only produced programs such as the 10-hour \u201cIn Search of the Constitution,\u201d but also paid for them through its own fundraising efforts.",
      "His projects in the 21st century included \u201cNow,\u201d a weekly PBS public affairs program; a new edition of \u201cBill Moyers Journal\u201d and a podcast covering racism, voting rights and the rise of Donald Trump, among other subjects.",
      "Moyers married Judith Davidson, a college classmate, in 1954, and they raised three children, among them the author Suzanne Moyers and author-TV producer William Cope Moyers. Judith eventually became her husband\u2019s partner, creative collaborator and president of their production company."

      "\"The Buccaneers\" is a romantic romp through 1870s London, told through the lens of a rambunctious group of American girls. Season 1, which premiered in November 2023, introduced viewers to Mabel Elmsworth (Josie Totah), a fun-loving young woman uninterested in conforming to society's \u2014 and her mother's \u2014 ambitions of seeing her married off.",
      "After Mabel's friend Conchita (Alisha Boe) marries English Lord Richard Marable (Josh Dylan), the friends all leave for London and face an immediate culture clash. The difference between the group of Americans and the English nobles they meet is exemplified by their early interactions with Richard's sister, Honoria (Mia Threapleton). But what starts as a resigned tolerance between Mabel and Honoria blooms into a sweet but secret love.",
      "Totah tells TODAY.com that show creator Katherine Jakeways \"wanted to tell a story that felt joyous and still truthful.\"",

      "\"I didn't want to ignore the fact that the time period inhibited them from fully being themselves,\" Totah adds.",

      "\"She looked at me like I was a monster,\" Mabel says.",
      "But Lizzy replies, \"How can love ever be wrong? If that's what gives you butterflies, then you are exactly who you're supposed to be.\"",
      "In the Season 1 finale, Mabel decides not to actually marry Miles, whom she planned to wed in order to stay in England. In a grand declaration, she tells Honoria that while they may never get to be together publicly, \"we can make our own world.\"",
      "The trailer for Season 2, which fittingly features Chappell Roan's queer anthem \"Good Luck Babe,\" previewed what's ahead for Mabel and Honoria's relationship, including surreptitiously holding hands at a ball and plenty of steamy makeout sessions.",
      "In Episode 2 of \u201cThe Buccaneers,\u201d which dropped June 25, Honoria and Mabel start to share a room due to the Marables\u2019 struggling finances.",

      "The goal of depicting Honoria and Mabel's relationship is to ensure queer joy \"was always at the center, while also being very aware of the stakes,\" Totah says.",
      "\"Maybe not so truthful to the time period in the sense that like, we wouldn't be arrested or defamed in the way that we would be then, but to know that it's still taboo and playing with that discomfort,\" Totah says.",
      "In one brief clip from the Season 2 trailer, Honoria and Mabel share a kiss in front of their friends, while Jinny (Imogen Waterhouse) and Conchita react with surprise.",
      "Totah says that scene came from one of her many pitches to the show's writers. (\"We joke because I pitch a lot,\" Totah says with a laugh.)",
      "\"I told the writers on a call they didn't ask for, I was like, I think that she should come out to the girls. And I wanted that to happen, because it felt like she had built all of these close friendships with these people and that they would be accepting of her,\" Totah adds.",
      "She calls the moment a \"natural evolution\" for Mabel.",
      "\"At a certain point, she needs to have that happen just from a story perspective,\" Totah says. \"Otherwise, how far can she grow, hidden?\"",

      "\u201cOK, what about when we get the star?\u201d Carmy poses.",
      "\u201cIf,\u201d Computer retorts.",
      "\u201cIf we get the star, right?\u201d Carmy says. \u201cI\u2019m serious.\u201d",
      "\u201cCarmen, this has never been more serious, OK?\u201d Jimmy says. \u201cNever ever.\u201d",
      "Carmy is convinced his restaurant is going to get a Michelin star and change its fortune, even after the eatery received a decidedly mixed review from the Chicago Tribune last season. He and Sydney have been discussing the star for multiple seasons, both wanting and fearing the lofty goal.",
      "They\u2019re not wrong, though: Stars given by the tire company \u2014 yes, it\u2019s the tire company \u2014 have been known to improve the business of restaurants that have received them. Restaurants \u2014 not chefs, it should be noted \u2014 strive for the highest accolade awarded by Michelin\u2019s anonymous inspectors who place the \u201cbest culinary experiences\u201d in its guide.",
      "And Carmy and Sydney aren\u2019t the only TV characters clamoring for the accolade: Other shows like \u201cLa Grand Maison Tokyo\u201d and \u201cEmily in Paris\u201d have used the Michelin star as a major plot point. So, how does the star system really work?",
      "How are Michelin stars awarded?",
      "First, a bit of history: In 1889, brothers Andre and Edouard Michelin founded the tire company, and since there were only mere hundreds of cars on the roads in France at the time, they had to find a way to drum up business.",
      "So, in 1900, the brothers produced a free little red handbook that helped more motorists take to the roads, plan trips and run their tires down so they would have to buy more of them.",
      "\u201cAt that time, before it became the international benchmark for restaurant and hotel guides, it was a 400-page guidebook containing practical information for travelers,\u201d the anonymous chief inspector for the Michelin Guide North America tells TODAY.com, including restaurants, hotels and sightseeing guides.",
      "Since 1933, anonymous inspectors have been tapped to find the best restaurants in a region. These days, an inspector is required to have 10 years of experience in the hospitality industry, possess a \u201cvery fine palate,\u201d be able to put aside their own taste preferences to judge the food of a restaurant and show proven knowledge of world cuisines.",
      "Michelin wouldn\u2019t reveal how many inspectors it employs but did say that a single inspector eats more than 250 anonymous meals per year and reports every one in detail.",
      "After they trawl fine-dining establishments, city hot spots, quiet bistros, rowdy pubs and street-food stands multiple times over a year, they cast votes with the international director of the Michelin Guides, the local editor and all of the inspectors involved to award stars. The decision has to be unanimous, too.",
      "The inspector notes that one common misconception portrayed in pop culture involves the anonymity of the inspectors: A restaurant is never made aware of a visit. So, Carmy and the crew would never really know if a Michelin inspector stopped by this season, at least until the moment they were awarded one.",
      "\u201cAnother one is that only \u2018fine dining\u2019 restaurants are inspected and/or included in the Guide, when in fact, we only evaluate the food on the plate, not taking into account service, decor, etc.,\u201d the inspector says.",
      "While the whole thing began with one star in 1926, it evolved between 1931 and 1933 to extend to three levels of stars; three stars means the establishment has \u201cexceptional cuisine\u201d that is \u201cworth a special journey.\u201d Only 125 restaurants on the planet currently hold three stars.",
      "The inspector adds that Michelin has guides dedicated to over 60 destinations worldwide, including several cities across the U.S. like Los Angeles, Washington, D.C. and New York City.",
      "How Michelin decides which cities to cover has been controversial, especially among chefs whose cities have been passed over. A 2019 New York Times report revealed that Michelin would send its inspectors to states whose tourism boards had paid a hefty fee. Both California and Colorado have paid Michelin hundreds of thousands of dollars for some of their cities to be included. Atlanta\u2019s tourism board paid Michelin $1 million for a three-year contract, while six Texas tourism boards chipped in for a total of $2.7 million to Michelin for a three-year presence. Boston and Philadelphia are up next, though their tourism boards haven\u2019t disclosed how much they had to pay.",
      "Michelin has said the involvement of what they call \u201cdestination marketing organizations\u201d \u2014 or \u201cDMOs\u201d \u2014 \u201cdoes not have any influence on the Inspectors\u2019 judgments regarding the destination assessment, the restaurants in the selection, or award distinctions,\u201d and that \u201cDMO teams have no access to the Inspectors\u2019 work or the final selection until the list of selected restaurants is revealed by the MICHELIN Guide.\u201d",
      "Luckily for Carmy and Sydney, Chicago has had a dedicated guide since 2011. Whether or not they get any stars remains to be seen, but what is for certain is that real-life Michelin inspectors will be watching.",
      "The inspector says they \u201care always entertained to see themselves represented in media, even though it isn\u2019t an accurate representation.\u201d"

      "It turns out, Sylvester and his boyfriend, whose identity the \"E! News\" host is keeping private, had been together for six months \u2014 and already swapped \"I love you's.\"",

      "\u201cWhen you don\u2019t grow up with a lot of things in life, when you grow up lower middle class, and you don\u2019t have a lot of possessions, and you didn\u2019t grow up with a lot of love in your life \u2014 when you finally get it, sometimes you have to keep it sacred,\u201d he says.",

      "Reflecting on that memorable hard launch, Sylvester says he had no intention of talking about his relationship on the show. In fact, the night before he hosted in February, he warned his boyfriend the topic of relationships may come up during the chat.",
      "\"I said, 'Don't take it personal, but if they ask me, I'm going to say, I'm still single,'\" Sylvester says. \"I was going to lie on national TV to everybody out there.\"",

      "\"This is the problem: She makes you feel so comfortable, you forget that there is a camera and 2 million people watching you because you feel like you're sitting with your best friend,\" he says.",
      "During the chat, Sylvester said his mother would have \"dropped her Folgers\" in reaction to his announcing his relationship on morning television. Jenna quipped mom Laura Bush might have, too.",
      "As for how Sylvester's boyfriend reacted?",
      "\"He was dying laughing,\" he says.",

      "\"I think when you've dated somebody for over nine months, there's a pride that comes with it,\" he adds. \"And I am proud to be in this relationship, and I want him to know that. And I think that was a blessing in disguise from myself that the Holy Spirit just ushered those words out because I do feel that pride being in a relationship with him.\"",
      "At this point, they're \"in deep,\" he says. He already has ideas about how he might share his boyfriend with the world.",
      "\"I think in the next three months, right at that year, I'm going to throw out the back of his head to mark our year anniversary,\" he says. \"Maybe you'll get a foot in 18 months. And then at the two-year mark, maybe I might give you a shoulder.",
      "\"We're going to be piecing this man together for the next six years,\" he adds. \"So come along on this fairy tale.\""

      "\u201cHe deserves much better than this, and so does the State of Israel. Bibi Netanyahu\u2019s trial should be CANCELLED, IMMEDIATELY, or a Pardon given to a Great Hero,\u201d Trump added.",

      "He has also been accused of accepting gifts \u2014 including cigars and champagne \u2014 in exchange for advancing the personal interests of Hollywood producer Arnon Milchan and Australian billionaire James Packer. Prosecutors say these were worth hundreds of thousands of shekels.",

      "The decision was made after Netanyahu and Katz cited new information indicating that Hamas was seizing aid intended for civilians in northern Gaza. The statement did not disclose the information but a video circulating on Wednesday showed dozens of masked men, some armed with rifles but most carrying sticks, riding on aid trucks.",

      "Netanyahu has also faced pressure from within his right-wing coalition, with some hardline members threatening to quit over ceasefire negotiations and the delivery of humanitarian aid.",
      "The war began when Hamas launched a surprise attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, killing nearly 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking 251 others hostage into Gaza.",
      "In response, Israel launched a military campaign that has killed more than 56,000 Palestinians, the majority of them civilians, according to local health authorities in Gaza.",
      "At least 103 Palestinians were killed by Israeli fire over the past 24 hours, local health authorities said, including some shot near an aid distribution point, the latest in a series of such incidents. The Israeli military had no immediate comment.",

      "A Defense Intelligence Agency initial assessment leaked Tuesday found that the U.S. bombing of three Iranian nuclear sites may have set back the country's nuclear program by only several months, a more limited impact than President Donald Trump stated after the strikes.",
      "The precise damage inflicted on Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities and the viability of its broader program have become politically charged issues, with Trump and his deputies denouncing the leak of the DIA report and the news outlets that reported it. Democratic lawmakers have accused the White House of possibly overstating the effect of the strikes.",
      "Ratcliffe said on social media that the CIA\u2019s findings were based on \u201ccredible intelligence\u201d and that they contradicted what he called \u201cillegally sourced public reporting regarding the destruction of key Iranian nuclear facilities.\u201d",

      "Arms control experts and former intelligence officials say Iran could revive its nuclear program even without the three nuclear sites that were targeted if it managed to safeguard a sufficient supply of highly enriched uranium and advanced centrifuges.",
      "Rafael Grossi, head of the United Nations atomic watchdog agency, said Wednesday in Vienna that it was possible Iran still had a stockpile of highly enriched uranium despite a 12-day Israeli air campaign and the U.S. air raids over the weekend. Tehran may have moved the uranium soon after the first bombing raids by Israel, he said.",
      "Before Ratcliffe released his statement, Trump dismissed the DIA assessment as inconclusive and premature and said repeatedly that Iran\u2019s nuclear sites and nuclear program had been \u201cobliterated.\u201d",
      "The DIA labeled its initial assessment as being of \u201clow confidence,\u201d according to three sources with knowledge of the matter.",
      "Intelligence analysts typically present their findings with varying levels of confidence, depending on the quality and credibility of the information available.",
      "The initial DIA assessment was based on findings from Sunday night, about 24 hours after the U.S. bombing raid against three Iranian nuclear facilities, one of the sources said.",
      "A full battle damage assessment is still underway, the report also said, and it will take days to weeks to complete, according to one of the sources.",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth told reporters at the NATO summit in the Netherlands that the DIA assessment was marked as being of \u201clow confidence\" because the evidence of what was bombed \u201cis buried under a mountain, devastated and obliterated.\u201d",
      "NBC News reported Tuesday that the initial assessment found that the strikes had most likely set back Iran\u2019s nuclear program by about three to six months but did not definitively destroy Iran\u2019s nuclear program as Trump has asserted.",
      "Initial intelligence reporting does not indicate that all of Iran\u2019s stockpile of highly enriched uranium has been destroyed or accounted for, and there are still questions about Iran\u2019s advanced centrifuges, which were not found at the nuclear sites bombed by U.S. aircraft, NBC News also reported Tuesday.",
      "The Israeli Atomic Energy Commission said Wednesday that the U.S. bombing had rendered the Fordo underground enrichment site \u201cinoperable.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe assess that the American strikes on Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities, combined with Israeli strikes on other elements of Iran\u2019s military nuclear program, has set back Iran\u2019s ability to develop nuclear weapons by many years,\u201d the commission said in a statement.",

      "Those concerns were echoed by Kenneth Roth, the former executive director of Human Rights Watch, who said that while Israel\u2019s early attacks on Iran had suggested local collaborators,  \u201cthere is deep reason for concern that people will be accused, convicted, and sentenced for helping Israel on the basis of flimsy if any evidence,\u201d given the country\u2019s \u201cnotorious lack of due process.\u201d",
      "The Iranian Embassy in London did not immediately respond to a  request for comment.",
      "Human rights groups have also warned that near-total internet blackouts across Iran can be used as a tool of repression, blocking the population from sharing information with the outside world.",
      "The Iranian Communications Ministry said this was enforced to prevent Israeli cyberattacks, although the government had in the past shut down or reduced internet access in times of civil unrest.",
      "The crackdown could be \u201cused as a pretext to pre-empt any signs of dissent or public protest against Iranian government and military officials for their failure to protect civilians and key infrastructure from being targeted,\u201d according to Burcu Ozcelik, a senior research fellow for Middle East security at the Royal United Services Institute, a London-based think tank.",
      "She added that the \u201cmanhunt\u201d for spies would also \u201clikely deflect attention away from the higher level officials in Iran who may be responsible for Israel\u2019s successful intelligence penetration inside Iran.\u201d",
      "After several senior military leaders and nuclear scientists were killed by Israel, talk of \"regime change\" by Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will likely have fueled paranoia within the Iranian leadership, although the president has since said he doesn't \"want it.\"",

      "The United Nations, which had previously run a network of hundreds of aid distribution points across Gaza but has since been sidelined by Israel, warned that reducing aid distribution to GHF\u2019s four sites would be chaotic, insufficient and dangerous. Since GHF began operations on May 26, scores of Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces while trying to reach its aid distribution sites, according to the local health ministry and witnesses.",
      "The United Nations human rights office said on Tuesday that more than 400 Palestinians are believed to have been killed while trying to collect humanitarian aid in just under a month.",
      "The Israeli military acknowledges involvement in many of these incidents, often saying that soldiers fire warning shots or at individuals who appear to pose a threat or are in unauthorized areas. GHF says the attacks happen outside their distribution sites.",
      "Most of the deadly incidents unfolded as Palestinians traveled to the GHF distribution sites, according to Palestinian health authorities and witnesses. At least one incident unfolded as Palestinians waited to collect food from United Nations convoys, the organization has said.",
      "Zeidan would soon join the dozens killed as they struggled to secure food, underscoring the pitfalls of a new aid system in which tens of thousands of Palestinians must walk long distances \u2014 often through areas controlled by the Israeli military \u2014 to have a chance of getting a fraction of the limited aid being handed out."

      "While China is the world\u2019s top producer of rare earths, it still imports raw materials containing the coveted metals from abroad.",
      "Myanmar accounted for about 57% of China\u2019s total rare earth imports last year, Gracelin Baskaran, director of the Critical Minerals Security Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told CNBC.",
      "According to Chinese Customs data, Myanmar\u2019s rare earth exports to China significantly picked up in 2018 and reached a peak of nearly 42,000 metric tons by 2023.",
      "Baskaran added that the imports from Myanmar are also particularly high in heavy rare earth element contents, which are generally less abundant in the earth\u2019s crust, elevating their value and scarcity.",
      "\u201cMyanmar\u2019s production has significantly strengthened China\u2019s dominant position, effectively giving Beijing a de facto monopoly over the global heavy rare earths supply chain \u2014 and much of the leverage it wields today.\u201d",
      "The country has become a key source of two highly sought-after heavy rare earths, dysprosium and terbium, that play crucial roles in high-tech manufacturing, including in defense and the military, aerospace and renewables sectors.",
      "\u201cThis dynamic has given rise to a supply chain in which extraction is concentrated in Myanmar, while downstream processing and value addition are predominantly carried out in China,\u201d said Baskaran.",
      "Why Myanmar?",
      "Myanmar is home to deposits that tend to have higher heavy rare earth content, David Merriman, research director at Project Blue, told CNBC.",
      "These \u201cionic adsorption clay,\u201d or IAC, deposits are exploited through leaching methods that apply chemical reagents to the clay \u2014 and that comes with high environmental costs.",
      "According to Merriman, the vast majority of the world\u2019s IAC operations were in Southern China in the early to mid-2010s. But, as Beijing began implementing new environmental controls and standards in the rare earths industry, many of these projects began to close down.",
      "\u201cMyanmar, particularly the north of the country, was seen as a key region which had similar geology to many of the IAC deposit areas within China,\u201d Merriman said.",
      "\u201cYou started to see quite a rapid buildout of new IAC-type mines within Myanmar, essentially replacing the domestic Chinese production. There was a lot of Chinese business involvement in the development of these new IAC projects.\u201d",
      "The rare earths extracted by these IAC miners in Myanmar are then shipped to China mostly in the form of \u201crare earth oxides\u201d for further processing and refining, Yue Wang, a senior consultant of rare earths at Wood Mackenzie, told CNBC.",
      "In 2024, a report from Global Witness, a nonprofit focused on environmental and human rights abuses, said that China had effectively outsourced much of its rare earth extraction to Myanmar \u201cat a terrible cost to the environment and local communities.\u201d",
      "China\u2019s rare earth risks",
      "China\u2019s reliance on Myanmar for rare earths has also opened it up to supply chain risks, experts said.",
      "According to Global Witness\u2019s research, most of the heavy rare earths from Myanmar originate from the Northern Kachin State, which borders China. However, following Myanmar\u2019s violent military coup in 2021, the military junta has struggled to maintain control of the territory amid opposition from the public and armed groups.",
      "\u201cMyanmar is a risky jurisdiction to rely on, given the ongoing civil war. In 2024, the Kachin Independence Army (KIA), a group of armed rebels, seized sites responsible for half the world\u2019s heavy rare earths production,\u201d said CSIS\u2019 Baskaran.",
      "Since the seizure, there have been reports of supply disruptions causing spikes in the prices of some heavy rare earths. According to a Reuters report, the KIA was seeking to use the resources as leverage against Beijing.",
      "Chinese customs data shows imports of rare earth oxides from Myanmar fell by over a third in the first five months of the year compared with the same period last year.",
      "\u201cIf Myanmar were to cease all exports of rare earth feed stocks to China, China would struggle to meet its demand for heavy rare earths in the short term,\u201d said Project Blue\u2019s Merriman.",
      "Not surprisingly, Beijing has been looking to diversify its sources of heavy rare earths.",
      "According to Merriman, there are IAC deposits in nearby countries, including Malaysia and Laos, where some projects have been set up with Chinese involvement.",
      "Still, he notes that environmental standards are expected to be higher in those countries, which will present challenges for rare earth miners.",
      "China\u2019s decision to cut back on its own extraction of heavy rare earth elements may serve as a warning to other countries about the costs of developing such projects. A report by Chinese media group Caixin in 2022 documented how former IAC operation sites in Southern China had left behind toxic water and contaminated soil, hurting local farmers\u2019 livelihoods."

    "summary": "A recent scientific study concluded a woman can run one mile in under 4 minutes. In the coming days, Faith Kipyegon will test that theory on the track.",
    "story": [
      "Last winter, a study startled the running world when a team of researchers concluded that, under the right circumstances, Kenyan superstar Faith Kipyegon could break a barrier long thought impossible \u2014 becoming the first woman to run 1 mile in less than four minutes.",
      "In the coming days, under a worldwide spotlight, that theory will be put to the test.",
      "Kipyegon on Thursday will line up in Paris in a Nike-sponsored race called Breaking4, just four laps \u2014 and 1,609 meters, to be exact \u2014 from history.",
      "If there were ever a runner to make such an attempt, it would be the 31-year-old Kipyegon. A three-time Olympic gold medalist in the 1,500 meters, who holds the world record in the 1,500 meters and formerly held the record at 5,000 meters, as well, she has come closer to the four-minute barrier than anyone. In 2023, racing in Monaco, Kipyegon smashed the previous world record for the mile by running 4:07.64.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s really stretching your imagination and acceptance of how women can excel in sport,\u201d said Rodger Kram, an associate professor emeritus at the University of Colorado who co-authored the study published in February in the Royal Society of Open Science.",
      "Yet speed alone won\u2019t make up the 7.64-second difference between her personal best and a barrier-breaking achievement \u2014 a lifetime in a race as short as the mile. The big variable is how exactly Kipyegon will \u201cdraft\u201d off pace-setters around her, thus reducing her aerodynamic drag. How many pacers Nike will use, and what formation they will employ, remains a mystery.",
      "Kipyegon told The Associated Press that \u201cbreaking four will really cement my legacy.\u201d Yet breaking four minutes could lead to a wider effect. Half-marathons and marathons have enjoyed a post-pandemic participation boom, but Kram wonders whether Kipyegon\u2019s example could inspire more women to run middle distances.",
      "\u201cTo see that, one, we actually want to go after a female record, that\u2019s exciting,\u201d said Shalaya Kipp, a former Olympic distance runner and NCAA champion who co-authored the study. \u201cIt\u2019s going to not only draw more females to the sport, but it\u2019s also going to help draw more attention to female physiology and get more research done on females too.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s not the runner in me, but that\u2019s the scientist in me that gets really excited if we have this. Scientists are going to start working with more female athletes, and that is a big gap we have right now,\u201d Kipp added.",
      "As experts in physiology and kinesiology, Kram, Kipp and their study\u2019s co-authors, Edson Soares da Silva and Wouter Hoogkamer, were already fans of running. But their pursuit of whether a female sub-four mile was possible began in earnest in 2023 while watching Kipyegon run her 4:07 world record while using pacers for only half the race.",
      "\u201cIt really stood out to us that this was a very fast race \u2014 a world record, of course \u2014 but she had terrible drafting,\u201d said Kipp, a postdoctoral research fellow at the Mayo Clinic. \u201cWe\u2019re track nerds, and we watched that, and we\u2019re like, \u2018Well, what if? What if?\u2019 And then we were like, \u2018We actually could do that math.\u2019\u201d",
      "The researchers\u2019 sub-four findings were modeled on a scenario in which Kipyegon would draft off a team of all-female pacers, in part for the gender-breaking symbolism it would represent, Kipp said. In that scenario, the study found that if Kipyegon could stay within about 40 inches behind a pacer in front of her, and 40 inches in front of another behind her \u2014 with a new pacing team swapping in halfway through \u2014 it would create an aerodynamic \u201cpocket\u201d in which she would face the least wind resistance.",
      "Under those conditions, Kipyegon could run 3:59.37, the paper concluded \u2014 the exact time run by Roger Bannister in 1954 when he, using pacers for more than 80% of the race, became the first person to ever break the sub-four barrier.",
      "Less remembered is that also in 1954, Diane Leather became the first woman to break the five-minute barrier in the mile. It took more than half a century for the idea of a woman running a sub-four mile to enter the realm of possibility, however, as training, times and technology all improved.",
      "An inflection point arrived in 2016.",
      "That year, Nike became the first shoe company to combine an exceptionally bouncy new foam with rigid \u201cplates\u201d in its shoes and spikes. Studies have determined such \u201csupershoes\u201d require less effort to run at a given pace by absorbing the impact from each foot strike, allowing runners to rebound more quickly. The breakthrough led Nike to design a different moon shot race, dubbed \u201cBreaking2,\u201d in which Kenyan superstar Eliud Kipchoge attempted to become the first person to run a marathon in less than two hours. He came up 25 seconds short during his first try, in 2017. In his second attempt, three years later, Kipchoge ran 1:59.40. The times do not count as an official world record because the carefully tailored attempt did not meet the standards of the sport\u2019s global governing body, but it represented a seismic shift in what was possible all the same.",
      "It was also a sign of things to come.",
      "\u201cWe opened the 2016 floodgates,\u201d Kipp said, \u201cand we saw these times dropping.\u201d",
      "Of the 50 fastest miles run by women all time, 33 have been run since 2016, including 10 of the top 11. The world record of 4:12.56 had stood since 1996 until Sifan Hassan ran 0.23 seconds faster in 2019. Four years later, Kipyegon shattered Hassan\u2019s world record by a stunning 4.69 seconds in Monaco.",
      "In Paris this week, Kipyegon will wear custom-made Nike supershoe spikes as well as a speed suit and custom bra designed to reduce drag. Kipyegon is unique in that her stride appears effortless, as if floating, Kipp said. Yet what matters most, Kram and Kipp said, is whether Kipyegon has improved at staying tucked in behind her pacers.",
      "Nike did not consult with Kram, Kipp or their research team on the technical details of Kipyegon\u2019s attempt. How the sportswear giant will handle the number and gender of the pacers has led to significant intrigue. Stadiums hosting professional meets feature a metal \u201crail\u201d on the inside of the first lane, separating the track from the infield. Because Paris\u2019 Stade Charlety has little rubberized track surface inside of the rail, it\u2019s unlikely it will have the space needed to use the type of \u201cfull arrowhead\u201d formation it employed in its attempt to help Kipchoge break two hours in the marathon. Kram wonders if Nike will employ a \u201chalf arrowhead\u201d or perhaps even the model the researchers studied, with one in front and one behind.",
      "He and Kipp will also be watching for how Kipyegon and her pacers line up at the start; how relaxed she appears while pushing an unprecedented pace; and, nearing the finish, when the pacers will peel away to allow Kipyegon to finish alone.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m going to be watching to make sure that she\u2019s in the pocket, and that the pacers don\u2019t get too excited,\u201d Kram said. \u201cIn the first 200 [meters] you can ruin your chances for the mile. If she goes out and runs 27 [seconds], she\u2019s cooked. She\u2019s got to go out in 29, 29-high.",
      "\u201cIf she comes through 1,200 in three minutes, I think she\u2019s going to get it. Other people are saying, \u2018Oh, that\u2019s when she\u2019s going to die.\u2019 But I believe in our numbers and our calculations.\u201d",
      "Kipchoge and his training partners wore T-shirts featuring \u201cBreaking4\u201d and Kipyegon\u2019s image during training recently.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been an honor for us to support [Kipyegon] as she prepares to achieve the unthinkable and to break down the barriers of human performance,\u201d Kipchoge wrote on Instagram. \u201cFaith is a true inspiration for our world. If there\u2019s one person to do it, it is you. Go for it!\u201d",
      "The race also comes at a significant moment for Nike itself. The company\u2019s roots are in running \u2014 it was founded by a middle-distance runner, Phil Knight, and his collegiate track coach \u2014 and more runners finished distance races in 2024 wearing the brand than any other, according to an industry group survey. In recent years, however, Nike\u2019s shelf space and market share among running shoes has been challenged by newcomers such as Hoka and On. Kipyegon\u2019s sub-four attempt will come on the same day that Nike is scheduled to host a quarterly earnings call.",
      "In the days before Kipyegon\u2019s race, Kram acknowledged having nerves over how the study\u2019s findings would fare in a real-life test. Many of his previous studies had received scant attention from the wider public, he said. February\u2019s sub-four paper, by comparison, had drawn global attention.",
      "\u201cEven if we don\u2019t go below four, how exciting is it just to have this attempt?\u201d Kipp said. \u201cIs it really going to be a failure if she runs, you know, 4:01, 4:02? It\u2019s still going to be a big deal.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s how Eliud Kipchoge\u2019s first sub-two [marathon] attempt was. It wasn\u2019t perfect, but it lowered the standard, and it made us realize if we can get closer, we can do it.\u201d"

      "Costa Rica\u2019s Constitutional Court on Tuesday ordered the government of Rodrigo Chaves to release Asian migrants deported by the Trump administration who have been held in a temporary shelter in the Central American country since February.",
      "In a 4-3 vote, the justices found that the Costa Rican government had violated the migrants\u2019 rights by failing to provide them with \u201ctimely and sufficient information\u201d about their immigration status or give them access to legal counsel. \u201cNor was free contact with the media permitted, nor was there any information from the outset about the possibility of requesting asylum,\u201d the court said in a statement.",
      "The judges gave the government 15 days to release the deported migrants and ordered it to determine their immigration status \u201cindividually\u201d and based on the law.",
      "In February, the Trump administration sent 200 Asian migrants to Costa Rica on two deportation flights, including nearly 100 children. The deportees came from countries such as China, Afghanistan, India, Pakistan, Russia and Uzbekistan. More than 70 were minors.",
      "The agreement between the two countries was reached as Costa Rica feared that President Donald Trump would retaliate if it refused to accept the migrants, according to statements made to the press by the president and the foreign minister.",
      "The deportees were immediately taken to the Temporary Migrant Care Center (CATEM), in the canton of Corredores, 7 miles from the border with Panama. They slept cramped in shared, poorly ventilated bunks in a hot, humid region where temperatures often exceed 90 degrees Fahrenheit.",
      "As of Tuesday, 28 people remained deported, including 13 minors, from Armenia, Russia, Azerbaijan, Afghanistan, Turkey and Iran, Omer Badilla, Costa Rica\u2019s deputy minister of the interior and police, told Noticias Telemundo.",
      "The vast majority of the deportees, 107, were repatriated to their countries of origin. Another 35 left the center on their own, and 30 requested asylum in Costa Rica, Badilla said.",
      "Costa Rican authorities described the Constitutional Court\u2019s ruling as a \u201cserious error\u201d and asserted that the migrants still there \u201cenjoy complete freedom; they can leave and move freely,\u201d according to Badilla.",
      "\u201c(The constitutional ruling) makes no sense. For months, these people have had regular immigration status and complete freedom of movement,\u201d the official said.",
      "\"From our perspective, the Constitutional Court is mistaken and making a serious error. It clearly doesn\u2019t understand the current situation at CATEM,\u201d he added.",
      "The constitutional ruling responds to a habeas corpus petition against the Costa Rican government filed by the country\u2019s former minister of communications, Mauricio Herrera.",
      "In late April, Costa Rica granted humanitarian immigration status to the migrants held at the shelter after a group of human rights lawyers filed a lawsuit against the country before the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child, alleging that the government had violated the rights of 81 migrant minors by detaining them at the shelter without legal counsel or access to education or psychological services.",
      "At the time, Costa Rican authorities announced that the migrants, whose passports were confiscated upon arrival in the country, would receive their documents back and were free to leave the shelter and seek options to leave Costa Rica or seek asylum if they so desired.",
      "In April, Noticias Telemundo visited CATEM and spoke with some of the migrants, including a 36-year-old Russian, German Smirnov, who was deported with his wife and 6-year-old son. Smirnov, originally from St. Petersburg, said he had worked in his country as an electoral official and witnessed how elections were manipulated in Russia. He said he sought out the organization of opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who died in a Siberian prison in 2024, to report fraud in the 2024 elections, but authorities under Vladimir Putin\u2019s regime discovered him.",
      "\"They\u2019ll put me in jail or send me to war\" if he returns to Russia, Smirnov said. \"It\u2019s simple, because my country is at war with a neighboring country.\u201d",

      "In announcing the agreement with the United States, Chaves said  Costa Rica was helping its \u201ceconomically powerful brother to the north\u201d and indicated that it feared punishment if it did not accept the migrants.",
      "\u201cIf they impose a tax on our free trade zones, they\u2019ll screw us,\u201d Chaves said. \u201cI don\u2019t think they\u2019ll do it, thank God. ... Love is repaid with love. ... Two hundred come, we treat them well and they leave,\" he said at a news conference.",
      "Costa Rican Foreign Minister Arnoldo Andr\u00e9 Tinoco also expressed the country\u2019s fear of Trump\u2019s \u201cpressure,\u201d although he denied that it had materialized.",

      "On Wednesday, the Iranian Parliament voted to suspend IAEA cooperation with only one abstention among the 223 lawmakers and none voting against it. Thursday saw the bill's approval by the country's powerful Guardian Council, which includes theologians selected by the supreme leader.",
      "\"Iran\u2019s peaceful nuclear program will continue with greater speed,\" Speaker Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf said later. While Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Esmail Baghaei said the bill \u201cis a clear response to the illegal attacks against our country.\"",
      "It would mean IAEA inspectors \u201cwill not be allowed entry into the country unless the security of nuclear sites and the peaceful nature of Iran\u2019s nuclear activities are guaranteed,\u201d he said.

      "Meanwhile, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian held a call with his Egyptian counterpart, Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi. \u201cIran is ready to cooperate in enhancing regional security and strengthening peace and stability,\u201d Pezeshkian said, according to state media. \u201cWe support the establishment of a region free of nuclear weapons and even weapons of mass destruction.\u201d"

      "The tourist, Juliana Marins, 26, began summiting Mount Rinjani on Saturday. She was joined by a guide and five other foreigners a she made her way up the active 12,224-foot volcano on the Indonesian island of Lombok. Then she fell some 1,968 feet, Indonesian authorities said.",
      "\"No signs of life were found,\" said Mohammad Syafii, head of Indonesia's National Search and Rescue Agency.",
      "Marins' family in Brazil confirmed her death.",
      "The Indonesian rescue team said it found Marins' body beside a crater using a thermal drone after four days of intensive searches complicated by extremely harsh terrain and weather.",
      "The difficult conditions and limited visibility delayed the evacuation process, Syafii said, as the rescue team climbed carrying Marins' body to Sembalun basecamp but would have to wait until Wednesday for transport to a police hospital.",
      "Brazil's Foreign Ministry called her death a tragedy and said that the country's embassy in Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia, had coordinated the rescue with local authorities.",
      "Marins' ordeal has riveted her home country, Brazil, with millions following the dramatic search-and-rescue efforts since news broke of her fall.",
      "Authorities did not say when exactly she died.",
      "Adding to the frenzy in Brazil over her ordeal, Brazil's embassy in Jakarta had accused the Indonesian government of fabricating Marins' rescue and misinforming her family that she had been located and given food and water just hours after her fall.",
      "There was no immediate response from the Indonesian government on that claim.",
      "Indonesia's island of Lombok lies east of Jakarta and neighbors the island of Bali. Mount Rinjani, the country's second-tallest peak, is a popular destination for trekkers.",
      "In an Instagram post, Marins' family thanked the many Brazilians who had prayed for their daughter's safety.",
      "Marins, a dancer who lived in Niteroi, outside Rio de Janeiro, had been traveling across Asia since February, her family said. She had visited the Philippines, Vietnam and Thailand before reaching Indonesia."

    "summary": "Iran has suffered a series of humiliating defeats brought on by the regime\u2019s own diplomatic miscalculations and strategic blunders, former officials say.",
    "story": [
      "Less than two years ago, Iran\u2019s government sounded triumphant.",
      "It was November 2023, just weeks after Hamas\u2019 deadly Oct. 7 attack on Israel, and a senior Iranian general was predicting that the regime and its proxy forces in Gaza and Lebanon were poised to vanquish Israel, the United States and other enemies.",
      "\u201cWe are fighting America, Zionism and all those who are targeting the greatness and honor of the Islamic Revolution of Iran,\u201d Gen. Hossein Salami, commander of the elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, said in a speech in the city of Kazvin.",
      "\u201cWe are on the verge of conquering great heights. ... We are completely overcoming the enemies.\u201d",
      "Now Iran is in its most precarious position since the early 1980s.",
      "Its Hezbollah allies in Lebanon have been devastated, Hamas has been eviscerated in Gaza, Tehran\u2019s nuclear sites have been heavily bombed, and Israel\u2019s military now owns the skies over Iran.",
      "As for Salami, he was killed in an Israeli airstrike this month.",
      "How Iran got here can be traced to a series of miscalculations and strategic blunders, experts and former officials say, a result of decisions made both decades and only months ago.",
      "Tehran\u2019s often obstinate diplomacy, overreliance on regional militants and shoddy security left it vulnerable to adversaries with much more powerful militaries. And at a crucial moment, the regime\u2019s leaders failed to grasp the intentions and capabilities of its arch foes in Jerusalem and Washington, with no foreign partner ready to come to its aid.",
      "\u201cIran was too inflexible when it had to be less stubborn,\u201d said Ali Vaez of the International Crisis Group think tank. \u201cIt never missed an opportunity to miss an opportunity.\u201d",
      "Among its more recent missteps, Iran failed to learn from how other countries managed their relations with President Donald Trump or how the ground had shifted after Israel devastated Iranian-backed Hezbollah militants in Lebanon, Vaez said.",
      "But perhaps Iran\u2019s biggest mistake was counting on those Hezbollah proxies in Lebanon in the first place to serve as a \u201cforward defense\u201d against any possible attack by Israel. That approach worked for years, and it dealt Israel a blow when it sent ground troops into Lebanon.",
      "But everything changed when Hamas launched a surprise attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing 1,200 people, mostly civilians. Iran had armed, trained and financed Hamas, and the group\u2019s onslaught set off a chain of events that has left the regime in Tehran severely weakened and its regional power diminished.",
      "\u201cI think there is a direct line from Oct. 7 to today,\u201d said Jonathan Panikoff, a former senior intelligence official.",
      "While Israel hammered away at Hamas militants in the Palestinian enclave of Gaza after Oct. 7, Iran and its Hezbollah allies prepared for an eventual ground attack from Israel into Lebanon. Instead, Israel took a different tack, targeting Hezbollah\u2019s commanders and its top leader through airstrikes and booby-trapped pagers used by Hezbollah\u2019s members. Israeli forces staged only a small incursion into southern Lebanon.",
      "Alex Plitsas, a former Defense Department official with the Atlantic Council think tank, said, \u201cThe dominoes that fell after Oct. 7th left Iran\u2019s proxy network in shambles, eroded deterrence and reduced its counterstrike capabilities.\u201d",
      "But he said Iran failed to adapt and refused diplomatic overtures from Washington despite its increasingly vulnerable position.",
      "Seth Jones, of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said that after the Iran-Iraq War in the 1980s, Tehran invested heavily in arming and training militias in the region through its Revolutionary Guard Corps, with Hezbollah as the anchor of an \u201caxis of resistance.\u201d",
      "The scheme worked for decades, Jones said, but it neglected the country\u2019s armed forces, which have fallen far behind.",
      "\u201cWhat it means is that your conventional forces don\u2019t get the same level of focus,\u201d Jones said.",
      "During Israel\u2019s air campaign, \u201cthe Iranians were fighting an enemy that\u2019s got fifth-generation F-35 stealth aircraft.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey just don\u2019t have an answer to that,\u201d Jones added.",
      "Iran has also faltered on the diplomatic front.",
      "In talks over its nuclear program, Iran\u2019s leaders stuck to an uncompromising stance mistakenly believing they could buy more time and secure more concessions from Trump, as well as his predecessor, Joe Biden, experts said.",
      "Over four years, Iran dragged its feet and delayed talks with the Biden administration, which had expressed a willingness to revive and revise the 2015 nuclear deal, which Trump had abandoned in 2018, Western officials say.",
      "When Trump returned to the White House, his special envoy, Steve Witkoff, offered Iran a way to continue to enrich uranium for a period of years, while other countries in the region would help it develop a civilian nuclear energy program. The Israeli government and Republican hawks were worried that Trump\u2019s offer was too generous. But Iran appeared to misread Trump, calculating that it could extend the talks over a longer period, experts and Western officials say.",
      "In the end, the billions of dollars and decades of effort Iran devoted to its nuclear program \u201cprovided the nation neither nuclear energy nor deterrence,\u201d Karim Sadjadpour, of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, wrote on social media.",
      "Relying on Russia",
      "Apart from its regional network of proxy forces stretching from Lebanon to Yemen, Iran had long relied on the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad as its only genuine ally. But Sunni rebels ousted Assad in December, and Iranian Revolutionary Guard officers are no longer welcome in Damascus.",
      "Iran also had portrayed its increasing cooperation with Russia as a \u201cstrategic\u201d partnership, with Tehran providing thousands of Shahed drones for its war on Ukraine, as well as technical advice to help Moscow build the unnamed aircraft on Russian territory. In return, Iran acquired some Russian air defense systems, but promised fighter jets and other hardware never materialized.",
      "Over the past two weeks, Israel\u2019s air force destroyed Iran\u2019s radars and Russian anti-aircraft weaponry, with Tehran losing control over its airspace.",
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin made no mention of providing military assistance to Iran when he met Iran\u2019s foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, in Moscow on Monday.",
      "Despite Iran\u2019s hard-line rhetoric about conquering its enemies and its extensive intelligence and security apparatus, Israel has repeatedly carried out sabotage and assassinations of top military officers, nuclear scientists, the leaders of Hezbollah in Lebanon and the leaders of Hamas in Gaza. The operations have humiliated Iran\u2019s regime and shown that the country\u2019s intelligence services are unable to protect top-ranking officers or other key figures.",
      "\u201cIran\u2019s entire investments in its forward defense, missiles program and nuclear capabilities evaporated in the course of 12 months of regional war and 12 days of war on its own territory,\u201d said Vaez, of the International Crisis Group. \u201cJudging by that outcome, there is no question that Iran miscalculated at every turn.\u201d"
