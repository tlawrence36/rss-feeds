      "\u201cIt\u2019s serious, but I\u2019ve started one of the best treatments available (the Nordic protocol), and I\u2019m lucky to be getting absolutely world-class care here in Melbourne,\u201d Szubanski posted.",
      "\u201cI won\u2019t sugar-coat it: it\u2019s rough. But I\u2019m hopeful. I\u2019m being lovingly cared for by friends and family, my medical team is brilliant, and I\u2019ve never felt more held by the people around me,\u201d she added.",

      "It didn\u2019t occur to Ben Wang right away that in taking on \u201cKarate Kid: Legends,\u201d he\u2019d be the franchise\u2019s first Asian American \u201cKid.\u201d",
      "It didn't occur to Ben Wang right away that in taking on \u201c Karate Kid: Legends,\u201d he'd be the franchise's first Asian American \u201cKid.\u201d And that gives him a lot of optimism.",
      "\u201cAt first I didn't even think about that,\u201d Wang told The Associated Press. \u201cThat feels like a very cool and actually privileged position that I get to be in.\"",
      "His casting happened, he said, in \"a world where that's normal enough.\"",
      "\u201cKarate Kid: Legends,\u201d which opens Friday, unites OG Ralph Macchio's Daniel and Jackie Chan's Mr. Han from the 2010 movie to help Wang's Li Fong win a New York City karate competition.",
      "In the original \u201cKarate Kid\u201d movie, which came out more than 40 years ago, Pat Morita was the only main Asian American cast member even though it takes place in California's San Fernando Valley. His beloved Mr. Miyagi helped underdog Daniel wax on and wax off against white karate bullies. That arc has been replicated and flipped in sequels and offshoots ever since. The overall lack of Asian and Asian American representation all these years has been a lingering point of contention for some.",
      "Jeff Yang, author of \u201cThe Golden Screen: The Movies That Made Asian America,\u201d said he knows plenty of Asian Americans who find most of the Miyagi-verse entertaining. At the same time, even the recent Netflix \u201cCobra Kai\u201d series hardly had any young Asian American main characters. That lost opportunity felt like a \u201cloose, nagging tooth,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s always been a situation where the ancient or legendary martial arts master is transferring his skills not just to another generation, but into another community,\u201d Jeff Yang said. \u201cIn a way, that feels like for me as an Asian American, it turns it into a guilty pleasure.\"",
      "The Asians who were there were \u201ceither sidekicks or villains,\" he added.",
      "In Asia, there's a long cinematic history of elite martial artists-turned-actors ranging from icon Bruce Lee to Chan and Jet Li. But in Hollywood, Asian characters who did perform karate or kung-fu often weren't written three-dimensionally. Most of the stars who could shine for acting and on-screen fighting weren't Asian.",
      "\u201cIn a way that\u2019s understandable,\u201d Yang said. \u201cMartial arts is one of the things that was brought to the United States by soldiers who had been stationed in Asia, learned the practice, embraced the lifestyle and the discipline.\u201d",
      "By the 1970s and '80s, karate dojos were becoming popular all over the U.S. in cities and suburbs. So \u201cThe Karate Kid\u201d debuted at just the right time.",
      "Ken Nagayama, a martial arts grand master who runs a school in the Valley, was an instructor at a North Hollywood dojo used for scenes in the original film. He recalls meeting Pat Morita. But, he wasn't thinking about casting. He was impressed by how much interest in karate shot up because of one movie.",
      "\u201cWhen that came out, so many people were interested in taking class, especially younger kids,\u201d said Nagayama, who plans to watch \u201cLegends\u201d with some of his students. He had \u201ca whole mix\u201d of students of all races signing up.",
      "Steven Ho, a stunt coordinator and martial artist who lives in Los Angeles and has appeared multiple times on Conan O'Brien's talk shows, remembers Morita, Macchio and William Zabka watching tournaments he competed in to prepare for the first movie. He was such a fan of Morita that he never thought about how there were no other Asian actors.",
      "\u201cPat Morita, to me, he was the lead,\u201d Ho said. \u201cAlso, if that were the only martial arts film out there, then yeah, it would be odd and I would be disappointed. But you gotta remember the \u201880s and \u201990s we were living in the golden age of Jet Li, Jackie Chan, films that featured ... more authentic martial artists.\"",
      "It's a full-circle moment that Chan is one of the mentors in this new flick. Wang is still in disbelief he got to do combat choreography with the superstar.",
      "\u201cHe's the guy you think he is,\u201d Wang said with a grin. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t turn it off when he\u2019s not on set.\u201d",
      "Ho happily points out that \u201cKarate Kid: Legends\u201d is reinforcing how his 12-year-old twin sons are growing up without negative Asian stereotypes like he did. He\u2019d rather a story have no Asians if the characters are going to be the butt of the joke. That history of stereotyping of Asian men is why he initially declined appearing on O\u2019Brien\u2019s show.",
      "\u201cI thought \u201dOh, he\u2019s a tall guy. I\u2019m a short, Asian guy. They\u2019re just going to goof on me. They\u2019re going to go off on me,' so I said, \u2018You know, I\u2019m gonna be out of town,\u2019\u201d Ho said.",
      "Luckily, the segments, which have earned millions of YouTube views, were crafted so Ho was the straight-man to O\u2019Brien\u2019s buffoonery.",
      "Twins Jonny and Ollie, in fact, are real-life karate kids. The boys, known as the \u201cTwinjas,\" know karate, mixed martial arts and other disciplines. They count Bruce Lee's daughter, Shannon, as a friend. They've appeared on \u201cAmerica's Got Talent,\u201d \u201cObi-Wan Kenobi\" and taught Kevin Hart and Snoop Dogg moves. They love \u201cCobra Kai\u201d for the drama and want to see \u201cLegends\u201d for Chan. They have since been introduced to the movie that started it all.",
      "For Ollie, Miyagi was his favorite character.",
      "\u201cI think that in the first Karate Kids, how the teacher was Asian, I think being a teacher is better than being a student,\u201d he said.",
      "Jonny says not every show or movie in this genre has to have an Asian lead, but when there is one, he takes note.",
      "\u201cI think that there\u2019s definitely a lot of other movies and shows that have Asian leads, like Simu Liu, the first Asian superhero,\u201d Jonny said, referring to Marvel's \u201c Shang-Chi.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s very significant.\"",
      "The Twinjas, who are working on a children's fiction book that's part mystery and part action, are not shy about voicing their own desire for \u201cany opportunities that come our way, we\u2019d love to take, especially for acting and using our martial arts skills,\u201d Ollie said.",
      "Perhaps they'll get some inspiration from seeing Wang in \u201cLegends.\u201d Wang considers it a \"point of pride\u201d if young Asian American children view him as a benchmark so they can see themselves as the hero.",
      "\u201cThe word I keep going back to is it's a privilege,\u201d Wang said. \u201cWhat I love about this series is ... there's this idea anyone can be the \u2018Karate Kid.\u2019\u201d",

      "Gaulden was released from federal prison in March and sent to home confinement after receiving credit for time served, according to his attorney Drew Findling. With home confinement finished last month, the pardon means he won't have to follow the terms of his probation, including drug testing, he said.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Reality TV stars Julie and Todd Chrisley, who were in prison after being convicted on federal charges of bank fraud and tax evasion, were pardoned by President Donald Trump and walked free Wednesday.",
      "The couple is best known for the long-running TV series \u201cChrisley Knows Best,\u201d which followed their family and luxurious lifestyle \u2014 which prosecutors said was boosted by bank fraud and hiding earnings from tax authorities.",
      "The Chrisleys were convicted in 2022 of conspiring to defraud banks in the Atlanta area out of more than $30 million in loans by submitting false documents.",
      "The pardons signed Wednesday are the latest example of Trump, himself a former reality TV star, pardoning high-profile friends, supporters, donors and former staffers.",
      "Here are some things to know about the Chrisleys:",
      "\u201cChrisley Knows Best,\u201d which ran from 2014 to 2023, chronicled the extravagant exploits of the boisterous, tightly knit family of the couple and their five children, from high-end cars to luxury vacations to stunning mansions. It was recorded in the Atlanta area at first and then in Nashville.",
      "In 2019 the show spawned the spinoff \u201cGrowing Up Chrisley,\u201d which featured the couple's children Chase and Savannah living in Los Angeles.",
      "The couple\u2019s 2022 trial started just after E! announced that it was moving forward with a new dating series, \u201cLove Limo,\u201d hosted by Todd Chrisley. It also came soon after USA announced the renwal of \u201cChrisley Knows Best\u201d for a 10th season, while its spinoff was renewed by E! for a fourth season.",
      "The Chrisleys were found guilty in 2022 in Atlanta on the fraud and tax charges. Until this Wednesday they still had years left on their sentences: Julie Chrisley was expected to be released in 2028, and Todd Chrisley in 2032.",
      "At trial prosecutors detailed a laundry list of offenses that started before they became famous.",
      "The Chrisleys and a former business partner submitted false documents to banks to obtain fraudulent loans and then used new loans to pay off the old ones, prosecutors said. The couple was accused of spending lavishly on cars, designer clothes, real estate and travel.",
      "Todd Chrisley filed for bankruptcy, walking away from more than $20 million in unpaid loans, according to prosecutors. Meanwhile Julie Chrisley created false financial documents to rent a home in Los Angeles, they said, but then the couple did not pay rent on it.",
      "Once they were starring in the reality show, they operated a company that collected their income from the series and other ventures and kept the corporate bank accounts in Julie Chrisley\u2019s name to avoid collection of half a million dollars in back taxes that Todd Chrisley owed, prosecutors said.",
      "When the IRS asked for information on the accounts, they transferred ownership to Todd Chrisley\u2019s mother to try to hide his income further, according to authorities.",
      "Prosecutors also accused the couple of not filing or paying taxes for several years",
      "The Chrisleys\u2019 lawyers argued that an IRS officer gave false testimony at trial and that prosecutors lacked evidence to support convictions.",
      "A panel of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld their convictions last year.",
      "Savannah Chrisley has been a staunch Trump supporter and endorsed his candidacy while also speaking about her parents in a speech at the Republican National Convention last summer.",
      "\u201cMy family was persecuted by rogue prosecutors and Fulton County due to our public profile ... and conservative beliefs,\u201d she said at the time.",
      "She has called the case against her parents politically motivated, though they were indicted in 2019 under a Trump-appointed U.S. attorney, Byung J. \u201cBJay\u201d Pak.",
      "In a social media post Wednesday, she praised U.S. Pardon Attorney Ed Martin, the Justice Department lawyer assigned to advise Trump on pardons and commutations.",
      "\u201cYour leadership is already changing countless lives \u2014 including mine,\u201d she said on the social platform X. \u201cThank you for standing boldly for truth, for justice, and for reuniting families like mine.\u201d",
      "Todd Chrisley was released from a minimum security prison camp in Pensacola, Florida, in the evening, according to Shannen Sharpe, a spokesperson for his attorney, and Julie Chrisley left a facility in Lexington, Kentucky, Sharpe said.",
      "As Savannah Chrisley waited to meet her father at his prison, she said the family was planning to do a lot of catching up.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to celebrate anniversaries, birthdays, Christmases, all the things,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause we\u2019re going to make up for the lost time.\u201d",

      "Wes Anderson has always been Wes Anderson, but with \u201cThe Phoenician Scheme\u201d he somehow seems more Wes Anderson than ever before",
      "\u201cThey say you murdered my mother,\u201d the young would-be nun tells the shady tycoon. \u201cI feel the need to address this.\u201d",
      "There\u2019s something about the deadpan delivery and the clear-eyed manner that makes you sit up and take notice of Liesl, and even more of Mia Threapleton, who plays her in \u201cThe Phoenician Scheme.\u201d (And there\u2019s another thing, too obvious to ignore: Boy, does she ever resemble her mom, Kate Winslet.)",
      "A vivid presence despite her dry-as-dust tone, Threapleton makes a splendid Andersonian debut here as half the father-daughter duo, along with Benicio Del Toro, that drives the director's latest creation. Their emerging relationship is what stands out amid the familiar Andersonian details: the picture-book aesthetic. The meticulous production design (down to those fascinating closing credits). The chapter cards. The \u201cwho\u2019s who\u201d of Hollywood cameos. And most of all the intricate \u2014 nay, elaborate; nay, labyrinthine \u2014 plot.",
      "Indeed, Anderson seems to be leaning into some of these characteristics here, giving the impression of becoming even more, well, Wes Anderson than before. He will likely delight his most ardent fans but perhaps lose a few others with the plot, which becomes a bit exhausting to follow as we reach the midpoint of this tale.",
      "But what is the Phoenician scheme, anyway?",
      "It's a sweeping, ambitious, somewhat corrupt dream of one Anatole \u201cZsa-zsa\u201d Korda (Del Toro), one of the richest industrialists in Europe, to exploit a vast region of the world. We begin in 1950, with yet another assassination attempt on Korda\u2019s life \u2014 his sixth plane crash, to be exact, which occurs as he sits smoking a cigar and reading about botany.",
      "Suddenly, in a hugely entertaining pre-credits sequence, Korda\u2019s in the cockpit, ejecting his useless pilot and directing his own rescue, asking ground control whether he should crash into a corn or soybean field. The media mourns his passing \u2014 and then he turns up, one eye mangled, biting into a husk of corn. As usual, reports of his death have been \u2026 you know.",
      "Recovering at his estate, with some truly fabulous, tiled bathroom floors, Korda summons Liesl from the convent where he sent her at age 5. He wants her to be his sole heir \u2014 and avenger, should his plentiful enemies get him.",
      "His plans are contained in a series of shoeboxes. But Liesl isn't very interested in the Korda Land and Sea Phoenician Infrastructure Scheme. What she wants to know is who killed her mother. She also mentions they haven\u2019t seen each other in six years. (\u201cI apologize,\u201d he says.) And she wonders why none of his nine sons, young boys he keeps in a dormitory, will be heirs. But Korda wants her.",
      "They agree to a trial period. We do get the creeping feeling Liesl will never make it back to the convent \u2014 maybe it\u2019s the red lipstick, or the affinity she\u2019s developing for jewels? But we digress.",
      "We should have mentioned by now the tutor and insect expert, Bj\u00f8rn. In his first Anderson film but likely not the last, Michael Cera inhabits this character with just the right mix of commitment and self-awareness. \u201cI could eat a horse,\u201d he muses in a silly quasi-Norwegian accent before lunch, \u201cand easily a pigeon!\u201d",
      "Now it's on the road they go, to secure investments in the scheme. We won\u2019t get into the financial niceties \u2014 we writers have word-length limits, and you readers have patience limits. But the voyage involves \u2014 obviously! \u2014 a long line of characters only Anderson could bring to life.",
      "Among them: the Sacramento consortium, aka Tom Hanks and Bryan Cranston, two American guys who hinge their financial commitment on the outcome of a game of HORSE.",
      "Next it\u2019s to Marseille Bob (Mathieu Amalric), and then to Marty (Jeffrey Wright), leader of the Newark Syndicate (we\u2019re not talking Jersey here, but Upper Eastern Independent Phoenicia), who offers a blood transfusion to Korda because, oh yes, he was shot by terrorists at the previous meeting. (Don't worry, the guy's indestructible.)",
      "Then there\u2019s Cousin Hilda (Scarlett Johansson, continuing the cameo parade), whom Korda seeks to marry to get her participation in the investment.",
      "And then back on the plane, the group is strafed by a fighter jet. Soon, it'll be revealed that one of them is a mole. We won\u2019t tell you who, although it\u2019s hard to tell if anything is really a spoiler here \u2014 like the part when Benedict Cumberbatch appears with a very fake beard as Uncle Nubar, who may be someone\u2019s father or may have killed someone, and engages in a slapstick fight with Korda, complete with vase-smashing.",
      "We also shouldn\u2019t tell you what happens with the big ol\u2019 scheme \u2014 it was all about the journey, anyway. And about Korda and Liesl, who by the end have discovered things about each other but, even more, about themselves.",
      "As for Liesl, at the end, she's clad stylishly in black and white \u2014 but definitely not in a habit. As someone famously said about Maria in \u201cThe Sound of Music,\u201d \u201csomewhere out there is a lady who I think will never be a nun.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe Phoenician Scheme,\u201d a Focus Features release, has been rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association \u201cfor violent content, bloody images, some sexual material, nude images, and smoking throughout.\u201d Running time: 101 minutes. Two and a half stars out of four.",

    "story": [
      "Sally Hawkins plays a foster mother with a secret in the new horror movie \u201cBring Her Back.\u201d",
      "Beware the quirky foster mother who introduces herself as a bit of a weirdo. That\u2019s how Laura (Sally Hawkins) cheerily greets the newly orphaned teenage siblings Andy and Piper in the new horror \u201cBring Her Back,\u201d which opens in theaters Friday.",
      "The comment, more telling than the kids realize at the time, comes after Laura excitedly introduces Piper, who is non-sighted, to her dog. She thinks it\u2019s a good joke to not explain first that the animal is not alive.",
      "The taxidermy is in fact the least weird thing about Laura. Australian filmmakers Michael and Danny Philippou, also behind the teen chiller debut \u201cTalk to Me,\u201d have dreamed up a new nightmare of trauma, grief, resurrection and the deep failures of Australia\u2019s child protective services. That last part is not actually a prominent throughline in the film, but after witnessing what these kids endure in the brisk 99-minute runtime, you too might have some questions about that department\u2019s standard practices.",
      "Many horror movies and stories have utilized non-seeing characters to enhance the suspense. \u201cBring Her Back\u201d strives to make Piper (newcomer Sora Wong) more than a gimmick but a young woman trying to assert her independence \u2014 she refuses to use her cane, which she thinks makes everyone baby her.",
      "Piper\u2019s main protector is her sweet and attentive older brother Andy (Billy Barratt). The film gives the audience a morsel of normality with these two before plunging us into the horror, first with the sudden death of their father, and then with the strange goings on at Laura\u2019s secluded home.",
      "They\u2019re surprised when they arrive to find there\u2019s another child there as well: Olly (Jonah Wren Phillips), who is mute, deeply strange and, when not locked in his room, getting into bloody messes of his own making. If you\u2019re squeamish about gaping wounds and the full surround sound experience of their squishing and oozing, this might not be the movie for you. For those who delight in the crafts behind it all, the makeup and sound work here is truly top notch.",
      "Like many of \u201cBring Her Back\u2019s\u201d genre peers, the occult, nude older men and grainy VHS tapes also co-star in the proceedings. Laura, whose non-seeing daughter drowned recently, is particularly fixated on Piper and equally as dismissive of poor Andy.",
      "While you can probably guess her endgame, the way it comes together is more of the point, and the Philippou twins certainly infuse the film with a fair amount of foreboding before anything truly deranged starts happening. It\u2019s a fun mystery to watch Laura\u2019s strange behavior, which one eventful day includes encouraging Andy to kiss his dead father on the lips (\"it's custom\"), getting the kids drunk and peeing in a measuring cup.",
      "Andy, three months shy of 18, was not originally supposed to accompany his sister to the foster home. But he convinces the social worker to give him a chance until he can apply for legal guardianship. Unfortunately, Laura seems intent on driving him away. He already has lingering trauma from finding his dead father (and other things that will be revealed in time), and now there\u2019s this chipper, tiny woman ready to gaslight him into insanity. Barratt, who won acclaim for his portrayal of a 12-year-old accused of killing his mother\u2019s boyfriend in the British television film \u201cResponsible Child,\u201d is excellent in a difficult role.",
      "Hawkins, meanwhile, gets to be bigger and wilder with Laura, shedding the nurturing mothers of \u201cPaddington\u201d and \u201cWonka\u201d for something defiantly disturbed. She\u2019s also got a few delightfully chilling lines that I won\u2019t spoil. And yet somehow Hawkins is also able to stay clear of campiness and make Laura, unhinged though she may be, the teeniest bit empathetic.",
      "The film doesn\u2019t quite earn the emotional catharsis it seems to be striving for. It\u2019s a little too insane and also underdeveloped, especially Piper\u2019s character, to let the audience in on that level. But if you\u2019ve come for unexpected scares and creativity, \u201cBring Her Back\u201d will not disappoint.",
      "\u201cBring Her Back,\u201d an A24 release in theaters Friday, is rated R by the Motion Picture Association for \u201csome grisly images, language, graphic nudity, strong violent content, underage drinking). Running time: 99 minutes. Two and a half stars out of four.",

      "A former WWE executive who had been fighting sexual abuse allegations in a lawsuit by an ex-employee has agreed to a confidential settlement and will now help the accuser as she continues suing the company and former leader Vince McMahon",
      "A former WWE executive who had been fighting sexual abuse allegations in a lawsuit by an ex-employee has agreed to a confidential settlement and will now help the accuser as she continues suing the company and former leader Vince McMahon, representatives and lawyers said Wednesday.",
      "John Laurinaitis, WWE's former head of talent relations \u2014 who once wrestled under the name Johnny Ace \u2014 will aid Janel Grant in her lawsuit against McMahon and the worldwide wrestling entertainment conglomerate. Representatives for Grant and Laurinaitis lawyer Edward Brennan confirmed the settlement-cooperation deal and said Laurinaitis has \u201cevidence\u201d against McMahon and the company, but wouldn't say what it was.",
      "\u201cHis agreement to a confidential settlement is a pivotal next step toward holding McMahon and WWE accountable and bringing justice to Ms. Grant after years of sexual abuse and trafficking,\u201d representatives for Grant and Laurinaitis said in a joint statement. \"Mr. Laurinaitis looks forward to moving on with his life. We cannot provide any additional details at this time.\u201d",
      "A court document filed Wednesday says Grant and Laurinaitis agreed to a dismissal of the lawsuit's claims against Laurinaitis, but allegations against the WWE and McMahon remain.",
      "McMahon's lawyer, Jessica Rosenberg, issued a statement in response.",
      "\u201cToday\u2019s dismissal of John Laurinaitis as a defendant doesn\u2019t alter the facts of this case in any way. Vince McMahon never mistreated Janel Grant,\" Rosenberg said. \u201cNo matter how many press releases her team issues, the truth remains unchanged.\u201d",
      "Rosenberg added that a lawyer for Laurinaitis previously said the lawsuit's allegations were unfounded.",
      "Representatives for the WWE did not immediately return emails seeking comment Wednesday.",
      "Grant sued the WWE, McMahon and Laurinaitis last year in federal court in Connecticut, where the WWE is based in Stamford. In graphic detail, she alleges McMahon coerced her into sex acts with him, Laurinaitis and others, and she claims both men sexually assaulted her. She says she was made to do humiliating acts during the encounters. The lawsuit also includes photos of sexual texts it says McMahon sent Grant.",
      "McMahon, former CEO and chairman of WWE, has denied Grant\u2019s allegations. He has previously said the lawsuit is \u201creplete with lies, obscene made-up instances that never occurred, and is a vindictive distortion of the truth. I intend to vigorously defend myself against these baseless accusations, and look forward to clearing my name.\u201d His lawyers said in court documents that he had a consensual relationship with Grant and never mistreated her.",
      "Grant first started working for the WWE in 2019 as an entry-level employee in its legal department, a job arranged by McMahon, and later transferred to the talent relations department, where Laurinaitis was her boss.",
      "Grant has said she was eventually pressured into leaving her job with the WWE and signing a $3 million nondisclosure agreement. The lawsuit also seeks to have the agreement declared invalid, saying McMahon breached the deal by giving her $1 million and failing to pay the rest.",
      "Currently pending in the lawsuit are motions by McMahon, the WWE and Laurinaitis to move all the claims to arbitration. They said the lawsuit should not be allowed because Grant agreed to settle any disputes in arbitration as part of her nondisclosure agreement.",
      "McMahon resigned from WWE\u2019s parent company in January 2024 after Grant filed her lawsuit. At the time, McMahon stepped down from his position as executive chair of the board of directors at WWE\u2019s parent company, TKO Group Holdings.",
      "McMahon also resigned as WWE\u2019s CEO in 2022 amid a company investigation into allegations that match those in Grant's lawsuit.",
      "McMahon bought what was then the World Wrestling Federation in 1982 and transformed it from a regional wrestling company into a worldwide phenomenon. Besides running the company with his wife, Linda, who is now the U.S. education secretary, he also performed at WWE events as himself.",

      "Buzz-saw guitars, dense synthesizers and throbbing percussion can sometimes brighten the mood.",
      "That\u2019s the goal of the new album from the American rock band Garbage, \u201cLet All That We Imagine Be the Light.\u201d Due for release Friday, it\u2019s the sound of frontwoman Shirley Manson pushed to the brink by health issues and the fury of our times.",
      "The band\u2019s familiar sonic mix provides a pathway out of the darkness, with heavy riffing and dramatic atmospherics accompanying Manson\u2019s alluring alto.",
      "\u201cThis is a cold cruel world,\u201d she sings on the crunchy \u201cLove to Give.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ve gotta find the love where you can get it.\u201d",
      "The album is Garbage\u2019s eighth and the first since 2021\u2019s \u201cNo Gods No Masters.\u201d The genesis came last August, when Manson aggravated an old hip injury, abruptly ending the band\u2019s world tour.",
      "The other members of the group \u2013 Butch Vig, Duke Erikson and Steve Marker \u2013 retreated to the studio and began work on new music. Manson added lyrics that lament fatalism, ageism and sexism, acknowledge vulnerability and mortality, and seek to embrace joy, love and empowerment.",
      "That\u2019s a lot, which may be why there\u2019s a song titled \u201cSisyphus.\u201d The sonics are formidable, too. A mix that echoes the Shangri-Las,Patti Smith and Evanescence helps to leaven the occasional overripe lyric, such as, \u201cThere is no future that can\u2019t be designed/With imagination and a beautiful mind,\" in the title track.",
      "Most of the material is less New Age-y, and there\u2019s a fascinating desperation in Manson\u2019s positivity. \u201cChinese Fire Horse,\u201d for example, becomes a punky, Gen X, age-defying fist-pumper.",
      "\u201cBut I\u2019ve still got the power in my brain and my body/I\u2019ll take no (expletive) from you,\u201d she sings.",
      "Manson sounds just as defiant singing about a love triangle on \u201cHave We Met (The Void),\u201d or mourning in America on \u201cThere\u2019s No Future in Optimism.\u201d The album peaks on the backside with the back-to-back cuts \u201cGet Out My Face AKA Bad Kitty,\u201d a battle cry in the gender war, and \u201cR U Happy Now,\u201d a ferocious post-election rant.",
      "Then comes the closer, \u201cThe Day That I Met God,\u201d a weird and whimsical benedictory mix of horns, strings, faith, pain management and more. Hope and uplift can sound good loud.",

      "\u201cThe more observant of you will notice Phineas\u2019 shirt has one extra stripe,\u201d says co-creator Jeff \u201cSwampy\u201d Marsh. Dan Povenmire, Marsh's creative partner, adds: \u201cHe hasn\u2019t actually gotten any taller, but we\u2019re giving him the illusion of getting taller.\u201d",
      "Other than a fourth stripe on Phineas\u2019s orange-and-white T-shirt, \u201cPhineas and Ferb\u201d returns with all the characters that Gen Z viewers so adored, including Perry the Platypus, the mad scientist Dr. Doofenshmirtz, the easily excitable older sister Candice and the bully Buford.",
      "\u201cWe were a little worried at first, like are we going to get in the writer' room and just get a lot \u2018No, did that.\u2019 \u2018Did that.\u2019 \u2018Did that,\u2019\u201d says Povenmire. \u201cBut it hasn\u2019t been like that at all. It\u2019s been great, fresh, new stories with these characters that we\u2019re just thrilled with.\u201d",
      "The series restarts with Phineas and Ferb enjoying summer vacation, Doofenshmirtz back to his evil ways \u2014 he updates his social media status to \u201cEvil Again\u201d \u2014 and Candace is once more on her everlasting quest to get her brothers in trouble.",
      "\u201cIsn't it great? It's like old times,\u201d says Doofenshmirtz.",
      "The first two episodes of the 40 ordered air June 5 on Disney Channel and Disney XD, while the first full batch of 10 episodes will premiere on Disney+ starting June 6.",
      "The decision to restart the series was a no-brainer. According to Disney internal streaming data, the show has been streamed some 650 million hours on Disney+ globally to date. According to Nielsen, \u201cPhineas and Ferb\u201d is among the top 10 most-watched animated kids series on streaming platforms despite not offering new episodes in 10 years.",
      "The show \u2014 which had four seasons between 2007 and 2015 \u2014 centers on the titular stepbrothers \u2014 the triangular- headed Phineas and the quiet Ferb \u2014 who stave off boredom by turning their backyard into things like ski resorts, surfing beaches or monster truck rallies.",
      "Unbeknownst to the pair, Perry, their mute pet platypus, is a secret government agent code-named P who regularly dons a hat and trench coat to save the world from Doofenshmirtz, voiced by Povenmire.",
      "The show is pitched to both kids and adults, mixing references to Nietzsche and Girl Scouts. Each episode also includes an original \u2014 often very catchy \u2014 song, written by Povenmire and Marsh. (\u201cSquirrels In My Pants\u201d is a proven winner.)",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s something that the whole family can enjoy together,\u201d says Marsh. \u201cWe made a commitment never to cut anything just because somebody said it was too smart. We just believed kids are smarter than you think.\u201d",
      "The idiosyncratic show had a hard birth, created in 1993 but not airing until 2007. Povenmire and Marsh, both veterans of shows like \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d and \u201cFamily Guy,\u201d hit it off and stuck with their vision.",
      "\u201cWhenever anybody would ask us to pitch them something, we would always dust this off and say, \u2018Well, here\u2019s the show we really want.\u2019 And most of the time people were just like, \u2018I think it\u2019s too complicated,\u2019\u201d says Povenmire.",
      "The creators insisted on using no double entendres, took out mean humor and refused to make the moms and dads idiots. Even the so-called villains \u2014 Candace and Doofenshmirtz \u2014 are good, deep down.",
      "\u201cIf you\u2019re trying to get a laugh, shocking somebody or putting somebody down are the two easiest, cheapest laughs to get,\u201d says Povenmire. \u201cWe\u2019d made this decision to make it nicer than the shows that we had seen on the air at the time.\u201d",
      "The show has been a magnet for celebrity cameos and the upcoming season is no different, with Michael Bubl\u00e9, John Stamos, \u201cTed Lasso\u201d stars Brendan Hunt and Cristo Fern\u00e1ndez, Alan Cumming, Leslie Jones, Anna Faris, Megan Rapinoe, Meghan Trainor and Ruth Negga all making guest spots.",
      "Phineas and Ferb's penchant for building things like a submarine sandwich submarine or a vaporizer machine has over the years had an unintended effect \u2014 inspiring a generation of engineers.",

      "Marsh recalls the first time he realized that he and Povenmire had a hit on their hands. He was with his child at an outdoor skating rink in Santa Monica early in the show's run when a little girl came skating by, singing their song \u201cS\u2019Winter,\u201d a mashup of summer and winter (One lyric goes: \u201cYou can freeze while you get tan\u201d),",

      "Matt Berninger's brooding, droning baritone is difficult to separate from The National's alt-rock brand of upbeat electric-guitar escape from minor-key plunges into the life's depths",
      "Matt Berninger's brooding, droning baritone is difficult to separate from The National.",
      "His second solo album, \u201cGet Sunk,\u201d doesn't diverge much from the alt-rock band he's fronted for more than a quarter-century. And why should it?",
      "The National's sad-dad brand exists in the bittersweet spot between Berninger's complex lyrics and a melodic versatility. And \"Get Sunk\u201d sounds more like an extension of the band's catalog than a self-serving experiment for a restless songwriter.",
      "It works on both levels \u2014 with the album's familiar, upbeat electric guitar-escapes.",
      "But when compared to his band's repertoire, \u201cGet Sunk\u201d runs out of steam. Even with his consistently clever lyrics, a couple of lethargic songs can drag down a 10-track lineup.",
      "The record arrives a few years after a struggle with pandemic-driven depression, as he detailed in an interview with David Letterman. Berninger was hit by a bad case of writer\u2019s block after his first solo record, \u201cSerpentine Prison,\u201d came out in 2020.",
      "The National\u2019s release of two new albums five months apart in 2023, after a four-year hiatus, helped thaw some of Berninger's frozen creativity. His family moved from California to Connecticut that year, too, further aiding his reset; he began reading and painting in the fresh air.",
      "On \u201cGet Sunk,\" the third track, \u201cBonnet of Pins,\u201d brings a hard edge, evoking the band's \u201cThe System Only Dreams in Total Darkness\u201d record from 2017. \u201cGet Sunk\u201d producer Sean O'Brien cranks on the guitar. Drummer Sterling Laws does his best impression of The National stalwart Bryan Devendorf. Julia Laws, whose indie rock band Ronboy has been touring with Berninger, sings backup on this smoky, stressful encounter with an ex-lover.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a cup trick shell game, it\u2019s a puff of smoke/And it gets me every time, it\u2019s a pretty good joke,\u201d Berninger sings. \u201cI know that you miss me, I know that you miss me/This stuff takes a lifetime.\u201d",
      "With the infectious opener \u201cInland Ocean\u201d bursting with a reverbed guitar that pulsates throughout the song, \u201cGet Sunk\u201d gets revved up right away. Even on the downbeat \u201cNowhere Special,\" Berninger is at his songwriting best ambling through a rant about an on-again, off-again relationship: \u201cA bat can haul our recording equipment into the woods/I know we shouldn\u2019t but I feel like we should.\u201d The closer, \u201cTimes of Difficulty,\u201d is tailor-made for a live-show singalong with the chant \u201cGet drunk! Get sunk! Forget! Get wet!\u201d that marks Berninger's search for clarity and creativity.",
      "Much like The National's 2019 album \u201cI Am Easy to Find,\u201d which brought in several women to pair vocals with his gravelly baritone, \u201cGet Sunk\u201d follows suit. Laws sings on eight of the 10 tracks, and Meg Duffy of the band Hand Habits joins Berninger on the sentimental \u201cFrozen Oranges.\"",
      "The sleepiness of \u201cFrozen Oranges\u201d is also the first warning there's just not enough energy to cover a whole album, not quite enough strength for \u201cGet Sunk\u201d to swim on its own. Berninger will be forever intertwined with The National, a connection there's no need to undo.",

      "So seemingly aligned in sensibility and style are Cera and Anderson that you could easily imagine a whole fake filmography. It is, for a slightly more corduroyed corner of the movie world, an actor-director pairing as destined as Scorsese and De Niro \u2014 even if \u201cThe Phoenician Scheme\u201d is (checks notes one last time) their first movie together.",

      "Cera plays Liesl\u2019s Norwegian tutor Bj\u00f8rn Lund. And because of the strong leading performances, you couldn\u2019t quite say Cera steals the show, he\u2019s certainly one of the very best things about \u201cThe Phoenician Scheme\" \u2014 and that's something for a movie that includes Tom Hanks and Bryan Cranston playing a game of HORSE. Bj\u00f8rn is an entomologist, which means Cera spends a sizable portion of the movie in a bow tie with an insect gently poised on his finger.",
      "\u201cHe is sort of a bug, himself,\u201d Cera, speaking in an interview at the Cannes Film Festival shortly before the premiere of \u201cThe Phoenician Scheme,\u201d says with a wry smile. \u201cAnd he sheds his skin and becomes his truth self.\u201d",
      "If Cera\u2019s role in \u201cThe Phoenician Scheme\u201d feels like a long time coming, it is. He and Anderson first met more than 15 years ago. Cera, 36, was then coming off his early breakthroughs in \u201cArrested Development,\u201d \u201cSuperbad\u201d and \u201cJuno.\u201d A comic wunderkind from Ontario who stood out even among the \u201cArrested Development\u201d cast as a teenager, Cera had caught Anderson\u2019s attention.",
      "\u201cIt was something arranged by an agent in New York and we went to a kind of cocktail party,\u201d Anderson recalls by phone. \u201cWe were with Harvey Keitel, too. So it was me and Harvey and Michael Cera \u2014 a totally unexpected combination. But I loved him. For years I\u2019ve kind of felt like: Why haven\u2019t we already done something together?\u201d",
      "For Cera, the meeting was even more memorable.",
      "\u201cI remember being very excited to meet him,\" Cera says. \"I remember him being very disarming. Obviously, he was like a luminary inspiration. He has had a huge impact on my general sense of taste. I discovered his movies when I was a teenager and watched them over and over.\u201d",
      "They nearly did come together on a movie before \u201cThe Phoenician Scheme.\u201d Anderson had a small role for Cera in \u201cAsteroid City,\u201d but when its production schedule got pushed, Cera had to drop out because of the coming due date for his first son with his wife Nadine.",
      "\u201cI was kind of worried that I blew it,\" says Cera, \u201cthat I missed the chance to sneak in.\u201d",
      "But even though Anderson and Cera didn\u2019t work together until \u201cThe Phoenician Scheme,\u201d they developed a relationship. Cera, who aspires to write and direct his own films, would send Anderson scripts for feedback. \u201cWe became friends,\u201d says Cera.",
      "\u201cIn the case of this movie, it was everything short of written for him,\u201d Anderson says. \u201cAs soon as we had the idea of the character, he was the guy who (cowriter Roman Coppola) and I started talking about. I think we talked to him about it before there was a script or anything.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt seemed like it had already happened,\u201d adds Anderson. \u201cAnd it was a very good fit, a natural thing.\u201d",
      "Cera quickly adapted to Anderson\u2019s unique style of moviemaking, in which the cast collectively stay at a hotel, begin the morning in makeup together and remain on set without trailers to retreat to. \u201cAt first, you\u2019re kind of exhausted,\u201d says Cera. \u201cAt the end of the first day, you go: OK, I need to eat a bigger breakfast.\u201d As the production went along, Cera often sat right next to Anderson to watch him work.",
      "One very notable characteristic of Bj\u00f8rn is a Norwegian accent. If there\u2019s anything more fitting than Michael Cera being a Wes Anderson movie, it might be Michael Cera doing a Norwegian accent in a Wes Anderson movie. It\u2019s also a bit that, in \u201cThe Phoenician Scheme,\u201d has a touch of spoiler to it. Cera calls it \u201csort of a jaunty, playful representation of an accent, not purporting to be a home run.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen I brought up the accent to Wes, I said, \u2018How should we go about this accent?\u2019\u201d Cera say. \u201cHe was kind of caught of guard. I think he hears the movie in his head and maybe hadn\u2019t figured that in. It was something Wes had to compute.\u201d",
      "As Anderson describes it, Cera was determined. \u201cI, at a certain point, was a little reluctant, like, I don\u2019t know if we need it,\u201d says Anderson. \u201cHe was like: \u2018No, let me show you what I\u2019m going to do.\u2019\u201d",
      "A determination in absurdism has long marked Cera's best performances. Though a private person who has resisted all urges to get a smartphone, Cera is remarkably fearless when it comes to the most awkward moments. It\u2019s a seriousness of purpose that, whether singing \u201cThese Eyes\u201d in \u201cSuperbad\u201d or waving hello as Allen in \u201cBarbie,\u201d that's made Cera a favorite of successive generations. Even in a billion-dollar blockbuster, Cera can be unassumingly hilarious.",
      "\u201cI feel like most people don\u2019t know I\u2019m in that movie. I mean, not a in a bad way. It was great for my personal disposition to get to be part of it,\u201d Cera says. \u201cI can say I\u2019m in it, but I can walk around. I\u2019m nowhere near the center of the movie. I\u2019m not on the poster, put it that way. (Laughs) My nephew went and saw the movie with my sister. Afterwards he was like, \u2018I thought Uncle Michael was going to be in this movie.\u2019 It was a nice lane for me.\u201d",
      "Just before the premiere of \u201cThe Phoenician Scheme\u201d in Cannes, it was announced that Cera, after writing a handful of scripts including an adaptation of Charles Portis\u2019 \u201cMasters of Atlantis,\u201d will make his directorial debut with \u201cLove Is Not the Answer,\u201d a film he wrote that has a cast including Pamela Anderson and Steve Coogan.",
      "\u201cYou have a little more control over your destiny if you try to create something, even though it\u2019s hard to get it off the ground,\u201d Cera says. \u201cBut it\u2019s better than sitting around. You\u2019re like a hired contractor as an actor, and it\u2019s a great thing about it. But I think a lot of actors end up becoming frustrated directors because of how many opinions you have about the proceedings.\u201d",
      "It may have taken many years for Cera and Anderson to finally team up, but it could have come at the right time, just as Cera is \u2014 ahem \u2014 shedding a skin. In any case, theirs remains an ongoing collaboration. Anderson tapped Cera for an ad they recently shot for Mont Blanc. Does that mean he's officially part of the troupe?",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s up to him,\" says Cera. \u201cI would never say no.\u201d",

      "Dolly Parton says her faith has carried her through her fluctuating grief following the death of her husband, Carl Dean",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Dolly Parton\u2019s angelic voice floated throughout her first gospel album in 1971 with songs like \u201cI Believe,\u201d \u201cLord Hold My Hand\u201d and the album\u2019s title track, \u201cGolden Streets of Glory.\u201d The entertainment icon says the same steadfast faith that inspired those hymns have anchored her throughout her grief following the death her husband, Carl Dean.",
      "\u201cI am a person of faith, and I truly believe that I\u2019m going to see him again someday. And I see him every day in my memories and in my heart, and in all the things that we used to do and all the things that we\u2019ve built together,\u201d said Parton. \u201cYou just kind of have to learn to kind of make new plans \u2014 but that\u2019s the hardest part.\u201d",
      "The Rock & Roll Hall of Fame honoree reflected on her marriage of nearly 60 years while promoting her new single-serve Southern-inspired frozen meals, following her popular Duncan Hines baking mixes via a collaboration with US-based Conagra Brands. Dean, who avoided the spotlight and inspired her timeless hit \u201cJolene,\u201d as well as her 2023 \u201cRockstar\u201d album, died in March at 82.",
      "\u201cI really feel his presence,\u201d said the 10-time Grammy winner. \u201cI just try to go on, because I know I have to. And he was ill for quite a while, and part of me was at peace that he was at peace and not suffering anymore. But that still doesn\u2019t make up for the loss and the loneliness of it.\u201d",
      "The 79-year-old recording artist spoke with The Associated Press about her perspective on life without her husband, her entrepreneurial spirit and on why she\u2019s never embraced the title \u201csuperstar.\u201d The conversation has been edited for brevity and clarity.",
      "PARTON: No, I just think that I\u2019ve always had dreams and I\u2019m always working. My husband understood that. Carl knew that better than anybody and he was all about it. He was very proud of me. \u2026 So when I did lose him, I just thought, well, I\u2019m going to take all of that energy, and I'm just going to put that back into other things, and I\u2019ll keep him ever-present in everything that I do.",
      "PARTON: I just think that if you\u2019re successful, if you are lucky enough to see your dreams come true, you need to make new dreams out of your other dreams. Because it\u2019s like a tree with lots of limbs and leaves, so every dream, you can kind of branch off \u2014 if you\u2019ll pardon the expression \u2014 and do other things. And I like the business end of things. I like seeing things happen, and I love making things happen. So, my mind just naturally works that way.",
      "PARTON: I have a new book coming out ... this one is called \u2018Star of the Show,\u2019 which is actually a song I wrote years ago. But it\u2019s about my life on the road and my life on stage \u2014 all the behind the scenes and all the people that I\u2019ve met, and all of the things that happen when you\u2019re traveling like that as I have for all of these years. So, that, and then I have my life story as a musical. It\u2019s called \u2018Dolly: An Original Musical.\u2019 And I\u2019ve written a lot of original songs for it. Of course, it\u2019ll have the big hits that are woven into the story. And it\u2019s just about my life, from the time I was little until up through now.",
      "It\u2019s going to be at the Fisher Center of Performing Arts at Belmont University (in Nashville). Then, once that has its run through the end of August, then we take it to New York to open on Broadway next year.",
      "PARTON: One of the things they did for the 40th anniversary was put a big sign up on the hill there above Dollywood that says \u201cDollywood\u201d like the Hollywood sign. \u2026 Years ago, when I thought, \u2018Well, someday I\u2019m going to have my own theme park and I\u2019m gonna change that H to a D and have Dollywood.' So, they finally, after 40 years, put that sign up, even though I\u2019ve talked about it for years. So, we\u2019ve got a lot of wonderful things planned for the whole season that\u2019s celebrating the 40th anniversary. It seems just like a few years back, but it\u2019s like everything else: I was with Carl for 60 years, and Dollywood\u2019s 40 years old. And that\u2019s just hard to believe because I\u2019m only 27. (laughs)",
      "PARTON: I don\u2019t think about my life in terms of \u2018superstar.\u2019 I\u2019m just a workin\u2019 girl. I always say \u2014 and it\u2019s the truth \u2014 that I am a workhorse that looks like a show horse. But I gotta keep it all up and I enjoy all of it. \u2026 My husband always said, \u2018If anybody was ever born to be a star, it\u2019s you.\u2019 Because he sees me loving to do all the things and playing and stuff \u2014 it\u2019s play time for me. But I take it very serious.",

      "Mr. Miyagi was known for waxing poetic",
      "Mr. Miyagi was known for waxing poetic. So the fact that \u201cKarate Kid: Legends\u201d has nothing to say is all the more disappointing.",
      "One of the most interesting aspects of the original \u201cThe Karate Kid\u201d and its early sequels is Mr. Miyagi\u2019s radical proclivity for mercy, often mistaken for cowardice by those around him. He doesn\u2019t just teach Daniel (Ralph Macchio) how to fight. He teaches him a subversive way of living, and, in doing so, becomes a kind of father figure to the fatherless boy.",
      "As is often the case, it seems the spirit of the franchise was lost somewhere in the creation of an entire universe \u2014 including six films and six seasons of \u201cCobra Kai.\u201d Although \u201cKarate Kid: Legends\u201d does eventually allude to this philosophy of compassion, it lacks both the heart and grit of those earlier films. It\u2019s neither entertaining, nor thought-provoking, which makes one wonder whether this was solely a means of capitalizing on the renewed audience the franchise boasts thanks to \u201cCobra Kai.\u201d",
      "In some ways, the film follows the playbook of its predecessors. Li Fong (Ben Wang) moves to New York from Beijing with his mother and deals with the clashing of cultures and the struggles of being an outsider. And while Li does eventually, like in previous films, fight the jealous ex-boyfriend of his new romantic interest, their rivalry is hardly the focal point of the story.",
      "Instead, Li\u2019s main struggle is internal, as he deals with the grief of witnessing his brother get fatally stabbed by a disgruntled opponent after a kung fu match back home. But even that internal struggle is buried under other subplots and is hardly dealt with in the end.",
      "You might be wondering how Macchio and Jackie Chan fit into this story. They are, after all, on the movie poster. But neither is meaningfully in the film until about an hour into it, when they decide they need to help Li prepare for his karate match. Chan starred as a kung fu master in the 2010 remake, and the impressively choreographed fight scenes in this movie are more akin to his previous film \u2014 the convergence between Macchio's karate and Chan's kung fu is never really fleshed out.",
      "\u201cKarate Kid: Legends\u201d is the first project in the franchise to connect Chan and Macchio, and does so in a way that feels forced. Once Chan and Macchio are finally on screen, there are a few endearing moments between the pair. But not enough to save the film. The attempt to tell a different story, while laudable, turns the film into a convoluted one, with no real character development or stakes.",
      "Part of the problem is that the movie takes itself so seriously, making some of the irreverent humor of \u201cCobra Kai\u201d unattainable. (One of the best moments of the film is William Zabka\u2019s cameo as Johnny Lawrence in a light-hearted coda.) For the most part, the film struggles tonally, thanks in part to the upbeat music set against a backdrop of violence and trauma.",
      "That\u2019s not to say the previous films haven\u2019t always suffered from trying to do too many things. But there were moments of poignancy in the earlier movies that are absent in this latest installment of the franchise.",
      "Despite its sprawling universe, there's no need to have kept up with it to understand most of what's going on. But rewatching the first wouldn't hurt, even if it will make you nostalgic for what's missing in \u201cKarate Kid: Legends.\u201d",
      "\u201cKarate Kid: Legends,\u201d a Sony Pictures release, is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association for martial arts violence and some language. Running time: 94 minutes. One and a half stars out of four.",

      "\u201cMusic will return to the beaches,\u201d said Julio Trindade, who works as a DJ in the kiosks and campaigned against the measure. \u201c Rio\u2019s beaches are known worldwide and they deserve a soundtrack.\u201d",

      "Iran has summoned France\u2019s representative in protest after the French foreign minister praised a prize-winning Iranian film as \u201ca gesture of resistance against the Iranian regime\u2019s oppression.\u201d",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Iran has summoned France's representative in protest after the French foreign minister praised a prize-winning Iranian film as \u201ca gesture of resistance against the Iranian regime's oppression.\u201d",
      "Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot had praised \u201cIt Was Just an Accident\u201d after it won the prestigious Palme d\u2019Or award at the Cannes Film Festival. The Iranian film centers on a man who abducts his suspected captor after being tortured in prison.",
      "Iran\u2019s Foreign Ministry said the French charge d\u2019affaires was summoned over the minister\u2019s \u201cinterventionist, irresponsible and instigative allegations,\u201d the state-run IRNA news agency reported.",
      "\u201cSpare us Iranians the lectures. You have no moral authority whatsoever,\u201d Iran\u2019s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said on \u201cX,\u201d citing France's approach to Israel's ongoing war in Gaza. France last week threatened \u201cconcrete action\u201d against Israel if the country didn't halt the offensive in Gaza and lift restrictions on humanitarian aid, but the statement was mostly dismissed as empty threats.",
      "Immediately following the award's announcement, the Iranian state news agency had announced a more muted celebration of the award, crediting the country\u2019s film industry for winning a second Palme d\u2019Or after Abbas Kiarostami\u2019s 1997 drama, \u201cTaste of Cherry.\"",
      "In Iran, film productions need to receive script approval from the government to shoot in public. Dissident filmmaker Jafar Panahi refuses to do that, knowing they won\u2019t allow him to make the films he wants to, and \u201cIt Was Just an Accident\u201d was filmed without cooperation. Iranian state TV called the film a mixture of \u201clie and smearing\u201d as well as an \u201cunderground\u201d film produced without required permits in Iran. State TV also chastised Panahi for not mentioning the plight of the Palestinians in his acceptance speech.",
      "The film follows a man named Vahid, played by Vahid Mobasser, who believes he sees his former captor, who tortured him in prison and ruined his life. He abducts him, takes him to the desert and begins to bury him in the ground.",
      "But to satisfy pangs of doubt, Vahid decides to confirm his suspicion by bringing the man, locked in his van, to other former prisoners for identification. In a strange and emotional journey, they are all forced to grapple with revenge and forgiveness. Panahi drew on the experiences from his own imprisonment as well as the stories of detainees around him.",
      "Other state media were more critical of the win. The Mizan news agency, an arm of the country\u2019s judiciary, reported on the win as part of the \u201cPolitical Cannes Film Festival,\u201d suggesting that the prize was given to Panahi because of his political leanings.",
      "Pro-reform media outlets and activists praised Panahi. \u201cThis victory is no accident \u2014 it is the result of a tireless dedication to exploring humanistic values and human rights,\u201d said Nobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi, who was also previously imprisoned at Tehran\u2019s notorious Evin Prison. Inmates at the prison include those with Western ties and political prisoners.",
      "Panahi, one of the leading international directors, was banned from traveling out of Iran in 2009 for attending the funeral of a student killed in anti-government protests, a judgment later extended to two decades. But even when placed under house arrest, Panahi kept making movies, many of which are among the most lauded of the century. He made 2011\u2019s \u201cThis Is Not a Film\u201d on an iPhone in his living room. \u201cTaxi\u201d (2015) was clandestinely shot almost entirely within a car.",
      "Panahi was arrested in 2022 when he went to the Tehran prosecutor\u2019s office to inquire about the arrests of two other Iranian filmmakers. A judge later ruled that he must serve six years for an earlier sentence on charges of propagandizing against the government from 2011 that had never been enforced. In early 2023, Panahi went on a hunger strike and was released from Evin Prison.",
      "Panahi said he would not seek asylum in another country, despite the risks of additional imprisonment.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s simple. I\u2019m unable to live here,\u201d he said last week from the Cannes festival. \u201cI have no ability to adapt to a new country, a new culture. Some people have this ability, this strength. I don\u2019t.\u201d",
      "On Monday, Panahi landed in Tehran to cheers and applause from fans.",

      "King Charles III arrives in Ottawa on Monday to underscore Canada\u2019s sovereignty to U.S. President Donald Trump",
      "OTTAWA, Ontario -- King Charles III arrives in Ottawa this week to underscore Canada's sovereignty to U.S. President Donald Trump.",
      "Trump\u2019s repeated suggestion that the U.S. annex its northern neighbor prompted Prime Minister Mark Carney to invite Charles to give the speech from the throne that will outline his government's agenda for the new Parliament. The king is the head of state in Canada, which is a member of the British Commonwealth of former colonies.",
      "\u201cHis Majesty King Charles III will read the speech from the throne and thus present the plan of our government, our priorities, as Canada is facing a pivotal moment in its history, the biggest transformation of the global trading system since the fall of the Berlin Wall,\" Carney told his caucus Sunday.",
      "Carney said \u201cCanada has a steadfast defender in the sovereign\" when he announced the visit earlier this month.",
      "It is rare for the monarch to deliver what\u2019s called the speech from the throne in Canada. Charles\u2019 mother, Queen Elizabeth II, did it twice in her 70-year reign. The last time was in 1977.",
      "Canadians are largely indifferent to the monarchy, but Carney has been eager to show the differences between Canada and the U.S. and he said that the king\u2019s visit clearly underscores the sovereignty of Canada.",
      "The Americans had a revolution to gain independence from Britain. Canada remained a colony until 1867 and continued thereafter as a constitutional monarchy with a British-style parliamentary system.",
      "\u201cWe are different and the king illustrates that,\u201d former Quebec Premier Jean Charest said. \u201cIf you look at why King Charles is reading the speech from the throne than you have to then acknowledge Canada\u2019s story.\u201d",
      "But new U.S. Ambassador to Canada Pete Hoekstra said sending messages isn\u2019t necessary and Canadians should move on from the 51st state talk, telling the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation that if there\u2019s a message to be sent there\u2019s easier ways to do that like calling him or calling the president.",
      "Royal historian Carolyn Harris expects Trump to notice the visit because the president has repeatedly spoken about his admiration for the royal family.",
      "Harris said Trump might see how different Canada is from the U.S.",
      "\u201cIt is a very distinctive history that goes back to the waves of loyalists who settled here after the American revolution,\u201d Harris said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re going to seeing the king in a Canadian context, escorted by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, surrounded by Canadian symbolism. This is very much King Charles III in his role as King of Canada.\u201d",
      "The speech, which will be delivered Tuesday, is not written by the king or his advisers in the U.K., as the king serves as a nonpartisan head of state. The king will read what is put before him by Canada\u2019s government.",
      "\u201cCharles can only act with the consent and with the advice of his prime minister. But at the same time he cannot act in a way that would throw any of the other 14 Commonwealth realms under the bus. So it is finest tightrope to walk,\" said Justin Vovk, a Canadian royal historian.",
      "Canadians were not happy when U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer extended a state visit invitation to Trump on behalf of the king during a time when Trump threatened Canada's sovereignty.",
      "\u201cTo be frank,\u201d Carney told Britain's Sky News. \u201cThey weren\u2019t impressed by that gesture, quite simply, given the circumstance. It was a time when we were quite clear ... about the issues around sovereignty.\"",
      "The king has more recently been showing support for Canada, including displaying Canadian military medals on his chest during a visit to a British aircraft carrier.",
      "After he arrives on Monday he will drop the ceremonial first puck or ball during a street hockey game. He will also attend a community event and meet with Carney and Canada's governor general, his representative as head of state. The king will return to the U.K. after Tuesday's speech and a visit to Canada's National War Memorial.",

      "Iranian dissident filmmaker Jafar Panahi won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival on Saturday for his revenge thriller \u201cIt Was Just an Accident,\" handing the festival's top prize to a director who had been banned from leaving Iran for more than 15 years.",
      "Cate Blanchett presented the award to Panahi, who three years ago was imprisoned in Iran before going on a hunger strike. For a decade and a half, he has made films clandestinely in his native country, including one film (\"This Is Not a Film\") made in his living room, and another (\"Taxi\") set in a car.",
      "The crowd rose in a thunderous standing ovation for the filmmaker, who immediately threw up his arms and leaned back in his seat in disbelief before applauding his collaborators and the audience around him. On stage, Panahi was cheered by Cannes jury president Juliette Binoche, who in 2010 in Cannes held up Panahi's name to honor the director when he was under house arrest.",
      "On stage, Panahi said what mattered most was freedom in his country.",
      "\u201cLet us join forces,\u201d said Panahi. \u201cNo one should dare tell us what kind of clothes we should wear, what we should do or what we should not do. The cinema is a society. Nobody is entitled to tell what we should or refrain from doing.\u201d",
      "The win for \u201cIt Was Just an Accident\u201d extended an unprecedented streak: The indie distributor Neon has now backed the last six Palme d'Or winners. The latest triumph for Neon, which acquired \u201cIt Was Just an Accident\u201d for North American distribution after its premiere in Cannes, follows its Palmes for \u201cParasite,\u201d \u201cTitane,\u201d \u201cTriangle of Sadness,\u201d \u201cAnatomy of a Fall\u201d and \u201cAnora.\u201d",
      "All those films were Oscar contenders and two, \u201cParasite\u201d and \u201cAnora,\u201d won best picture.",
      "Last year, filmmaker Mohammad Rasoulof fled Iran to attend the premiere of his film in Cannes and resettle in Germany. Panahi, though, has said that unlike his friend Rasoulof, life in exile isn't for him. He planned to fly home to Tehran on Sunday.",
      "\u201cIt Was Just an Accident\u201d was inspired by Panahi's experience in prison. In the film, a group of former prisoners encounter the man who terrorized them in jail, and weigh whether or not to kill him.",
      "Panahi was jailed in Tehran\u2019s Evin Prison after going there to inquire about the then-jailed Rasoulof. Panahi was released in 2023 after going on a hunger strike.",
      "In 2009, he was banned from traveling out of Iran after attending the funeral of a student killed in the Green Movement protests. Through those years, Panahi continued to make films illegally in Iran, without a permit, and had his films smuggled to festivals on USB drives. His travel ban was lifted after his release in 2023.",
      "\u201cThe film springs from a feeling of resistance, survival, which is absolutely necessary today,\u201d Binoche told reporters after the ceremony. \u201cArt will always win. What is human will always win.\u201d",
      "The Cannes closing ceremony followed a major power outage that struck southeastern France on Saturday in what police suspected was arson. Only a few hours before stars began streaming down the red carpet, power was restored in Cannes.",
      "\u201cA day without electricity,\" sighed John C. Reilly, who sang an English-language \u201cLa Vie En Rose\u201d at the ceremony. The festival's films, he said, supplied \u201call the needed electricity.\"",
      "The Grand Prix, or second prize, was awarded to Joachim Trier\u2019s Norwegian family drama \u201cSentimental Value,\u201d his lauded follow-up to \u201cThe Worst Person in the World.\u201d Some had expected \u201cSentimental Value\u201d to win the Palme, but Trier \u2014 whose film reunites him with actor Renate Reinsve \u2014 still took a major prize.",
      "\u201cWe live in a time of tremendous excess and saturation of images. Moving images are being thrown at us all the time,\" said Trier. \"And I want to give homage to the Cannes Film Festival for being a place where the big cinematic image, which is the foundation of the moving image, the free image, the image that we take time to look at, the image where we can identify with each other in contemplation and empathy, to be cherished in this place in such a way is very important in this moment.\u201d",
      "Kleber Mendon\u00e7a Filho\u2019s Brazilian political thriller \u201cThe Secret Agent\" won two big awards: best director for Filho and best actor for Wagner Moura. Though Cannes juries are generally urged to spread awards around, the two for \u201cThe Secret Agent\u201d showed the jury's strong feelings for it. Asked about the two prizes, juror Jeremy Strong explained, simply, \u201cThat was our wish.\u201d",
      "The wins, which followed the international film Oscar victory for Walter Salles' \u201cI'm Still Here\u201d in March, gave Brazil more to celebrate. On X, Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, said the awards \u201cshow that our country\u2019s cinema is second to none.\u201d",
      "The jury prize was split between two films: \u00d3liver Laxe\u2019s desert road trip \u201cSir\u00e2t \" and Mascha Schilinski's German, generation-spanning drama \u201cSound of Falling.\u201d Best actress went to Nadia Melliti for \u201cThe Little Sister,\u201d Hafsia Herzi's French coming-of-age drama.",
      "The Belgian brothers Luc and Jean-Pierre Dardenne, who are two-time Palme d'Or winners, won best screenplay for their latest drama, \u201cYoung Mothers.\u201d Its their ninth prize in Cannes. The festival's award for best first film, the Camera d'Or, went to Hasan Hadi for \u201cThe President's Cake,\u201d making it the first Iraqi film to win an award at the festival.",
      "Saturday's ceremony brought to a close a 78th Cannes Film Festival where geopolitics cast a long shadow, both on screen and off. Shortly before the French Riviera extravaganza, which is also the world's largest movie market, U.S. President Donald Trump floated the idea of a 100% tariff on movies made overseas.",
      "Most filmmakers responded with a shrug, calling the plan illogical. \u201cCan you hold up the movie in customs? It doesn\u2019t ship that way,\u201d said Wes Anderson, who premiered his latest, \u201cThe Phoenician Scheme\u201d at the festival. At the opening ceremony, honorary Palme d'Or recipient Robert De Niro called Trump \u201cAmerica's philistine president.\u201d",
      "Other top American films in Cannes included Spike Lee's \u201cHighest 2 Lowest\u201d (which pulled Lee away from his New York Knicks but not out of their blue and orange color), the Christopher McQuarrie-Tom Cruise actioner \u201cMission: Impossible \u2014 Final Reckoning,\" and Ari Aster's \u201cEddington,\u201d which found a divisive reaction.",
      "Panahi's win put him in rare company. He's now won Cannes' Palme d'Or, Venice's Golden Lion (for \u201cThe Circle\u201d) and Berlin's Golden Bear (for \u201cTaxi\u201d). Only three other filmmakers have done that: Henri-Georges Clouzot, Michelangelo Antonioni and Robert Altman.",
      "Addressing reporters after his win, Panahi spoke about filmmakers and artists always being able to find a way, \u201ceven in complicated situations.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey must realize that no powers that be can halt such people in their tracks,\u201d said Panahi. \u201cYou have this power.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Filmmaker Matt Wolf learned that Paul Reubens had died along with the rest of the world",
      "Paul Reubens did not tell his director that he was dying.",
      "On July 31, 2023, the news of Reubens' death came as a shock to documentary filmmaker Matt Wolf, who had spent a year trying to convince him to make the ambitious two-part documentary \u201cPee-wee as Himself,\u201d now streaming on HBO Max, and over 40 hours interviewing him on camera.",
      "But in 2023, the project was in danger of falling apart: The two had been at an impasse for a while over the issue of creative control and they\u2019d finally found a way forward. He had one last interview scheduled, set for the first week of August. Then the texts started coming in. Wolf sat there shaking.",
      "They\u2019d spoken about everything \u2014 Reubens' childhood, his complicated relationship with fame, his ambitions, his commitment to his alter-ego Pee-wee Herman, his sexuality, his arrest \u2014 except the fact that he\u2019d been battling cancer for the past six years. But after the initial shock, a renewed purpose set in.",
      "\u201cI went to work the day after Paul died. I started to read the 1,500-page transcript of our interview through the night and was struck by the significance and meaning that came by understanding that he was privately contemplating mortality,\u201d Wolf said. \u201cI was aware that this was an extraordinary situation that was part of the story of the film and that the stakes were the highest I had ever experienced.\u201d",
      "For the next year, Wolf would wake up and say to himself, \u201cYou cannot drop the ball. Rise to the occasion.\u201d It was, he said, \u201cthe most challenging and involved and emotional process of filmmaking that I\u2019ve ever gone through and maybe that I\u2019ll ever go through again.\u201d",
      "Reubens wanted to direct his own documentary. He\u2019d always prized creative control and couldn\u2019t fathom why he would cede it in telling his own story for the first time. But everyone around him seemed to think that was a bad idea. It would take over a year of getting to know Wolf, whose film credits include documentaries about cellist Arthur Russell and news archivist Marion Stokes, to consider letting go.",
      "Even after Reubens had agreed to let Wolf direct the project, he continued to push back and resist at times. Early on, they decided to record their phone conversations as well, recognizing that their dynamic illuminated something true about Reubens.",
      "\u201cRight away, Paul was sort of rebelling against the process, blowing off steam, procrastinating, teasing me, sometimes being adversarial, but in a funny wink-wink way,\u201d Wolf said. \u201cI was frustrated. I thought, how am I ever going to get through this? This is the most resistant interview subject I\u2019ve ever encountered. Then I realized this is actually a pretty significant form of portraiture. This is showing Paul\u2019s discomfort and uncertainty about really showing and sharing himself.\u201d",
      "The result is a collaboration, Wolf said, but one in which he also had editorial control. It wasn\u2019t going to be a hit piece, but it wasn\u2019t going to be a puff piece either.",
      "Wolf, 43, was part of the generation of kids who grew up with the children\u2019s television series \u201cPee-wee\u2019s Playhouse.\u201d It was, he said, the first time he\u2019d felt viscerally moved by a work of art.",
      "Still, he wasn\u2019t approaching the project as a fan. He was coming as a filmmaker who makes documentaries about gay artists and unconventional visionaries who \u201cbeg for reappraisal.\u201d Unlike most of his subjects, however, Reubens was an icon and a cult figure.",
      "\u201cI was determined not to make a film that fell into the traps of the celebrity biopic with platitudes from other famous people and manufactured self-reflection,\u201d Wolf said. \u201cI wanted to make portrait of an artist.\u201d",
      "Much of the film focuses on the prehistory of Pee-wee, showing how his childhood, his artistic awakening, his early improv days and his \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d rejection would converge into the commitment to this alter ego. Part of that involved engaging with Reubens\u2019 sexuality in a direct way. In the film, Reubens speaks about living openly as a gay man, and then going back in the closet.",
      "\u201cHe had always intended to come out but was very ambivalent about that,\u201d Wolf said. \u201cAnd I saw myself as a younger gay person who could help somebody achieve that and also to give a sense of nuance and depth to his artistry that one could appreciate, and to understand the personal sacrifices that were required for him to do that.\u201d",
      "Reubens\u2019 career was derailed when he was arrested for indecent exposure in an adult movie theater in 1991. He was handed a small fine but the damage was incalculable. In 2001, he was arrested and charged with misdemeanor possession of child pornography, which was reduced to an obscenity charge with probation. These are covered in the documentary\u2019s second part.",
      "\u201cHe wanted to set the record straight, particularly about the unfortunate footnotes of his arrest, which to some extent have overshadowed his artistic accomplishments,\u201d Wolf said. \u201cThat to me felt like the easy part and also the least interesting part of the film.\u201d",
      "\u201cPee-wee as Himself\u201d premiered earlier this year at the Sundance Film Festival, where Wolf got to see emotional responses from audiences, no matter if they came to it as fans or out of some curiosity around the controversies. That emotional intensity was what he hoped they\u2019d feel.",
      "\u201cI wanted to make a film with a big range of emotions, from joy and delight to tragedy and sorrow,\u201d Wolf said. \u201cPaul contains that big spectrum of feelings. And I wanted the viewer to feel it, to have a lasting connection to him. When a film can affect you emotionally it becomes unforgettable.\u201d",

      "The Cannes Film Festival has played host to the directorial debuts of three stars",
      "CANNES, France -- The Cannes Film Festival has played host to the directorial debuts of three stars: Scarlett Johansson, Kristen Stewart and relative newcomer Harris Dickinson.",
      "Their films are very different but the fulfillment of longtime dreams of being behind the camera. All three movies are part of Cannes' Un Certain Regard section, which has helped launch the careers of directors like Yorgos Lanthimos, Lynne Ramsay and Molly Manning Walker.",
      "At 28, Dickinson is an up-and-coming actor, known for \u201cBabygirl,\u201d \u201cWhere the Crawdads Sing\u201d and the Palme d'Or-winning \u201cTriangle of Sadness,\u201d who worked for years to develop his film, \u201cUrchin.\u201d",
      "Johansson, a two-time Oscar acting nominee who's been a star since her teens and played Black Widow in multiple Marvel films, brought \u201cEleanor the Great,\u201d a film about a nonagenarian who coopts her late friend's Holocaust story, to Cannes this week.",
      "Stewart, also an acting Oscar nominee, debuted \u201cThe Chronology of Water,\u201d an adaptation of Lidia Yuknavitch\u2019s 2011 memoir, last week.",
      "Awards for the Un Certain Regard section will be announced Friday, a day before the Cannes Film Festival closes.",
      "Here's what the actors-turned-directors had to say about their first forays into creating a film from behind the camera.",
      "\u201cI wanted to direct from a very young age. I wanted to make films,\u201d says Dickinson, who got his start as many young creators do now: on YouTube. He even had a web sketch series. \u201cThat was my first love, just making things.\u201d",
      "Dickinson's profile as an actor has exploded in recent years, but his desire to direct was so strong, he started saying no to roles.",
      "\u201c'Urchin' was all I could think about. It was pouring out of me. It was all that was on my mind,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to say no when you\u2019ve got something to take you away from that, you know? Nothing that came in would make me question my own film, which is a sign that I had to make it at this time.\u201d",
      "The film stars Frank Dillane as a homeless Londoner suffering from drug addiction.",
      "Johansson is now one of the world's most recognizable stars. She's also one of its most respected, earning two Oscar nominations in 2020, for \u201cMarriage Story\u201d and \u201cJojo Rabbit.\u201d",
      "Her success as an actor helped her take on new roles on films, including producing, and, now, directing.",
      "\u201cAt some point, I worked enough that I stopped worrying about not working, or not being relevant \u2014 which is very liberating,\u201d Johansson says. \u201cI think it\u2019s something all actors feel for a long time until they don\u2019t. I would not have had the confidence to direct this film 10 years ago.\u201d",
      "She says that throughout her career, imagining how to make movies has been part of her process: \u201cWhether it was reading something and thinking, \u2018I can envision this in my mind,\u2019 or even being on a production and thinking, \u2018I am directing some elements of this out of necessity.\u2019\u201d",
      "The New York-set \u201cEleanor the Great\u201d stars June Squibb as a 94-year-old who, out of grief and loneliness, takes over her friend's story of Holocaust survival as her own.",
      "\u201cIt was eight years in the making and then a really accelerated push. It\u2019s an obvious comparison but it was childbirth,\u201d says Stewart of the film. \u201cI was pregnant for a really long time and then I was screaming bloody murder.\u201d",
      "Stewart in interviews has talked about challenging the myth that men are better suited to directing.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really not fair for people to think it\u2019s hard to make a movie insofar as you need to know things before going into it. There are technical directors, but, Jesus Christ, you hire a crew. You just have a perspective and trust it,\u201d she said. \u201cMy inexperience made this movie.\u201d",
      "Yuknavitch's memoir recounts her surviving sexual abuse by her father and how she sought refuge in competitive swimming and, later, writing.",
      "While Stewart expressed doubts that she offered much to her film's star, Imogen Poots, in terms of useful direction, the actor disagrees.",
      "\u201cKristen is incredibly present but at the same has this ability, like a plant or something, to pick up on a slight shift in the atmosphere where it\u2019s like: \u2018Wait a minute,\u2019\u201d Poots said, causing Stewart to laugh. \u201cThere is this insane brain at play and it\u2019s a skill set that comes in the form of an intense curiosity.\u201d",

      "SAO PAULO -- Brazilian photographer and environmentalist Sebasti\u00e3o Salgado, known for his award-winning images of nature and humanity, died at 81 from leukemia, his family said Friday. Local media reported he died in Paris, where he lived for more than 55 years.",
      "Salgado's style is marked by black-and-white imagery, rich tonality, and emotionally charged scenarios. Many of his best pictures were taken in impoverished communities, especially in the Amazon and in Africa. He was recently experiencing undisclosed health problems.",
      "\u201cThrough the lens of his camera, Sebasti\u00e3o tirelessly fought for a more just, humane, and ecological world,\u201d Salgado's family said in a statement.",
      "\u201cAs a photographer who traveled the globe continuously, he contracted a particular form of malaria in 2010 in Indonesia while working on his Genesis project. Fifteen years later, complications from this illness developed into severe leukemia, which ultimately took his life,\u201d the family added.",
      "Earlier, Instituto Terra, which was founded by Salgado and his wife L\u00e9lia Wanick Salgado, and the French Academy of Fine Arts, of which he was a member, announced his death, but did not provide details on the circumstances or where he died.",
      "\u201cSebasti\u00e3o was more than one of the best photographers of our time,\u201d Instituto Terra said in a statement. \u201cHis lens revealed the world and its contradictions; his life, (brought) the power of transformative action.\u201d",
      "Composer Laurent Petitgirard, secretary of the French Academy of Fine Arts, said in a statement that Salgado, one of his colleagues, was \u201cremarkable for his moral integrity, his charisma, and his commitment to serving art.\u201d",
      "\"He leaves behind a monumental body of work,\u201d Petitgirard said about a photographer who received many awards, and was elected an honorary member of the Academy of Arts and Sciences in the United States in 1992 and to the French Academy of Fine Arts in 2016.",
      "Salgado\u2019s main works include the recent \u201cAmazonia\u201d series, \u201cWorkers,\u201d which shows manual labor around the world, and \u201cExodus\u201d (also known as \u201cMigrations\u201d or \u201cSahel\u201d), which documents people in transit, including refugees and slum residents.",
      "Salgado had his life and work portrayed in the documentary \u201cThe Salt of the Earth\u201d (2014), co-directed by Wim Wenders and his son, Juliano Ribeiro Salgado. The film was was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Documentary in 2015.",
      "One of Brazil\u2019s most famous artists, though, always insisted he was \u201cjust a photographer.\u201d",
      "Salgado moved to France in 1969 as Brazil endured a military dictatorship. He said in different interviews he was then a leftist militant against the regime.",
      "It was in Paris in 1973 that he started to fully dedicate his time to photography and develop his black-and-white style, years after his economics degree.",
      "His first professional works were for the agency Sygma in 1974. The following year, he documented the lives of peasants and Indigenous peoples in Latin America for the Gamma agency. Five years later, he joined Magnum, a top brand for photographers, of which he later became president.",
      "Salgado left it in 1994 to found Amazonia Images with his wife, an agency that exclusively handles his work.",
      "Brazil\u2019s President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, who received Salgado\u2019s support throughout his political career, requested a minute of silence during a ceremony in the capital city of Brasilia to honor \u201cone of the greatest, if not the greatest, photographer the world has ever produced.\u201d",
      "\u201cHis nonconformity with the fact that the world is so unequal and his stubborn talent in portraying the reality of the oppressed always served as a wake-up call for the conscience of all humanity,\u201d Lula said. \u201cSalgado did not only use his eyes and his camera to portray people: he also used the fullness of his soul and his heart.\u201d",
      "France\u2019s President Emmanuel Macron posted a picture of Salgado\u2019s in Alaska in his Instagram profile as a tribute to the photographer, who also had French citizenship.",
      "Salgado and his wife, whom he married in 1967, raised their two sons, Juliano and Rodrigo, in France. His friends said every morning that he could he would breathe the air near the Canal Saint-Martin in Paris. His death also caused commotion in the country he adopted.",
      "Fran\u00e7ois-Bernard M\u00e2che, a major French composer who worked with Salgado for his exhibition \u201cAqua Mater\u201d in Paris, said the Brazilian was an \u201cauthentic and warm man\u201d.",
      "\u201cHis gaze transformed landscapes, and beyond the spectacular, he reached a kind of inner truth (\u2026). With him, photography fulfilled one of its highest ambitions by going far beyond mere appearances,\u201d M\u00e2che told The Associated Press.",
      "Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo said Salgado was passionate about their city.",
      "\u201cTonight I cry for a very close friend, a rare soul; a loyal, discreet and sensible man. His death moves us profoundly. He already leaves us an immense void,\u201d Hidalgo said. \u201cParis, the city that loved him, will give him the honors he deserves.\u201d",
      "An exhibition of about 400 of Salgado\u2019s works is currently on display in the city of Deauville, in northern France.",
      "Brazilian newspaper Folha de S. Paulo, which published several of Salgado\u2019s works over the last decades, said he recently canceled a meeting with journalists in the French city of Reims due to health problems. He was scheduled to attend an exhibition with works by his son Rodrigo for a church in the same city on Saturday, the daily reported.",
      "Salgado and his wife had been working since the 1990s to restore part of the Atlantic Forest in Minas Gerais. In 1998, they turned a plot of land they owned into a nature reserve, according to Salgado\u2019s biography on the French Academy of Fine Arts\u2019 website. That same year, they created Instituto Terra, which promotes reforestation and environmental education.",
      "So far, Instituto Terra has planted more than 3 million trees in the city of Aimores, which lies in what was once a somewhat deserted region in the countryside of the Minas Gerais state. The photographer was born there in 1944.",
      "In an undated interview with Forbes Brasil published on Thursday, Salgado said that attending the exhibition of his works in Deuville felt like a stroll through his life.",
      "\u201cHow many times in my life have I put my camera to the side and sat down to cry? Sometimes it was too dramatic, and I was alone. That's the power of the photographer; to be able to be there,\u201d Salgado said.",
      "\u201cIf a photographer is not there, there's no image. We need to be there. We expose ourselves a lot. And that is why it is such an immense privilege.\u201d",

      "Buble, a five-time Grammy-winning pop icon, has signed on to be part of the team's fundraising efforts for the American Cancer Society. The \u201cPanthers on the Prowl\u201d initiative combines art and philanthropy to support cancer research and patient services, and donors get the chance to sponsor life-sized panther sculptures that will be placed around South Florida.",
      "The program is the brainchild of Panthers hockey operations president and general manager Bill Zito and his wife Julie Zito.",
      "\u201c'Panthers on the Prowl' is a creative and really cool and uplifting way to demonstrate and show our support for those people that are suffering, so we can generate the much-needed funding to keep this fight going,\" Buble said. \"Cancer touches all of us, my family, friends, yours, neighbors, everyone. I joined my buddy Bill Zito and the Florida Panthers and all of our NHL hockey community because I want to be part of the solution.\u201d",
      "The program formally launched in March and has been backed by famed artist Romero Britto along with NFL players \u2014 and South Florida natives \u2014 Nick Bosa and Joey Bosa, among others.",
      "Julie Zito is a cancer survivor, Bill Zito lost his mother and sister to cancer, and the Zito family recently lost a close friend to cancer as well.

      "The team is hoping to raise at least $1 million.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s in all of our families and all of our friendships,\" said Zito, who joined the Panthers in 2020. \"It makes me more determined not to achieve a goal for the goal\u2019s sake, but to achieve a goal to bring people together.\u201d",

      "Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who was a longtime anti-vaccine activist, said this week that the shots are no longer recommended for healthy children and pregnant women, usurping a decision normally made by scientific experts, not political appointees.",
      "The announcement follows an earlier Trump administration step to limit COVID-19 vaccinations among healthy people under age 65.",
      "Until now, the U.S. \u2013 following guidance from independent experts who advise the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \u2013 has recommended yearly COVID-19 vaccinations for everyone age 6 months and older.",
      "Together, the moves have left health experts, vaccine makers and insurers uncertain about what to advise and what comes next.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to add a lot of confusion overall,\u201d said Ajay Sethi, an epidemiologist at the University of Wisconsin, Madison.",
      "Some of this season\u2019s vaccine is still available. Insurance industry experts say if people had insurance coverage before Kennedy\u2019s announcement, it\u2019s highly unlikely that would have ended instantly based on the secretary\u2019s video announcement. That means if someone could find a shot, they'd likely be able to get one for now.",
      "Who will be able to get what vaccines this fall is still unclear.",
      "Vaccine manufacturers plan to issue updated COVID-19 shots in the late summer or fall. But the Food and Drug Administration has said it plans to limit approval of seasonal shots to seniors and others at high risk, pending more studies of everyone else.",
      "Even if the U.S. approves vaccines only for certain groups, it still may be possible for others to get the shot depending on the outcome of upcoming advisory meetings, regulatory moves and decisions from insurers and employers.",
      "Insurers base coverage decisions on the recommendations of that CDC panel, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. It\u2019s not clear what role that panel now will play. Paying out of pocket could cost about $200.",
      "But some insurers and employers may decide to still cover the shots regardless of the new recommendations, said Jen Kates, a senior vice president at the non-profit KFF, which studies health care issues. She noted that they may view the expense as worthwhile if it avoids a higher bill from someone hospitalized by the coronavirus.",
      "The FDA published a list of health conditions it said would qualify, including asthma, cancer, diabetes, obesity and physical inactivity. The CDC has a more extensive list.",
      "But, again, it isn't yet known how this will play out. For example, it could be hard for people to prove they're qualified. If they're vaccinated at a drugstore, for instance, the pharmacist wouldn't normally know about underlying health problems or even ask. Kates said it's unclear whether Kennedy's move would affect whether doctors recommend the shot.",
      "And Sethi, the UW-Madison expert, said \u201cthis elephant in the room\u201d is that blocking vaccination to the healthy may mean people who have a risk factor and simply don't know it will miss out.",
      "Adding to the confusion, the FDA included pregnancy and recent pregnancy on the list of conditions that would qualify someone for a shot \u2014 but Kennedy said that pregnancy was no longer a qualification in his announcement this week.",
      "COVID-19 complications during pregnancy can include preterm birth as well as serious illness in the mother, and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine said it \u201cstrongly reaffirms\u201d its recommendation for vaccination during pregnancy.",

      "At the time, no measures were taken to suspend his medical license or limit his contact with children and Le Scouarnec continued his abuse in hospitals until his arrest in 2017.",
      "\u201cShould Jo\u00ebl Le Scouarnec have been the only one in the defendant\u2019s box?\u201d prosecutor St\u00e9phane Kellenberger asked during his closing arguments.",
      "\u201cMore could have been done,\" Kellenberger said. \"Things could have been done differently, even within the notorious layers of French bureaucracy, where responsibilities are so often passed from one authority to another until, eventually, that responsibility is lost, and hits innocent lives.\"",
      "Le Scouarnec has confessed to all the sexual abuse alleged by the 299 civil parties, as well as to other assaults that are now beyond the statute of limitations. In a shocking admission during the trial, he also acknowledged sexually abusing his granddaughter \u2014 a statement made in front of her visibly distraught parents.",
      "Le Scouarnec had been convicted in 2005 for possessing and importing child sexual abuse material and sentenced to four months of suspended prison time. Despite that conviction, he was appointed as a hospital practitioner the following year. Child protection groups that have joined the proceedings as civil parties hope that the case will help strengthen the legal framework to prevent such abuse.",
      "Le Scouarnec\u2019s trial came as activists continue to push to dismantle taboos that have long surrounded sexual abuse in France. The most prominent case was that of Gis\u00e8le P\u00e9licot, who was drugged and raped by her now ex-husband and dozens of other men who were convicted and sentenced in December to three to 20 years in prison.",
      "In a separate case focusing on alleged abuse at a Catholic school, an inquiry commission of the National Assembly, France\u2019s lower house of parliament, is investigating allegations of physical and sexual abuse over five decades.",
      "Victims of Le Scouarnec have, however, complained of a perceived lack of attention.",
      "\"This trial, which could have served as an open-air laboratory to expose the serious failings of our institutions, seems to leave no mark on the government, the medical community, or society at large,\u201d a group of victims said in a statement.",
      "Not all victims were initially aware they had been abused. Some were contacted by investigators after their names appeared in journals kept by Le Scouarnec, in which he meticulously documented his crimes. Others only realized they had been hospitalized at the time after checking medical records. Two of his victims took their own lives some years before the trial.",
      "Using the cover of medical procedures, the former abdominal and digestive surgeon took advantage of moments when children were alone in their hospital rooms. His method was to disguise sexual abuse as clinical care, targeting young patients who were unlikely to remember the encounters.",
      "The notebooks, which detail the abuse in graphic language, have become central to the prosecution\u2019s case.",
      "Despite the scope of the allegations, Le Scouarnec has remained calm and composed throughout the trial.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t see them as people,\u201d he told the court. \u201cThey were the destination of my fantasies. As the trial went on, I began to see them as individuals, with emotions, anger, suffering and distress.\u201d",
      "He said his first act of abuse occurred in 1985, when he raped his 5-year-old niece.",
      "While he offered apologies to some victims, his demeanor struck many as detached and emotionless.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t show emotion, that\u2019s just how I am,\u201d he said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t feel it, but I don\u2019t express it.\u201d",
      "The case first came to light in April 2017, when a 6-year-old neighbor told her mother that the man next door had exposed himself and touched her through the fence separating their properties.",
      "A search of his home uncovered more than 300,000 photos, 650 pedophilic, zoophilic and scatological video files, as well as notebooks where he described himself as a pedophile and detailed his actions.",
      "\u201cJo\u00ebl Le Scouarnec says he no longer feels any sexual attraction to children, but there\u2019s no way to verify that,\u201d Kellenberger, the prosecutor, told the court. \u201cExperts concluded that we cannot rely on his word alone and that his potential for future danger remains significant.\u201d",
      "Prosecutors are seeking not only a 20-year prison sentence with a two-thirds minimum term, but also a post-sentence preventive detention, a rarely used measure in France that applies to the country\u2019s most dangerous offenders. If approved, Le Scouarnec could be held indefinitely in a secure socio-medical facility, even after serving his time.",
      "A third trial is expected in the coming years, following the emergence of new allegations during this trial, including further abuse involving his granddaughter.",

      "A leading medical group is warning of a rising number of cholera cases in war-torn Sudan as a new outbreak of the waterborne disease grips the country",
      "CAIRO -- A leading medical group warned on Tuesday of a rising number of cholera cases in war-torn Sudan as a new outbreak of the waterborne disease grips the country, and said its teams have treated hundreds of patients in the region of the capital, Khartoum.",
      "Joyce Bakker, the Sudan coordinator for Doctors Without Borders \u2014 also known as M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res or MSF \u2014 said that the alarming spike began in mid-May, with Khartoum's twin city, Omdurman, as the epicenter.",
      "She said MSF treated almost 2,000 suspected cholera cases in the past week alone. There were no immediate official figures of fatalities from cholera in this latest outbreak, though an aid worker said he was told on Monday of 12 people dying of cholera.",
      "In March, MSF said that 92 people had died of cholera in Sudan\u2019s White Nile State, where 2,700 people had contracted the disease since late February.",
      "Sudan plunged into war more than two years ago, when tensions between the Sudanese army and its rival paramilitary Rapid Support Forces group, or RSF, exploded with battles in Khartoum and across the country.",
      "Since then, at least 20,000 people have been tallied as being killed, though the number is likely far higher, and the African nation has been engulfed by what the United Nations says is the world\u2019s largest humanitarian crisis.",
      "More than 14 million people have been displaced and forced from their homes and disease outbreaks, famine and atrocities have mounted as the country entered its third year of war.",
      "Sudan's Health Minister Haitham Ibrahim said on Saturday that the recent increase in cholera cases is estimated to average 600 to 700 per week, over the past four weeks.",
      "He attributed the surge to the return of many Sudanese to the Khartoum region \u2014 people who had fled their homes to escape the fighting and who are now coming back. Their returns have strained the city's dwindling water resources, he said.",
      "Last week, the Sudanese military said it had regained control of the Greater Khartoum area from the paramilitary forces.",
      "On Monday, Mohanad Elbalal, co-founder of the Khartoum Aid Kitchen, said he was told that 12 people had died of cholera in Omdurman, including a relative of one of his kitchen staff.",
      "Bakker, the MSF coordinator, said Tuesday that the group's treatment centers in Omdurman are overwhelmed and that the \u201cscenes are disturbing.\u201d",
      "\u201cMany patients are arriving too late to be saved,\" she said. \"We don\u2019t know the true scale of the outbreak, and our teams can only see a fraction of the full picture.\u201d",
      "She called for a united response, including water, sanitation and hygiene programs and more treatment facilities.",

      "France\u2019s lower house of parliament has adopted a bill to allow adults with incurable illness to take lethal medication",
      "PARIS -- France\u2019s lower house of parliament adopted a bill Tuesday to allow adults with incurable illness to take lethal medication, as public demands grow across Europe for legal end-of-life options.",
      "The National Assembly vote is a key step on the long-debated issue, though others remain before the bill can become law.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m thinking of all the patients and their loved ones that I\u2019ve met over more than a decade. Many are no longer here, and they always told me: Keep fighting,\" said Olivier Falorni, the bill's general rapporteur, amid applause from fellow lawmakers.",
      "The proposed measure on lethal medication defines assisted dying as allowing use under certain conditions so that people may take it themselves. Only those whose physical condition doesn\u2019t allow them to do it alone would be able to get help from a doctor or a nurse.",
      "The bill, which received 305 votes in favor and 199 against, will be sent to the Senate, where the conservative majority could seek to amend it. A definitive vote on the measure could take months to be scheduled amid France\u2019s long and complex process. The National Assembly has final say over the Senate.",
      "Activists have criticized the complexity and length of the parliamentary process that they say is penalizing patients waiting for end-of-life options.",
      "In parallel, another bill on palliative care meant to reinforce measures to relieve pain and preserve patients\u2019 dignity was also adopted Tuesday, unanimously.",
      "To benefit, patients would need to be over 18 and be French citizens or live in France.",
      "A team of medical professionals would need to confirm that the patient has a grave and incurable illness \u201cat an advanced or terminal stage,\u201d is suffering from intolerable and untreatable pain and is seeking lethal medication of their own free will.",
      "Patients with severe psychiatric conditions and neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease won\u2019t be eligible.",
      "The person would initiate the request for lethal medication and confirm the request after a period of reflection. If approved, a doctor would deliver a prescription for the lethal medication, which could be taken at home or at a nursing home or a health care facility.",
      "A 2023 report indicated that most French citizens back legalizing end-of-life options, and opinion polls show growing support over the past 20 years.",
      "Initial discussions in parliament last year were abruptly interrupted by President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s decision to dissolve the National Assembly, plunging France into a months-long political crisis.",
      "\u201cWhat a long road it has been, contrary to what the public thought, contrary to what the French people believed,\u201d said Jonathan Denis, president of the Association for the Right to Die With Dignity (ADMD).",
      "Earlier this month, Macron suggested he could ask French voters to approve the measure via referendum if parliament discussions get off track.",
      "Macron on Tuesday called the vote an important step, adding on social media that \"with respect for different sensibilities, doubts, and hopes, the path of fraternity I had hoped for is gradually beginning to open. With dignity and humanity.\u201d",
      "Many French people have traveled to neighboring countries where medically assisted suicide or euthanasia are legal.",
      "Medically assisted suicide involves patients taking, of their own free will, a lethal drink or medication prescribed by a doctor to those who meet certain criteria. Euthanasia involves doctors or other health practitioners giving patients who meet certain criteria a lethal injection at their own request.",
      "\u201cI cannot accept that French men and women have to go to Switzerland \u2014 if they can afford it \u2014 or to Belgium to be supported in their choice, or that French men and women are being accompanied clandestinely in other countries,\" Denis said.",
      "French religious leaders this month issued a joint statement to denounce the bill, warning about the dangers of an \u201canthropological rupture.\u201d The Conference of Religious Leaders in France (CRCF), which represents the Catholic, Orthodox, Protestant, Jewish, Muslim and Buddhist communities, said the proposed measures risk exerting pressure on older people and those with illnesses or disabilities.",

      "Haitians with HIV are defying stigma as they publicly denounce USAID cuts implemented by the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump that has led to a dwindling of life-saving medication",
      "PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti -- A video showing dozens of people marching toward the office of Haiti\u2019s prime minister elicited gasps from some viewers as it circulated recently on social media. The protesters, who were HIV positive, did not conceal their faces \u2014 a rare occurrence in a country where the virus is still heavily stigmatized.",
      "\u201cCall the minister of health! We are dying!\u201d the group chanted.",
      "The protesters risked being shunned by society to warn that Haiti is running out of HIV medication just months after the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump slashed more than 90% of USAID\u2019s foreign aid contracts and $60 billion in overall aid across the globe.",
      "At a hospital near the northern city of Cap-Haitien, Dr. Eugene Maklin said he struggles to share that reality with his more than 550 HIV patients.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard to explain to them, to tell them that they\u2019re not going to find medication,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s like a suicide.\u201d",
      "More than 150,000 people in Haiti have HIV or AIDS, according to official estimates, although nonprofits believe the number is much higher.",
      "David Jeune, a 46-year-old hospital community worker, is among them. He became infected 19 years ago after having unprotected sex. \u201cI was scared to let people know because they would point their finger at you, saying you are infecting others with AIDS,\u201d he said.",
      "His fear was so great that he didn\u2019t tell anyone, not even his mother. But that fear dissipated with the support Jeune said he received from nonprofits. His confidence grew to the point where he participated in Monday\u2019s protest.",
      "\u201cI hope Trump will change his mind,\u201d he said, noting that his medication will run out in November. \u201cLet the poor people get the medication they need.\u201d",
      "Patrick Jean No\u00ebl, a representative of Haiti\u2019s Federation of Associations of HIV, said that at least five clinics, including one that served 2,500 patients, were forced to close after the USAID funding cuts.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t stay silent,\u201d he said. \u201cMore people need to come out.\u201d",
      "But most people with HIV in Haiti are reluctant to do so, said Dr. Sabine Lustin, executive director of the Haiti-based nonprofit Promoters of Zero AIDS Goal.",
      "The stigma is so strong that many patients are reluctant to pick up their medication in person. Instead, it is sent via packages wrapped as gifts to not arouse suspicion, Lustin said.",
      "Lustin\u2019s organization, which helps some 2,000 people across Haiti, receives funding from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While their funding hasn\u2019t been cut, she said that shortly after Trump was sworn in, the agency banned prevention activities because they targeted a group that is not a priority. By that, Lustin said she understood they were referring to gay men.",
      "That means the organization can no longer distribute up to 200,000 free condoms a year or educate people about the disease.",
      "\u201cYou risk an increase in infections,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have a young population who is sexually active who can\u2019t receive the prevention message and don\u2019t have access to condoms.\u201d",
      "On a recent sunny morning, a chorus of voices drowned out the din of traffic in Haiti\u2019s capital, growing louder as protesters with HIV marched defiantly toward the office of Haiti\u2019s prime minister.",
      "\u201cWe are here to tell the government that we exist, and we are people like any other person,\u201d one woman told reporters.",
      "Another marching alongside her said, \u201cWithout medication, we are dying. This needs to change.\u201d",
      "Three days after Monday's protest, the leader of Haiti\u2019s transitional presidential council, Louis G\u00e9rald Gilles, announced that he had met with activists and would try to secure funding.",
      "Meanwhile, nonprofit organizations across Haiti are fretting.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know what we\u2019re going to do,\u201d said Marie Denis-Luque, founder and executive director of CHOAIDS, a nonprofit that cares for Haitian orphans with HIV/AIDS. \u201cWe only have medication until July.\u201d",
      "Her voice broke as she described her frantic search for donations for the orphans, who are cared for by HIV-positive women in Cap-Haitien after gang violence forced them to leave Port-au-Prince.",
      "Denis-Luque said she has long advocated for the orphans\u2019 visibility.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t keep hiding these children. They are part of society,\u201d she said, adding that she smiled when she saw the video of Monday\u2019s protest. \u201cI was like, whoa, things have changed tremendously. The stigma is real, but I think what I saw \u2026 was very encouraging to me. They can\u2019t be silenced.\u201d",
      "Experts say Haiti could see a rise in HIV infections because medications are dwindling at a time that gang violence and poverty are surging.",
      "Dr. Alain Casseus, infectious disease division chief at Zamni Lasante, the largest non-governmental healthcare provider in Haiti, said they expected to see a surge in patients given the funding cuts, but that hasn\u2019t happened because traveling by land in Haiti is dangerous since violent gangs control main roads and randomly open fire on vehicles.",
      "He warned that abruptly stopping medication is dangerous, especially because many Haitians do not have access or cannot afford nutritious food to strengthen their immune system.",
      "\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t take long, especially given the situation in Haiti, to enter a very bad phase,\u201d he said of HIV infections. And even if some funding becomes available, a lapse in medication could cause resistance to it, he said.",
      "Casseus said gang violence also could accelerate the rates of infection via rapes or physical violence as medication runs out.",
      "At the New Hope Hospital run by Maklin in Haiti\u2019s northern region, shelves are running empty. He used to receive more than $165,000 a year to help HIV/AIDS patients. But that funding has dried up.",
      "\u201cThose people are going to die,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know how or where we\u2019re going to get more medication.\u201d",

      "Naqi Rizvi loves the \u201cabsolute freedom\u201d he feels on the tennis court",
      "LONDON -- Naqi Rizvi loves the \u201cabsolute freedom\u201d he feels on the tennis court.",
      "Winning titles is fun, too.",
      "The 34-year-old blind tennis champion is on a mission to not only raise awareness but also elevate the sport into the Paralympics.",
      "\"That would be the dream, and I\u2019d love to be the first Paralympic champion if I can,\u201d Rizvi said.",
      "The London resident, fully blind from the age of 7 because of congenital glaucoma, only took up the sport a decade ago and is now the No. 1-ranked men's player in the world for his category.",
      "Also an avid runner, Rizvi has completed two marathons and although jogging with a guide is great, tennis offers more.",
      "\u201cOn a tennis court, I have absolute freedom because I know where the boundaries are, no one needs to tell me which way to turn, I don\u2019t need to have a cane or anything of this sort,\" he told The Associated Press during a practice session at the National Tennis Center in southwest London.",
      "\"It\u2019s just the absolute sense of freedom to know that I can run comfortably, make my own decisions, and then be able to play points or rallies. It\u2019s just incredible.\u201d",
      "The rules are basically the same as mainstream tennis just with smaller dimensions and slightly lower net. Tactile lines are taped onto the court so players like Rizvi can feel the boundaries. Depending on the level of visual impairment, you are allowed up to three bounces of the ball. The foam ball contains a bell so players can audibly track it.",
      "\u201cWhat I find interesting about blind tennis is it\u2019s incredibly technical,\u201d said Rizvi, who also possesses a big serve.",
      "The problem-solving aspect of the sport is something Rizvi enjoys \u2014 no surprise given that he studied engineering at University College London.",
      "\u201cYou really need to anticipate after you\u2019ve heard the first bounce where the second and third will be,\u201d he said. \"You obviously can\u2019t see how your opponent has hit the ball, so it\u2019s a lot of anticipation and a lot of practice and getting used to different trajectories that the ball can take.",
      "Rizvi didn't even know that tennis was an option until he visited Metro Blind Sport in London a decade ago. He was hooked right away.",
      "\u201cI can almost assure you that if you did a survey of blind and partially sighted people,\" he said, \"the majority of them wouldn\u2019t have any idea because it\u2019s not televised, it\u2019s not in any other mainstream events, so how are people supposed to find out?\u201d",
      "The Lawn Tennis Association supports a visually impaired program that includes practice sessions at the governing body's National Tennis Center. That's where Jack Draper, the world No. 5 player, tried out the different levels. The LTA also runs tournaments each year and sends \u201cTeam GB\u201d to an international competition.",
      "Rizvi noted that there's not much financial backing in the sport. There's no prize money at tournaments and players often fund their own travel.",
      "\u201cUnless you obviously have the visibility and the money behind it, it\u2019s really hard,\u201d he said. \u201cGoverning bodies need to take a more active role and try and give parity to all forms of disability tennis not just the ones that have made it big like wheelchair tennis, for example.\u201d",
      "Rizvi, who is married and works in finance, originally represented his native Pakistan but for the past year has been part of England's program since gaining British citizenship. He discussed his childhood \u2014 his father is Pakistani and his mother is Indian \u2014 in a TEDx Talk he gave as a student at UCL.",
      "Invented in Japan by Takei Miyoshi in 1984, blind tennis is played around the world. Last year's world championships in Italy were the largest to date with 117 players from 20 countries, the International Blind Tennis Association said.",
      "Rizvi has won several national titles, a European championship, the world championship in 2023 \u2014 as well as gold that year at the ISBA World Games. He is also the two-time defending champion of the Play Your Way to Wimbledon tournament.",
      "The International Paralympic Committee handbook spells out that the sport or discipline must be \u201cwidely and regularly practiced\u201d in at least 32 countries and three continents.",
      "\u201cI really want it to be in the Paralympics,\u201d Rizvi said, \"but I also want this to be a mainstream sport which can be part of the ATP Tour, part of Grand Slam tournaments, just like wheelchair tennis has made such amazing leaps forward. I\u2019d love for blind tennis to be there as well because it\u2019s definitely got the potential.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s got the countries, the continents, the people, the passion behind it.\"",

      "Leo paid a visit to the Borgo Laudato Si, an educational sustainability project that grew out of Francis\u2019 2015 environmental encyclical \u201cPraised Be,\u201d the Vatican said. The center is located in the gardens of the Vatican\u2019s Castel Gandolfo property on Lake Alban in the hills south of Rome.",
      "Pope Urban VIII built the palace on the northern end of town in 1624, to give popes an escape from the sweltering Roman summers. It was enlarged over succeeding pontificates to its present size of 55 hectares (136 acres), which is actually bigger than Vatican City itself.",
      "Popes past used it regularly in summer, and Pope Benedict XVI famously closed out his papacy there on Feb. 28, 2013. But Francis, a homebody who never took a proper vacation during his 12-year pontificate, decided to remain in Rome in summer.",
      "In 2014 he decided to open Castel Gandolfo\u2019s gardens to the public, and later turned part of the palazzo itself into a museum, in part to help offset the economic downturn the town experienced with no popes holding weekly Sunday prayers there in summer.",

      "MANILA, Philippines -- Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. will retain Defense Secretary Gilberto Teodoro Jr., who is among the most vocal critics of China in Asia, as Marcos presses on with a midterm overhaul of his Cabinet, a senior official said Thursday.",
      "Teodoro, who has strongly echoed Marcos\u2019 criticisms of China\u2019s increasingly assertive actions in the South China Sea, will remain in his post, Executive Secretary Lucas Bersamin told a news conference.",
      "Maj. Gen. Nicolas Torre III will be the next chief of the 232,000-member national police. Torre led the arrest of former President Rodrigo Duterte in March and his turnover to International Criminal Court detention in The Netherlands for his deadly anti-drug crackdowns, Bersamin said.",
      "Last year, Torre oversaw the arrest of Philippine religious leader Apollo Quiboloy, a key Duterte supporter who was placed on the FBI\u2019s most-wanted list after being indicted for sexual abuses and trafficking in the U.S. Torre would take over his retiring predecessor, Gen. Rommel Marbil.",

But his equally popular vice-presidential running mate, Sara Duterte, later had a falling out with him that has sparked intense political discord.",
      "With support from friendly countries including the U.S., a treaty ally, Marcos emerged as the most vocal critic of China\u2019s actions in the disputed South China Sea while contending with an array of longstanding domestic issues including inflation, delayed fulfillment of a campaign promise to bring down the price of rice and many reports of kidnappings and other crimes.",
      "Teodoro told The Associated Press in March that China\u2019s aggressive policies in the disputed waters were now considered the greatest threat to the Philippines' national security and should also be regarded as a global threat because it could choke a trade route that is crucial for global supply chains.",
      "\"The greatest external threat actually is Chinese aggression, Chinese expansionism and the attempt by China to change the international law through the use of force or acquiescence \u2026 or its attempt to reshape the world order to one that it controls,\u201d Teodoro told the AP.",
      "Bersamin, who serves as executive secretary to Marcos and the Cabinet, has not specified the reasons for each Cabinet change but said \u201cthe president has no patience for under performance.\"",

      "China claims virtually the entire South China Sea, a key global trade and security route despite a 2016 international arbitration ruling initiated by the Philippines that invalidated those expansive claims based on the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.

      "Kitty Wu, director of education consultancy Litz USA Student Service in Hong Kong, said that some students who planned to apply to American universities in the future are now also considering the University of Hong Kong, the city\u2019s top university and an option because of its high ranking \u2014 something that had not happened before.",
      "\u201cThings are different every day now, we don\u2019t know how things will change in the future, so we don\u2019t know the impact for next year,\u201d she said.",
      "Will Kwong, managing director at AAS Education Consultancy in Hong Kong, said his company was already helping students with offers from American universities to apply to other institutions, predominantly in Britain and Australia, to give them an alternative. He said they made the move after the media reported the State Department had halted the scheduling of new visa interviews for foreign students hoping to study in the U.S.",

      "WARSAW, Poland -- Poland\u2019s presidential election has come down to a stark ideological choice: a liberal pro-European mayor versus a staunch nationalist conservative. They are polling so close that the outcome is impossible to predict in the run-off round on Sunday.",
      "It's not just a domestic affair. President Donald Trump has thrown his weight behind the nationalist candidate, Karol Nawrocki, and dangled the prospect of closer military ties if Poles choose him over liberal Warsaw Mayor Rafa\u0142 Trzaskowski.",
      "Trump met with Nawrocki earlier this month at the White House and sent his Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to a meeting of the conservative pressure group CPAC in Poland, where she offered a strong endorsement.",
      "Noem even dangled the prospect of closer U.S.-Polish military ties in the event of a Nawrocki win \u2014 with the implied warning that a Trzaskowski victory could jeopardize Poland\u2019s security.",
      "At stake is not only Poland\u2019s domestic course but also the international standing of a key European Union and NATO member on the alliance\u2019s eastern flank, in a region gripped by anxiety over Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine.",
      "Sunday\u2019s vote will either empower Prime Minister Donald Tusk, a pro-EU reformer, with a presidential ally who can advance his rule-of-law agenda \u2014 or saddle him with a rival who could veto legislation and block government initiatives.",
      "Trzaskowski\u2019s supporters argue that a pro-European leader would enhance Poland\u2019s global standing during a time of war in Europe. Nawrocki\u2019s backers believe only conservative rule can safeguard national sovereignty and traditional Christian values, and they say Trump\u2019s support would greatly enhance Poland\u2019s security.",
      "But the candidate who may ultimately decide the outcome is one who won\u2019t appear on the runoff ballot.",
      "S\u0142awomir Mentzen, a 38-year-old far-right politician and beer producer from the central city of Torun, finished third in the first round of voting on May 18, with nearly 15% of the vote. Though eliminated, his supporters \u2014 often young, anti-establishment, and deeply skeptical of both Brussels and Poland's political establishment \u2014 have become the most sought-after constituency in the country.",
      "Both remaining candidates have gone out of their way to court Mentzen and his base. In recent days, each man traveled to the north-central Polish town of Torun, famous for being the birthplace of astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus, to appear on Mentzen's YouTube channel, where he has built a following with a mix of libertarian economics, nationalist rhetoric, and anti-EU invective.",
      "His influence highlights a broader shift in Polish politics, where the far right \u2014 once considered a fringe force \u2014 is increasingly shaping the national agenda. It\u2019s also part of a larger trend of hard-right parties gaining traction across Europe.",
      "Piotr Buras, head of the European Council on Foreign Relations\u2019 Warsaw office, says Poland is part of a larger pattern in which voters turn to populist forces amid rapid social change. But he also cites local factors, such as disillusionment with Tusk\u2019s coalition.",
      "That coalition, which spans the ideological spectrum, has struggled to agree on key issues, including liberalizing the abortion law \u2014 a campaign promise. Meanwhile, outgoing conservative President Andrzej Duda has blocked parts of Tusk\u2019s agenda. Observers say the coalition\u2019s voters must be highly mobilized on Sunday to defeat Nawrocki.",
      "Many votes in the first round went to protest candidates. Among voters aged 18\u201329, over 35% backed Mentzen, and nearly 20% supported a far-left candidate, Adrian Zandberg, according to exit polls.",
      "In addition, an extreme right-wing antisemite, Grzegorz Braun, won more than 6% of the votes overall.",
      "Buras believes right-wing protest candidates are more appealing today than those on the left because they promise to restore a lost past, while the left promises a better future that many see as unattainable.",
      "\u201cThe world is changing, society is changing very fast, much faster than anytime in the past,\" Buras said. \u201cPeople are worried and they vote for those who say we can go back to the glorious past.\u201d",
      "Since the first round, Mentzen \u2014 co-leader of the Confederation party \u2014 has presented both candidates with an eight-point list of demands: no new taxes; defense of cash payments; expanded gun rights; and opposition to NATO membership for Ukraine, among others.",
      "Nawrocki, who appeared on Mentzen\u2019s show on June 22, signed on to all eight points \u2014 including the controversial Ukraine stance \u2014 breaking with his Law and Justice party\u2019s longstanding support for Kyiv\u2019s integration with the West.",
      "Trzaskowski appeared two days later. He said he could agree with some points, like fiscal restraint, but rejected others. He strongly defended LGBTQ+ rights and reaffirmed that Ukraine should eventually join NATO, once the war ends, calling it key to Poland's own security.",
      "The YouTube interviews have dominated the political conversation, underscoring how Mentzen, a TikTok-savvy outsider, has upended traditional campaigning.",
      "The exchange between Trzaskowski and Mentzen on Saturday was occasionally tense, especially over LGBTQ+ rights, but remained civil and substantive.",
      "In many ways it overshadowed a traditional televised debate the day before. The substance of that debate did not seem to change the trajectory of the campaign. The thing Poles discussed most was a brief moment when Nawrocki inserted something into his mouth which he later said was a tobacco pouch. Some have questioned if he is fit to be president if he couldn't get through a two-hour debate without taking a hit of tobacco.",
      "After the sometimes sharp exchanges, Mentzen sat down for a beer with Trzaskowski and others in the pub he owns.",
      "The informal gathering was documented by Foreign Minister Radek Sikorski, who was there as well. He posted a video on social media Saturday evening showing the group with the words: \u201cFor a Poland that unites, not divides.\u201d",
      "The video quickly went viral, with commentators speculating about whether it was a spontaneous gesture or a calculated political move.",
      "It was also one more example, if more were needed, of how far-right forces in Europe are slowly becoming accepted.",
      "For Mentzen, the moment was also awkward. The man who made his name skewering the political elite appeared cozy with establishment figures. Critics on the hard right lashed out, revealing fractures in the movement he helped popularize.",
      "After dangling the promises of an endorsement for days, Mentzen on Wednesday afternoon said he wouldn\u2019t offer one to either candidate. \u201cVote as your conscience tells you,\u201d he told his supporters.",

      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- A New Zealand court on Thursday discharged the husband of an Australian diplomat without convicting him, months after the man pleaded guilty to assault for drunkenly spitting on a teenager during a street altercation on the night of a rugby match in Wellington.",
      "The man was granted permanent name suppression. Judge Paul Mabey, presiding at the Wellington District Court, said he didn\u2019t accept the man\u2019s arguments that the potential harms to him justified the discharge, but the magistrate agreed that his wife\u2019s diplomatic career could be curbed by an assault conviction and the publication of his name.",
      "The man could be barred from travel abroad to her future postings, the judge said, and the family could be split up if the Australian High Commission decided he could not remain in New Zealand to preserve bilateral relations between the countries.",
      "The charges arose after an episode last September after the man attended a rugby match between New Zealand and Australia in the capital, which Australia lost 33-13. He was drunk when he arrived at Wellington\u2019s main nightlife area, where he approached a group of teenagers and became aggressive when they didn\u2019t want to engage with him, the judge said.",
      "A member of the group punched the man, who responded by spitting on a young woman. He was arrested by police officers who happened to be passing.",
      "The case has provoked widespread news coverage in New Zealand and Australia, which featured cell phone footage of the man\u2019s arrest. In the video, he was seen verbally abusing a police officer and claiming to have diplomatic immunity. He had such immunity, conferred by protocol to the partners of senior envoys to New Zealand, which he later waived voluntarily.",
      "He pleaded guilty to New Zealand's lowest level of assault charge in January. It is punishable by up to six months in jail and a fine of up to 4,000 New Zealand dollars ($2,400).",
      "\u201cFor the avoidance of any doubt at all, he is not here to be sentenced for abusing the police or rashly claiming diplomatic immunity,\u201d Judge Mabey said.",
      "\u201cHe was right to say he had that immunity,\" the judge added. \"He was completely stupid to say it at all.\u201d",

      "\u201cIf I were not to suppress his name, his offending would be inextricably linked to his wife and she would suffer considerably,\u201d the judge said.",

The company opened a new factory in 2024, ramping up production of advanced missiles used by multiple European countries.",

      "By readying for the worst, Resser said, the municipality also prepares for other \u2014 more likely \u2014 threats such as a pandemic, extreme weather or power outages such as the one that immobilized Spain and Portugal in April.",
      "Authorities in Kongsberg were not always so proactive but a flood in 2007 and an exercise simulating a four-day power disruption in 2016 made them realize they needed to step up.",

      "Mexicans will vote in the country\u2019s first judicial elections Sunday",
      "MEXICO CITY -- Mexicans will vote in the country\u2019s first judicial elections Sunday. The fiercely debated question is whether electing judges will deepen democratic decay or purge courts of rampant corruption and impunity.",
      "The vote comes as power in Mexico has been increasingly concentrated in the popular president\u2019s office, and as organized crime wields significant political influence in many parts of the country. Critics worry that electing judges will weaken checks and balances on government and stack the courts in favor of the ruling party.",
      "Judges and court staff previously earned their positions through merit and experience. Now the election has more than 7,700 candidates vying for more than 2,600 judicial positions, including on Mexico\u2019s Supreme Court. Hundreds more positions will be elected in 2027.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve never seen something like this before. What Mexico is doing is like an experiment, and we don\u2019t know what the outcome of it will be,\u201d said Carin Zissis, director of the Council of the Americas' Washington office.",
      "Mexico\u2019s judicial elections will pick judges across every level of government, an unprecedented situation globally.",
      "Former President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador led the push for the overhaul. The highly popular leader was long at odds with Mexican courts, which regularly struck down reform proposals and halted projects they called an overreach of executive power. L\u00f3pez Obrador went as far as publicly criticizing judges in his press briefings.",
      "Last September, after dominating presidential and legislative elections, his Morena party jammed the constitutional reform through congress. His ally and successor, President Claudia Sheinbaum, has continued to champion it.",
      "The overhaul notably put limits on the Supreme Court's power to widely block presidential actions and laws, and set up a disciplinary tribunal for judges.",
      "\u201cThe way I see it, the Supreme Court is going to once again become irrelevant, just like it was in the old days of authoritarian rule ... when its ability to monitor constitutionality was basically null,\u201d said Rafael Estada, a constitutional historian.",
      "Sheinbaum and L\u00f3pez Obrador have asserted that by popularly electing judges, they can root out corruption in the judiciary and bring the branch closer to the people.",
      "\u201cWho is going to choose the judges on the court now? The Mexican people. That\u2019s the big difference between what once was and what now is,\u201d Sheinbaum said Monday as she called on Mexicans to vote.",
      "\u201cAnd that,\u201d she added, \u201cis democracy.\u201d",
      "Many on the ballot won a lottery after being screened by committees made up of people from the three branches of government \u2014 two of which are controlled by the president\u2019s party. To qualify, candidates need a law degree, five years of professional experience, an essay and letters of recommendation from friends and colleagues.",
      "The passage of the reform legislation sparked weeks of protests by judges and judicial staff, a sharp rebuke from the Biden administration and concerns by international investors, causing the Mexican peso to dip.",
      "Opponents have called on Mexicans to boycott the vote, and the election is projected to have low turnout.",
      "The opponents \u2013 former judges, legal experts, politicians and foreign observers -\u2014 say that battling corruption and impunity in the courts is not a bad idea. Most Mexicans agree that the judiciary is rife with corruption.",
      "\u201cThe judiciary has a lot of scores to settle in this country,\u201d said Georgina De la Fuente, election specialist with the Mexican consulting firm Strategia Electoral.",
      "But critics say the ruling party is simply politicizing the courts at an opportune moment, when Sheinbaum is highly popular.",
      "Judicial candidates are not allowed to announce their party affiliation and are unable to accept party funds or hold major campaign events. A number of former Morena government officials and allies, however, have posted lists on social media of which ones to elect.",
      "Mexico's electoral authority said Wednesday it also had investigated cases of physical guides handed out to potential voters in Mexico City and Nuevo Leon state, something it said could amount to \u201ccoercion.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe way in which this reform was designed does not give people greater access to justice. It was designed to take control of the judiciary and blur the division of powers,\u201d De la Fuente said.",
      "Others warn that the overhaul could open the judiciary to questionable judges and allow organized crime to further influence Mexico\u2019s justice system.",
      "A number of candidates have raised eyebrows. Chief among them is Silvia Delgado Garc\u00eda, a former lawyer for drug kingpin Joaqu\u00edn \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n, who is running to be a criminal court judge in the northern border state of Chihuahua.",
      "Critics \u201cspeak out of ignorance because whether or not I\u2019ve represented some person doesn\u2019t transform you into that person,\u201d she told the AP as she handed out campaign flyers to people crossing the border from Ciudad Juarez to El Paso, Texas.",
      "\u201cWhat I can promise you is I\u2019ll be an impartial judge,\u201d she told some voters.",
      "Watchdogs also say that last year's vote on the reform was rushed through, criteria for candidates wasn\u2019t always followed, the number of candidates was limited by a lottery and lower-court orders trying to keep the reforms from taking effect were ignored.",
      "Zissis, of Council of the Americas, said the reforms could increase instability in the region at a time of rapid political change.",
      "Mexico\u2019s government has been working furiously to talk U.S. President Donald Trump down from tariff threats and meet demands by his administration to crack down on organized crime. At the same time, Trump has been locked in political fights with courts trying to block various actions.",
      "The turmoil could hurt international investment in Mexico if investors believe their money is less secure, Zissis said.",

      "Following a monetary policy meeting, the Bank of Korea cut its benchmark interest rate by a quarter percentage point to 2.5%. It was its fourth cut since October, when it began lowering borrowing costs for the first time in years to support a weakening economy. The bank slashed its 2025 growth outlook to 0.8%, nearly halving its previous projection of 1.5% announced in February.",

      "Since beginning his second term, Trump has vowed to slap huge new tariffs on foreign products entering the United States, including those from Mexico, Canada and China, which he insists will create more domestic jobs and shrink the federal deficit.",
      "In recent weeks, South Korea has sent trade officials to Washington to discuss the Trump administration\u2019s trade measures, including reciprocal tariffs and potential product-specific duties on semiconductors and cars, which are major exports for the country\u2019s trade-dependent economy.",
      "A decision by a U.S. federal court saying Trump lacks the legal authority to impose such tariffs could upset his plans, but the White House has appealed and it's unclear what will happen in the longer run.",
      "Experts say South Korea's leverage in trade talks and its ability to tackle domestic economic challenges have been undermined by political instability after former President Yoon Suk Yeol\u2019s ill-fated imposition of martial law in December. Yoon was formally ousted from office in April, setting the stage for a snap presidential election next week.",

As lawmakers begin rushing to the National Assembly, the military\u2019s martial law command issues a proclamation declaring sweeping government powers, including the suspension of political parties\u2019 activities and control over media.

      "The strikes, which began last Thursday in the southern port city of Bandar Abbas, one of the country\u2019s main transportation and shipping hubs, have now spread across Iran. The protests are slowly gaining steam, supported by prominent dissident voices, and could morph into more serious protests against the government.",
      "Last week, the Iranian government announced plans to increase the price of fuel for trucks from 4 cents per liter (15.14 cents per gallon) to nearly 50 cents per liter (about $1.90 per gallon) in late June. With massive resources of oil and gas, Iran has some of the lowest fuel prices in the world. The average price for a gallon of gas in the United States on Wednesday was $3.16, according to AAA, a drivers' assistance and advisory service.",

      "UNICEF said Wednesday that the number of reported cases surged ninefold from 90 a day to 815 a day since from May 15-25. Since the beginning of the year, more than 7,700 people have been diagnosed with cholera, including more than 1,000 children under the age of 4, it said.",
      "Most cases have been reported in Khartoum and Omdurman, but cholera was also detected in five surrounding provinces, the ministry said.",
      "Joyce Bakker, the Sudan coordinator for Doctors Without Borders, said the group\u2019s treatment centers in Omdurman are overwhelmed with patients.",
      "The \u201cscenes are disturbing,\u201d Bakker said. \u201cMany patients are arriving too late to be saved \u2026 We don\u2019t know the true scale of the outbreak, and our teams can only see a fraction of the full picture.\u201d",
      "Khartoum and Omdurman were a battleground throughout the civil war, nearly emptying them of residents. The region of the capital was recaptured by the military in late March from its rival, the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, or RSF.",
      "Since then, some 34,000 people have returned. But the city has been wrecked by months of fighting. Many found their homes damaged. Clean water is difficult to find, in part because attacks on power plants have disrupted electricity and worsened water shortages, UNICEF said. Sanitation systems are damaged.",
      "\u201cPeople have been drinking polluted water and transferring water into unhygienic containers,\u201d said Dr. Rania Elsayegh, with Sudan\u2019s Doctors for Human Rights.",
      "Health workers fear the outbreak could spread quickly, since many people are packed into displacement centers making it difficult to isolate those infected. The health system has also broken down. More than 80% of hospitals are out of service and those that are operating have shortages of water, electricity and medication, said Dr. Sayed Mohamed Abdullah, of Sudan\u2019s Doctors Union.",
      "The World Health Organization describes cholera as a \u201cdisease of poverty\u201d because it spreads where there is poor sanitation and a lack of clean water.",
      "It is a diarrheal disease caused when people eat food or water contaminated with the bacterium Vibrio cholerae. It is easily treatable with rehydration solutions and antibiotics. Most of those infected have only mild symptoms but, in severe cases, the disease can kill within hours if left untreated.",
      "The WHO\u2019s global stockpile of oral cholera vaccines has dropped below its minimum threshold of 5 million doses, making it increasingly difficult to stop outbreaks. At the same time, cholera epidemics have been on the rise around the world since 2021, because of poverty, conflict and extreme climate events like floods and cyclones, the U.N. says.",
      "The civil war has devastated Sudan since it erupted in April 2023, when simmering tensions between the military and the RSF exploded into open warfare across the country.",
      "At least 24,000 people have been reported killed, though the number is likely far higher. More than 14 million have been displaced and forced from their homes, including over 4 million who streamed into neighboring countries.",
      "Famine was announced in at least five locations with the epicenter in the wrecked Darfur region.",
      "The fighting has been marked by atrocities including mass rape and ethnically motivated killings that the U.N. and international rights groups say amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity.",
      "Devastating seasonal floods have compounded Sudan\u2019s misery. Each year, dozens of people have been killed and critical infrastructure washed away.",
      "Cholera is not uncommon in Sudan. In 2017, cholera left at least 700 dead and sickened about 22,000 in less than two months.",
      "But the war\u2019s destruction has fueled repeated outbreaks.",
      "Cholera spread across 11 of the country\u2019s 18 provinces in September and October, sickening more than 20,000 people and killing at least 626, according to health authorities.",
      "Over the course of two weeks in February and March, another outbreak infected more than 2,600 people, and 90 people died, mostly in the White Nile province, according to Doctors Without Borders.",
      "Other diseases have also spread. In the past week, an outbreak of dengue, a mosquito-borne illness, sickened about 12,900 people and killed at least 20, the Health Ministry said Tuesday. At the same time, at least 12 people died of meningitis, a highly contagious, serious airborne viral disease, it said.",

      "The European Union has lifted a wide range of sanctions on Syria, but slapped new ones on people it says participated on attacks on Alawite civilians during a wave of violence in the Syrian coastal region in March",
      "PARIS -- The European Union lifted a wide range of sanctions on Syria on Wednesday, but slapped new ones on people and groups it says participated on attacks on civilians during a wave of violence in the Syrian coastal region in March.",
      "The move lifted most sanctions that had been imposed on the country, including on its financial system, while keeping them in place on individuals and organizations in Syria it says violated human rights or for \u201csecurity grounds,\u201d like the extended family of former President Bashar Assad or its chemical weapons program, according to the text of the European Council on the decision.",
      "The EU\u2019s foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas had announced plans to lift the sanctions last week. She said the move was \u201cconditional\u201d and that sanctions could be resumed if the new government of Ahmad al-Sharaa - a former rebel commander who led the charge that unseated former President Bashar Assad in December - doesn\u2019t keep the peace.",
      "Kallas said in a statement Wednesday that removing sanctions \u201cis simply the right thing to do, at this historic time, for the EU to genuinely support Syria\u2019s recovery and a political transition that fulfils the aspirations of all Syrians.\u201d",
      "Wednesday\u2019s decision slapped \u201crestrictive measures\u201d on two people and three armed groups that were accused of \u201ctargeting civilians and especially the Alawite community\u201d - referring to the religious minority to which Assad belongs - during violence in March on the coast and of torture and \u201carbitrary killings of civilians.\u201d",
      "Clashes erupted at the time after a group of Assad loyalists attacked security forces near the coastal city of Latakia. Rights groups reported widespread revenge killings as militants from Syria\u2019s Sunni majority - some of them officially affiliated with the new government\u2019s security forces - targeted Alawites, regardless of whether they were involved in the insurgency. Hundreds of civilians were killed.",
      "The new government in Damascus has promised to hold perpetrators accountable, but a body formed to investigate the violence has yet to release its findings. While there have not been large-scale attacks on Alawites since March, members of the community remain fearful and say that individual incidents of kidnappings and killing continue to take place.",
      "The two people targeted by the new sanctions are Mohammad Hussein al-Jasim, leader of the Sultan Suleiman Shah Brigade, and Sayf Boulad Abu Bakr, leader of the Hamza Division, both armed groups that the EU said had taken part in the attacks. The militias were also slapped with new sanctions, as was another armed group, the Sultan Murad Division.",
      "The lifting of the broader sanctions on Syria comes days after the United States granted Syria sweeping exemptions from sanctions in a first step toward fulfilling President Donald Trump\u2019s pledge to lift a half-century of penalties on a country shattered by 13 years of civil war. A measure by the U.S. State Department waived for six months a tough set of sanctions imposed by Congress in 2019.",
      "The easing of sanctions removes one of the major barriers to reconstruction of the country, which the United Nations in 2017 estimated would cost at least $250 billion. Some experts now say that number could reach at least $400 billion.",
      "The United Nations estimates that 90% of Syrians live in poverty and state-supplied electricity comes as little as two hours every day.",

      "To do this, Vardges I. recruited Robert A. and Arman S., who are accused of trying to lure the man to a meeting in a cafe in downtown Frankfurt with the aim of identifying him and gathering further information about him. Because the man had previously been in touch with German police, no meeting ever took place, the Federal Prosecutor's Office said, adding that the three men remain in custody.",

      "In 2019, a Russian national, Vadim Krasikov, was convicted in Germany of killing a Georgian citizen who had fought Russian troops in Chechnya. Krasikov was sentenced to life imprisonment, but was released as part of a prisoner exchange between Russia and Ukraine in 2024.",
      "At his sentencing, German judges said Krasikov had acted on the orders of Russian authorities, who gave him a false identity, passport and the resources to carry out the killing.",

The July 10 summit promises to drive commitments to sustainable development amid population shifts and technological advancements that are disrupting cities worldwide.",

      "With its blend of media personalities, athletes and artists, this edition resembles previous lineups that sought to rally audiences against poverty through recognizable cultural figures. It's also key to Evans' goal of growing the movement to 50 million \u201cglobal citizens\u201d taking the platform's recommended actions by 2029.

      "NICOSIA, Cyprus -- Cyprus will offer Syrian families money to help them resettle back in their homeland and allow the main income earners to remain on the island nation for up to three years to work as part of a voluntary repatriation program, a Cypriot minister said Thursday.",
      "Deputy Minister for Migration Nicholas Ioannides said that a prerequisite for families to qualify for the program is that they must drop their claims for asylum or rescind international protection status already granted to them prior to Dec. 31, 2024.",
      "Unveiling the program, Ioannides said that families wishing to voluntarily return will be given a one-off sum of 2,000 euros ($2,255) for one adult and 1,000 euros ($1,128) for each child. Childless couples are also eligible to apply. The application period runs from June 2 to Aug. 31.",
      "Additionally, the family\u2019s main income earner \u2014 either the father or mother will be granted a special residency and work permit allowing them to stay for a minimum of two years in Cyprus with the option of another year.",
      "Ioannides said that many Syrians have expressed their willingness to return and help rebuild their country, but are reluctant to do so because of the uncertainty surrounding where they\u2019ll be able to earn a living wage.",
      "According to the head of Cyprus\u2019 Asylum Service Andreas Georgiades, the program\u2019s premise is to help families overcome any such reluctance by affording them a modest nest egg with which to cover their immediate needs while enabling the main income earner to continue working and sending money to his family.",
      "The income earner will be allowed to travel back and forth to Syria while his or her residency and work permit are valid.",
      "Syrian nationals make up the largest group of asylum-seekers in Cyprus by far. According to Asylum Service figures, 4,226 Syrians applied for asylum last year \u2014 almost 10 times more than Afghans who are the second-largest group.",
      "\u201cThis new program is a targeted, humanitarian and realistic policy that bolsters Syria\u2019s post-war transition to normality,\u201d Ioannides said, adding that European Home Affairs Commissioner Magnus Brunner considers the program as a potential example for other European Union member countries to follow.",
      "Meanwhile, Ioannides repeated that a 2009 Search and Rescue agreement that Cyprus has with Syria enables Cypriot authorities to send back boatloads of Syrian migrants trying to reach the island nation after they\u2019re rescued in international waters.",
      "Ioannides said that two inflatable boats each loaded with 30 Syrian migrants were turned back in line with the bilateral agreement after being rescued when they transmitted that they were in danger.",
      "Ioannides again denied Cyprus engages in any pushbacks, despite urgings from both the U.N. refugee agency and Europe\u2019s top human rights body to stop pushing back migrants trying to reach the island by boat.",

      "All, authorities allege, were victims tied to cryptocurrency-related crimes that have spilled out from behind computer screens and into the real world as the largely unregulated currency surges in value.",
      "While crypto thefts are not new, the use of physical violence is a far more recent trend, said John Griffin, a finance professor at the University of Texas in Austin who tracks financial crimes.",
      "\u201cI think this kind of physical violence is a natural manifestation of the emboldened nature of crypto activities,\u201d he said. \u201cThings that might clearly be outside of social norms in other spaces \u2014 like robbing a bank \u2014 are somehow just part of the game here.\u201d",
      "In the New York case, two American crypto investors \u2014 John Woeltz and William Duplessie \u2014 have been arrested on kidnapping and assault charges in recent days after a 28-year-old Italian man told police they tortured him for weeks to get his Bitcoin password. Attorneys for both men declined to comment.",
      "While the allegations are still emerging, they come just weeks after 13 people were indicted on federal charges in Washington, D.C., accused of combining computer hacking and money laundering with old-fashioned impersonation and burglary to steal more than $260 million from victims\u2019 cryptocurrency accounts.",

      "The case stemmed from an investigation that started after a couple in Connecticut last year were forced out of a Lamborghini SUV, assaulted and bound in the back of a van. Authorities allege the incident was a ransom plot targeting the couple\u2019s son \u2014 who they say helped steal more than $240 million worth of Bitcoin from a single victim. The son has not been charged, but is being detained on an unspecified \u201cfederal misdemeanor offense\u201d charge, according to online jail records.

      "And in January, the co-founder of French crypto-wallet firm Ledger, David Balland, and his wife were also kidnapped for ransom from their home in the region of Cher of central France. They also were rescued by police and 10 people were arrested.",

      "As a group, cryptocurrency theft victims reported the most losses \u2014 more than $6.5 billion",
      "The agency and experts say the crypto crime underworld is likely being fueled by the large amounts of money at stake \u2013 combined with weak regulation of cryptocurrency that allows many transactions to be made without identity documents.",
      "Violence may be increasing for several reasons including that criminals believe they can get away with crypto theft because transactions are hard to trace and often cloaked by anonymity, according to the crypto tracing firm TRM Labs. And crypto holders are getting easier to identify because of the prevalence of personal information online and people flaunting their crypto wealth on social media, the firm says.",
      "Phil Ariss, TRM Labs\u2019 director of UK public sector relations, said crypto also may be attracting criminal groups that have long used violence.",
      "\u201cAs long as there\u2019s a viable route to launder or liquidate stolen assets, it makes little difference to the offender whether the target is a high-value watch or a crypto wallet,\u201d Ariss said in a statement. \u201cCryptocurrency is now firmly in the mainstream, and as a result, our traditional understanding of physical threat and robbery needs to evolve accordingly.\"",

    "story": [
      "On a hillside northwest of Los Angeles, Andreas Tompros is replanting hundreds of avocado trees",
      "SOMIS, Calif. -- Andreas Tompros lost his home and at least a third of his avocado orchard to a wildfire last year, but the 47-year-old grower is not worried about his farm making a comeback.",
      "While California farmers often rattle off a list of challenges they face including high labor costs, water restrictions and overseas competition, many avocado growers say they have a good thing going. A key reason may come as a surprise to some \u2014 Mexican imports.",
      "When the United States lifted its ban on Mexican avocados in 1997, California growers worried at first that the imported fruit would displace their production.",
      "But the steady flow of avocados has wound up helping, not hurting, their sales by allowing for a year-round supply to markets and restaurants that has fomented demand, farmers say. Before the influx, most American consumers considered avocados to be specialty items \u2014 and when they came into season in California, industry officials had to work to rev up widespread interest in order to sell them.",
      "But not anymore.",
      "Avocado consumption has been booming in the United States over the past two decades. The amount of fruit available per person tripled to more than 8 pounds (3.6 kilograms) between 2000 and 2021, federal statistics show. Avocado toast and guacamole are regular offerings not just in culinary hubs like NYC but at cafes around the Midwest and the South.",
      "On a steep, sun-soaked hillside northwest of Los Angeles, Tompros is replanting nearly 300 avocado trees with the belief that Americans\u2019 hunger for the fruit \u2014 and his orchard \u2014 will continue to grow.",
      "\u201cIt will come back, and I believe it will become better than it was,\u201d Tompros, who previously ran a software company in Hollywood, said of the orchard he took over five years ago in the tiny community of Somis.",
      "Avocado demand has also been buoyed by consumers' growing interest in healthy fats, said Emiliano Escobedo, executive director of the Hass Avocado Board.",
      "A 2000 U.S. law created the board that collected 2.5 cents for every pound (0.5 kilograms) of avocados imported or produced in the United States. The board used the money to market avocados and conduct nutritional research, an effort that has been widely credited with making the fruit ubiquitous in supermarkets and on restaurant menus.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been really wildly successful. It generates way more money than most of these other industry boards do,\u201d said Richard Sexton, distinguished professor of agricultural and resource economics at the University of California, Davis. \u201cWhen you look at the growth rate in avocado consumption relative to all fruits, the difference in growth rate is dramatic.\u201d",
      "Escobedo said about 60% of U.S. households currently buy avocados, and about half of these are responsible for the overwhelming majority of consumption, which means there\u2019s still room for the market to grow \u2014 especially in the Northeast, where the fruit is less common.",
      "\u201cThere is a lot of opportunity for certain groups of people to increase their purchasing of avocados,\u201d Escobedo said.",
      "While the Trump administration has threatened tariffs on a spate of Mexican goods, avocados have so far been spared. California growers said they want Mexican avocados to keep flowing into the country, though they also want robust U.S. inspections of the imports to keep out pests to protect their crop.",
      "\u201cIf you are going to farm in California, avocados are about the best deal right now,\u201d said Ken Melban, president of the California Avocado Commission.",
      "California farmers grow about 10% of the avocados eaten in the United States, Melban said, and account for nearly all of the country\u2019s domestic avocado production. The fruit is largely grown in California from April through September, and Mexican imports arrive year-round to meet nationwide demand, which exceeds what the state's farmers grow, he said.",
      "In Southern California's Ventura County, many growers have shifted to avocados since lemon prices were walloped by cheaper imports from Argentina. As recently planted trees start bearing fruit in a few years, the region's avocado production is likely to rise, said Korinne Bell, agricultural commissioner for the county northwest of Los Angeles.",
      "Avocado trees do not come without risks in a region prone to wildfires.",
      "Still, demand for the trees has jumped due to interest from lemon growers \u2014 and since the November 2024 fire charred Ventura County avocado orchards, said Rob Brokaw, whose family-owned nursery has supplied avocado trees to California growers for 70 years.",
      "\u201cRight now we are sold out essentially for this year,\u201d Brokaw said. \u201cAnd we're mostly sold out for 2026.\u201d",
      "Tompros debated whether to plant the more fire-resistant lemon trees or another crop after the fire ripped through Somis, but he decided to replant due to the soaring demand for Super Bowl guacamole and avocado toast.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the super food, and it\u2019s still growing in popularity,\u201d Tompros said.",
      "He\u2019s taking precautions to not plant the trees too close to what will eventually be his rebuilt home, because the dried-out leaves that help nourish the orchard's soil can also fuel blazes.",
      "It may take a few years, but Tompros hopes it won\u2019t be too long before his newly planted trees bear fruit that he can sell to a local packinghouse or in seasonal gift boxes with citrus and passionfruit that he ships directly to customers.",

    "story": [
      "Natural gas has become a go-to fuel for power plants from coast to coast, sometimes replacing dirtier coal-fired plants and, by extension, improving air quality",
      "COUNSELOR, N.M. -- On a Tuesday in March, Billton Werito drove his son Amari toward his house in Counselor, New Mexico, navigating the bumpy dirt road that winds through a maze of natural gas pipelines, wellheads and water tanks. Amari should have been in school, but a bout of nausea and a dull headache kept him from class.",
      "\u201cIt happens a lot,\u201d Amari explained from the backseat, glancing up from his Nintendo Switch. The symptoms usually show up when the sixth-grader smells an odor of \u201crotten egg with propane\u201d that rises from nearby natural gas wells and wafts over Lybrook Elementary School, where he and some 70 other Navajo students attend class. His little brother often misses school for the same reason.",
      "\u201cThey just keep getting sick,\u201d Amari\u2019s father, Billton, said. \u201cI have to take them out of class because of the headaches. Especially the younger one, he\u2019s been throwing up and won\u2019t eat.\u201d The symptoms are putting the kids at risk of falling further behind in school.",
      "Lybrook sits in the heart of New Mexico\u2019s San Juan Basin, a major oil and gas deposit that, along with the Permian Basin in the state\u2019s southeast, is supplying natural gas that meets much of the nation\u2019s electricity demand.",
      "The gas pulled from tens of thousands of wells in New Mexico has reaped huge benefits for the entire country. Natural gas has become a go-to fuel for power plants from coast to coast, sometimes replacing dirtier coal-fired plants and, by extension, improving air quality. Locally, oil and gas companies employ thousands of workers, often in areas with few other opportunities, all while boosting the state\u2019s budget with billions in royalty payments.",
      "But those benefits may come at a cost for thousands of students in New Mexico whose schools sit near oil and gas pipelines, wellheads and flare stacks. An Associated Press analysis of state and federal data found 694 oil and gas wells with new or active permits within a mile of a school in the state. This means that around 29,500 students in 74 schools and pre-schools potentially face exposure to noxious emissions, as extraction from the ground can release unhealthy fumes.",
      "At Lybrook, where Amari just finished sixth grade, fewer than 6% of students are proficient at math, and only a fifth meet state standards for science and reading proficiency.",
      "Other factors could help explain students\u2019 poor achievement. Poverty rates are higher in some areas with high levels of gas development, and students at rural schools overall tend to face challenges that can adversely affect academic performance. AP\u2019s analysis found that two-thirds of the schools within a mile of an oil or gas well were low-income, and the population is around 24% Native American and 45% Hispanic.",
      "But research has found that student learning is directly harmed by air pollution from fossil fuels \u2014 even when socioeconomic factors are taken into account.",
      "And it\u2019s not just New Mexico where this is a risk. An AP analysis of data from the Global Oil and Gas Extraction Tracker found over 1,000 public schools across 13 states that are within five miles of a major oil or gas field. Major fields are collections of wells that produce the highest amount of energy in a state.",
      "\u201cThis kind of air pollution has a real, measurable effect on students,\u201d said Mike Gilraine, a professor of economics at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver, Canada, who studies connections between air quality and student performance.",
      "In 2024, Gilraine cowrote a study showing that student test scores were closely associated with air contamination. Each measured increase in PM2.5, a type of pollution created from the burning of fossil fuels, was associated with a significant decline in student test scores, Gilraine found. Conversely, researchers have documented that reductions in air pollution have led to higher test scores and fewer absences.",
      "\u201cTo me the surprise was certainly the magnitude of the effects\u201d of air pollution on students, Gilraine said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to find a similar factor that would have such an impact on schools nationwide.\u201d",
      "America\u2019s shift to natural gas has resulted in substantial increases in student achievement nationwide, Gilraine\u2019s research shows, as it has displaced dirtier coal and led to cleaner air on the whole. But there has been little data on air quality across New Mexico, even as it has become one of the most productive states in the nation for natural gas. State regulators have installed only 20 permanent air monitors, most in areas without oil or gas production.",
      "Independent researchers have extensively studied the air quality near schools in at least two locations in the state, however. One is Lybrook, which sits within a mile of 17 active oil and gas wells.",
      "In 2024, scientists affiliated with Princeton and Northern Arizona universities conducted an air-monitoring study at the school, finding that levels of pollutants \u2014 including benzene, a cancer-causing byproduct of natural gas production that is particularly harmful to children \u2014 were spiking during school hours, to nearly double the levels known to cause chronic or acute health effects.",
      "That research followed a 2021 health impact assessment that was done with support from several local nonprofits and foundations, which analyzed the effects of the area\u2019s oil and gas development on residents.",
      "The findings were startling: More than 90% of people surveyed suffered from sinus problems. Nosebleeds, shortness of breath and nausea were widespread. The report attributed the symptoms to the high levels of pollutants that researchers found \u2014 including, near Lybrook, hydrogen sulfide, a compound that gives off the sulfur smell that Amari Werito associated with his headaches.",
      "Those studies helped confirm what many community members already knew, said Daniel Tso, a community leader who served on the committee that oversaw the 2021 health impact assessment.",
      "\u201cThe children and the grandchildren need a safe homeland,\u201d Tso said during an interview in March, standing outside a cluster of gas wells within a mile of Lybrook Elementary.",
      "\u201cYou smell that?\u201d he said, nodding towards a nearby wellhead, which smelled like propane. \u201cThat\u2019s what the kids at the school are breathing in. I\u2019ve had people visiting this area from New York. They spend five minutes here and say, \u2018Hey, I got a headache.\u2019 And the kids are what, six hours a day at the school breathing this?\u201d",
      "Lybrook school officials did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Researchers have identified similar air quality problems in New Mexico\u2019s southeast.",
      "In 2023, a team of scientists from a coalition of universities conducted a detailed, yearlong study of the air in Loving, a small town in the Permian Basin. Local air quality, researchers found, was worse than in downtown Los Angeles, and the tested air contained the fifth-highest level of measured ozone contamination in the U.S.",
      "The source of the ozone \u2014 a pollutant that\u2019s especially hazardous to children \u2014 was the area\u2019s network of gas wells and related infrastructure. Some of that infrastructure sits within a half-mile of a campus that houses Loving\u2019s elementary, middle and high schools.",
      "A small group of residents has spoken out about the area\u2019s air quality, saying it has caused respiratory problems and other health issues. But for most locals, any concerns about pollution are outweighed by the industry\u2019s economic benefits.",
      "Representatives of the oil and gas industry have claimed the air quality studies themselves are not trustworthy.",
      "\u201cThere needs to be a robust study to actually answer these questions,\u201d said Andrea Felix, vice president of regulatory affairs for the New Mexico Oil and Gas Association (NMOGA). Felix said other sources of emissions, such as cars and trucks, are likely a larger source of air quality problems near wells.",
      "\u201cCompanies follow the best available science\u201d for well placement and emissions controls, Felix said, and also contribute huge amounts of money to the state\u2019s education budget through streams like royalties and direct expenditures. In the most recent fiscal year, oil and gas revenue supported $1.7 billion in K-12 spending in New Mexico, according to a NMOGA report.",
      "Officials with Loving Municipal Schools are also skeptical of the alarm over the wells. Loving Superintendent Lee White said the school district used funds from the oil and gas industry to pay for a new wing at the elementary school, a science lab for students, turf on the sports field and training and professional development for teachers. He said the industry\u2019s contributions to state coffers can\u2019t be ignored.",
      "\u201cAre we willing to give that up because people say our air is not clean?\u201d he said during an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s just as clean as anywhere else.\u201d",
      "As White spoke, a drill rig worked a couple of miles east of Loving\u2019s elementary school while parents poured into the gymnasium to watch kindergartners collect their diplomas. White touted the district\u2019s success, saying the elementary school scores above state averages for reading, math and science proficiency, while Loving\u2019s high school students far outpace the state average for college and career readiness.",
      "But environmental groups, attorneys and residents continue to push for limits on drilling near schools.",
      "Those efforts saw a boost in 2023, when New Mexico State Land Commissioner Stephanie Garcia Richard issued an executive order prohibiting new oil and gas leases on state-owned land within a mile of schools.",
      "Industry representatives decried the move, saying it added potentially insurmountable costs and barriers to drilling operators. However, AP\u2019s analysis found that relatively few wells would be impacted even if the rule applied to all of New Mexico; only around 1% of oil and gas wells in the state are within a mile of a school.",
      "In the years since, residents of areas where exploration is heavy have lobbied for legislation prohibiting gas operations within a mile of schools, regardless of land status. That bill died in committee during the most recent session of the New Mexico legislature.",
      "Advocates have also sued the state over an alleged lack of pollution controls. That suit is currently pending in state court.",

      "SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea\u2019s central bank cut its key interest rate and sharply lowered its growth outlook for the country\u2019s economy in 2025, as it moved Thursday to counter U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff hikes and weak domestic demand worsened by recent political turmoil.",
      "Following a monetary policy meeting, the Bank of Korea cut its benchmark interest rate by a quarter percentage point to 2.5%. It was its fourth cut since October, when it began lowering borrowing costs for the first time in years to support a weakening economy. The bank slashed its 2025 growth outlook to 0.8%, nearly halving its previous projection of 1.5% announced in February.",
      "Share prices jumped, with the Kospi gaining 1.7%.",

      "Since beginning his second term, Trump has vowed to slap huge new tariffs on foreign products entering the United States, including those from Mexico, Canada and China, which he insists will create more domestic jobs and shrink the federal deficit.",
      "In recent weeks, South Korea has sent trade officials to Washington to discuss the Trump administration\u2019s trade measures, including reciprocal tariffs and potential product-specific duties on semiconductors and cars, which are major exports for the country\u2019s trade-dependent economy.",
      "A decision by a U.S. federal court saying Trump lacks the legal authority to impose such tariffs could upset his plans, but the White House has appealed and it's unclear what will happen in the longer run.",
      "Experts say South Korea's leverage in trade talks and its ability to tackle domestic economic challenges have been undermined by political instability after former President Yoon Suk Yeol\u2019s ill-fated imposition of martial law in December.

      "WASHINGTON -- A federal court in New York handed President Donald Trump a big setback Wednesday, blocking his audacious plan to impose massive taxes on imports from almost every country in the world.",
      "A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of International Trade ruled that Trump overstepped his authority when he invoked the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act to declare a national emergency and justify the sweeping tariffs.",
      "The tariffs overturned decades of U.S. trade policy, disrupted global commerce, rattled financial markets and raised the risk of higher prices and recession in the United States and around the world.",
      "The U.S. Court of International Trade has jurisdiction over civil cases involving trade. Its decisions can be appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington and ultimately to the Supreme Court, where the legal challenges to Trump\u2019 tariffs are widely expected to end up.",
      "The court\u2019s decision blocks the tariffs Trump slapped last month on almost all U.S. trading partners and levies he imposed before that on China, Mexico and Canada.",
      "On April 2, Trump imposed so-called reciprocal tariffs of up to 50% on countries with which the United States runs a trade deficit and 10% baseline tariffs on almost everybody else. He later suspended the reciprocal tariffs for 90 days to give countries time to agree to reduce barriers to U.S. exports. But he kept the baseline tariffs in place. Claiming extraordinary power to act without congressional approval, he justified the taxes under IEEPA by declaring the United States' longstanding trade deficits \u201ca national emergency.\u201d",
      "In February, he'd invoked the law to impose tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China, saying that the illegal flow of immigrants and drugs across the U.S. border amounted to a national emergency and that the three countries needed to do more to stop it.",
      "The U.S. Constitution gives Congress the power to set taxes, including tariffs. But lawmakers have gradually let presidents assume more power over tariffs \u2014 and Trump has made the most of it.",
      "The tariffs are being challenged in at least seven lawsuits. In the ruling Wednesday, the trade court combined two of the cases \u2014 one brought by five small businesses and another by 12 U.S. states.",
      "The ruling does leave in place other Trump tariffs, including those on foreign steel, aluminum and autos. But those levies were invoked under a different law that required a Commerce Department investigation and could not be imposed at the president\u2019s own discretion.",
      "The administration had argued that courts had approved then-President Richard Nixon\u2019s emergency use of tariffs in a 1971 economic and financial crisis that arose when the United States suddenly devalued the dollar by ending a policy that linked the U.S. currency to the price of gold. The Nixon administration successfully cited its authority under the 1917 Trading With Enemy Act, which preceded and supplied some of the legal language later used in IEPPA.",
      "The court disagreed, deciding that Trump\u2019s sweeping tariffs exceeded his authority to regulate imports under IEEPA. It also said the tariffs did nothing to deal with problems they were supposed to address. In their case, the states noted that America's trade deficits hardly amount of a sudden emergency. The United States has racked them up for 49 straight years in good times and bad.",
      "Wendy Cutler, a former U.S. trade official who is now vice president at the Asia Society Policy Institute, says the court's decision \"throws the president\u2019s trade policy into turmoil.\u201d",
      "\u201cPartners negotiating hard during the 90-day day tariff pause period may be tempted to hold off making further concessions to the U.S. until there is more legal clarity,\" she said.",
      "Likewise, companies will have to reassess the way they run their supply chains, perhaps speeding up shipments to the United States to offset the risk that the tariffs will be reinstated on appeal.",
      "The trade court noted that Trump retains more limited power to impose tariffs to address trade deficits under another statute, the Trade Act of 1974. But that law restricts tariffs to 15% and only for 150 days with countries with which the United States runs big trade deficits.",
      "For now, the trade court's ruling \u201cdestroys the Trump administration\u2019s rationale for using federal emergency powers to impose tariffs, which oversteps congressional authority and contravenes any notion of due process,\u201d said Eswar Prasad, professor of trade policy at Cornell University. \"The ruling makes it clear that the broad tariffs imposed unilaterally by Trump represent an overreach of executive power.''",

      "SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea\u2019s presidential race has devolved into personal attacks and petty disputes, drowning out meaningful policy debate after former conservative leader Yoon Suk Yeol\u2019s ouster over his martial law fiasco.",
      "The bitter mudslinging between liberal frontrunner Lee Jae-myung and conservative opponent Kim Moon Soo escalated during Tuesday night\u2019s final presidential debate, with Lee branding Kim \u201cYoon Suk Yeol\u2019s avatar\u201d and Kim denouncing Lee as a \u201charbinger of monster politics and dictatorship.\"",
      "Here is a look at the words and controversies that have roiled the presidential contest as two days of early voting begins Thursday ahead of the June 3 election:",
      "Consistently trailing Lee in opinion polls, Kim has focused on dredging up his legal troubles and casting the outspoken Democratic Party candidate as a dangerous, hardline populist whose economic promises are detached from reality.",
      "For days, Kim\u2019s camp has seized on what appeared to be a casual comment by Lee about the profitability of running coffee shops during a May 16 campaign rally in Gunsan city.",
      "Lee was touting his past policy as Gyeonggi Province governor in 2019, when he relocated unlicensed food vendors from the province's popular mountain streams to clean up and revitalize tourist areas.",
      "Lee said he offered to help vendors transition to legitimate businesses and suggested it would be far more profitable to sell coffee than their labor-intensive chicken porridge. Lee said he noted that a cup of coffee could sell for 8,000 to 10,000 won ($5.8 to $7.3), while the raw cost of beans was just 120 won (9 cents).",
      "The remarks quickly struck a nerve in a country where the rapid spread of small coffee shops has come to symbolize the struggles of the self-employed in a decaying job market.",
      "Kim's People Power Party accused Lee of \u201cdriving a nail into the hearts of small business owners\u201d by portraying coffee shops as profiteering and said he misunderstood the factors behind retail pricing.",
      "Lee accused the conservatives of distorting his remarks, saying he was simply explaining how he had helped vendors operate in a better environment.",
      "Kim's avoidance of direct criticism of Yoon over his martial law decree has been a major source of Lee's political offensive against him.",
      "When Yoon appeared May 21 to view a documentary film justifying his martial law decree and raising unfounded claims about how the liberals benefited from election fraud, some PPP members lamented he was practically campaigning for Lee.",
      "Kim, formerly Yoon's labor minister, only said he would do his best as president to eliminate suspicions of alleged election fraud.",
      "Kim also has not offered any notable reaction to various scandals surrounding Yoon's wife, Kim Keon Hee.",
      "Prosecutors in Seoul are investigating fresh allegations that the former first lady received luxury gifts, including two Chanel bags, from a Unification Church official seeking business favors after Yoon took office in 2022.",
      "She previously faced several other allegations including receiving a Dior bag from a Korean American pastor and involvement in a stock price manipulation scheme.",
      "During the presidential debate, Lee claimed Yoon would return as a \u201cshadow ruler\u201d behind Kim, and Kim skirted Lee's question about whether he would pardon Yoon.",
      "The \u201croom salon\u201d is a long-standing symbol of South Korea\u2019s male-oriented nightlife culture. The expensive, private karaoke bar where hostesses drink and sing with male customers abruptly emerged as a hot election issue.",
      "Lee\u2019s party alleged a judge handling Yoon\u2019s rebellion trial visited one of the bars in affluent southern Seoul last year with two unidentified people. It said his companions paid the bill and they were likely linked to his work as a judge, representing a conflict of interest.",
      "The judge, Jee Kui-youn, has been at the center of bipartisan wrangling since he approved Yoon\u2019s release from prison in March and allowed him to stand his trial without physical detention.",
      "\u201cWe should strip him of his judge robe,\" party spokesperson Noh Jongmyun said. \"Isn\u2019t it preposterous for him to serve as chief judge for the rebellion trial where the fate of Korea\u2019s democracy lies?\u201d",
      "Jee denied the allegations, saying that like many ordinary people he enjoys \u201csamgyeopsal,\u201d grilled pork bellies, and \u201csomaek,\u201d shots mixing beer and the traditional Korean liquor soju.",
      "Conservative critics accuse the Democratic Party of trying to tame the judiciary branch as Lee faces five criminal trials over corruption and other allegations.",
      "South Korea does not hold a second round of runoff elections. Subsequently, when there is a clear frontrunner it is common for two remaining rivals to launch a unified campaign in which one withdraws and supports the other in exchange for a high-profile role in the government.",
      "With Lee maintaining a solid lead, this year\u2019s race saw a similar maneuver among conservatives, but the extremely chaotic, undemocratic manner failed and hurt Kim's campaign.",
      "Believing Han Duck-soo, Yoon\u2019s former prime minister, had a better chance of defeating Lee, PPP leaders consisting primarily of Yoon loyalists held late night, emergency meetings to cancel Kim\u2019s nomination and push a candidacy by Han, an independent. The attempt was rejected the next day in a vote by party members.",
      "Kim called the move \u201can overnight political coup\" and later made efforts to align with Lee Joon-seok, the candidate of the smaller conservative party. Lee has flatly rejected the overture.",

    "story": [
      "Mining company Signal Peak Energy sits atop a billion-ton coal reserve beneath Montana\u2019s rugged Bull Mountains and ships 98% of the fuel it mines to Japan and South Korea",
      "ROUNDUP, Mont. -- Former ranch hand Pat Thiele has spent years fighting a losing battle against a massive coal mine creeping underground toward his central Montana property.",
      "Mine owner Signal Peak Energy sits atop a billion-ton reserve of coal in the Bull Mountains, not far from where Thiele lives. The mine has long seemed poised to benefit from President Donald Trump's pledges to revive the faltering coal industry \u2014 vows the president has renewed vigorously in his second term with new orders to deregulate mining. A Republican tax cut bill making its way through Congress contains a special carve-out provision allowing the mine to expand.",
      "But Thiele and his neighbors see a glimmer of hope in another Trump initiative, his \u201cAmerica first\u201d approach to global trade. The Signal Peak mine sends 98% of the minerals it unearths to Japan and South Korea. If tariffs spark a trade war, they think it could inadvertently scuttle the mine's expansion plans \u2014 an effort their legal challenges have so far only managed to slow.",
      "In effect, an escalating trade war could undermine Trump's goal of saving coal.",
      "\u201cAs long as they\u2019ve got somebody to buy it, they\u2019ll keep mining,\u201d said Thiele. \u201cBut a reaction could conceivably come from Japan and South Korea saying, \u2018Well, if you\u2019re going to tariff our shipbuilding or our products, fine, we\u2019re not buying your damn coal.\u2019\u201d",
      "Thiele, 77, assessed the situation as he stood atop a hillside charred by a wildfire. The former Army Ranger who served two combat tours in Vietnam took in a commanding view of the valley below, where his small herd of cattle grazed.",
      "He's a political outlier in rural Musselshell County, Montana, where mining has been a bedrock of the economy for more than a century. It stands to benefit more than most places from Trump's efforts, which for the most part have only slowed coal's demise.",
      "Eighty-five percent of Musselshell voters backed Trump in the 2024 presidential election. They viewed his victory as a reprieve from former President Joe Biden\u2019s anti-coal policies, said Musselshell County Commission Chairman Robert Pancratz.",
      "But worries tariffs could undermine coal's comeback aren't confined to Trump's opponents.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re thrilled that he\u2019s for coal,\u201d Pancratz said, \u201cand I believe in principle what he is trying to do with the tariffs is to make for more equitable trade.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut there may be some fall-out, you know, unintended consequences of all these things.\"",
      "Many fear the impact a trade war could have on the local economy. Experts say that's a legitimate worry.",
      "Coal analyst Seth Feaster said the implications for Signal Peak and other U.S. miners could cut two ways: Countries that don\u2019t reach a deal on tariffs could retaliate against U.S. exports, reducing demand for its coal. Or countries like South Korea and Japan could be willing to use energy supplies as leverage to reach an agreement, cementing their status as markets for western coal.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear the administration is very coal-forward and will use energy as a negotiating tool in whatever trade agreements it\u2019s trying to establish,\u201d Feaster said.",
      "The bulk of U.S coal mined to use as power plant fuel comes from a handful of huge pit mines in the Powder River Basin of northeastern Wyoming and southeastern Montana. Wyoming Gov. Mark Gordon, a Republican, pitched the state\u2019s coal on a recent trade trip to Japan and Taiwan.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s probably a bit of a long shot, but if we don\u2019t try, there won\u2019t be any opportunity at all. And I do think that both countries have come to the realization that they can\u2019t be 100% renewable,\u201d Gordon said.",
      "Signal Peak has almost 300 workers, making it a major employer in the region. Taxes and other payments by the company account for about a third of Musselshell County\u2019s revenue.",
      "Several years ago, the mine was the subject of a broad corruption investigation that led to convictions of former mine employees and associates for embezzlement, tax evasion, bank fraud, money laundering, drug trafficking and firearms violations.

      "Global coal production reached an all-time high last year, approaching roughly 10 billion tons (more than 9 billion metric tons) and dampening international efforts to curb emissions from burning a fuel that scientists say is a major contributor to global warming. Much of that growth was driven by Asia, where new coal plants keep springing up to power expanding economies.",
      "The U.S. coal industry, meanwhile, has been on an almost two-decade decline as more domestic utilities switch to cleaner fuels. That means exports account for a growing share of revenue. They topped 100 million tons last year after previously peaking under former President Barack Obama.",
      "Even if tariffs don\u2019t hurt U.S. miners, efforts by U.S. coal companies to capitalize on international demand have long been hindered by a lack of access to West Coast ports. Hauling it hundreds of miles by rail, then across the Pacific Ocean, drives up the cost of exporting coal.",
      "\u201cMost of it\u2019s pure geography. The coal, there\u2019s no problem with selling the coal, but the problem is you\u2019ve got, you know, a thousand miles of rail to get it to the nearest port,\u201d said Andrew Blumenfeld, a coal industry analyst at McCloskey by OPIS.",

      "The problems that disrupted flights at New Jersey's largest airport this spring could be repeated anywhere across the country, so Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy is trying to sell Congress on his plan to overhaul the nation's air traffic control system that will cost \u201ctens of billions.\u201d",
      "Duffy provided an update Wednesday on the repairs and staffing efforts that are underway to help eliminate the problems affecting Newark Liberty International Airport, which has been running more smoothly in the past few weeks since the airlines started to cut the number of flights they operate there.",
      "And Duffy emphasized that the Newark radar outages and air traffic control shortage are a prime example of why the antiquated system needs to be improved.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m concerned that we could have more Newarks. And again, why it\u2019s so important that we actually begin this build with the money that Congress is going to send us,\u201d he said.",
      "Duffy still wouldn't give a price tag of his expansive overhaul of the air traffic control system that he said is clearly needed after the deadly midair collision over Washington, D.C., in January that killed 67 people and all the problems affecting Newark this spring. But he said the $12.5 billion the House included President Donald Trump's massive bill won't be enough because \u201cit\u2019s going to be tens of billions of dollars.\u201d",
      "Duffy has been meeting privately with lawmakers since he unveiled the plan. But he said he wants to let Congress \u201cdo the dance the way the Congress dances\u201d to develop a plan to pay for the program.",
      "The problems that led to hundreds of cancellations and delays at Newark do seem to have improved since the Federal Aviation Administration limited the number of flights at the airport so they could handle it with the number of controllers available. The already short-staffed air traffic control facility in Philadelphia that directs planes in and out of Newark lost five controllers to trauma leave after the first radar and communications outage on April 28 and another one is out on medical leave.",
      "That left the facility with only 16 certified controllers and five supervisors. But Duffy said there are another 16 experienced controllers in training that he hopes will start to get certified between now and October.",
      "That is an example of how the FAA remains about 3,000 short on the number of air traffic controllers it wants, so Duffy has also tried to speed up the hiring and training process while offering incentives to keep experienced controllers from retiring early.",
      "The FAA has said that it expects to be able to bump up the number of flights daily in Newark to 34 arrivals and 34 departures once a runway construction project is completed in mid-June. That is also about the time that some of the controllers on a 45-day trauma leave might be scheduled to return. The FAA will revisit the limits in October because it hopes to have more controllers trained by then.",
      "The government also upgraded the software at the air traffic control facility after a second radar outage on May 9. That helped prevent a repeat problem on May 11.",
      "The FAA is also working on the telecommunications problems. Duffy said Verizon worked quickly to install a new fiber optic line between Philadelphia and New York over the past month, but the FAA wants to thoroughly test it out before switching over, so that likely won't be available until July. After that, the FAA plans to also improve the lines between New York and the Newark airport because some of them are still copper wires.",
      "\u201cClearly something wasn\u2019t going right when we experienced these outages,\u201d acting FAA administrator Chris Rocheleau said. \u201cRight now, part of this effort, part of this initiative, is to ensure we\u2019re acting with decisiveness, right \u2014 with focus \u2014 to make sure the lines get in, to make sure those redundancies are put in, to make sure the controllers have the tools they need to make the system safe, to operate safely.\u201d",
      "In the meantime, Duffy said it would be a good idea for pilots to brush up on their procedures of how to handle an outage because they can happen. In addition to the problems in Newark, controllers in Denver lost their radios for a couple minutes earlier this month. Duffy said there were also several other outages affecting Newark last year that didn't get public attention.",
      "\u201cWe have to look at the real world around us and some of the issues that come up and make sure we are brushed up and ready to go, should there be a brief outage,\" Duffy said. \"And again, that there\u2019s a lot of redundancy and a lot of procedures that keep people safe should this happen.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- Federal Reserve officials agreed earlier this month to hold off on any interest-rate moves while they evaluated the impact of President Donald Trump's tariffs on inflation, unemployment, and the broader economy.",

      "Their decision flew in the face of Trump's repeated calls to reduce borrowing costs because, in his view, there is \u201cNO INFLATION.\u201d The central bank, led by Chair Jerome Powell, cut its key rate three times last year to about 4.3%. Federal Reserve staff economists said during the meeting that inflation \u201cremained elevated,\u201d the minutes showed.",
      "Trump's tariffs have created a dilemma for the Fed because the duties could both raise inflation \u2014 which the Fed would typically fight with higher interest rates \u2014 and slow the economy and push up unemployment, which the central bank usually tries to counter with lower rates.",
      "Officials \u201cjudged that downside risks to employment and ... upside risks to inflation had risen, primarily reflecting the potential effects of tariff increases,\u201d the minutes said.",
      "Since the meeting, many officials have underscored that the Fed may have to wait for some time before making any further moves with interest rates.",
      "Policymakers said there was \u201cconsiderable uncertainty surrounding the evolution of trade policy\" and its impacts on the economy, the minutes said.",
      "\u201cTaken together, (officials) saw the uncertainty about their economic outlooks as unusually elevated,\u201d the minutes said.",
      "At the same time, at least some Fed officials expressed a range of concerns that tariffs would likely raise prices in the months ahead. Many policymakers said that their surveys and discussions with business leaders suggested that companies were likely to pass at least some or all of the cost of the extra duties on to consumers. Several of the officials said that companies not affected by the tariffs could seek to raise their prices if other companies did so.",
      "And the fact that the economy recently experienced the highest inflation in 40 years in 2022 suggested that companies might be more willing to raise prices than previously, when consumers had little experience of inflation, several officials said.",

The story was the same: any dresses from Europe would come with tariff-driven price increases ranging from $150 to $400.

An immediate concern is some of her paper goods. Her wedding planner has already flagged a 10% price increase for the menus, place cards and signage she wanted for her September celebration in Hawaii.",

For instance, flowers grown in Hawaii are in high demand, with increased prices to match, in response to 10% tariffs imposed on a large number of imports around the world. That includes flowers from Ecuador, Colombia and other countries that grow the bulk of the flowers the U.S. imports.",

There just aren\u2019t very many designers who create and put their whole looks together in this nation,\u201d said Christine Greenberg, founder and co-owner of the Urban Set Bride boutique in Richmond, Virginia.",

      "As if the impending arrival of your first child isn\u2019t stressful enough, you\u2019re undoubtedly shopping for a seemingly endless list of baby gear. Cribs, strollers, bottle warmers, sound machines and whatever the heck a MamaRoo is. You\u2019ll likely get most of that stuff from a baby registry. But the biggest baby gear item requires a more significant cash outlay: a new vehicle for your growing family.",
      "We can\u2019t help you pay for that, but we can point you toward five great SUVs of different sizes that all start for under $40,000. Edmunds\u2019 car experts focused on three qualities: 1) lots of space between the first and second-row seatbacks for bulky rear-facing infant safety seats; 2) big rear door openings to make it easy to get your newborn in and out; and 3) a roomy cargo area for all of your baby gear. The pricing below includes destination fees.",
      "Subcompact SUVs are not usually top choices for young families because of their limited space for cargo and child safety seats. The Volkswagen Taos is an exception. It\u2019s one of the roomiest models in its class and even rivals a Mazda CX-5 for all-around baby-toting usefulness. Got a rear-facing infant seat, or even a convertible seat, combined with a stroller and a travel crib? No problem \u2014 they\u2019ll all likely fit without having to slide the front seats far forward. The 2025 Taos also receives some welcome improvements such as an updated interior with a bigger center touchscreen and a more powerful engine that gets up to an EPA-estimated 31 mpg combined.",

      "The Niro is available as a hybrid, plug-in hybrid and all-electric vehicle. The hybrid comes oh-so-close to matching the Toyota Prius\u2019 fuel economy by getting up to an EPA-estimated 53 mpg combined. It also costs less than the Prius and has a more spacious back seat. The cargo area is nice-sized too. There are a lot of hybrid-powered SUVs available and the Niro is one of the least expensive. The plug-in version and the Niro Electric are considerably more expensive than the regular Niro hybrid, but otherwise they share the same family-friendly utility.",

      "The CR-V has long been a go-to choice for parents and rightfully so. It\u2019s an Insurance Institute for Highway Safety Top Safety Pick. It has a vast back seat, so you won\u2019t likely have to move the front seats up to accommodate the infant car seat in any of the rear positions. The CR-V\u2019s rear door openings are huge, and cargo space is among the roomiest you\u2019ll find for a compact SUV. The entry-level versions of the CR-V come with a 190-horsepower engine, while the more expensive trims have a 204-horsepower hybrid powertrain that gets up to an EPA-estimated 40 mpg combined.",

The cargo area is also of a decent size, though ultimately you\u2019ll find more in the CR-V and other compact SUVs. Its electric vehicle credentials are also excellent. It traveled 356 miles on a full charge in the independent Edmunds EV Range Test and has enough power to zip around town without issue. Basically, the Equinox EV is a great family-friendly SUV, and a great EV, at a reasonable price.",

That\u2019s good for future-proofing and just generally handy for those times when you\u2019re going out to dinner with the grandparents and want to take just one vehicle. The Santa Fe isn\u2019t quite as large as Hyundai\u2019s Palisade, but it\u2019s roomy enough for new families and is less expensive.

      "Heysel Stadium in Brussels was staging the European Cup final between Juventus and Liverpool exactly 40 years ago.",
      "Crowd disorder culminated in a surge by Liverpool fans into an adjacent stand containing mostly Juventus supporters. In the ensuing chaos, some were trampled or suffocated to death as they tried to flee and others died when a retaining wall collapsed.",
      "A total of 39 people \u2014 32 from Italy, four from Belgium, two from France and one from Northern Ireland \u2014 died and around 600 were injured in events that took place in real time on international television.",
      "On the 40th anniversary of the Heysel disaster, here\u2019s a look at what exactly happened and the consequences of one of soccer\u2019s darkest days.",
      "English soccer was in a bad place in the mid-1980s, with racism and hooliganism damaging the reputation of fans in the game\u2019s birthplace. Just two weeks before Heysel, a 15-year-old boy died during fighting at a game between Birmingham and Leeds, and a fire that ripped through a wooden stand at Bradford killed 56 people. Two months earlier, some of the worst ever rioting occurred at an FA Cup game between Luton and Millwall.",
      "\u201cA slum sport played in slum stadiums and increasingly watched by slum people\u201d was how an editorial by The Sunday Times summed up the state of English soccer ahead of Heysel.",
      "Liverpool fans might therefore have been viewed with suspicion as they poured into Brussels for the match against Juventus, but they were also suspicious themselves. A year earlier, at the 1984 European Cup final in Rome, Liverpool supporters were attacked by their Roma counterparts after the game.",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a case of revenge,\u201d Tony Evans, a Liverpool fan who was at Heysel at age 24, told The Associated Press, \u201cbut rather no ultra will ever do this to me again.\u201d",
      "Adding to the potential for catastrophe at the 1985 final was the condition of Heysel, a 55,000-capacity structure with outdated standing-room only stands, flimsy chicken-wire fences and crumbling walls inside and outside the stadium. There were too few police officers present, and organizers arranged for there to be a section for \u201cneutral\u201d fans beside one of the two stands holding Liverpool supporters at one end of the ground.",
      "Many Juve fans ended up getting tickets in the \u201cneutral\u201d section \u2014 and that's where the tragedy occurred.",
      "Evans attended the match with family and friends and remembers the level of drunkenness among Liverpool fans was unlike anything he\u2019d seen.",
      "\u201cPeople were out of control everywhere,\u201d he told the AP. \u201cWhen you got to the ground, people were kicking holes in the wall to climb in. By then, the atmosphere had deteriorated and there were wild rumors going round that Liverpool fans had been stabbed and one had been hung.\u201d",
      "Evans, who has written about Heysel in two books, \u201cFar Foreign Land\u201d and \u201cTwo Tribes,\u201d recalls the Liverpool section being so overcrowded that fans were already spilling through a collapsed barrier into the \u201cneutral\u201d section.",
      "Fans were seen throwing beer cans and chunks of concrete torn from the stands.",
      "What ultimately set off a fatal surge by Liverpool fans, Evans said, was flares being set off.",
      "\u201cThat seemed to spark a huge panic, a charge down the front,\u201d he said.",
      "Those fleeing the panic were crushed in the corner of the neutral section next to an old wall, which collapsed.",
      "Despite the chaos, organizers decided the final should be played, believing it would prevent further disorder between fans outside the stadium. Juventus won 1-0.",
      "Some 26 Liverpool fans were arrested and charged with manslaughter, 14 of whom were found guilty and given three-year prison sentences.",
      "Suspended prison sentences were handed to a Belgian Football Association official and a police chief.",
      "Heysel never hosted another major game. It was torn down in 1994 and replaced with King Baudouin Stadium.",
      "In terms of sporting sanctions, English clubs were banned from playing in European competition for five years. Liverpool received an indefinite suspension that ultimately lasted for six years.",
      "Heysel was \u201cthe low point for the English game\u201d that was hated by the British government \u201cfor its internationally shaming events,\u201d according to John Williams, an expert in the sociology of football at the University of Leicester.",
      "Fans voted with their feet, with crowds in the English league in the 1985-86 season plummeting to around 16 million \u2014 a post-war low \u2014 when they had once been two and a half times that, Williams said.",
      "Yet Williams said Heysel started the process of reflection among English soccer fans that something needed to change. Within a decade \u2014 and turbo-charged by another stadium tragedy when Liverpool fans were crushed at an FA Cup match at Hillsborough, leading to the death of 97 people \u2014 the English game would have all-seater stadiums, CCTV, stronger powers for the police, an alcohol ban inside grounds, a national organization of fans, the Premier League and be the envy of the rest of Europe.",
      "\u201cIronically, in many ways it was England that benefitted most from Heysel in the long run, more than for the Italians and others in Europe,\u201d Williams said.",
      "He referred to what authorities abroad call the \u201cEnglish miracle \u2014 the managing of fans competently with stewards rather than police and the generally very low levels of disorder in new elite modern stadia.\u201d",
      "For Evans, fans took a deep breath and stepped away from \u201cthe abyss.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt was a natural development by the people who watched the game and realized if this sort of behavior that had characterized the first half of the 1980s continued, football would be dead within a decade,\u201d Evans said. \u201cEveryone says Hillsborough was the determining factor, but the reality is the tides of history had changed four years before.\u201d",
      "Liverpool and Juventus were unveiling memorials on Thursday in honor of the Heysel victims to mark the 40th anniversary.",
      "For Liverpool, the occasion would be even more poignant coming just days after a minivan plowed into dozens of fans during the team\u2019s latest Premier League victory parade.",

      "ANAHEIM, Calif. -- Aaron Judge and the New York Yankees will have a good head of steam as they bus 30 miles up the 5 Freeway for their World Series rematch against the Los Angeles Dodgers this weekend.",
      "New York's 1-0 victory over the Los Angeles Angels on Wednesday night gave the AL East leaders 16 wins in 20 games.",
      "Clarke Schmidt continued a six-week stretch of superb starting pitching with six shutout innings, and Anthony Volpe drove in the only run with a first-inning sacrifice fly as the Yankees (35-20) completed a three-game sweep and sent the Angels (25-30) to their fifth straight loss.",
      "A Yankees rotation that lost ace Gerrit Cole to season-ending elbow surgery and has two other starters \u2014 Luis Gil and Marcus Stroman \u2014 on the injured list has a major league-best 2.54 ERA over the last 40 games and has limited opponents to one run or less in 22 of those starts.",
      "Left-hander Ryan Yarbrough allowed one run and two hits in six innings of Monday night\u2019s 5-1 win over the Angels, left-hander Carlos Rodon gave up five hits in seven scoreless innings of Tuesday\u2019s 3-2 win, and Schmidt, a right-hander, gave up four hits in his six shutout innings Wednesday night.",
      "Left-hander Max Fried, who is 7-0 with a 1.29 ERA in 11 starts, will pitch Friday night\u2019s series opener against the Dodgers, and right-hander Will Warren, who is 3-2 with a 4.09 ERA in 11 starts, is scheduled to pitch Saturday.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ve given us a chance to win every single night,\u201d said Yankees reliever Mark Leiter Jr., who notched his second save with a scoreless ninth inning Wednesday night.",
      "\u201cEach guy is going out there and doing it a little different way, putting their own spin on it, which is great for us, because it gives them a different look for six or seven innings, and we get to do our thing with a different look for the last couple innings. You\u2019re only as good as your starting pitching, generally, and they\u2019ve been great.\u201d",
      "The NL West-leading Dodgers (34-22) have three frontline starters \u2014 Blake Snell, Tyler Glasnow and Roki Sasaki \u2014 and four high-leverage relievers \u2014 Blake Treinen, Evan Phillips, Michael Kopech and Kirby Yates \u2014 on the injured list.",
      "But they still have plenty of star power, with Shohei Ohtani, Mookie Betts and Freddie Freeman, who have combined to win five MVP awards, plus Teoscar Hern\u00e1ndez and Will Smith at the top of their lineup.",
      "\u201cYeah, it will feel big,\u201d Yankees manager Aaron Boone said of the matchup. \u201cNow, we won\u2019t go in treating it any differently, but we played the Subway Series (against the New York Mets) last week, and there was a lot of hype for that. I think these are good things for our guys to play in and experience.\u201d",
      "The series will feature two of the best players in baseball in Judge and Ohtani, both coming off an MVP season.",
      "Judge, who has won two American League MVPs, leads the AL in batting average (.391), on-base percentage (.488), slugging percentage (.739), OPS (1.227) and hits (81). He is tied for third in the majors in home runs (18) and ranks fourth in RBIs (47).",
      "Ohtani, who has won three MVPs \u2014 his first two with the Angels in 2021 and 2023 \u2014 leads the major leagues with 20 homers and 59 runs and ranks third in OPS (1.042). He produced baseball\u2019s first 50-50 season with 54 homers and 59 stolen bases in 2024.",
      "The two-way star, who has a 38-19 record and 3.01 ERA in 86 starts over five seasons but did not pitch while recovering from Tommy John surgery in 2024, is also on track to return to the mound sometime after the All-Star break.",
      "\u201cI think Judge has been the best hitter in the sport now for a number of years, but what Shohei does with his speed and, when he\u2019s healthy, being an ace on the mound, and his ability to swing the bat \u2026 we haven\u2019t seen that,\u201d Boone said.",
      "\u201cOhtani, when you add in the pitching element, is just so unique, like nothing we\u2019ve ever seen in this game.\u201d",
      "Freeman, the Dodgers first baseman, hit four homers, including a walk-off grand slam in the 10th inning of Game 1, and drove in 12 runs to earn World Series MVP honors last October.",
      "Freeman\u2019s two-run single also keyed a five-run rally in the fifth inning that helped the Dodgers overcome a 5-0 deficit in their series-clinching 7-6 victory in Game 5 at Yankee Stadium.",
      "The Dodgers held Ohtani to two hits in 19 at-bats (.105) and no RBIs in the World Series, but he played the final three games with a dislocated left shoulder that was surgically repaired after the season.",
      "\u201cYou have to execute (pitches) at a high level against him, or we\u2019re backing up bases or getting a new ball,\u201d Boone said. \u201cWe did a pretty good job against him in the World Series last year, but he\u2019s also hit some big homers against us.\u201d",
      "The Yankees will have a Dodgers nemesis that they didn\u2019t have last October in veteran first baseman Paul Goldschmidt, who signed a one-year, $12.5 million deal last winter and is batting .347 with an .899 OPS, five homers and 27 RBIs in his first 55 games with the Yankees.",
      "A former Arizona Diamondbacks and St. Louis Cardinals slugger, Goldschmidt has a .283 average, .872 OPS, 35 homers and 109 RBIs in 163 career games against the Dodgers and a .308 average, .928 OPS, 19 homers and 50 RBIs in 77 games in Dodger Stadium.",
      "\u201cI would say he\u2019s more than an X-factor,\u201d Boone said of Goldschmidt, who led off Wednesday night\u2019s game with a double and scored on Volpe\u2019s sacrifice fly. \u201cHe\u2019s one of our dudes.\u201d",

      "FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. -- Lionel Messi scored twice and had an assist, and Inter Miami broke out of its slump with a 4-2 victory over Montreal on Wednesday night.",
      "Messi scored in the 27th and 87th minutes and set up Luis Su\u00e1rez's goal with some nice dribbling in the 68th. Su\u00e1rez added another in the 71st.",
      "The win gave Messi's Inter Miami team just its second victory in its past eight matches. Miami last won on May 3, going 0-2-2 since then and dropping to sixth in the Eastern Conference.",
      "It has been a surprising plunge for a team that went 22-4-8 during the regular season in 2024 to set MLS records for points (74) and winning percentage (.765) and captured the Supporters Shield \u2014 so puzzling that Messi spoke recently of the group's need to stick together despite the difficulties.",
      "His pep talk seemed to work.",
      "In its last match, Miami rallied from a two-goal deficit to tie Philadelphia, which leads MLS with 10 wins this season. And that momentum carried over against Montreal, which is last in the Eastern Conference with only one win.",
      "\u201cWe know in what situation we are (in),\u201d said Miami coach Javier Mascherano. \u201cSometimes you have to analyze not just the result, you have to analyze the game, how we play. I think in some games we didn\u2019t get the result that we wanted. We deserved it a little bit more, but in (soccer), you don\u2019t deserve, you have to do.\u201d",
      "Messi's first goal on Wednesday was set up by Sergio Busquets, who delivered a pass to his former Barcelona teammate and set the screen that freed up Messi for his seventh goal of the MLS season.",
      "Messi then linked up with Su\u00e1rez to give Miami a two-goal cushion midway through the second half, and iced the win on a pass from Su\u00e1rez just before the end of regulation.",
      "It was a much-needed goal for Su\u00e1rez, who finished last season tied for the second-most goals in MLS with 20, but had just two entering Wednesday's match.",
      "It was also the offensive performance Miami needed before it begins Club World Cup play. The Herons have another MLS match at home on Saturday against Columbus before their first contest of the tournament against Al Ahly of Egypt on June 14.",
      "Miami could be without three defenders on Saturday, including veteran left back Jordi Alba, who went down with a lower-body injury in the first half. Mascherano said the team would need to gather more information to find out the extent of the injury.",
      "Gonzalo Luja\u0301n and Toto Aviles also left with lower-body injuries.",
      "Miami allowed two late Montreal goals by Dante Sealy and Victor Loturi, both lapses that Mascherano was not happy about.",

      "HOUSTON -- Zach Dezenzo homered and Victor Caratini drove in two runs in the seventh to help the Houston Astros rally for a 5-3 victory over the Athletics on Wednesday.",
      "The Athletics led by 1 when rookie Justin Sterner (1-1) took over for Luis Severino to start the seventh. Dezenzo sent his fourth pitch 416 feet to center field for his second homer this season to tie it at 3-all.",
      "There were runners on second and third with two outs in the inning when Caratini lined a single to center field to score 2 and put the Astros on top 5-3.",
      "Houston\u2019s Lance McCullers Jr. allowed five hits and three runs in a season-long six innings in his fifth start after missing more than two seasons with injuries.",
      "Shawn Dubin (2-0) struck out two in a scoreless seventh for the win and Josh Hader converted his 14th save in 14 opportunities with a scoreless ninth.",
      "Jacob Wilson homered with two RBIs for the Athletics, who fell to 3-17 in their last 20 games.",
      "Severino yielded three hits and two runs \u2014 one earned \u2014 in six innings. He struck out four to give him 1,003 strikeouts in his career, making him the 48th active player to reach 1,000 strikeouts.",
      "Christian Walker was hit on the hand with a pitch to start Houston\u2019s fourth. He left in the bottom of the sixth inning because of the hit and the team said more information on his condition would be provided postgame.",
      "The Astros jumping on Sterner in the seventh to take the lead after Severino\u2019s strong start kept them in check through six.",
      "McCullers struck out 12 to tie a career high he last reached in 2018.",
      "LHP Jacob Lopez (0-2, 2.57 ERA) will start for Oakland on Thursday night in the opener of a four-game series at Toronto. The Astros open a four-game series against Tampa Bay on Thursday night with RHP Ryan Gusto (3-2, 4.58) on the mound against RHP Shane Baz (4-3, 4.94).",

    "story": [
      "Jayden Daniels is in his second spring of NFL offseason workouts with the same coach and offense from his successful rookie year for the Washington Commanders",
      "ASHBURN, Va. -- Jayden Daniels evades the topic as if he's an oncoming pass rusher and ducks away from the questions as if he's avoiding a sack.",
      "It sure looks as if the Washington Commanders' franchise quarterback has bulked up, adding some muscle after his AP Offensive Rookie of the Year season. He just won't say how much and insists it was not a particular mission of his.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s up for grabs \u2014 I don\u2019t know,\" Daniels said Wednesday after an offseason practice session. \"I was just working out. It wasn\u2019t about this amount or much. Just go out there, have a plan and naturally just put on weight.\u201d",
      "Daniels is happy to let others talk about his weight, and that extends to his teammates and coaches. They notice, chalking it up to him being a competitor looking to gain another edge.",
      "Kliff Kingsbury, back for a second season as offensive coordinator, has not seen what Daniels is lifting but observes the 24-year-old looking a little thicker.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s still pretty lean, but he\u2019s definitely worked really hard at his fitness and the weight room,\" Kingsbury said. \"He knows what he has to do to protect himself and where he feels comfortable playing. But the arm strength: He looks better, and you can tell he\u2019s stronger. There\u2019s no doubt.\u201d",
      "That wasn't a message from the coaching staff coming off Daniels leading the way in Washington exceeding all expectations to make the playoffs and go on an improbable run to the NFC championship game. Kingsbury wanted Daniels to get some rest rather than rush back into preparing for his second professional season.",
      "Easier said than done. A year since being the second pick in the draft and going through an entirely new process, he took some time to reflect and adjusted his priorities.",
      "\u201cYou just have so much time and freedom to kind of do what you want,\" Daniels said. \"It was difficult trying to navigate that, but you on lean on people closest to you and obviously you\u2019ve got to keep the end goal in mind. You\u2019re trying to get better each and every day, and you\u2019re trying to progress each and every season, each and every month and snap.\u201d",
      "Part of getting better was absolutely getting some more upper-body heft \u2014 especially given Daniels' penchant to escape the pocket and run for big gains and given reigning Super Bowl champion Philadelphia, Dallas and the New York Giants have no shortage of bruising defenders ready to hit him.",
      "\u201cPut on a little muscle, huh?\" center Tyler Biadasz said. \u201cFor sure. He said what he was going to do, and he did it.\"",
      "Daniels upon arriving in Washington developed the reputation as a player who arrives early to the team facility and stays late. No one around the Commanders anticipates that will change now that he may be a few pounds heavier.",
      "\u201cI haven\u2019t gotten like side by side in the mirror or anything, but he\u2019s doing great,\" coach Dan Quinn said. \u201cYou can sense when people are going for it, and he\u2019s certainly one that is. ... There is no flinch in Jayden Daniels. He is as focused and relentless as you could (be) about getting better.\u201d",
      "Trade pickup Deebo Samuel was in attendance for organized team activities Wednesday, but fellow wide receiver Terry McLaurin was not around for the voluntary stage of offseason workouts after taking part in mandatory sessions recently. Left tackle Laremy Tunsil and cornerback Marshon Lattimore were also absent.",
      "McLaurin's camp is believed to be discussing a new contract with general manager Adam Peters. McLaurin, who turns 30 in September, is only signed through next season.",
      "\u201cI understand the business side of the things, and when he stopped coming I understand his side of the story,\" Samuel said. \u201cI just not try to get bothered with it and just let him deal with it on his own and just kind of handle it on his own.\u201d",
      "Quinn said he has been in touch with every player, plus Peters to see if there are any extension updates.",
      "\u201cThose guys have been excellent in terms of the communication with me,\u201d Quinn said. \"I can speak to Terry, specifically: He\u2019s having a great offseason.\u201d",
      "No one seems to be worried about McLaurin. Certainly not his QB.",
      "\u201cMe and Terry got a good relationship outside of football,\" Daniels said. \"He\u2019s got to handle what he has to handle, but that doesn\u2019t change anything with the fact that he\u2019s a part of our brotherhood. We know Terry\u2019s working and everything, so we got to get better and he knows he\u2019s got to get better each and every day.\u201d",

      "Tyreek Hill said he has to prove to the Miami Dolphins that they can depend on him as a committed leader after his comments at the end of last season indicating that he wants to play somewhere else",
      "MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. -- Tyreek Hill isn't expecting his Miami Dolphins teammates to vote him team captain again.",
      "Not after how last season ended \u2014 when the veteran wide receiver took himself out of the Dolphins' regular-season finale against the New York Jets with no reported injury and hinted at wanting out of Miami afterward.",
      "Hill has since diminished those actions as more frustration with a poor season than any serious desire to play elsewhere. Entering his fourth season in Miami, he's aiming to show the Dolphins that he's still a leader they can depend on.",
      "\u201cI've got to prove myself,\u201d Hill said after Wednesday's session of organized team activities. \u201cThis OTAs, training camp, I got to prove myself. I've got to show up different. The mindset\u2019s got to be different.\"",
      "Hill added he doesn't feel as if he deserves being selected team captain \u2014 he's been one each of his previous three years \u2014 but \u201cif I didn\u2019t get it, I wouldn\u2019t dwell on it. I wouldn\u2019t sweat it ... because I put myself in that position.\u201d",
      "Hill has spent the offseason recovering from two wrist procedures. His right wrist was heavily taped Wednesday \u2014 the one he had surgery on earlier this year to repair ligament damage after playing through the injury the entire 2024 season.",
      "Hill did not participate in 7-on-7 drills during Miami's first OTA practice that was open to reporters, but he did some individual work on the practice field and cheered on teammates during drills.",
      "Afterward, he said he's in a \u201cbetter spot\u201d than he was last season and was feeling zero pain. He's expected to resume catching passes by training camp.",
      "\u201cTyreek's done a great job of being proactive of when he got the surgery done,\u201d coach Mike McDaniel said Wednesday, \u201cand then making sure that he is able to do as much as he can with the team, which has very much included his daily participation in how he attacks all of our strength program. ... As we train his way back into recovery of that hand, then he'll start catching the ball.\u201d",
      "Hill was noticeably leaner when he spoke on Wednesday. He said he weighs 183 pounds now, down from around 197 when he first got to Miami.",
      "\u201cObviously I can run with anybody, run by anybody,\u201d Hill said. \u201cBut I think having that endurance, having that ability to not get tired from third downs is very important. So I wanted to slim down and actually lose body fat.\u201d",
      "He repeated his goal of reaching 2,000 yards receiving, something he came close to in 2023 but wasn't able to achieve.",
      "Hill led the NFL with 1,799 yards receiving that season for Miami. His 112.4 yards per game and 13 receiving touchdowns also led the NFL.",
      "He came nowhere near replicating those numbers in 2024, finishing the season with 959 yards \u2014 his fewest since the 2019 season with Kansas City. And Miami's offense took a step back in part because injuries sidelined starting quarterback Tua Tagovailoa throughout the season.",
      "Frustrations boiled over for Hill in the final game. By the second half of an eventual loss, Hill was out of the game. Afterward, he said he intended to \"do what\u2019s best for me and my family. If that\u2019s here or wherever the case may be. I\u2019m (going to) open that door for myself.\u201d",
      "He's remained in headlines for different reasons since then, whether for chatter that he plans to race Olympian Noah Lyles, or recently because of a domestic dispute with his wife, who has since filed for divorce.",
      "Hill said he's used therapy and church to cope with the drama of the past few months, while trying to put the frustrations of last season behind him.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s tough, man, but at the same time, I've got to understand what I\u2019m trying to accomplish and what this team is trying to accomplish, too,\" Hill said. \"Because I want to be a part of something special. I want to win.\u201d",
      "The Dolphins are still pursuing trade options for All-Pro cornerback Jalen Ramsey after both sides agreed to part ways.",
      "Beyond that, McDaniel has little interest in discussing the details of what went wrong.",
      "\u201cQuite honestly. Zero has changed since the last time I said anything about him,\u201d McDaniel said Wednesday. \u201cI'm very much interested in the players that I'm coaching on the field today.\u201d",
      "Ramsey is due approximately $24 million in guaranteed money in 2025. The Dolphins would be in a better financial position if they wait until after June 1 to trade him, as it would clear about $10 million in cap space.",
      "Ramsey was not seen at OTAs on Wednesday, and the Dolphins aren't spending much time talking about his potential departure.",
      "\u201cJalen's my dog, but we're kind of focused on the guys in the room right now,\" cornerback Kader Kohou said. \"We don't talk about Jalen, we let the upstairs handle that situation.\u201d",

      "But Shadab took charge in the final four overs as Pakistan scored 51 off the last 23 balls before Shadab holed out at mid-on off the penultimate ball.",

      "NEW YORK -- The Indiana Pacers need just one win to reach the NBA Finals and they already have two of them at Madison Square Garden in this series.",
      "They can finish off the New York Knicks quickly, just like they play. But while the Pacers like their games fast, they were trying not to get ahead of themselves as they prepared for Game 5 of the Eastern Conference finals on Thursday night.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re still pretty young so we\u2019re learning by some of the experience that we\u2019re getting right now, but we\u2019ve got to stay in the moment,\u201d coach Rick Carlisle said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to keep our eye on the ball and go day to day and moment to moment here.\u201d",
      "Indiana opened a 3-1 lead with a 130-121 victory Tuesday behind Tyrese Haliburton, who had 32 points, 15 assists and 12 rebounds without a turnover, the first 30-15-10 game in the postseason with no turnovers since they were tracked beginning in 1977-78.",
      "The Pacers have three opportunities to reach the NBA Finals for the second time in franchise history. They fell to the Los Angeles Lakers in 2000 in their only time playing for the title.",
      "The No. 4 seed in the East looks ready for another chance. The Pacers are 11-3 in the postseason \u2014 unbeaten outside of losses in all three Game 3s \u2014 and they have won six straight road games, two shy of the NBA record within one postseason.",
      "They simply ran by the Knicks in Game 4, scoring 22 fast-break points, but Haliburton expects much more resistance when they try to win a series on New York's home floor for the second straight year.",
      "\u201cYou can feel good about it for the night, but then you\u2019ve got to be ready to go for Game 5 because their backs are against the wall,\u201d Haliburton said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to play as desperate as they can, as they should. They\u2019re going to come out and throw a punch and throw more punches and more punches, and we\u2019ve just got to be able to respond to those.\u201d",
      "The Knicks rallied from a 20-point deficit in Game 3, the third time in this postseason they have done that. Now they need to make a much different kind of comeback: the 14th in NBA history from a 3-1 deficit.",
      "\u201cI mean, we\u2019ve been a team that has kind of found a way to do the impossible when it always seemed impossible. We just keep fighting, so it\u2019s going to be a testament to our whole playoff run,\u201d Knicks center Karl-Anthony Towns said. \u201cNow we have to be in one of the biggest fights our lives and of our season, and it starts with next game.\u201d",
      "Coach Tom Thibodeau has tried a lineup change, inserting Mitchell Robinson to play alongside Towns in a double-big look. He has gone deeper into his bench than usual in search of the right combinations to slow down a Pacers team that has reached 130 points twice in this series after doing so in Game 7 of the East semifinals last year, when they shot an NBA playoff-record 67.1% from the field in a rout at MSG.",
      "The Knicks put themselves in bad positions by committing 17 turnovers in Game 4 that led to 20 points, but they also gave up easy baskets even when their defense was set. It left them with plenty to correct if they wanted to extend their first conference finals appearance since 2000 to a Game 6 in Indiana on Saturday.",
      "\u201cI've never known this team to quit,\" forward Josh Hart said. \u201cThat's not the character of the guys that we have in the locker room. So obviously our backs are against the wall, but we're competitors and we're going to bring it until the series is over.\u201d",

      "Coach Brian Daboll said Wednesday the team is simply being cautious with Nabers, who Daboll said has had an issue with the toe since his college days at LSU.",
      "\u201cMalik will be out here today, but he won\u2019t be participating,\u201d Daboll said before the Giants' second practice of organized team activities and first open to reporters. \u201cWe\u2019re being mindful of his toe that he\u2019s had. Nothing serious, but we\u2019re being smart with him in terms of the rehab part of it. So that\u2019s where we\u2019re at.\u201d",
      "Daboll didn't detail the nature of the injury, but said Nabers didn't need any procedures on his toe during the offseason.",
      "\u201cThey have a plan,\u201d Daboll said. \u201cOur doctors, our trainers, if you will, have a plan to kind of move him along and he\u2019s been doing a good job with that.\u201d",
      "Nabers was the sixth overall pick in the NFL draft last year after setting LSU's career record for yards receiving with 3,003 in three seasons. He followed that by catching an NFL rookie-record 109 passes for New York last season, setting the franchise mark for most receptions in a season. Nabers also tied former Giants star Odell Beckham Jr. for the NFL record for fewest games needed for 100 career catches, reaching the milestone in just 14 contests.",
      "He was able to accomplish that despite having an unsettled quarterback situation last season with Daniel Jones, Drew Lock and Tommy DeVito all starting games.",
      "Russell Wilson, signed to a one-year deal worth up to $21 million with $10.5 million guaranteed, is expected to be the starter this upcoming season. DeVito returns, but New York also signed veteran Jameis Winston and drafted former Mississippi star Jaxson Dart with the 25th overall pick.",
      "All four quarterbacks took snaps at practice, with mostly Wilson working with the starters. He threw a touchdown pass to Darius Slayton in 11-on-11 drills. Dart also took three snaps with the starters.",
      "It's uncertain when Nabers will get on the field to participate in practice with his new quarterbacks, but Daboll was not concerned.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s had it for a while, back in college, too,\u201d the coach said. \u201cSo just trying to be smart.\u201d",
      "Daboll said the Giants have \u201cgood attendance\u201d for OTAs, but said a few unnamed players had a stomach virus and were sitting out Wednesday. Left tackle Andrew Thomas (foot) is rehabilitating his injury, as is safety Anthony Johnson (shoulder).",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s May, so it\u2019s important that they progress so we can get them ready for training camp here,\u201d Daboll said. \u201cAnd if they\u2019re ready to go later on in this process, then they\u2019ll do what they can do.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "A push in Texas to ban children under 18 years old from social media platforms is fading at the state Capitol",
      "AUSTIN, Texas -- A push in Texas to ban social media accounts for children under 18 faded Thursday after lawmakers did not take a key vote on creating one of the nation's toughest restrictions aimed at keeping minors off platforms such as TikTok, Snapchat and Instagram.",
      "The bill, which already passed the GOP-controlled state House, aims to go further than a Florida social media ban for minors under 14. Australia banned social media accounts for anyone under 16.",
      "But earlier momentum behind the Texas measure slowed at the eleventh hour in the state Senate as lawmakers face a weekend deadline to send bills to Republican Gov. Greg Abbott. Abbott has not said publicly whether he supported the proposed ban, which was opposed by tech trade groups and critics who called it it an unconstitutional limit on free speech.",
      "\u201cThis bill was the best way to protect children in this state,\u201d state Rep. Jared Patterson, a Republican carrying the measure, said Wednesday.",
      "The legislative session ends Monday. That leaves a narrowing path for the proposal that, if passed, would set up another test of state efforts to set boundaries on how and when children can access social media.",
      "Many tech companies have established a presence in Texas, including X, which is owned by Elon Musk.",
      "Earlier this week, Abbott signed into law a separate measure requiring Apple and Google to verify the age of online app store users, as well as parental consent to download apps and make in-app purchases for users under 18. Utah passed a similar bill earlier this year.",
      "The proposed Texas ban aimed at minors is the latest move in a growing bipartisan push nationwide to address the impacts of social media on the well-being of children. Critics accuse platforms of using addictive functions to lure children onto their site and keep them there, and of not doing enough to curb violent or age-inappropriate content, or online abuse.",
      "Nearly half of American teenagers say they are online \u201cconstantly\u201d despite concerns about the effects of social media and smartphones on their mental health, according to a December 2024 report published by the Pew Research Center.",
      "The American Psychological Association has called on tech companies and lawmakers to protect children\u2019s mental health, arguing that social media platforms are \u201cparticularly risky\u201d to young people who cannot disengage from sites and struggle with impulse control.",
      "States and countries have passed various measures to address the problem, and some have run into legal challenges.",
      "A federal judge in 2024 temporarily blocked Utah\u2019s first-in-the-nation law requiring social media companies to check the ages of all users and place restrictions on accounts belonging to minors.",
      "California, which is home to some of the largest tech companies in the world, will make it illegal for social media platforms to knowingly provide addictive feeds to children without parental consent starting in 2027. And New York state allows parents to block their kids from getting social media posts suggested by a platform\u2019s algorithm.",

      "An alleged kidnapping in New York is the latest instance in which authorities say cryptocurrency-related crimes have involved real-world violence",
      "HARTFORD, Conn. -- A man says he was tortured for weeks in a New York townhouse. Another in Paris was held for ransom and his finger cut off. A couple in Connecticut were carjacked, beaten and thrown into a van.",
      "All, authorities allege, were victims tied to cryptocurrency-related crimes that have spilled out from behind computer screens and into the real world as the largely unregulated currency surges in value.",
      "While crypto thefts are not new, the use of physical violence is a far more recent trend, said John Griffin, a finance professor at the University of Texas in Austin who tracks financial crimes.",
      "\u201cI think this kind of physical violence is a natural manifestation of the emboldened nature of crypto activities,\u201d he said. \u201cThings that might clearly be outside of social norms in other spaces \u2014 like robbing a bank \u2014 are somehow just part of the game here.\u201d",
      "In the New York case, two American crypto investors \u2014 John Woeltz and William Duplessie \u2014 have been arrested on kidnapping and assault charges in recent days after a 28-year-old Italian man told police they tortured him for weeks to get his Bitcoin password. Attorneys for both men declined to comment.",
      "While the allegations are still emerging, they come just weeks after 13 people were indicted on federal charges in Washington, D.C., accused of combining computer hacking and money laundering with old-fashioned impersonation and burglary to steal more than $260 million from victims\u2019 cryptocurrency accounts.",
      "Some are accused of hacking websites and servers to steal cryptocurrency databases and identify targets, but others are alleged to have broken into victims\u2019 homes to steal their \u201chardware wallets\u201d \u2014 devices that provide access to their crypto accounts.",
      "The case stemmed from an investigation that started after a couple in Connecticut last year were forced out of a Lamborghini SUV, assaulted and bound in the back of a van. Authorities allege the incident was a ransom plot targeting the couple\u2019s son \u2014 who they say helped steal more than $240 million worth of Bitcoin from a single victim. The son has not been charged, but is being detained on an unspecified \u201cfederal misdemeanor offense\u201d charge, according to online jail records. Police stopped the carjacking and arrested six men.",
      "Meanwhile in France, kidnappings of wealthy cryptocurrency holders and their relatives in ransom plots have spooked the industry.",
      "Attackers recently kidnapped the father of a crypto entrepreneur while he was out walking his dog, and sent videos to the son including one showing the dad's finger being severed as they demanded millions of euros in ransom, prosecutors allege. Police freed the father and arrested several suspects.",
      "Earlier this year, men in masks attempted to drag the daughter of Pierre Noizat, the CEO and a founder of the Bitcoin exchange platform Paymium, into a van, but were thwarted by a shopkeeper armed with a fire extinguisher.",
      "And in January, the co-founder of French crypto-wallet firm Ledger, David Balland, and his wife were also kidnapped for ransom from their home in the region of Cher of central France. They also were rescued by police and 10 people were arrested.",
      "The FBI recently released its 2024 internet crime report that tallied nearly 860,000 complaints of suspected internet crime and a record $16.6 billion in reported losses \u2014 a 33% increase in losses compared with 2023.",
      "As a group, cryptocurrency theft victims reported the most losses \u2014 more than $6.5 billion",
      "The agency and experts say the crypto crime underworld is likely being fueled by the large amounts of money at stake \u2013 combined with weak regulation of cryptocurrency that allows many transactions to be made without identity documents.",
      "Violence may be increasing for several reasons including that criminals believe they can get away with crypto theft because transactions are hard to trace and often cloaked by anonymity, according to the crypto tracing firm TRM Labs. And crypto holders are getting easier to identify because of the prevalence of personal information online and people flaunting their crypto wealth on social media, the firm says.",
      "Phil Ariss, TRM Labs\u2019 director of UK public sector relations, said crypto also may be attracting criminal groups that have long used violence.",
      "\u201cAs long as there\u2019s a viable route to launder or liquidate stolen assets, it makes little difference to the offender whether the target is a high-value watch or a crypto wallet,\u201d Ariss said in a statement. \u201cCryptocurrency is now firmly in the mainstream, and as a result, our traditional understanding of physical threat and robbery needs to evolve accordingly.\"",

      "Artificial intelligence technology bellwether Nvidia overcame a wave of tariff-driven turbulence to deliver another quarter of robust growth amid feverish demand for its high-powered chips that are making computers seem more human",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Artificial intelligence technology bellwether Nvidia overcame a wave of tariff-driven turbulence to deliver another quarter of robust growth amid feverish demand for its high-powered chips that are making computers seem more human.",
      "The results announced Wednesday for the February-April period came against the backdrop of President Donald Trump\u2019s on-again, off-again trade war that has whipsawed Nvidia and other Big Tech companies riding AI mania to propel their revenue and stock prices upward.",
      "But Trump\u2019s tariffs \u2014 many of which have been reduced or temporarily suspended \u2013 hammered the market values of Nvidia and other tech powerhouses heading into the springtime earnings season as investors fretted about the trade turmoil dimming the industry\u2019s prospects.",
      "Those worries have eased during the past six weeks as most Big Tech companies lived up to or exceeded the analyst projections that steer investors, capped by Nvidia\u2019s report for its fiscal first quarter.",
      "Nvidia earned $18.8 billion, or 76 cents per share, for the period, a 26% increase from the same time last year. Revenue surged 69% from a year ago to $44.1 billion. If not for a $4.5 billion charge that Nvidia absorbed to account for the U.S. government\u2019s restrictions on its chip sales to China, Nvidia would have made 96 cents per share, far above the 73 cents per share envisioned by analysts.",
      "In another positive sign, Nvidia predicted its revenue for the May-July period would be about $45 billion, roughly the level that investors had been anticipating. The forecast includes an estimated $8 billion loss in sales to China due to the export controls during its fiscal second quarter, after the restrictions cost it about $2.5 billion in revenue during the first quarter.",
      "In a conference call with analysts, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang lamented that the U.S. government had effectively blocked off AI chip sales to China \u2014 a market that he estimated at $50 billion. Huang warned the export controls have spurred China to build more of its own chips in a shift that he predicted the U.S. will eventually regret.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. based its policy on the assumption that China cannot make AI chips. That assumption was always questionable, and now it\u2019s clearly wrong,\u201d Huang said.",
      "Despite Nvidia's lost opportunities in China, investors were heartened by the company's first-quarter performance. Nvidia's shares gained more than 4% in extended trading after the numbers came out. Nvidia\u2019s stock price ended Wednesday\u2019s regular trading session at $134.81, just slightly below where it stood before Trump\u2019s Jan. 20 inauguration. The price had plunged to as low as $86.62 last month during a nosedive that temporarily erased $1.2 trillion in shareholder wealth.",
      "The outlook began brightening for Nvidia last month after AI leaders such as Microsoft, Alphabet and Meta Platforms reaffirmed their plans to invest heavily in AI. That spending has been a boon for Nvidia because its chipsets provide the technology\u2019s brainpower, an advantage that has helped the company's annual revenue from $27 billion to $130 billion in just two years.",
      "Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives estimates Big Tech companies will spend about $325 billion on long-term investments primarily revolving around AI this year, with a substantial chunk of that money budgeted for Nvidia\u2019s chips \u201cThere is one chip in the world fueling the AI revolution and it's Nvidia. That narrative is clear from these results,\u201d Ives wrote in a research note.",
      "Trump\u2019s trade war has been raising doubts about Nvidia\u2019s ability to maintain its astounding momentum by threatening to close off other key markets besides China.",
      "In apparent attempt to curry favor with the president, Huang last month announced Nvidia will help boost U.S. manufacturing by building some of its AI chips and supercomputers in plants located in Arizona and Texas. Huang also accompanied Trump on a trip to Saudi Arabia earlier this month, signaling Nvidia\u2019s ambitions to sell more of its AI chips in the Middle East as that region attempts to lessen its economy dependence on oil.",
      "Trump also extended a helping hand to Nvidia of by rescinding the scheduled start export controls that had been drawn up under President Joe Biden\u2019s administration that would have broadened the restrictions on chips sales in foreign markets beyond the limits already in place on deals with China and Russia.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. will always be Nvidia\u2019s largest market and home to the largest installed base of our infrastructure,\u201d Huang said. \u201cEvery nation now sees AI as core to the next industrial revolution.\u201d",

      "Vance\u2019s speech comes after Trump promised to make the U.S. the \u201ccrypto capital of the planet\u201d when he addressed the same bitcoin conference in Nashville last year in the middle of the presidential campaign. The crypto industry, which felt unfairly attacked by the Biden administration, spent heavily to help Trump and pro-crypto lawmakers win election.",

      "Vance also touted the Trump administration\u2019s record at fulfilling the campaign promises made last year.",
      "As president, Trump has established a strategic bitcoin reserve for the federal government and pardoned Ross Ulbricht, the founder of Silk Road, a black market website that was key to the early growth of bitcoin. Trump has also staked his administration with outspoken crypto backers while his administration has undone or paused several enforcement actions taken against large crypto companies.",
      "Several other Trump officials are speakers at the bitcoin conference, as are his sons Don Jr. and Eric. The president and his family\u2019s use of crypto as a platform to make money for the Trump brand has drawn criticism from Democrats and even crypto enthusiasts as corrupt and unseemly.",

      "NEW YORK -- Scientists have identified a new pod of ancient hunter-gatherers who lived near the land bridge between North America and South America about 6,000 years ago.",
      "Researchers are still charting how human populations spread across the Americas thousands of years ago, arriving first in North America before veering south. Groups that split off developed their own collection of genes that scientists can use to piece together the human family tree.",
      "Discovered through ancient DNA, the group lived in the high plateaus of present-day Bogot\u00e1, Colombia \u2014 close to where the Americas meet. Scientists aren't sure exactly where they fall in the family tree because they're not closely related to ancient Native Americans in North America and also not linked to ancient or present-day South Americans.",
      "The new study was published Wednesday in the journal Science Advances.",
      "\u201cUp to this point, we didn\u2019t believe there was any other lineage that would appear in South America,\" said archaeologist Andre Luiz Campelo dos Santos with Florida Atlantic University who was not involved with the new research. \u201cThis is unexpected.\u201d",

      "Analyzing more genes in South America will help confirm if this new group truly did disappear or if there could be evidence of their descendants elsewhere, said Campelo dos Santos.",

      "The headline-grabbing tale of an Italian man who said he was kidnapped and tortured for weeks inside an upscale Manhattan townhouse by captors seeking his bitcoin highlights a dark corner of the cryptocurrency world: the threat of violence by thieves seeking digital assets.",
      "The alleged attempted robbery is known as a \u201cwrench attack.\u201d It\u2019s a name popularized by an online comic that mocked how easily high-tech security can be undone by hitting someone with a wrench until they give up passwords.",
      "Wrench attacks are on the rise thanks in part to cryptocurrency\u2019s move into mainstream finance, Phil Ariss of the crypto tracing firm TRM Labs said in a recent blog post.",
      "\u201cCriminal groups already comfortable with using violence to achieve their goals were always likely to migrate to crypto,\u201d Ariss said.",
      "Some of the crypto\u2019s key characteristics help explain why wealthy individuals who hold a lot of digital assets can be ripe targets for such attacks.",
      "Cryptocurrencies like bitcoin offer traders full control of their funds without the need for a bank or permission from a government to buy, sell or hold it. The trade-off is that if funds are lost or stolen, there can be no way to get them back.",
      "Self-reliance is a key ethos of crypto. Securing and controlling one\u2019s private keys, which are like passwords used to access one\u2019s crypto holdings, is viewed as sacrosanct among many in the crypto community. A popular motto is \u201cnot your keys, not your coins.\u201d",
      "Transactions on the blockchain, the technology that powers cryptocurrencies, are permanent. And unlike cash, jewelry, gold or other items of value, thieves don\u2019t need to carry around stolen crypto. With a few clicks, huge amounts of wealth can be transferred from one address to another.",
      "In the case in New York, where two people have been charged, a lot of details have yet to come out, including the value of the bitcoin the victim possessed.",
      "Stealing cryptocurrency is almost as old as cryptocurrency itself, but it\u2019s usually done by hacking. North Korean state hackers alone are believed to have stolen billions of dollars\u2019 worth of crypto in recent years.",
      "In response to the threat of hacking, holders of a large amount of crypto often try and keep their private keys off the internet and stored in what are called \u201ccold wallets.\u201d Used properly, such wallets can defeat even the most sophisticated and determined hackers.",
      "But they can\u2019t defeat thieves who force a victim to give up their password to access their wallets and move money.",
      "The case in New York is the latest in a string of high-profile wrench attacks. Several have taken place in France, where thieves cut off a crypto executive\u2019s finger.",
      "Experts suggest several ways to mitigate the threats of wrench attacks, including using wallets that require multiple approvals before any transactions.",
      "Perhaps the most common way crypto-wealthy individuals try to prevent wrench attacks is by trying to stay anonymous. Using nicknames and cartoon avatars in social media accounts is common in the crypto community, even among top executives at popular companies.",

      "An international team reported Wednesday that this celestial object \u2014 perhaps a star, pair of stars or something else entirely \u2014 is emitting X-rays around the same time it\u2019s shooting out radio waves. What\u2019s more, the cycle repeats every 44 minutes, at least during periods of extreme activity.",
      "Located 15,000 light-years away in a region of the Milky Way brimming with stars, gas and dust, this object could be a highly magnetized dead star like a neutron or white dwarf, Curtin University\u2019s Ziteng Andy Wang said in an email from Australia.",
      "Or it could be \u201csomething exotic\u201d and unknown, said Wang, lead author of the study published in the journal Nature.",
      "NASA\u2019s Chandra X-ray Observatory spotted the X-ray emissions by chance last year while focusing on a supernova remnant, or the remains of an exploded star. Wang said it was the first time X-rays had been seen coming from a so-called long-period radio transient, a rare object that cycles through radio signals over tens of minutes.",
      "Given the uncertain distance, astronomers can't tell if the weird object is associated with the supernova remnant or not. A single light-year is 5.8 trillion miles.",
      "The hyperactive phase of this object \u2014 designated ASKAP J1832\u2212091 \u2014 appeared to last about a month. Outside of that period, the star did not emit any noticeable X-rays. That could mean more of these objects may be out there, scientists said.",
      "\u201cWhile our discovery doesn\u2019t yet solve the mystery of what these objects are and may even deepen it, studying them brings us closer to two possibilities,\u201d Wang said. \u201cEither we are uncovering something entirely new, or we\u2019re seeing a known type of object emitting radio and X-ray waves in a way we\u2019ve never observed before.\u201d",
      "Launched in 1999, Chandra orbits tens of thousands of miles (kilometers) above Earth, observing some of the hottest, high-energy objects in the universe.",

      "After back-to-back explosions, SpaceX launched its mega rocket Starship again on Tuesday evening, but fell short of the main objectives when the spacecraft tumbled out of control and broke apart.",
      "The 403-foot (123-meter) rocket blasted off on its ninth demo from Starbase, SpaceX\u2019s launch site at the southern tip of Texas. Residents voted this month to organize as an official city.",
      "CEO Elon Musk 's SpaceX hoped to release a series of mock satellites following liftoff, but that got nixed because the door failed to open all the way. Then the spacecraft began spinning as it skimmed space toward an uncontrolled landing in the Indian Ocean.",
      "SpaceX later confirmed that the spacecraft experienced \u201ca rapid unscheduled disassembly,\u201d or burst apart. \u201cTeams will continue to review data and work toward our next flight test,\u201d the company said in an online statement.",
      "Musk noted in a post on X it was a \u201cbig improvement\u201d from the two previous demos, which ended in flaming debris over the Atlantic. Despite the latest setback, he promised a faster launch pace moving forward, with a Starship soaring every three to four weeks for the next three flights.",
      "It was the first time one of Musk's Starships \u2014 intended for moon and Mars travel \u2014 flew with a recycled booster. There were no plans to catch the booster with giant chopsticks back at the launch pad, with the company instead pushing it to its limits. Contact with the booster was lost at one point, and it slammed into the Gulf of Mexico in pieces as the spacecraft continued toward the Indian Ocean.",
      "Then the spacecraft went out of control, apparently due to fuel leaks.",
      "\u201cNot looking great with a lot of our on-orbit objectives for today,\u201d said SpaceX flight commentator Dan Huot. The company had been looking to test the spacecraft\u2019s heat shield during a controlled reentry.",
      "Communication ceased before the spacecraft came down, and SpaceX ended its webcast soon afterward.",
      "The previous two Starships never made it past the Caribbean. The demos earlier this year ended just minutes after liftoff, raining wreckage into the ocean. No injuries or serious damage were reported, although airline travel was disrupted. The Federal Aviation Administration last week cleared Starship for another flight, expanding the hazard area and pushing the liftoff outside peak air travel times.",
      "Besides taking corrective action and making upgrades, SpaceX modified the latest spacecraft\u2019s thermal tiles and installed special catch fittings. This one was meant to sink in the Indian Ocean, but the company wanted to test the add-ons for capturing future versions back at the pad, just like the boosters.",
      "NASA needs SpaceX to make major strides over the next year with Starship \u2014 the biggest and most powerful rocket ever built \u2014 in order to land astronauts back on the moon. Next year\u2019s moonshot with four astronauts will fly around the moon, but will not land. That will happen in 2027 at the earliest and require a Starship to get two astronauts from lunar orbit to the surface and back off again.",

      "The soil was removed from across the Fukushima prefecture as part of decontamination work following the 2011 nuclear disaster and has since been in interim storage. Some of it has since reached levels safe enough for reuse, officials say.",
      "Using the soil at Ishiba's office in Tokyo is aimed at reassuring the public it is safe. The government said that it plans to reuse the soil for flower beds and other purposes within the grounds of government agencies. The plan is based on guidelines set by the Environment Ministry in March and endorsed by the International Atomic Energy Agency.",

      "The bones, fashioned into narrow projectiles for hunting, had been uncovered in excavations dating back over a century in the Bay of Biscay near Spain and France. Scientists figured the tools were quite ancient, but many were small fragments so it was hard to determine their age.",
      "Technological advancements in the past decade have now made it possible to date the oldest of the tools to about 20,000 years ago. Scientists found that the bones came from blue whales, fin whales, sperm whales and other species.",
      "\u201cHumans and whales have clearly been encountering one another for a long time,\u201d said Vicki Szabo with Western Carolina University, who studies the history of whaling and was not involved with the latest research.",

There\u2019s been solid evidence of whale bone tools dating back to about 5,000 years ago, but the new research published Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications pushes the timeline back.",
      "Ancient humans weren't necessarily hunting whales, said study author Jean-Marc Petillon with the French National Centre for Scientific Research. More likely, they were scavenging the bodies of beached whales and fashioning their dense, heavy bones into tools to hunt reindeer or bison.",
      "The tools indicate that ancient people in the area took advantage of resources near the sea for survival. They likely also collected seashells and fished. Finding such evidence has been difficult as rising sea levels disrupt coastlines across the globe, scientists said.",

      "Rising concerns about the misuse of drones have led to the development of new technologies designed to counter unmanned aircraft",
      "WASHINGTON -- Drones have harassed airports and bedeviled local police. They have trespassed over nuclear plants and prisons. On the battlefield, they can kill.",
      "But aside from shooting down the devices, which may create further danger, there's often not much anyone can do to stop drones when they pose a threat or wander where they're not welcome.",
      "That's beginning to change. Cheap and easily modified, unmanned aerial vehicles have become a part of daily life as well as a tool for governments and bad actors alike \u2014 used for intelligence gathering, surveillance, sabotage, terrorism and more. Concerns about their misuse have spurred a technological scramble for ways to stop the devices in midair.",
      "\u201cAn adversary can use an off-the-shelf drone they bought for $500 and find out what\u2019s going on at U.S. nuclear weapons bases,\" said Zachary Kallenborn, a London-based national security consultant and expert on drone warfare. \u201cChina, Russia, Iran: If they're not doing it they're stupid.\u201d",
      "Military drones are already potent weapons of war, used to track enemy movements and deliver attacks. But they have become an increasing threat at home, too. And anti-drone systems now hold significant promise for airports, water treatment plants, military installations and public events targeted by drones in recent years.",
      "The rise in incidents involving unmanned aircraft \u2014 like the wave of sightings reported last year in New Jersey \u2014 has led to more research and investment into the most effective ways of countering drones, preferably while preventing injuries to those below.",
      "Some systems work by firing a projectile to destroy it. Others jam the radio frequencies used to control the drones, causing them to land in place or fly back to their origin. Another approach uses other drones to fire nets at the offending devices.",
      "All the techniques have their strengths and weaknesses.",
      "Jamming a drone is highly effective and relatively easy from a technical standpoint. But it\u2019s a blunt tool \u2014 jamming not just the drone's signal but other electromagnetic signals used by telephones, emergency responders, air traffic control and the internet.",
      "The most basic anti-drone measures are called kinetic defenses, which involve shooting a missile, bullet, net or other projectile at the device to destroy or disable it.",
      "Kinetic systems can be risky, however, by creating the threat that debris could fall on people or property or that a missile fired at unmanned aircraft could miss and hit civilians instead. In 2022, for instance, 12 people were injured in Saudi Arabia when they were hit by debris after authorities took down a drone launched by Houthi rebels near the Yemen border.",
      "The Israeli firm D-Fend Solutions created a system it calls EnforceAir that allows the operator to hack into an adversarial drone and take over its controls. The equipment looks like a large computer router and can be set up on a tripod or a vehicle or carried in a backpack.",
      "Like other anti-drone systems, D-Fend's product also detects any drones entering a predetermined area, allowing the operator to permit friendly devices to fly through while disabling others.",
      "In a demonstration of the technology in an empty athletic field in suburban Washington, the system quickly hijacked a drone operated by one of D-Fend's technicians as it entered an area being monitored.",
      "\u201cWe detect the drone, we take control and we land it,\u201d said Jeffrey Starr, the company\u2019s chief marketing officer.",
      "Landing the aircraft safely allows authorities to study the device \u2014 a critical benefit to law enforcement or national security investigations. It also allows the drone to be given back to its owner in the case of harmless mistakes involving hobbyists.",
      "Anti-drone systems that involve hacking the invading aircraft may not work on military drones, however, as they come equipped with greater cyberdefenses.",
      "National security experts predict that a variety of techniques to counter drones could soon become commonplace, used to protect sensitive buildings, pipelines, ports and public areas. But before that can happen, federal laws must catch up to the threat.",
      "\u201cMost of the laws we're dealing with were written for manned aviation,\u201d said DJ Smith, senior technical surveillance agent with the Virginia State Police's Bureau of Criminal Investigations.",
      "Smith, who oversees his department\u2019s use of drones, said any new federal rules should come with a public awareness campaign so hobbyists and commercial drone users understand the law and the responsibilities of using a drone. Authorities also need greater powers to use systems to track suspicious drones, he said, and take action against them when they pose a threat.",
      "\u201cWe want to detect, we want to track, we want to identify,\u201d Smith said.",
      "Federal law currently restricts how local and state police can use anti-drone systems. Some lawmakers are pushing to change that.",
      "\u201cIt is paramount that our state and local law enforcement agencies are able to be granted the proper authority to protect citizens at large events and gatherings,\u201d said Rep. Cory Mills, a Florida Republican and a sponsor of legislation designed to make it easier for local authorities to use technology to counter drones at large public events.",
      "The bill, introduced this month, would give local law enforcement the ability to use anti-drone systems that have been approved by the Department of Homeland Security, the Federal Aviation Administration and other agencies.",

      "Since President Donald Trump took office in January, his administration has pointed to what it calls waste and inefficiency in federal science spending and made major cuts to staff levels and grant funding at the National Science Foundation,the National Institutes of Health, NASA and other agencies, as well as slashing research dollars that flow to some private universities.",
      "The White House budget proposal for next year calls to cut the NIH budget by roughly 40% and the National Science Foundation\u2019s by 55%.",
      "\u201cThe Trump administration is spending its first few months reviewing the previous administration\u2019s projects, identifying waste, and realigning our research spending to match the American people\u2019s priorities and continue our innovative dominance,\" said White House spokesperson Kush Desai.",
      "Already, several universities have announced hiring freezes, laid off staff or stopped admitting new graduate students. On Thursday, the Trump administration revoked Harvard University\u2019s ability to enroll international students, though a judge put that on hold.",
      "Research institutions abroad are watching with concern for collaborations that depend on colleagues in the U.S. \u2014 but they also see opportunities to potentially poach talent.",
      "\u201cThere are threats to science ... south of the border,\u201d said Brad Wouters, of University Health Network, Canada\u2019s leading hospital and medical research center, which launched the \u201cCanada Leads\u201d recruitment drive. \u201cThere\u2019s a whole pool of talent, a whole cohort that is being affected by this moment.\u201d",
      "Universities worldwide are always trying to recruit from one another, just as tech companies and businesses in other fields do. What's unusual about the current moment is that many global recruiters are targeting researchers by promising something that seems newly threatened: academic freedom.",
      "European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said this month that the European Union intends \u201cto enshrine freedom of scientific research into law.\u201d She spoke at the launch of the bloc's \u201cChoose Europe for Science\u201d \u2014 which was in the works before the Trump administration cuts but has sought to capitalize on the moment.",
      "Eric Berton, president of Aix-Marseille University, expressed a similar sentiment after launching the institution\u2019s \u201cSafe Place for Science\u201d program.",
      "\u201cOur American research colleagues are not particularly interested by money,\" he said of applicants. \"What they want above all is to be able to continue their research and that their academic freedom be preserved.\"",
      "It\u2019s too early to say how many scientists will choose to leave the U.S. It will take months for universities to review applications and dole out funding, and longer for researchers to uproot their lives.",
      "Plus, the American lead in funding research and development is enormous \u2014 and even significant cuts may leave crucial programs standing. The U.S. has been the world\u2019s leading funder of R&D \u2014 including government, university and private investment \u2014 for decades. In 2023, the country funded 29% of the world\u2019s R&D, according to the American Association for the Advancement of Science.",
      "But some institutions abroad are reporting significant early interest from researchers in the U.S. Nearly half of the applications to \u201cSafe Place for Science\u201d \u2014 139 out of 300 total \u2014 came from U.S.-based scientists, including AI researchers and astrophysicists.",
      "U.S.-based applicants in this year\u2019s recruitment round for France\u2019s Institute of Genetics, Molecular and Cellular Biology roughly doubled over last year.",
      "At the Max Planck Society in Germany, the Lise Meitner Excellence Program \u2014 aimed at young female researchers \u2014 drew triple the number of applications from U.S.-based scientists this year as last year.",
      "Recruiters who work with companies and nonprofits say they see a similar trend.",
      "Natalie Derry, a U.K.-based managing partner of the Global Emerging Sciences Practice at recruiter WittKieffer, said her team has seen a 25% to 35% increase in applicants from the U.S. cold-calling about open positions. When they reach out to scientists currently based in the U.S., \u201cwe are getting a much higher hit rate of people showing interest.\u201d",
      "Still, there are practical hurdles to overcome for would-be continent-hoppers, she said. That can include language hurdles, arranging childcare or eldercare, and significant differences in national pension or retirement programs.",
      "Brandon Coventry never thought he would consider a scientific career outside the United States. But federal funding cuts and questions over whether new grants will materialize have left him unsure. While reluctant to leave his family and friends, he\u2019s applied to faculty positions in Canada and France.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve never wanted to necessarily leave the United States, but this is a serious contender for me,\u201d said Coventry, who is a postdoctoral fellow studying neural implants at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.",
      "But it\u2019s not easy to pick up and move a scientific career \u2014 let alone a life.",
      "Marianna Zhang was studying how children develop race and gender stereotypes as a postdoctoral fellow at New York University when her National Science Foundation grant was canceled. She said it felt like \u201cAmerica as a country was no longer interested in studying questions like mine.\u201d",
      "Still, she wasn\u2019t sure of her next move. \u201cIt\u2019s no easy solution, just fleeing and escaping to another country,\u201d she said.",
      "The recruitment programs range in ambition, from those trying to attract a dozen researchers to a single university to the continent-wide \u201cChoose Europe\u201d initiative.",
      "But it\u2019s unclear if the total amount of funding and new positions offered could match what's being shed in the U.S.",
      "Even as universities and institutes think about recruiting talent from the U.S., there\u2019s more apprehension than glee at the funding cuts.",
      "\u201cScience is a global endeavor,\u201d said Patrick Cramer, head of the Max Planck Society, noting that datasets and discoveries are often shared among international collaborators.",
      "One aim of recruitment drives is to \u201cto help prevent the loss of talent to the global scientific community,\u201d he said.",
      "Researchers worldwide will suffer if collaborations are shut down and databases taken offline, scientists say.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. was always an example, in both science and education,\u201d said Patrick Schultz, president of France's Institute of Genetics, Molecular and Cellular Biology. So the cuts and policies were \u201cvery frightening also for us because it was an example for the whole world.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "CPAC is holding events in Poland and Hungary this week.",
      "LONDON -- The \"Make America Great Again\" roadshow arrived in Europe this week with events in two nations where American conservatives see prime opportunities for a new transatlantic political culture -- one molded by President Donald Trump's right-wing populism and imbued with grand \"clash of civilizations\" rhetoric.",
      "The Conservative Political Action Conference -- CPAC -- opened its week of European events on Tuesday in Jasionka, Poland, where Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem was among the speakers, urging Poles to vote for right-wing presidential candidate Karol Nawrocki in this weekend's runoff election.",
      "Noem eschewed the diplomatic norm of non-alignment in elections in allied nations, as have other administration officials including Vice President JD Vance. \"You will be the leaders that will turn Europe back to conservative values,\" she told attendees in Jasionka.",
      "\"We need you to elect the right leader,\" Noem said, dismissing Nawrocki's rival -- liberal Warsaw Mayor Rafal Trzaskowski -- as \"an absolute train wreck of a leader.\"",
      "\"Donald Trump is a strong leader for us, but you have an opportunity that you have just as strong of a leader in Karol if you make him the leader of this country,\" Noem said.",
      "CPAC's next stop will be in Budapest, Hungary, on Thursday, hosted by populist Prime Minister Viktor Orban -- a totem of the European anti-establishment right wing who has long enjoyed cozy relations with Trump.",
      "Peter Kreko, the director of the Political Capital Institute in Budapest, said Orban is positioning himself as \"another recipient of the MAGA soft power export.\"",
      "\"Orban is still positioning himself as someone who is exporting his campaign tactics, who can help others in terms of campaign consultancy and provide help from the United States,\" Kreko said. \"He's trading off of his good partnership with Donald Trump.\"",
      "On the web page promoting CPAC's Hungary event, the organization hit out at \"corrupt elites\" who it said \"betray all that once made us great: patriotic virtue has been replaced by internationalism, common sense by bureaucracy and tradition by woke madness.\"",
      "\"People on both sides of the Atlantic have risen up against this repackaged version of socialism, but success can only be complete when the tides of change converge and the age of patriotism begins at both poles of the West,\" CPAC wrote.",
      "Internationalism is front and center in the CPAC event agendas. Among the speakers in Budapest will be American conservative commentator Ben Shapiro, Yair Netanyahu -- the son of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Santiago Abascal, the leader of Spain's far-right Vox party.",
      "Also attending will be a host of other European conservative politicians from Poland, Austria, the Czech Republic, Croatia, Denmark, France, Estonia and Greece -- among others.",
      "\"With the triumph of Donald Trump and the rise of the European Right, the Age of the Patriots of Western Civilization has begun -- CPAC Hungary 2025 will be the hub of this movement,\" the organizing website said.",
      "But the CPAC events come at a moment of peril for transatlantic relations. Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariffs threaten to touch off a costly trade war with the European Union.",
      "Trump has made no secret of his disdain for the bloc. \"Now we're going to charge the European Union,\" Trump said when unveiling his tariff plans in April. \"They're very tough. Very, very tough traders. You know, you think of the European Union, very friendly. They rip us off. It's so sad to see. It's so pathetic.\"",
      "Trump announced last weekend that his planned 50% tariffs on EU goods would be delayed into July. But the bloc remains on a collision course with the Trump administration.",
      "The economic and political aspirations of all EU leaders rely heavily on the bloc's own fortunes, even for those populist leaders like Orban who so often define themselves in opposition to the grand European project.",
      "The president's European offensive could yet sour budding ties between the MAGA movement and its foreign allies, if the latter's \"core interests appear directly threatened by Trumpism,\" Celia Belin, a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations and head of its Paris office, told ABC News.",
      "Kati Piri, Hungarian-born member of the Dutch parliament and the Labour Party's spokesperson for foreign affairs, migration and asylum, told ABC News in a statement that \"Trump's unilateralist policies are designed to hurt all Europeans, and that so-called allies will not be spared.\"",
      "\"Trump's continued threats of tariffs on EU products and global trade wars are making him an unpopular friend to have -- and this is fragmenting the unity of the global right,\" Piri suggested.",
      "The glitz and glamour of CPAC's Budapest event will be welcome for Orban, Kreko said, as the prime minister grapples with his own domestic challenges -- not least the meteoric rise of liberal opposition leader Peter Magyar.",
      "Around 10,000 people rallied in Budapest earlier this month to protest government plans to restrict the rights of independent media organizations -- the latest in a wave of large protests against Orban and his Fidesz party government.",
      "Kreko said Orban's popularity is flagging after 15 years of uninterrupted power, even as he positions himself at the forefront of the nascent right-wing \"illiberal international.\"",
      "\"Orban is nowhere as popular as he was, let's say in 2022, when he won the last elections,\" Kreko said. \"His popularity is waning, he is having a hard time getting it back and he also uses increasingly authoritarian tools to be able to keep power.\"",
      "\"He has a hard time at home persuading his own constituency that the regime he is promoting all over the world is as powerful, as beautiful, as successful as it is seen by the MAGA camp in the United States,\" Kreko added.",
      "Trump's America has become the center of gravity of the global right-wing movement -- with the weight of the federal government and the broader national conservative movement behind it.",
      "This week Samuel Samson -- a senior advisor for the State Department's Bureau for Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor -- gave an indication of the prevailing winds in American transatlantic policy, publishing an article setting out \"the need for civilizational allies in Europe.\"",
      "Claiming the existence of \"an aggressive campaign against Western civilization itself,\" Samson accused European governments of having \"devolved into a hotbed of digital censorship, mass migration, restrictions on religious freedom and numerous other assaults on democratic self-governance.\"",
      "Opening the CPAC event in Poland on Tuesday, chairman Matt Schlapp told attendees, \"The globalists intend to take each one of us out one by one -- to shame us, to silence us, to bankrupt us, to ruin us, to make our kids turn against us.\"",
      "That is why, he said, it was important to \"win all these elections, including in Poland, that are so important to the freedom of people everywhere.\"",
      "For now, Kreko suggested the transatlantic MAGA project is incomplete, as did recent election results in Romania, Portugal and the first round of Poland's presidential vote in which conservative and far-right candidates did not win power.",
      "\"What is common between Trump, Orban and many others in central and eastern Europe is that they really want to build this illiberal international,\" Kreko said.",
      "\"But at the same time, we also have to be careful about overestimating its impact,\" he said.",

      "As negotiations to end the war in Ukraine stall, the Trump administration is turning to the Middle East to showcase progress toward landmark deals and to fulfill the president\u2019s vow to be a global peacemaker.",
      "Trump\u2019s special envoy for the Middle East and go-to mediator Steve Witkoff made a surprise announcement at the White House on Wednesday, declaring he believed that a temporary truce in Gaza was now within reach -- and that it could lead to \u201ca peaceful resolution of that conflict.\u201d",
      "\"I think that we are on the precipice of sending out a new term sheet, that hopefully will be delivered later on today. The president is going to review it, and I have some very good feelings about getting to a long-term resolution,\u201d Witkoff said.",
      "U.S. officials said they expected the framework would be transmitted to Israel and to Hamas via mediators late Wednesday or early Thursday, and that the reason for Witkoff\u2019s optimism was that the administration believes the terms of the new proposal for ensuring talks continue after the initial hostage release and 60-day long ceasefire would appeal to both parties.",
      "Any break in the warfare would also present the opportunity to scale up a newly launched, U.S.-backed effort to distribute humanitarian aid in Gaza, which came under fire this week after multiple videos showing widespread chaos at distribution sites emerged.",
      "Negotiations still may face an uphill battle, particularly with Hamas.",
      "The initial three-day peace deal aimed at ending the war in Gaza, which was brokered by members of both the Biden and Trump administrations, collapsed in March after Israel sought to extend the initial stage of the agreement to rescue more detainees from Gaza without proceeding to more in-depth negotiations aimed at ultimately reaching a two-state solution. At the time of deal\u2019s collapse, the Trump administration supported Israel\u2019s proposed extension.",
      "However, the president has since taken a harsher approach to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, revealing on Wednesday that he told him it would be \u201cinappropriate\u201d to strike Iranian nuclear facilities.",

      "The administration has explored taking a number of steps aimed at demonstrating tangible progress from its talks with Iran, including the possibilityof issuing some kind of joint memorandum with Iran and potentially expanding the U.S. delegation negotiating with Iran to include Secretary of State Marco Rubio, according to two U.S. officials familiar with the matter who cautioned that no final decision has been reached.",

    "story": [
      "Putin has \"been able to play and outplay\" Trump, one analyst told ABC News.",
      "President Donald Trump has repeatedly said his personal relationship with Vladimir Putin would allow him get through to  the Russian president and bring peace to Ukraine.",
      "But after Moscow's escalation of strikes on Kyiv over the weekend, Trump wrote Putin's gone \"absolutely CRAZY!\"",
      "\"I\u2019ve always had a very good relationship with Vladimir Putin of Russia, but something has happened to him,\" Trump wrote in a social media post on Sunday. By Tuesday, Trump warned Putin was \"playing with fire.\"",
      "The comments are the clearest sign yet of Trump's mounting frustration with Putin -- but the question remains whether he will take any punitive action against Russia or if he's making idle threats.",
      "Asked on Wednesday what the consequences would be if Russia continues its intensified barrage on Ukraine, Trump deflected.",
      "\"Well, I'm not going to tell you exactly. But the words speak pretty loud,\" he said.",
      "Trump was asked on Sunday if he would consider imposing new sanctions on Russia. The president said \"absolutely.\"",
      "The Kremlin responded that Trump's criticism of Putin was an \"emotional reaction\" and that he didn't \"fully understand\" their military motives.",
      "\"Putin's intent has been obvious. He's stated it over and over. He's acted on it. It is to be sure that Ukraine is not a sovereign nation,\" said William Taylor, a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine currently serving as a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council. \"He is not a friend of the United States. And this has been clear for a long time. He has been able to play and outplay President Trump all along.\"",
      "\"I think that President Trump is recognizing that reality,\" Taylor told ABC News. \"That Putin is not his buddy. That Putin is attacking Ukraine in record numbers of missiles and drones right after speaking to Trump. This is not a serious negotiator. Putin is very clearly not interested in stopping this war.\"",
      "Trump continued to say on Wednesday he was \"disappointed\" and \"not happy\" with Russia's onslaught toward Ukraine.",
      "\"Trump\u2019s comments won\u2019t necessarily affect the stance either side takes in these talks: the Ukrainians will convey maximum flexibility, while the Russians will stress the concessions they expect Kyiv to make. Where you could see a change is in the U.S. attitude toward new sanctions or new aid to Ukraine,\" said Stephen Sestanovich, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations who served as the State Department's ambassador-at-large for the former Soviet Union.",
      "Trump had promised to end the war on Day 1 in office -- a pledge he later said was hyperbolic.",
      "He's come under heavy scrutiny for making public demands of Ukraine, including that it give up the goal of NATO membership and possibly conceding some territory gained by Putin's forces, while not doing the same with Russia.",
      "An hourslong phone call between Trump and Putin last week yielded no major breakthroughs. Putin said he was ready to work on a \"memorandum on a possible future peace agreement\" but showed no signs of making concessions.",
      "Trump had said after that call direct talks between Ukraine and Russia would start immediately and possibly be held at the Vatican. Russia later rejected the Vatican as a location.",
      "Retired Gen. Keith Kellogg, Trump's Special Presidential Envoy for Ukraine, told Fox News this week that new Russia-Ukraine talks could take place in Geneva -- perhaps involving Trump, Putin and Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelenskyy. On the \"memorandum\" mentioned by Putin, Kellogg said Ukraine has given their version of the document and \"now we need to get the same from Russia.\"",
      "Trump on Wednesday said he would sit down with Putin and Zelenskyy \"if it's necessary.\" Asked if he still believed Putin really wants to end the war, Trump sidestepped.",
      "\"I can't tell you that,\" Trump said. \"But I'll let you know in about two weeks. Within two weeks. We're going to find out very soon. We're going to find out whether or not he's tapping us along or not. And if he is, we\u2019ll respond a little bit differently. But it will take about a week and a half, two weeks.\"",
      "Trump made similar comments back in April wondering if Putin was \"tapping\" the U.S. along, and warned they'd take another tack if so, though nothing has substantially changed since then.",
      "\"Trying to read Putin\u2019s mind is a risky business, but right now he seems to think he can pretend to negotiate without limiting his military attacks and that Trump will hold off on new sanctions or new weapons,\" Sestanovich said. \"If Trump thinks Putin\u2019s approach shows considerable disrespect for him, well, he\u2019s right.\"",
      "Trump's threat of additional sanctions is one he's made previously, though he's yet to implement them and did not join European countries when they announced last week their own sanctions package against Russia.",
      "On Wednesday, Trump was asked what was stopping him from imposing new sanctions.",
      "\"Only the fact that if I think I'm close to getting a deal, I don't want to screw it up by doing that. Let me tell you, I'm a lot tougher than the people you're talking about,\" Trump told reporters.",
      "There is growing support for economic pressure on Russia among Republicans. In the Senate, a bill from South Carolina Republican Lindsey Graham that would impose sanctions on countries that buy Russian energy has more than 80 co-sponsors.",
      "\"This is not the time for more \u2018Vladimir stop.' This is not the time for questions of concern about being pissed off. Those times are passed,\" said Taylor. \"Now is the time, if President Trump is serious, and I think he is serious about ending this war, now's the time for him to take action.\"",
      "Yet just last week, after speaking with Putin, Trump floated he might \"back away\" from talks completely -- and leave it Putin and Zelenskyy to sort things out themselves.",
      "Such a move would be a win for the Russian leader, analysts say.",
      "\"That said, I don't think that President Trump and the administration will walk away because this has been the top priority since before the election and for President Trump to throw up his hands, essentially give in and give up to President Putin, would be an admission of defeat, admission of loss, would give President Putin a big win and would be a stain on President Trump,\" Taylor said.",

      "A federal court in New York handed President Donald Trump a big setback Wednesday, blocking his audacious plan to impose massive taxes on imports from almost every country in the world",
      "WASHINGTON -- A federal court in New York handed President Donald Trump a big setback Wednesday, blocking his audacious plan to impose massive taxes on imports from almost every country in the world.",
      "A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of International Trade ruled that Trump overstepped his authority when he invoked the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act to declare a national emergency and justify the sweeping tariffs.",
      "The tariffs overturned decades of U.S. trade policy, disrupted global commerce, rattled financial markets and raised the risk of higher prices and recession in the United States and around the world.",
      "The U.S. Court of International Trade has jurisdiction over civil cases involving trade. Its decisions can be appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington and ultimately to the Supreme Court, where the legal challenges to Trump\u2019 tariffs are widely expected to end up.",
      "The court\u2019s decision blocks the tariffs Trump slapped last month on almost all U.S. trading partners and levies he imposed before that on China, Mexico and Canada.",
      "On April 2, Trump imposed so-called reciprocal tariffs of up to 50% on countries with which the United States runs a trade deficit and 10% baseline tariffs on almost everybody else. He later suspended the reciprocal tariffs for 90 days to give countries time to agree to reduce barriers to U.S. exports. But he kept the baseline tariffs in place. Claiming extraordinary power to act without congressional approval, he justified the taxes under IEEPA by declaring the United States' longstanding trade deficits \u201ca national emergency.\u201d",
      "In February, he'd invoked the law to impose tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China, saying that the illegal flow of immigrants and drugs across the U.S. border amounted to a national emergency and that the three countries needed to do more to stop it.",
      "The U.S. Constitution gives Congress the power to set taxes, including tariffs. But lawmakers have gradually let presidents assume more power over tariffs \u2014 and Trump has made the most of it.",
      "The tariffs are being challenged in at least seven lawsuits. In the ruling Wednesday, the trade court combined two of the cases \u2014 one brought by five small businesses and another by 12 U.S. states.",
      "The ruling does leave in place other Trump tariffs, including those on foreign steel, aluminum and autos. But those levies were invoked under a different law that required a Commerce Department investigation and could not be imposed at the president\u2019s own discretion.",
      "The administration had argued that courts had approved then-President Richard Nixon\u2019s emergency use of tariffs in a 1971 economic and financial crisis that arose when the United States suddenly devalued the dollar by ending a policy that linked the U.S. currency to the price of gold. The Nixon administration successfully cited its authority under the 1917 Trading With Enemy Act, which preceded and supplied some of the legal language later used in IEPPA.",
      "The court disagreed, deciding that Trump\u2019s sweeping tariffs exceeded his authority to regulate imports under IEEPA. It also said the tariffs did nothing to deal with problems they were supposed to address. In their case, the states noted that America's trade deficits hardly amount of a sudden emergency. The United States has racked them up for 49 straight years in good times and bad.",
      "Wendy Cutler, a former U.S. trade official who is now vice president at the Asia Society Policy Institute, says the court's decision \"throws the president\u2019s trade policy into turmoil.\u201d",
      "\u201cPartners negotiating hard during the 90-day day tariff pause period may be tempted to hold off making further concessions to the U.S. until there is more legal clarity,\" she said.",
      "Likewise, companies will have to reassess the way they run their supply chains, perhaps speeding up shipments to the United States to offset the risk that the tariffs will be reinstated on appeal.",
      "The trade court noted that Trump retains more limited power to impose tariffs to address trade deficits under another statute, the Trade Act of 1974. But that law restricts tariffs to 15% and only for 150 days with countries with which the United States runs big trade deficits.",
      "For now, the trade court's ruling \u201cdestroys the Trump administration\u2019s rationale for using federal emergency powers to impose tariffs, which oversteps congressional authority and contravenes any notion of due process,\u201d said Eswar Prasad, professor of trade policy at Cornell University. \"The ruling makes it clear that the broad tariffs imposed unilaterally by Trump represent an overreach of executive power.''",

      "South Carolina Democrat Dr. Annie Andrews says she\u2019s running against Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham in 2026",
      "COLUMBIA, S.C. -- Dr. Annie Andrews, the South Carolina Democrat who unsuccessfully challenged Rep. Nancy Mace in 2022, says she's running against Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham in 2026, challenging the four-term incumbent in part due to what she characterized as his waffling positions over the course of his political career.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s changed his position on nearly every issue over that time and that\u2019s because, in my view, he doesn\u2019t stand for anything or believe in anything other than what it takes to get reelected,\u201d Andrews, a pediatrician in Charleston, told The Associated Press before a campaign rollout Thursday.",
      "Andrews joins at least one other Democrat in a primary field.",
      "In her launch video, Andrews says it\u2019s \u201cembarrassing\u201d to see how politicians like Graham \u2014 at the moment one of President Donald Trump\u2019s top Senate allies \u2014 have swung from criticizing Trump to working to gain his favor. The video features archival video of Graham bemoaning critics who called Trump a \u201ckook\u201d and then, a year earlier, using the same term to describe his former GOP primary foe in the 2016 presidential contest.",
      "Andrews also levies criticism at Graham for voting to confirm Trump\u2019s Cabinet picks and for his relationship with Elon Musk, describing \u201can unelected billionaire ... taking a chainsaw to Social Security, Medicare and veterans\u2019 healthcare.\u201d She calls Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth \u201ca guy who can\u2019t even organize a text thread,\u201d a reference to the recent Signal chat scandal in which war plans were discussed.",
      "No Democrat has won a U.S. Senate seat in South Carolina in decades, and Republicans in recent history typically take statewide seats by double-digit margins. When he last ran in 2020, Graham defeated his Democratic opponent, Jaime Harrison, by a 10 percentage point margin.",
      "That contest turned into South Carolina\u2019s most expensive ever, with both candidates posting record fundraising that surpassed $200 million total and continued to grow in the race\u2019s closing days. Harrison, who went on to chair the Democratic National Committee, became the first U.S. Senate candidate to amass a war chest of more than $100 million over the course of the race.",
      "Andrews was the Democratic nominee who unsuccessfully sought to unseat Mace in 2022, losing to the Republican by 14 percentage points. South Carolina's 1st District, which spans the state's southern coast, is the only one to have flipped from red to blue in decades, when Joe Cunningham won it for Democrats for a single term in the 2018 election. Mace won it in 2020 and has been reelected twice, although in 2026 she is eyeing a race for governor.",
      "In the years since her House run, Andrews stepped away from her practice at the Medical University of South Carolina and founded a political organization focused on issues related to children, including climate change, gun violence and childhood poverty. According to federal filings, an affiliated political action committee, Their Future PAC, gave $7,000 to a handful of candidates in the 2024 cycle and had about $5,000 on hand at the end of 2024.",
      "Asked about Democrats' lackluster statewide record in the state, Andrews said she felt Harrison's effort was \u201chamstrung\u201d by necessary precautions in place during the pandemic. Now, she said, voters feel strained under the effects of the Trump administration's \u201cchaotic\u201d policies.",
      "\"Lindsey Graham has had 22 years to make things better for folks here in South Carolina, and I think you'd be hard-pressed to find many voters who could articulate in what way Lindsey has made their life better,\" Andrews said.",
      "Graham, seeking his fifth Senate term, kicked off his reelection campaign in February, announcing that Gov. Henry McMaster and Sen. Tim Scott would chair his effort. Scott, the state\u2019s junior senator, is serving as chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the chamber\u2019s campaign arm.",

      "\"After a careful and thorough review of all the information available, including that contained in your initial request for a cost share adjustment and appeal, we have concluded that an extension of the 100 percent federal cost share for debris removal and emergency protective measures, including direct federal assistance for an additional 180 days under major disaster declaration FEMA-4827-DR is not warranted,\" acting Administrator David Richardson wrote in the letter.",
      "The cost-sharing request comes from a Biden administration directive to match 100% of the funds that the state puts in to share costs of the disaster cleanup after Hurricane Helene devastated the state as a Category 4 storm in September 2024.",

      "Traditionally, there is a cost-sharing model with a 75% federal absorption of costs to 25% for states, but that was changed under the Biden administration to match the costs 100%.",

      "At the center of the plan is Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who has weighed how to cut the agency after Trump said in January that he would \"begin the process of fundamentally reforming and overhauling FEMA, or maybe getting rid of them,\" and announced a review of FEMA in a presidential action on Jan. 24.",
      "\"The president has indicated he wants to eliminate FEMA as it exists today and to have states have more control over their emergency management response,\" Noem said on May 8, adding that the agency has \"failed\" in its mission and should be eliminated or downsized. \"He wants to empower local governments and support them and how they respond to their people,\"",
      "FEMA has not responded to ABC News' request for comment.",
      "Still, an internal review of FEMA this month indicated the agency is \"not ready\" for the 2025 hurricane season.",
      "\"As FEMA transforms to a smaller footprint, the intent for this hurricane season is not well understood, thus FEMA is not ready,\" the review said, citing staffing limitations, hiring and a lack of coordination with states as the Trump administration attempts to reorganize and diminish FEMA.",

      "The discovery came after three private Alaska companies, including one that uses sonar equipment to search underwater, offered in April to help look for the family, who are from Texas, according to a statement released by the Alaska Department of Public Safety.",
      "Earlier this month, they found the missing boat along with human remains in 180 feet (55 meters) of water in Kachemak Bay near Homer, the department said.",
      "Divers from the state were then able to recover three sets of remains from the sunken vessel during dives on Tuesday and Wednesday.",

      "The search for the family was launched in August after a report came in that a 28-foot (8.5-meter) aluminum boat carrying eight people had begun taking on water, the U.S. Coast Guard said at the time. The Coast Guard notified other ships in the area of the situation, and a boat nearby rescued four people.",

      "CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- Harvard University is holding its commencement Thursday at a pivotal moment, when its place as one of the world's leading higher education institutions is under what increasingly seems like existential threats from the Trump administration.",
      "Other schools face the loss of federal funding and their ability to enroll international students if they don't agree to the Trump administration's shifting demands. But Harvard, which was founded in 1636, a century and a half before the nation itself, is taking the lead on defying the White House in federal court \u2014 and paying a significant price.",
      "The Trump administration\u2019s latest salvos include asking federal agencies to cancel about $100 million in contracts with the Ivy League school. The government already canceled more than $2.6 billion in federal research grants, moved to cut off Harvard\u2019s enrollment of international students and threatened its tax-exempt status.",
      "Visa interviews for international students admitted to schools nationwide were halted on Tuesday, and Trump said Wednesday that Harvard should reduce its international enrollment from 25% to about 15%.",
      "Sustained by a $53 billion endowment, the nation\u2019s oldest and wealthiest university is testing whether it can be a bulwark against Trump\u2019s efforts to limit what it calls antisemitic activism on campus, which Harvard sees as an affront to the freedom to teach and learn nationwide.",
      "The Trump administration has demanded Harvard enact broad government and leadership reforms and changes to its admissions policies. It also demanded the university audit views of diversity on campus and stop recognizing some student clubs.",
      "Dr. Abraham Verghese, the bestselling author and Stanford expert on infectious diseases, will be the principal speaker at the university's 374th commencement. On Wednesday, NBA Hall of Famer and activist Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was the \u201cClass Day\u201d speaker, and journalist Christiane Amanpour addressed graduates of Harvard's Kennedy School.",
      "Both praised Harvard for standing up to the Trump administration, with Abdul-Jabbar specifically calling out the actions of Harvard President Alan Garber.",
      "\u201cWhen a tyrannical administration tried to bully and threaten Harvard, to revoke their academic freedom and to destroy free speech, Dr. Alan Garber rejected the illegal and immoral pressures,\u201d Abdul-Jabbar said to wide applause as he compared Garber's response to Rosa Parks' stand against racist segregation.",
      "\u201cAfter seeing so many cowering billionaires, media moguls, law firms, politicians and other universities bend their knee to an administration that is systematically strip-mining the U.S. Constitution, it is inspiring to me to see Harvard University take a stand for freedom,\" he continued.",
      "In response to the administration's threats, Harvard has sued to block the funding freeze and persuaded a federal judge to temporarily halt the enrollment ban. It is going to court in Boston on Thursday just as the commencement is wrapping up, hoping for a ruling that allows it to continue enrolling international students.",
      "\u201cWe believe that the government overreach and devastating attacks on scientific and medical research are unwarranted and unlawful, and so we have taken legal action to defend the institution,\u201d Garber said in an interview with a university publication.",
      "\u201cWe should all be concerned that colleges and universities have increasingly come under attack. But we should not dismiss the criticisms even when they are based on distortions or inaccuracies \u2014 we need to look for the underlying concerns that can be embedded in them,\u201d said Garber, who commissioned internal reports last year on antisemitism and anti-Arab prejudice at the Ivy League campus.",
      "The Trump administration has said it wants \"to protect American students and faculty from antisemitic violence and harassment.\u201d It cites campus protests against Israel. Like many college students around the country, Harvard students set up tents called on the university to divest from companies supporting Israel's military, which has leveled Gaza in response to attacks by Hamas.",
      "Last year, hundreds of graduating students walked out of commencement chanting \u201cFree, free Palestine\u201d after weeks of campus protests. Harvard also said some protesters would not receive diplomas alongside their classmates, although it eventually allowed most to get them.",
      "This year, the anti-war demonstrations have largely faded from view, but protesters plan a silent vigil before Thursday's ceremony.",
      "\u201cAs a graduate of Harvard, I am horrified by Israel\u2019s mass murder of Palestinians (including by deliberate starvation), its total leveling of Gaza, its targeting of hospitals, its assaults on Palestinian educational and cultural institutions, and its relentless killings of journalists,\" Harvard graduate Victor Wallis explained in a statement.",

      "ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. -- Another teenager was arrested Wednesday on murder and other charges in connection with a deliberate hit-and-run that targeted a bicyclist, Albuquerque police said.",
      "Detectives learned that the boy was the fourth suspect in the stolen car when it hit and killed 63-year-old physicist Scott Dwight Habermehl while he was biking to his job at Sandia National Laboratories.",
      "The teen arrested Wednesday was 15 at the time of the May 2024 crash. The others included a boy who had just turned 11 and two other teens.",
      "Video of the crash was recorded from inside the car and circulated on social media. It was reported to authorities earlier this year by people including a middle school principal after a student flagged it.",
      "Authorities said that during the course of the investigation several people told detectives they recognized the sound of the fourth suspect\u2019s voice when the video was posted on social media. The teen had denied being the car during an earlier interview with police, but detectives learned that he had shared details about the crash and the police investigation with friends through social media conversations.",
      "The Associated Press doesn\u2019t typically name people under 18 accused of a crime.",
      "The case was among those highlighted by Democratic New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham as well as Republican lawmakers and prosecutors as they pleaded with the Democratic-led Legislature to address juvenile crime across the state. Although vowing to do so, the governor has yet to call a special session to bring lawmakers back to consider new legislation.",

      "The New Orleans jail where 10 inmates escaped from earlier this month is experiencing \u201csignificant flooding\u201d from what a sheriff called \u201congoing and severe plumbing failures.\"",
      "NEW ORLEANS -- The New Orleans jail that gained national attention for a brazen escape by 10 inmates earlier this month is experiencing \u201csignificant flooding\u201d from \u201congoing and severe plumbing failures,\u201d the Orleans Parish Sheriff's Office says.",
      "Embattled Sheriff Susan Hutson and her deputies have portrayed the bold jailbreak \u2014 one of the largest in recent U.S. history \u2014 as the result of an ailing facility in dire need of repairs and improvements such as replacing faulty locks.",
      "State and local officials have generally disputed Hutson\u2019s characterization of the $150 million state-of-the-art facility built in 2015 and blamed the sheriff\u2019s leadership since taking office in 2022. The jail system has been under the oversight of a federal judge and the U.S. Justice Department since 2013.",
      "\u201cThese recurring plumbing issues highlight a much deeper infrastructure crisis at OJC, rooted in years of deferred maintenance, chronic overcrowding, and a lack of meaningful investment,\u201d Hutson said in statement Wednesday. \u201cThis is not just a facilities problem. It\u2019s a public safety issue, a staffing issue, and most of all, a human dignity issue.\u201d",
      "The sheriff's office renewed calls this week for \u201cimmediate and sustained infrastructure investment,\u201d saying jail flooding and other issues were both \u201cforeseeable and preventable.\u201d It said it requires at least $13 million in urgent fixes and that requests for help have been made repeatedly to city officials.",
      "But New Orleans City Council members questioned management of the jail last week during a tense meeting and argued the sheriff's office requires greater transparency and accountability. The city's chief administrative officer also noted the department has received a larger proportionate increase in funding since 2019 than any other public safety agency in the city.",
      "The longstanding debate over how to improve the city's jail system persists as two inmates remain at large. The group of fugitives escaped in the early hours of May 16 by yanking open a jail door, removing a toilet and crawling through a hole in the wall where steel bars had been cut away, then hopping over barbed-wire fencing using blankets.",
      "Authorities say the inmates were able to escape because a maintenance worker, Sterling Williams, turned off the water in the cell after an inmate allegedly threatened to shank him.",
      "Williams' lawyer Michael Kennedy has said the plumber was not threatened and had only turned off the water after being told to do so by a deputy. Williams was unaware that the inmates intentionally clogged the toilet as part of an orchestrated plan to escape, Kennedy said. Authorities have made no mention of the cell having a clogged toilet.",
      "Over the weekend \u2014 in a seemingly unrelated incident \u2014 the jail received \u201cemergency repairs\u201d as water pooled and the facility remains forced to rely on an \u201cexternal water supply\" as of Wednesday, the sheriff's office said.",
      "Flooding in the jail has been exacerbated by inmates' \u201cmisuse the plumbing system\u201d such as flushing \u201cinappropriate items\u201d down the toilet, the sheriff's office added.",
      "While the Orleans Justice Center is only a decade old, dysfunction has long plagued the city\u2019s jail system.",

They also said all three bulleted fired may not have hit the prisoner's body.",

      "Mahdi was the second inmate to die in South Carolina by firing squad.",
      "The only photo of Mahdi taken at his autopsy shows two apparent chest wounds. Officials said all three bullets fired by the three volunteer prison employees hit Mahdi, with two going through the same hole.",
      "During the state\u2019s first firing squad death, the autopsy found that Brad Sigmon\u2019s heart had been destroyed. Just one of the four chambers of Mahdi\u2019s heart was perforated, which likely meant he didn\u2019t die in the 15 seconds experts predicted he would have if the squad\u2019s aim was true, according to his lawyers.",

      "But the state Supreme Court rejected the request for any reports the prison agency produces to review executions, the description of the training the firing squad conducts and the steps taken when an X-ray is done before the shooting to locate the heart.",
      "The justices also refused to require prison officials to say if the same members of the firing squad and target placement team used for Mahdi would work on Stanko's execution.",
      "\"Appellant has made no showing that Mahdi\u2019s execution was 'botched' or that protocols were not followed such that Appellant needs further information to make an informed election of the method of his execution,\" the justices wrote.",
      "Stanko is being executed for killing his 74-year-old friend Henry Turner. Stanko went to Turner\u2019s home in April 2006 after lying about his father dying and then shot Turner twice while using a pillow as a silencer, authorities said.",
      "Stanko stole Turner\u2019s truck, cleaned out his bank account and then spent the next few days in Augusta, Georgia, where he told people in town for the Masters golf tournament that he owned several Hooters restaurants. He stayed with a woman who took him to church. She then called police once she saw his photo and that he was wanted, police said.",
      "Hours before killing Turner, Stanko beat and strangled his girlfriend in her home and raped her daughter before slashing the teen\u2019s throat. The daughter survived and testified against him at one of his trials.",
      "\u201cStephen Stanko is just plain evil. He has in his core down deep inside something that makes him evil. He\u2019s a bad man, he knows it, and he likes it. He doesn\u2019t turn away from it. He will hide it. He\u2019s very, very, very good at hiding it, but you cannot equate evil with insanity,\u201d then-prosecutor Greg Hembree said in his closing statement at one of Stanko\u2019s trials.",

      "The California Interscholastic Federation announced the temporary rule change Tuesday after high school junior AB Hernandez's success drew backlash, including from President Donald Trump. He criticized the athlete's participation in a social media post Tuesday, though the group said it decided on the rule change before that.",
      "Here's what to know:",
      "Former California Gov. Jerry Brown signed a law in 2013 allowing students to participate in sex-segregated school programs, including on sports teams, and use bathrooms and other facilities that align with their gender identity.",
      "A Republican-led effort to block that law failed recently in the Democratic-dominated Legislature. Another proposal that also failed would have required the federation to ban students whose sex was assigned male at birth from participating on a girls school sports team.",
      "The federation said it was launching a \u201cpilot entry process\u201d to allow more girls participate in the championship track-and-field meet.",
      "Under the change, \u201cany biological female student-athlete who would have earned the next qualifying mark for one of their Section\u2019s automatic qualifying entries in the CIF State meet, and did not achieve the CIF State at-large mark in the finals at their Section meet\u201d could compete, the group said.",
      "If a transgender athlete medals, their ranking would not displace a \u201cbiological female\u201d student from medaling, the federation confirmed. In high jump, triple jump and long jump \u2014 all of the state championship events Hernandez qualified to compete in \u2014 a \u201cbiological female\u201d who would have earned podium placement will get the medal for that place and will be reflected in the records, the federal said.",
      "The federation did not specify how they define \u201cbiological female\" or how they would verify whether a competitor meets that definition.",
      "Experts from organizations including the American Medical Association, American Psychiatric Association and American Psychological Association say gender is a spectrum, not a binary structure consisting of only males and females.",
      "Hernandez, a trans athlete in Southern California, is at the center of the debate. She won the long jump and triple jump during the division finals and is expected to perform well this weekend. She also set a triple jump meet record at the Ontario Relays earlier this year.",
      "Critics have accused her of having an unfair advantage over other athletes.",
      "Hernandez told the publication Capital & Main earlier this month that she couldn't worry about the actions of critics, who have called out her participation and heckled her at postseason meets.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m still a child, you\u2019re an adult, and for you to act like a child shows how you are as a person,\u201d she said.",
      "She noted that she has lost some of her events, saying that disproved arguments that she can't be beat.",
      "The rule change may discriminate against transgender athletes, said Elana Redfield, a policy director at the UCLA School of Law Williams Institute, which researches sexual orientation and gender identity policies.",
      "\u201cThe CIF policy creates two sets of rules \u2014 one for transgender girls, who must earn a place through traditional measures of competition, and another for \u2018biological females,\u2019 some of whom are allowed an extra chance to earn a spot,\u201d Redfield said in an email.",
      "The change seems to \u201cthread a fine needle\u201d by trying to ensure cisgender girls aren't denied a competition slot while still allowing trans athletes to participate, Redfield said.",
      "Doriane Lambelet Coleman, a professor at Duke Law School, said the change would help ensure that \u201cno female athlete loses a place on a team or in a competition when a trans girl is included.\u201d",
      "\u201cUnlike inclusion policies that ignore sex differences, doing it this way doesn\u2019t gaslight the other girls about their biology,\u201d said Coleman, who has researches subjects including children, sports and law and wrote recently on the evolving definition of sex.",
      "Izzy Gardon, a spokesperson for California Gov. Gavin Newsom, called the rule change \u201ca reasonable, respectful way to navigate a complex issue without compromising competitive fairness\u201d and said the governor thought it was a thoughtful approach.

      "West Virginia's governor says his administration will improve transparency and policies within the state\u2019s embattled foster care system",
      "CHARLESTON, W.Va. -- West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey vowed Wednesday that his administration will improve transparency and policies within the state\u2019s embattled foster care system.",
      "Morrisey, a Republican, announced the changes after eight listening sessions statewide to identify areas of improvement and a review of critical cases. Morrisey said he heard attendees at one such session in Martinsburg discuss \u201ca broken system.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt was difficult to hear many of the issues could have been avoided had the state communicated differently, had the state eliminated some red tape or had the right tools to better equip\u201d Child Protective Services workers, Morrisey said at a news conference at the state Capitol. \u201cYou all know that these issues have been going on for a very, very long time. And unfortunately it\u2019s the kids that suffer. And we can\u2019t tolerate that.",
      "\u201cWest Virginia cannot keep kicking the can down the road as was done in the past. That\u2019s not the model of this administration.\u201d",
      "Largely overwhelmed by the opioid epidemic in a state with the most overdose deaths per capita, West Virginia has the highest rate of children in foster care \u2014 currently more than 6,000 in a state of about 1.8 million.",
      "Morrisey, who took office in January after serving three terms as the state's attorney general, put some of the blame on the administration of his predecessor, two-term Republican Gov. Jim Justice, for often withholding foster care information from the public, including stonewalling Freedom of Information Act requests.",
      "After an internal review of six fatalities or near fatalities between 2021 and 2024, Morrisey said the Department of Human Services will implement a new policy mandating that certain information, including the results of investigations, be disclosed in serious child welfare cases.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019re not going to have to chase people down the hall\u201d in obtaining case information, Morrisey said.",
      "Among the changes, Morrisey said child welfare supervisors will now be required to conduct monthly reviews of their cases, and a new intake process will be implemented for the foster care system, allowing caseworkers to contact individuals involved rather than simply relying on a case referral. He also said improvements have been made to a child welfare dashboard to allow for easier access to data.",
      "\"What I can promise you today is we want to be honest, we want to be transparent and we will be accountable for what happens,\u201d Morrisey said.",
      "West Virginia has been dogged by serious child welfare issues for decades.",
      "In 2014, a private boarding school for troubled youths closed in Salem after abuse allegations surfaced. Lawsuits against the former Miracle Meadows school\u2019s co-founder and its operating entities that alleged widespread sexual, physical and mental abuse were settled for tens of millions of dollars.",
      "The discovery of the emaciated body of a 14-year-old girl in her home in 2023 prompted a state investigation into whether law enforcement and child protective services could have intervened to prevent her death. The girl\u2019s mother and two grandparents were indicted on murder charges last September.",
      "In March a couple received the maximum sentences of decades in prison for abusing their adopted children, which included heavy labor, locking them in bedrooms, forcing some to sleep on concrete floors and making them stand for hours with their hands on their heads.",
      "And a judge in February ordered that a monitor be put in place to oversee state child protective services placements in hotels and camps on Friday after a 12-year-old boy in state care attempted suicide in a hotel room. The action came the same day that a federal judge dismissed a yearslong sweeping class action lawsuit against West Virginia\u2019s welfare system on behalf of foster children.",

      "There are plenty of hideouts in the rugged terrain of the Ozark Mountains where searchers are hunting for an ex-lawman known as the \u201cDevil in the Ozarks.\u201d",
      "There are plenty of hideouts in the rugged terrain of the Ozark Mountains, from abandoned cabins to campsites in the vast forests where searchers are hunting for an ex-lawman known as the \u201cDevil in the Ozarks.\u201d",
      "Others are not only off the grid but beneath it, in the hundreds of caves that lead to vast subterranean spaces.",
      "Local, state and federal law enforcement have continued to scour the region around the prison throughout the third day of the search.",
      "\u201cUntil we have credible evidence that he is not in the area, we assume that he\u2019s probably still in the area,\u201d Rand Champion, a spokesman for the Arkansas Department of Corrections, said at a press conference on Wednesday.",
      "Fugitive Grant Hardin, 56, \u201cknows where the caves are,\u201d said Darla Nix, a cafe owner in Pea Ridge, Arkansas, whose sons grew up around him. Nix, who describes Hardin as a survivor, remembers him as a \u201cvery, very smart\u201d and mostly quiet person.",
      "For the searchers, \"caves have definitely been a source of concern and a point of emphasis,\" said Champion.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s one of the challenges of this area \u2014 there are a lot of places to hide and take shelter, a lot of abandoned sheds, and there are a lot of caves in this area, so that\u2019s been a priority for the search team,\u201d Champion said.",
      "The area around the prison is \"one of the most cave-dense regions of the state,\u201d said Matt Covington, a University of Arkansas geology professor who studies caves.",
      "Hardin, the former police chief in the small town of Gateway near the Arkansas-Missouri border, was serving lengthy sentences for murder and rape. He was the subject of the TV documentary \u201cDevil in the Ozarks.\u201d",
      "He escaped Sunday from the North Central Unit \u2014 a medium-security prison also known as the Calico Rock prison \u2014 by wearing an outfit designed to look like a law enforcement uniform, according to Champion. A prison officer opened a secure gate, allowing him to leave the facility. Champion said that someone should have checked Hardin's identity before he was allowed to leave the facility, describing the lack of verification as a \u201clapse\u201d that is being investigated.",
      "It took authorities approximately 30 minutes to notice Hardin had escaped.",
      "Champion said that inmates are evaluated and given a classification when they first enter the prison system to determine where they are housed. There are portions of the Calico Rock facility that are maximum-security.",
      "While incarcerated, Hardin did not have any major disciplinary issues, Champion said.",
      "Authorities have been using canines, drones and helicopters to search for Hardin in the rugged northern Arkansas terrain, Champion said. The sheriffs of several counties across the Arkansas Ozarks had urged residents to lock their homes and vehicles and call 911 if they notice anything suspicious.",
      "In some ways, the terrain is similar to the site of one of the most notorious manhunts in U.S. history.",
      "Bomber Eric Rudolph, described by authorities as a skilled outdoorsman, evaded law officers for years in the Appalachian Mountains of western North Carolina. It was a five-year manhunt that finally ended in 2003 with his capture.",
      "Rudolph knew of many cabins in the area owned by out-of-town people, and he also knew of caves in the area, former FBI executive Chris Swecker, who led the agency\u2019s Charlotte, North Carolina, office at the time, said in the FBI's historical account of the case.",
      "\u201cHe was anticipating a great conflict and he had clearly lined up caves and campsites where he could go,\u201d Swecker said.",
      "Rudolph pleaded guilty to federal charges associated with four bombings in Georgia and Alabama.",
      "There are nearly 2,000 documented caves in northern Arkansas, state officials say. Many of them have entrances only a few feet wide that are not obvious to passersby, said Michael Ray Taylor, who has written multiple books on caves, including \u201cHidden Nature: Wild Southern Caves.\u201d",
      "The key is finding the entrance, Taylor said.",
      "\u201cThe entrance may look like a rabbit hole, but if you wriggle through it, suddenly you find enormous passageways,\u201d he said.",
      "It would be quite possible to hide out underground for an extended period, but \u201cyou have to go out for food, and you're more likely to be discovered,\u201d he said.",
      "Hardin had a checkered and brief law enforcement career. He worked at the Fayetteville Police Department from August 1990 to May 1991, but was let go because he didn\u2019t meet the standards of his training period, a department spokesman said.",
      "Hardin worked about six months at the Huntsville Police Department before resigning, but records do not give a reason for his resignation, according to Police Chief Todd Thomas, who joined the department after Hardin worked there.",
      "Hardin later worked at the Eureka Springs Police Department from 1993 to 1996. Former Chief Earl Hyatt said Hardin resigned because Hyatt was going to fire him over incidents that included the use of excessive force.",
      "\u201cHe did not need to be a police officer at all,\u201d Hyatt told television station KNWA.",
      "He continued to have trouble in his brief stint as an officer in Gateway, according to the 450-person town's mayor Cheryl Tillman.",
      "While Hardin was the town's sole officer, \u201cthere was things that I seen that wasn\u2019t good. He was always angry,\u201d said Tillman, who wasn't mayor at the time.",
      "Hardin pleaded guilty in 2017 to first-degree murder for the killing of James Appleton, 59. Appleton, who was Tillman's brother, worked for the Gateway water department when he was shot in the head on Feb. 23, 2017, near Garfield. Police found Appleton\u2019s body inside a car. Hardin was sentenced to 30 years in prison.",
      "He was also serving 50 years for the 1997 rape of an elementary school teacher in Rogers, north of Fayetteville.",
      "He had been held in the Calico Rock prison since 2017.",

      "The Rosebud Sioux Tribe in South Dakota is declaring a state of emergency on its reservation",
      "SIOUX FALLS, S.D. -- The Rosebud Sioux Tribe in South Dakota has declared a public safety state of emergency on its reservation, asking for more law enforcement resources from the federal government.",
      "It's the tribe's third emergency declaration in six years as members contend with methamphetamine and other illicit drug use, trafficking and gun violence on the Rosebud Indian Reservation. The tribe previously declared states of emergency in 2019 and 2024.",
      "Kathleen Wooden Knife, president of the Rosebud Sioux Tribe, wrote in the declaration on Tuesday that the emergency is due to \u201cpervasive law and order and public health issues ... creating threats to public safety, the health and welfare of the general public.\u201d",
      "The declaration asked for increased patrol and investigative support from federal agencies, cooperation from the 12 communities on the reservation and coordination between the tribe and federal government.",
      "Law enforcement is stretched thin on many reservations in the U.S., leading some tribes to sue the federal government. In a lawsuit the Oglala Sioux tribe filed against the Bureau of Indian Affairs, a federal judge ruled that the U.S. government is obligated by treaty to support law enforcement on the Pine Ridge Reservation.",
      "The Rosebud Indian Reservation has a dozen law enforcement officers for an area that stretches nearly 1 million acres (404,686 hectares) across five counties, said Lewis Good Voice Eagle, chief of staff to Wooden Knife. Low staffing is partially due to 2016 budget cuts, as well as difficulty retaining officers who don't receive the same benefits as they would working elsewhere.",
      "After previous emergency declarations, the reservation received help from the U.S. Attorney's Office, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Department of Interior, though it was not enough to solve the problems, Good Voice Eagle said.",
      "\u201cWith the shortage of law enforcement and the shortage of juris doctorate barred attorneys, it has really created another nightmare on the Rosebud Indian Reservation,\u201d he said.",
      "Crime on South Dakota's nine Native American reservations has been a longstanding issue and the subject of tense relations with former South Dakota governor and current Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. The nine tribes in the state banned her from tribal lands last year for saying publicly that tribal leaders were catering to drug cartels on the reservations.",

      "Ajay Dev, 58, was released May 23 after 16 years in prison for 76 convictions of sexual assault on a minor and related charges, the San Francisco Chronicle reported Tuesday.",
      "Superior Court Judge Janene Beronio scheduled a hearing for June 13 for Yolo County District Attorney Jeff Reisig to decide whether to retry Dev. Prosecutors could also appeal the ruling. Reisig's office declined to comment on the case.",
      "Dev, an immigrant from Nepal who worked as a water engineer, was visiting the South Asian nation with his wife in 1998 when they decided to adopt 15-year-old Sapna Dev, part of their extended family, and bring her to live with them in Davis, California.",
      "In early 2004, Sapna Dev\u2019s boyfriend broke up with her, and she accused Ajay Dev of causing the breakup, Beronio said in her ruling. Later she told police that Ajay Dev had had sex with her two or three times a week for three or four years until she moved out of his home, the judge said.",
      "Four witnesses who had not been contacted by Dev\u2019s trial lawyers testified at a recent hearing that Sapna Dev had told them that her accusations against him were lies or were motivated by her anger at him, the Chronicle reported.",

Her defense attorneys filed notice that she intended to plead not guilty by reason of insanity, saying that at the time of the wreck she was suffering from a \u201cdelusional compulsion\u201d caused by mental illness that absolves her of criminal liability. The DeKalb County district attorney's office wanted to present evidence that Wierson had stopped taking some medication prescribed to treat bipolar disorder, arguing that the jury should be allowed to consider that she voluntarily contributed to her mental state.",
      "The trial court said the state could use that evidence, but the state Court of Appeals reversed that ruling in a pretrial appeal. The state then appealed to the state Supreme Court, which upheld the intermediate appeals court's ruling.",
      "An Atlanta-area psychologist with a years-long history of bipolar disorder, Wierson believed at the time of the crash that she was on a mission from God to save her daughter from being killed, her lawyers have said.",
      "Georgia law outlines two tests for someone seeking to use an insanity defense at trial. Both have to do with the person\u2019s mental state \u201cat the time of\u201d the alleged crime. The first says a person shall not be found guilty of a crime if they \u201cdid not have mental capacity to distinguish between right and wrong\u201d related to the act. The second says a person shall not be found guilty of a crime if the person acted because of \u201ca delusional compulsion\u201d that \u201covermastered\u201d their will.",
      "An expert hired by the defense and another engaged by the court found that Wierson met both of those criteria. Justice Andrew Pinson wrote in Wednesday's majority opinion that the law says nothing about the cause of the person's mental state at the time of the crime.",
      "\u201cPut simply, the plain language of the insanity-defense statutes gives not even a hint that these defenses would not be available to a person who has \u2018brought about\u2019 the relevant mental state voluntarily, whether by not taking medication or otherwise,\u201d he wrote.",
      "Robert Rubin, a lawyer for Wierson, has said that his client is \u201chaunted by the tragic consequences\u201d of her actions. But he said in an email Wednesday that he hopes the Supreme Court ruling will allow the case to be resolved without a trial.",
      "\u201cThe Georgia Supreme Court reaffirmed the basic principle that the focus of an insanity case is the defendant\u2019s state of mind at the time of the act,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe State never disputed that our client was insane at the time of the accident. Its attempt to make this case about alleged medication compliance was misplaced and dragged this case out unnecessarily.\u201d",
      "The DeKalb County district attorney's office did not immediately have a comment Wednesday. Bruce Hagen, a lawyer for the Jenness family said in an email that he was \u201cvery disappointed, although not surprised\u201d by the high court's ruling.",
      "In its ruling on this case, the Supreme Court also overturned its own ruling in a 1982 case that had created an exception to the insanity defenses. That case involved a man diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia who, against his doctor's orders, put himself in a highly stressful situation and ended up killing two people.",

      "A 19-year-old man has been charged with assault and weapons crimes in a shooting at a Connecticut mall that wounded five people",
      "A 19-year-old man was charged with assault and weapons crimes after he allegedly shot five people at a Connecticut mall during a dispute, authorities said Wednesday.",
      "Tajuan Washington, who was free on $20,000 bail on unrelated motor vehicle charges, drove to police headquarters under police surveillance and surrendered following Tuesday's shooting at the Brass Mill Center in Waterbury, city Police Chief Fernando Spagnolo said during a news conference.",
      "The injuries were not life-threatening, officials said.",
      "The shooting shortly after 4:30 p.m. sent mall patrons scrambling for safety. Dozens of law enforcement officers responded and searched the mall for hours. Police identified Washington on security video, seeing him leave the mall and drive away, Spagnolo said.",
      "Washington was detained on $2 million bond and was expected to appear in court Wednesday. It was not immediately clear if he had a lawyer for the shooting case who could respond to the allegations.",
      "Lawrence Adler, a lawyer for Washington on the motor vehicle charges that include interfering with police, said Washington denies those allegations and called the case insignificant. He said he did not know much about the mall shooting.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s nothing about his past to lead anyone to say this kid\u2019s on a path to hurting people,\u201d Adler said.",
      "Waterbury Mayor Paul Pernerewski Jr. said three people have been discharged from the hospital and two were still being treated. The person most seriously injured, a woman who was shot in the spine, had regained some feeling in her extremities and officials were hoping she isn't permanently paralyzed, he said.",
      "Washington and a man who was with four young women got into a dispute and Washington pulled a pistol, Pernerewski said.",
      "\u201cIt was in effect two young men who knew each other, had a history and a past,\u201d the mayor said.",
      "The city was shaken but not broken, Pernerewski said.",
      "\u201cThis is a strong city, and we are very much standing together in times of crisis,\" he said. \"We support and we care for one another.\u201d",
      "Spagnolo did not release details of the dispute, saying it was not entirely clear but police had some idea what it was about.",
      "Spagnolo said evidence indicated the shooter used a .40-caliber handgun, which had not been found. Police with a search warrant seized two rifles and found ammunition at Washington\u2019s home that matched some ammunition at the mall, Spagnolo said.",
      "Police surveilling Washington\u2019s home followed him as he drove to police headquarters to report he had been involved in the dispute, Spagnolo said.",
      "It was shocking that a dispute that might have just been a fistfight became a shooting instead, Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont said at the news conference.",
      "\u201cSomeone pulls out a semiautomatic and shoots seven rounds and badly wounds five people like that \u2014 just like that,\u201d Lamont said.",
      "Police and witnesses described the chaos of people crying and running, others locking themselves inside areas of the mall, and swarms of police searching for the shooter.",
      "Jayvon Turner told WFSB-TV that one of the victims was bleeding heavily. \u201cIt was crazy and I tried to tell everybody to get out of there,\" he said.",
      "Court records show Washington was accepted into a probation program earlier this year for another set of charges, which have been sealed from public view under the state law for that program, which is generally for first-time offenders.",
      "The Brass Mill Center is located off Interstate 84 in Waterbury, about 30 miles (about 50 kilometers) southwest of Hartford, the state capital. Spagnolo said police have used the mall for active shooter drills in the past, and that helped officers during the response.",

      "A federal judge has immediately rejected a defense request for a mistrial at the sex trafficking trial of music mogul Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs",
      "NEW YORK -- A federal judge immediately rejected a defense request for a mistrial on Wednesday at the sex trafficking trial of Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs, after his attorneys said prosecutors tried to imply to a jury that the music mogul interfered with the investigation into rapper Kid Cudi's firebombed Porsche in 2012.",
      "Although such mistrial requests are common during lengthy federal trials involving hundreds of pieces of evidence and dozens of witnesses, this was the first request at Combs\u2019 trial, which is in its third week of testimony in Manhattan. Combs has been active in his defense, regularly writing notes to his lawyers, and they have consulted with him as they questioned witnesses.",
      "Judge Arun Subramanian instructed the jury to disregard testimony about the destruction of fingerprint cards that occurred months after Cudi's car was set ablaze. Weeks before that firebombing, Combs became enraged when he learned that Cudi was dating Cassie, the singer who had a nearly 11-year relationship with Combs from 2007 to 2018.",
      "The Molotov cocktail used to burn Cudi\u2019s car in his Hollywood Hills driveway was fashioned out of a 40-ounce Old English 800 malt liquor bottle and a designer handkerchief, according to Lance Jimenez, an arson investigator for the Los Angeles Fire Department, and photographs shown in court.",
      "The defense\u2019s mistrial request came after Jimenez testified that fingerprints taken from Cudi\u2019s burned up Porsche 911 were destroyed in August 2012, about eight months after the fire. Jimenez said someone in the Los Angeles Police Department who was not involved in the investigation ordered the fingerprint cards destroyed. He said that was not normal protocol.",
      "Combs, 55, has pleaded not guilty to charges that he led a racketeering conspiracy for 20 years that relied on fear and violence to get what he wanted. If convicted, he could face 15 years to life in prison. Cassie and other witnesses have testified that she was repeatedly beaten by Combs, and she said she was frequently coerced to engage in unwanted sex acts.",
      "Defense attorney Alexandra Shapiro asked for the mistrial during a morning break with the jury out of the room. She told Subramanian that \u201cprosecutorial misconduct\u201d had occurred and said \u201cthere's no way to un-ring this bell.\u201d",
      "She said prosecutors were on notice during jury selection that some prospective jurors had to be eliminated from consideration for the jury because they believed Combs could buy his way out of the racketeering conspiracy he's charged with.",
      "\u201cThese questions were designed to play right into that,\u201d she said.",
      "Defense lawyer Marc Agnifilo called the prosecution\u2019s conduct \u201coutrageous.\u201d",
      "Combs\u2019 lawyers argued that the prosecution\u2019s questions and Jimenez\u2019s resulting testimony was highly prejudicial because prosecutors were suggesting that Combs had something to do with the destruction of the records.",
      "Assistant U.S. Attorney Christy Slavik said \u201ca mistrial is absolutely unwarranted here.\u201d She said the subject of fingerprints was raised to counter defense suggestions through questions posed to other witnesses that the car firebombing was poorly investigated and that the area was not canvassed for fingerprints.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/john-mauceri-pericardial-constriction-nyu-langone-heart-health/",
    "published": "Tue, 27 May 2025 08:10:59 -0400",
    "summary": "John Mauceri had a complicated health history, but his sudden swelling and fatigue left his team of doctors stumped.",
    "story": [
      "Conductor John Mauceri is no stranger to health struggles. He was diagnosed with psoriatic arthritis in 2017, then chronic lymphocytic leukemia and interstitial lung disease in 2019. Medication treated the conditions and sent the cancer into remission, but he has remained on the lookout for recurrence.",
      "In December 2023, Mauceri, then 78, contracted COVID-19. He struggled to climb the stairs and developed a \"troublesome\" cough. He went to the emergency room at NYU Langone, where he has previously received medical care. An X-ray found viral pneumonia and severe lung disease. Doctors removed three liters of liquid from his left lung. The only relief, he said, was that there was no trace of cancer. He left the hospital about a week later.",
      "Within weeks, new symptoms quickly emerged. First, his left ankle swelled. Then the swelling continued up his leg. As the weeks passed, the swelling entered his abdomen and inched down his right leg. At one point, Mauceri was gaining a pound every day. He was also dealing with fatigue and shortness of breath. He couldn't conduct.",
      "\"I was wearing somebody else's body, at least from my waist down. I couldn't wear normal clothes,\" Mauceri said. \"Putting shoes on was hard. I couldn't walk through my house.\"",
      "No one on his care team could identify what was causing the symptoms.",
      "\"I had an oncologist, I had a pulmonologist, a rheumatologist. I had a lot of doctors, and they all thought it was somebody else's domain,\" Mauceri said.",
      "Searching for a diagnosis",
      "Dr. Adam Skolnick, a cardiologist at NYU Langone and one of Mauceri's doctors, said the team first looked for more common causes for the swelling. Mauceri underwent MRIs and other tests. An exam found his lymph system was working normally. Cardiac catheterization, where a thin tube is guided through the heart, found no signs of heart disease. There were no signs of blood clots, cancer recurrence or other likely conditions.",
      "Meanwhile, the swelling was beginning to strain Mauceri's body, putting him at risk of multi-organ failure.",
      "While studying the images of Mauceri's heart, Skolnick began to form a theory. But \"the only definitive way to fully diagnose and treat Mr. Mauceri would be through surgery to open the chest,\" the doctor said.",
      "What is pericardial constriction?",
      "Skolnick thought Mauceri might have pericardial constriction, which occurs when the sac around the heart, or the pericardium, is thickened by scarring. That prevents the heart from fully opening. It can create pressure, resulting in swelling in the legs and abdomen.",
      "It's a rare condition that is usually acquired because of a prior illness, Skolnick said, including viral infections like COVID-19.",
      "Since there are no tests that look at the pericardium specifically, Mauceri would have to undergo open-heart surgery to confirm the diagnosis. The condition would also be treated in that same surgery. After Mauceri's care team eliminated all other possible options, they decided it was time to go into the operating room in June 2024.",
      "Mauceri accepted that the surgery was his only option.",
      "\"There was no alternative,\" he said. \"I said, 'Well, let's just do it.'\"",
      "A high-risk surgery",
      "Dr. Eugene Grossi, a cardiothoracic surgeon and leader of NYU Langone Heart's robotic surgery team, performed Mauceri's surgery. When he opened the conductor's chest, he found that Mauceri's \"heart was trapped\" inside a thick shell of scarring. Typically, the pericardium is like a paper bag. Mauceri's was like shoe leather, Grossi said.",
      "\"You don't think about it, but your lungs expand with every breath you take. Your chest wall opens. Your lungs expand. The heart does also, because it has to be able to accept the blood that's coming back from your arteries and veins. And his was just trapped,\" Grossi explained. That entrapment leads to fluid retention, creating swelling, Grossi said.",
      "Under the scarring, Mauceri's heart was functioning well. With the diagnosis made, Grossi and the surgical team had to scrape the pericardium and attached scar tissue carefully off the heart. Removing the pericardium creates no lasting health issues, but the procedure, called a pericardiectomy, is a delicate one.",
      "\"It's almost like the heart is a hard-boiled egg, and we're peeling off the shell,\" Grossi said.",
      "Mauceri's procedure went smoothly, his doctor said. Once the pericardium was removed, Mauceri's urine output bag began to fill, proving to the surgeons that the pressure was off and blood was pumping smoothly.",
      "\"Every day is a miracle\"",
      "After Mauceri was released from the hospital, he quickly began losing weight. He said he feels like he's in the best shape he's been since college.",
      "\"This is extraordinary because not only did I survive it, but I'm stronger than ever as a result of it,\" Mauceri said.",
      "His health struggles didn't end immediately. Shortly after the heart surgery, he was hospitalized again for a blockage of the small intestine. That was quickly treated, again at NYU Langone, but it slowed his recovery. It wasn't until December 2024, more than a year after he was diagnosed with COVID-19, that Mauceri was able to conduct an orchestra again.",
      "Mauceri conducted back-to-back performances in London and Paris, getting used to being onstage again. In May, he traveled to Japan to conduct in Tokyo. The 13-hour flight and long performance days felt like the first test of his endurance after his illnesses, he said. The performance was a raging success.",
      "Mauceri said he has no plans to slow down now that he's back to work. In between spending time with his family in New York City, he plans to travel the country for other concerts, including at the Hollywood Bowl in October, shortly after his 80th birthday.",
      "\"I was conducting as if I wasn't on the cusp of being 80 anymore,\" he said. \"I was allowed to do that because my doctors gave me this added time in my life where I can do that. So every day is a miracle. Every day I'm grateful for what they did.\"",

The condition is relatively uncommon but is more likely to occur in older people, according to the\u00a0Cleveland Clinic. There's no known cause of the condition.",
      "\"Usually, it just comes out of the blue. We really don't know why,\" CBS News chief medical correspondent Dr. Jon LaPook said.",

      "Doctors, environmental groups and residents are trying to figure out if there is a causal connection between pollutants from the steel industry and rates of cancer in Gary, Indiana.",
      "Pollutants you can see, and tiny particulates you can't, come from different types of industry in the Gary region. But according to Environmental Protection Agency records, steel production plants release the most toxins of all the industries in the region.",
      "Beryl Fitzpatrick is one of the residents affected. You can hear the cancer as she speaks.",
      "\"I was having trouble swallowing,\" she recalled.",
      "Fitzpatrick was diagnosed with Stage 3 tongue cancer. She didn't know if she would ever speak again after doctors removed part of her tongue while removing a cancerous tumor, but she fought to keep her voice.",
      "\"I had to learn phonics. I had to learn, I had to learn words and sounds,\" she said. \"It was humbling.\"",
      "And she knows the very air in her own backyard could be playing a role in her disease.",
      "\"It's almost certain that her place of residence, with the high pollution and other industrial output contributed to her cancer,\" said Dr. Kerstin Stenson, lead of the head and neck cancer program at Rush University Medical Center who's been treating Fitzpatrick.",
      "The City of Gary was built by the steel industry, but when families like Fitzpatrick's moved to the region in droves from the South during the Great Migration for jobs and opportunities, they didn't know as much as we do now about the health risks linked to industrial production.",
      "\"A lot of the teachers would talk about students that had asthma,\" Fitzpatrick said.",
      "Seven major coal-powered steel production plants operate in the United States. Three plants are clustered in the Gary region: Burns Harbor, Gary Works and Indiana Harbor.",
      "CBS News Chicago Investigators dug into state and federal data from the Environmental Protection Agency to see how these facilities impact the community.",
      "Our investigation found that in 2023, the latest data available, the three mills emitted 25 million pounds of toxins, more industrial pollution than the combined toxic release of the four similar mills in other states.",
      "\"We do not need to sacrifice health and communities to make steel,\" said Hilary Lewis, a director of Industrial Labs.",
      "Industrial Labs, a nonprofit environmental organization, released a report in October 2024 detailing its findings on the steel industry's impact on the community.",
      "\"The people in Northwest Indiana are bearing the brunt of the coal-based steel industry today,\" she said.",
      "The study found people living near one steel production facility have a 12% to 26% higher risk of getting cancer. People in Gary live near three.",
      "And cancer isn't the only health risk associated with this kind of industrial exposure.",
      "Industrial Labs' study found people living in Gary are in the top 10% of the nation at risk for developing asthma. Even Gary Mayor Eddie Melton grew up with asthma, and the irony of the steel industry that built the city now being the thing making people sick is not lost on him.",
      "\"I mean, that's a stark reality that a lot of folks have to deal with,\" Melton said.",
      "The mayor wants this dealt with, in part, by toughening toxic emissions standards. But that may not happen; in March, the federal EPA announced it's considering lowering some standards polluters must meet.",
      "\"What we're seeing from a federal and state government concerns me, in terms of rolling back the regulations on industries such as the steel industry, and other industries,\" Mayor Melton said.",
      "Gary already fails to meet federal air quality standards. Lake County, Indiana has more toxic releases than 99% of all other counties across the country, and the state ranks second in the nation for the most industrial pollution released per square mile.",
      "So what is the EPA doing for the people of Gary?",
      "\"They're responsible for protecting clean air,\" Lewis said. \"And right now, they're not doing that.\"",
      "CBS News Chicago Investigatiors dug into EPA records dating back to 1977 and found that since then the EPA took 152 formal actions against the steel production facilities. Nearly half of those actions were for violating the Clean Air Act. For those air pollution violations, regulators issued more than $23 million in penalties paid by the parent companies.",
      "\"If you're a multi-billion-dollar corporation, fees and fines probably are just a drop in the bucket for you,\" Melton said.",
      "Both the state and federal EPA declined interviews but sent statements saying they act when facilities are out of compliance, and those actions have reduced air emissions.",
      "Fitzpatrick lives about 43 blocks from the largest steel mill in the nation, and we found they released more pollutants than any other steel or iron mill tracked by the EPA across the country.",
      "More than half the industrial pollution in Lake County comes from Gary Works, which is owned by U.S Steel.",
      "U.S. Steel declined an interview, but responded to questions by email, saying the EPA's data includes byproducts \"legally emitted,\" and said they have systems in place to comply with environmental regulations.",
      "In regards to the Industrial Labs report, U.S. Steel said it was \"designed to create media attention rather than reach any scientific conclusions.\"",
      "Fitzpatrick has lived in Gary for 60 of her 71 years, never fully knowing what she was exposed to.",
      "\"I didn't think I was living a lifestyle that was polluting my body,\" she said.",
      "She wasn't. Dr. Stenson said Fitzpatrick doesn't have the typical risk factors for her cancer. And she's not alone.",
      "\"There are many patients that have come from that industrial area that would present with head and neck cancer without risk factors,\" Stenson said.",
      "Gary has been notorious for its pollution for decades.",
      "Dr. Mihir Bhayani, also at Rush University Medical Center, is getting closer to directly linking air pollution and some cancers. The new research he is working on could force change.",
      "\"What we are working on currently is, again, a direct causal link between air pollution and head and neck cancer,\" he said.",
      "He believes steel mills are making people sick in Gary, and he wants to see emissions standards toughened.",
      "\"So that individuals who are living in those areas, they're exposed to the same clean air that individuals who are living in more affluent areas are,\" he said.",
      "\"The types of communities that this industry is impacting are disproportionately people of color and low-income communities,\" said Lewis.",
      "More than 76% of Gary's population is Black, and the average income is less than $23,000 a year.",
      "About four hours away from Gary by car is the steel plant in Middletown, Ohio. It's getting a major portion of a $500 million federal grant to change the steel-making process and cut hazardous pollution in that city, which has an average income of $30,000 a year and is 73% white.",
      "Fitzpatrick believes more would be done to keep the air clean and her community healthy if Gary's demographics were different.",
      "\"I am worthy. No matter what you think about my Black skin, my dark skin, I'm worthy. I'm worthy for this community to be cleaned up and I am a person worthy of a good life,\" she said.",
      "Gary and other communities found to be disproportionately impacted by pollution were getting extra help from the federal EPA's Environmental Justice office, but in April it was labeled a DEI program and shut down.",
      "If nothing is done, Bhayani said, there will be long-term effects on people living in communities like Gary.",
      "\"They are going to have higher rates of cancer. They're going to have higher rates of cardiac disease. They're going to have high rates of lung disease,\" Bhayani said.",
      "That's why Fitzgerald, who fought for her voice while still battling the disease that nearly took it, said she'll do whatever it takes to make change here so that it can be different for someone else.",
      "\"As long as I have breath and I can breathe and I have strength to get up, I'm going to join other people, like-minded people. We're going to fight. We're going to fight,\" she said.",
      "Cleveland Cliffs, which owns two of the plants in Northwest Indiana, did not return messages from CBS News Chicago Investigators. U.S. Steel maintains its work is essential to the health of the American economy.",
      "But Fitzgerald and others who live there worry about their own health, and they're asking lawmakers to step up and join their fight for cleaner air.",

      "FULL STATEMENTS",
      "On whether they have studied the impact of releases from Gary Works and the health effects, including cancer and asthma, in the community:",
      "\"In 2020, the EPA deemed that there was an ample margin of safety around iron and steel emissions to protect public health and prevent adverse environmental effects.\"",
      "It is important to note that there are many industrial facilities in Northwest Indiana. Focusing solely on Gary Works as a source of pollution is both incorrect and irresponsible.",
      "On the study released by Industrial Labs:",
      "\"It is clear that these conclusions were pre-determined by a group that describes itself as 'scaling campaigns and building a movement to clean up heavy industry', which is to say that this document is designed to create media attention rather than reach any scientific conclusions. There are certain interests campaigning to eliminate U.S.-based blast furnaces, which are essential to national security and the health of America's economy because they are the only facilities capable of making certain types and qualities of steels required for critical applications.\"",
      "On residents believing toxic releases would not be allowed at the same level in more affluent communities with different demographics:",
      "\"Federal and state emissions laws and regulations apply equally to any municipality in the same jurisdiction. Gary, Indiana, is no exception. We care deeply about the communities where we live and work, as evidenced by the contributions by the Company and our employees. Since 2020, U. S. Steel Gary Works and its employees have donated over $1.3 million dollars to community organizations and efforts. In addition, our dedicated employees volunteer countless hours of their time to organizations and schools across the area. Our more than 3,400 Gary Works employees put safety and environmental compliance first. We are proud of their work and the Northwest Indiana community we call home.\"",
      "\"In addition to our spend on environmental compliance and community investment and engagement, we were the only U.S. Metals, Minerals and Mining company recognized as one of the World's Most Ethical Companies for 2025- the fourth consecutive year we received this designation. It is a testament to our commitment to ethical conduct and compliance.\"",
      "\"Gary Works was built in 1908, and the city was built around it. Any notion that we select certain areas to operate because of their demographics is wholly incorrect.\"",
      "On state and federal EPA fines, violations and consent decrees:",
      "\"U. S. Steel spends more than $80 million annually on environmental controls in Indiana as part of its commitment to environmental excellence. The EPA's Toxic Release Inventory, from which this data is drawn, includes manufacturing byproducts that are legally emitted under the EPA's stringent regulations and those which are legally disposed of in permitted landfills. As the nation's largest integrated steelmaking facility, it is common sense that U. S. Steel's Gary Works will have more legally allowed releases than smaller iron or steel mills in the country.\"",
      "Additional comment on emissions controls and other projects:",
      "\"U. S. Steel has robust systems and emissions control equipment at all levels of the steelmaking process to adhere to environmental regulations.",
      "At Gary Works, our processes and environmental controls are monitored extensively by our teams. Third parties are also used for sampling water and for opacity observation to ensure compliance with regulations.",
      "Our partnership with CarbonFree is one of the ways we're working to reduce emissions. This carbon capture and utilization project will help us reduce greenhouse gas emissions by converting emissions to calcium carbonate, which is used in a variety of products for consumers and industry.\u00a0 Gary Works also produces Pig Iron, an important feedstock for U. S. Steel's electric arc furnaces. The Company is on track to meet its goal of 20% greenhouse gas emissions reduction by 2030 goal and has a goal of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.\"",
      "IDEM is not a health agency nor a legislative body. IDEM is also not involved in local zoning decisions that determine where businesses are located.",
      "IDEM is responsible for implementing and enforcing existing federal and state environmental regulations. This includes issuing operating permits that ensure businesses comply with applicable environmental standards and conducting routine inspections to monitor compliance. When facilities are found to be out of compliance, IDEM can initiate enforcement actions or refer cases for further legal or administrative review.",
      "The U.S. EPA does require states to submit a state implementation plan (SIP) for areas in nonattainment within its borders. You can find more information on the SIPs for Lake and Porter counties here: https://www.in.gov/idem/sips/",
      "In 2013, IDEM conducted an assessment of air toxics in the industrialized area of Lake and Porter County. The complete Lakeshore Air Toxics Study is available here: https://www.in.gov/idem/toxic/studies/lakeshore-air-toxics-study. The study found air toxics concentrations and risk within the lakeshore area to be similar to comparable communities, and the most significant risk is attributable to mobile sources (motor vehicles). In the time since the study, technological advances and pollution prevention strategies have led to a further decline in industrial emissions.",
      "We recognize that air quality is a deeply important issue for Northwest Indiana residents and remain committed to our responsibilities under the Clean Air Act and other applicable laws. For more specific responses to questions involving federal enforcement actions, health data, or proposed changes to emission standards, we encourage you to follow up directly with the U.S. EPA.",
      "EPA is fulfilling its mission to protect human health and the environment. The agency works with our state partners to ensure industrial facilities comply with all environmental laws and regulations.",
      "EPA performs on-site and off-site inspections to ensure compliance. If noncompliance is found, EPA takes action. EPA has issued three recent Clean Air Act enforcement settlements, which have significantly reduced air emissions. In Burns Harbor, Cleveland Cliffs BOF steel making shop and Phoenix Global slag processing companies and in Gary, the U.S. Steel Gary Works' blast furnace have all decreased particulate matter and metal hazardous air pollutants to the atmosphere. Our state partner, the Indiana Department of Environmental Management, also conducts inspections and enforcement actions.",
      "Previous compliance and enforcement work, including inspections and enforcement activity, can be found in EPA's ECHO system. You can search by location or by facility. Keep in mind that the integrated iron and steel mills that you reference may have contractors on site that have separate permits and emissions reporting.",
      "The northern portions of Lake and Porter Counties are part of a larger Chicago area that was found to be out of compliance with the ground-level ozone (or \"smog\") standard.\u00a0 Ozone high in the atmosphere protects people from harmful ultraviolet rays but at ground-level it can trigger a variety of health problems, such as lung irritation.",

      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's airport screening program has detected multiple cases of the new COVID-19 variant NB.1.8.1, which has been linked to a large surge of the virus in China.",
      "Cases linked to the NB.1.8.1 variant have been reported in arriving international travelers at airports in California, Washington state, Virginia and the New York City area, according to records uploaded by the CDC's airport testing partner Ginkgo Bioworks.",
      "Details about the sequencing results, which were published in recent weeks on the GISAID, or Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data, virus database, show the cases stem from travelers from a number of countries, including Japan, South Korea, France, Thailand, the Netherlands, Spain, Vietnam, China and Taiwan. The travelers were tested from April 22 through May 12, the records show.",
      "Cases of NB.1.8.1 have also now been reported by health authorities in other states, including Ohio, Rhode Island and Hawaii, separate from the airport cases. In California and Washington state, the earliest cases date back to late March and early April.",
      "Experts have been closely watching the variant, which is now dominant in China and is on the rise in parts of Asia. Hong Kong authorities say that rates of COVID-19 in the city have climbed to the worst levels they have seen in at least a year, after a \"significant increase\" in reported emergency room visits and hospitalizations driven by COVID-19.",
      "\"CDC is aware of reported cases of COVID-19 NB.1.8.1 in China and is in regular contact with international partners,\" a CDC spokesperson said in a statement.",

      "The strain came up multiple times during a Thursday meeting of the Food and Drug Administration's outside vaccine advisers, as they wrestled with whether and how to recommend updating COVID-19 vaccines for the coming fall and winter seasons.",
      "Vaccines from last season targeted a descendant of the JN.1 variant called KP.2. Early data presented to the committee by Pfizer and Moderna suggested switching to a different JN.1 descendant that has been dominant in recent months, called LP.8.1, could boost protection against NB.1.8.1, too.",
      "\"The LP.8.1 vaccine has the highest titers against LP.8.1, which is dominant in the U.S. and many other regions and cross-neutralizes other currently circulating variants, including NB.1.8.1, a dominant JN.1 subvariant in many Asian countries,\" Darin Edwards, lead of Moderna's COVID-19 program, told the panel.",
      "The committee unanimously backed recommending that the coming season's vaccines should target some kind of JN.1 variant, but was split on the details. Some favored allowing vaccine makers to stick with last season's vaccines, while others called for the update to target the LP.8.1 descendant of JN.1 that Pfizer and Moderna have prototyped.",
      "\"Although one can't predict evolution, and you don't know how this is going to keep diversifying, the overwhelming odds are that what does come and predominate in the next few months, the next six months, next year will come from something that's circulating now. It won't come from something that doesn't exist any longer,\" Jerry Weir, director of the FDA's division of viral products, said.",
      "For now, CDC and FDA officials told the panel that only one strain \u2014 a variant called XFC \u2014 has been significantly growing in the U.S. But they cautioned that the evolution of the virus has been unpredictable, even as the country has settled into a relatively predictable pattern of two surges a year: once in the summer and once over the winter.",
      "This past season only saw an evolutionary \"drift\" in the virus, as opposed to the kind of sweeping replacements driven by highly mutated strains in some earlier years. While COVID-19 trends climbed over the winter, they remained far below previous peaks.",
      "\"Throughout this winter, we didn't see that strain replacement that we have in the past couple of years. But I'm not saying that the virus will not shift again in the immediate future,\" the CDC's Natalie Thornburg told the panel. Thornburg is the acting chief of the laboratory branch in the CDC's division for coronaviruses and other respiratory viruses.",

In Asia, Japan's Nikkei 225 index surged 1.9%. America's largest ally in Asia had urged Mr. Trump to cancel the tariffs on imports from Japan and to also halt 25% tariffs on steel, aluminum and autos.",

      "The company said it was notified Wednesday that the Health and Human Services Department had withdrawn funds awarded in July 2024 and in January to pay for development and purchase of its investigational vaccine.",
      "The funds were awarded through the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, or BARDA, a program that focuses on medical treatments for potential pandemics.",
      "The new vaccine, called mRNA-1018, used the same technology that allowed development and rollout of vaccines to fight COVID-19 in record time.",
      "Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has expressed deep skepticism regarding mRNA vaccines, despite real-world evidence that the vaccines are safe and saved millions of lives.",
      "The cancelation came as Moderna announced positive interim results from an early-stage trial of the vaccine that targeted H5 bird flu virus, tested in 300 healthy adults.",
      "\"While the termination of funding from HHS adds uncertainty, we are pleased by the robust immune response and safety profile observed in this interim analysis,\" CEO Stephane Bancel said in a statement.",
      "He added that Moderna would \"explore alternatives\" for funding the development and manufacturing of the vaccine, according to French news agency AFP.",
      "\"These clinical data in pandemic influenza underscore the critical role mRNA technology has played as a countermeasure to emerging health threats,\" AFP cited Bancel as saying.",
      "In a statement in March, Moderna told CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder that, \"Researchers have been exploring mRNA's potential in medicine for over 30 years, leading to the rapid deployment of mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines that transformed the course of the pandemic. With more than a billion doses distributed worldwide and an unprecedented amount of real-world safety and efficacy data, the benefits of mRNA vaccination ... are well established.\"",
      "Dr. Ashish Jha, a public health expert who served as former President Joe Biden's COVID-19 response coordinator, remarked about the funding withdrawal on X, saying, \"This move puts the lives of Americans at risk. The attack on mRNA vaccines is beyond absurd. It was President Trump's Operation Warp Speed that gave us mRNA vaccines. ... \u00a0If Bird Flu starts spreading from people to people, we will come to regret this as the day we decided to put the lives of the American people at grave risk. \"",
      "H5N1 bird flu viruses spilled from wild bird into cattle in the U.S. last year, infecting hundreds of animals in several states. At least 70 people in the U.S. have been sickened by bird flu infections, mostly mild. One person died.",
      "Scientists fear that continued mutation of the virus could enable it to become more virulent or more easily spread in people, with the possibility that it could trigger a pandemic.",
      "Moderna received $176 million in July 2024 and $590 million in January. The January award would have supported a late-stage clinical trial that could have determined the vaccine's efficacy against pandemic viruses, including bird flu, a company spokesman said.",

    "summary": "A federal court on Wednesday blocked most of the sweeping tariffs imposed by President Trump.",
    "story": [
      "A federal court on Wednesday froze most of the sweeping tariffs imposed by President Trump on virtually every foreign nation, ruling the levies exceed the president's legal authority.",
      "The ruling \u2014 issued by a panel of judges on the U.S. Court of International Trade \u2014 halted the sweeping 10% tariffs Mr. Trump assessed on virtually every U.S. trading partner on \"Liberation Day\" last month, with higher tariffs threatened for dozens of countries. The court also blocked a separate set of tariffs imposed on China, Mexico and Canada by the Trump administration, which has cited drug trafficking and illegal immigration as its reasoning for the hikes.",
      "Global markets rallied on the news.",
      "The Trump administration has justified the tariffs by citing the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977, or IEEPA, which gives the president the power to regulate imports during certain emergency situations. But the court on Wednesday rejected the government's interpretation of the law, and said it would be unconstitutional for any law passed by Congress to give the president blanket authority to set tariffs.",
      "\"The court does not read IEEPA to confer such unbounded authority and sets aside the challenged tariffs imposed thereunder,\" the judges wrote Wednesday.",
      "The court said Mr. Trump's global 10% tariffs aren't authorized by IEEPA because they're designed to deal with trade imbalances between the U.S. and the rest of the world, which the judges said should fall under non-emergency legislation.",
      "And the China, Canada and Mexico tariffs aren't legal because they \"do not deal with the threats set forth in those orders,\" the court also found.",
      "The three judges who wrote Wednesday's ruling were nominated to the bench by former President Ronald Reagan, former President Barack Obama and Mr. Trump in his first term.",
      "The Trump administration said in court papers that it will appeal the ruling to the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals.",
      "White House spokesperson Kush Desai responded to the ruling by defending the reasoning for the tariffs, saying the U.S.'s trade deficits with other countries have \"created a national emergency that has decimated American communities.\"",
      "\"It is not for unelected judges to decide how to properly address a national emergency. President Trump pledged to put America First, and the Administration is committed to using every lever of executive power to address this crisis and restore American Greatness,\" Desai said in a statement.",
      "Tariffs are a signature part of Mr. Trump's second-term agenda. He argues the levies are necessary to boost U.S. manufacturing and end what he views as unfair trade practices. But the moves have rattled financial markets and drawn rebuke from Democrats, as well as some Republicans.",
      "Mr. Trump has stood by his tariff strategy but halted many of the levies while vowing to negotiate with U.S. trading partners. A set of so-called \"reciprocal\" tariffs on dozens of countries were paused in April for a period of at least three months. Goods that fall under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement were exempted from 25% tariffs. Massive tariffs on Chinese goods have also been cut back amid negotiations.",
      "Meanwhile, the tariffs have drawn lawsuits from businesses, Democratic states and other parties. Wednesday's ruling was linked to two lawsuits: One from a group of businesses that say they have been harmed by the tariffs, and one from several states.",
      "Some of the lawsuits against the tariffs have raised legal doctrines long championed by conservative lawyers and judges to restrict the authority of executive branch agencies. Those include the major questions doctrine, which says Congress needs to give clear authorization for federal agencies to decide issues of major economic significance, and the nondelegation doctrine, which holds that Congress can't delegate its legislative power to the executive branch.",

    "story": [
      "Vice President JD Vance on Wednesday touted the Trump administration's ties with the cryptocurrency industry\u00a0 \u2014 a once-fringe business that President Trump and his allies have embraced in recent months.",
      "\"I'm here today to say loud and clear, with President Trump, crypto finally has a champion and an ally in the White House,\" Vance told the Bitcoin 2025 Conference in Las Vegas.",
      "The Trump administration has leaned into cryptocurrency, looking to ease regulations, promote growth in the industry, and bring it into the mainstream. A longstanding backer of cryptocurrencies, Vance owned between $250,000 and $500,000 worth of Bitcoin, according to an August 2024 financial disclosure.",
      "\"We want our fellow Americans to know that crypto and digital assets and particularly Bitcoin, are part of the mainstream economy, and are here to stay,\" Vance said Wednesday.",
      "Vance said it's been a while since he's been to a conference with \"this level of energy,\" adding, \"but I promise I'm not just saying that to juice my own memecoins.\" Vance gave few policy specifics in his speech. But he insisted that, through decentralized finance, crypto has \"transformed\" how Americans make transactions and acts as a \"hedge\" against bad policy.",
      "\"Crypto is a hedge against bad policymaking from Washington, no matter what party's in control,\" he said. \"It's a hedge against skyrocketing inflation, which has eroded the real savings rates of Americans over the last four years. And as you all know well, it's a hedge against a private sector that's increasingly willing to discriminate against consumers on the basis of their basic beliefs, including their politics.\"",
      "Vance urged Congress to pass the GENIUS Act, which would create a regulatory framework for stablecoins. Stablecoins are a type of crypto tied to an underlying asset such as the U.S. dollar.",
      "\"In this administration, we do not think that stablecoin's threatened the integrity of the United States dollar, quite the opposite,\" Vance said Wednesday. \"In fact, we view them as a force multiplier of our economic might.\"",
      "Vance said he knows a lot of people in 2024 chose to \"speak up\" and \"get involved,\" and he needs them to step up again.",
      "\"Unless you guys get involved in politics, politics is going to ignore this industry,\" Vance said. \"... While Bitcoin is digital, none of you are. None of us are. What happens in the world of politics, what happens in the world of bureaucracy, it will affect even the most transformational and valuable technologies if we don't make the right decisions. So the first piece of advice, the first thing that I'd ask you, is to take the momentum of your political involvement in 2024 and carry it forward to 2026 and beyond.\"",
      "The Las Vegas event is also featuring a handful of other Trump backers: His two eldest sons Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, who have invested in crypto ventures, are speaking Wednesday on a panel about \"the rise of new bitcoin business models.\" Chris LaCivita, who co-managed Mr. Trump's 2024 campaign, and David Sacks, a venture capitalist who serves as the White House's crypto czar, spoke on Tuesday.",
      "Vance is the highest-ranking sitting politician to address the Bitcoin Conference, which describes itself as \"the world's largest gathering of bitcoiners\" and often draws crypto-friendly lawmakers. Mr. Trump, then a presidential candidate, was the headline speaker last year.",
      "Vance headlined a fundraiser hosted by MAGA Inc. on Tuesday night in Las Vegas, where tickets were priced at $1 million a head, CBS News has learned. The fundraiser was first reported by The Washington Post.",
      "Vlad Tenev, CEO of Robinhood, the popular trading platform for stocks and crypto, told CBS News at the conference that the Trump administration's approach to the crypto industry is welcome news.",
      "\"Under the previous administration, we have been subject to\u2026it was basically a carpet bombing of the entire industry,\" Tenev said.",
      "\"And now suddenly, you're allowed to play some offense\u2026And we have an administration that's open to the technology,\" he added.\"",
      "Bitcoin \u2014 and cryptocurrency more generally \u2014 has grown in prominence and drawn allies from both parties, despite skepticism about its volatility. The price of Bitcoin, the world's most widely used cryptocurrency, has leaped nearly 60% in the last year.",
      "Mr. Trump was once a crypto skeptic, calling Bitcoin a \"scam\" whose value is \"based on thin air.\" But in his second term, he has enthusiastically boosted crypto and promised to reverse strict Biden-era regulations.",
      "Mr. Trump and his family also have financial interests in crypto, which makes up $2.9 billion of his net worth, according to one recent report. Trump Media and Technology Group, the parent company of Truth Social, announced Tuesday it is raising $2.5 billion to invest in Bitcoin.",
      "Meanwhile, businesses linked to the president launched a Trump-branded \"meme coin\" earlier this year, and Mr. Trump hosted the digital currency's top investors at his Virginia golf club last week. The president and his sons are linked to crypto exchange World Liberty Financial. And Eric Trump co-founded a Bitcoin mining venture that's seeking to go public.",
      "The moves have drawn criticism from Democrats and some ethics experts who argue Mr. Trump's crypto ventures pose a conflict of interest, and investing in them could be a quick route to gaining access to the president.",
      "Tenev weighed in on Trump's personal investment in crypto.",
      "\"Of course, it is a potential conflict,\" Tenev said, but added, \"The idea that they're motivated by personal gain\u2026I don't know if that has too much backing in fact.\"",
      "The GENIUS Act, the once-bipartisan Senate bill aimed at regulating stablecoins, bled support after Democratic lawmakers pushed for restrictions on elected officials buying or selling crypto \u2014 with some Democrats directly citing Mr. Trump's crypto investments. Senators ultimately voted to advance the bill earlier this month.",

      "Reality television stars Todd and Julie Chrisley were pardoned\u00a0Wednesday by President Trump. The couple have been incarcerated since 2022 after being found guilty of bank and tax fraud.",
      "Todd Chrisley, 57, has been serving a 12-year sentence at Florida's FPC Pensacola minimum-security men's federal prison with a release date of April 2032, according to the Bureau of Prisons. Julie Chrisley, 52, meanwhile, has been serving a 7-year sentence at the FMC Lexington prison in Kentucky, with a release date of January 2028, the BOP says.",
      "Scott Taylor, a spokesperson for the Federal Bureau of Prisons, told CBS News in an email that both Todd and Julie Chrisley were released from prison Wednesday.",
      "Who are Todd and Julie Chrisley?",
      "The married couple gained prominence on the reality show \"Chrisley Knows Best,\" which debuted on the cable channel USA Network in 2014. The show depicted the wealthy couple \u2014 Todd Chrisley made his money in real estate \u2014 as they dealt with issues such as child-rearing and their careers.",
      "The show was\u00a0described as \"humorously voyeuristic\" by Common Sense Media. The program ended after 10 seasons in March 2023, after the Chrisleys were sentenced for tax and bank fraud.",
      "What were the Chrisleys convicted of?",
      "The pair were indicted in 2019\u00a0on charges including conspiring to defraud community banks out of more than $30 million in loans, with a federal jury convicting them in June 2022. The couple was also convicted of conspiring to defraud the IRS, along with additional tax crimes, the U.S. Attorney's Office of the Northern District of Georgia said at the time.",
      "The jury found that the couple submitted fake bank statements and other financial records to obtain personal loans, which they then used to buy luxury cars, designer clothes, real estate and travel.",
      "\"After spending all the money, Todd Chrisley filed for bankruptcy and walked away from more than $20 million of the fraudulently obtained loans,\" the U.S. Attorney's Office said in 2022 after their conviction.",
      "Meanwhile, the couple concealed their income from their reality TV show from the IRS to avoid paying nearly $500,000 in delinquent taxes. The Chrisleys also failed to file tax returns and pay taxes from 2013 through 2016.",
      "\"These convictions should send a clear message regardless of your fame or notoriety, everyone will be held accountable for paying their fair share of taxes,\" said James E. Dorsey, special agent in charge, IRS-Criminal Investigation, in a statement\u00a0on the Chrisley's convictions.",
      "Why did Trump pardon the Chrisleys?",
      "In a call Tuesday with the couple's children, Mr. Trump said the couple received \"pretty harsh treatment, based on what I'm hearing.\" He added that he doesn't know the Chrisleys personally.",
      "According to the statement from the Chrisley's law firm, the pair had sought a presidential pardon earlier this year by alleging \"serious misconduct by the government, including an illegal raid, reliance on tainted evidence and a trial that featured false testimony from a key government witness.\"",
      "Their daughter, Savannah Chrisley, was a speaker at the 2024 Republican National Convention, with the law firm noting that she \"publicly thanked President Trump for standing up against political prosecutions and fighting for families like hers.\"",
      "Their lawyer, Alex Little, said in the statement that the Chrisleys were targets because of their political views.",
      "\"This pardon corrects a deep injustice and restores two devoted parents to their family and community,\" Little said. \"President Trump recognized what we've argued from the beginning: Todd and Julie were targeted because of their conservative values and high profile.

      "Coined by Financial Times journalist Robert Armstrong in a May 2\u00a0column, the tongue-in-cheek term stands for \"Trump Always Chickens Out.\" That phrase is meant to describe a pattern of stocks plunging when the Trump administration announces stiff new tariffs, then surging when Mr. Trump eases up on them days or weeks later.",
      "Since Armstrong's column, Mr. Trump has pulled back on import duties on two other major U.S. trading partners. On May 12, he placed a 90-day freeze\u00a0on 145% tariffs on Chinese goods, while on May 26 he\u00a0delayed 50% tariffs on European goods until July. In both cases, the markets jumped after Mr. Trump offered to ease tariffs.",
      "\"[T]he recent rally has a lot to do with markets realizing that the U.S. administration does not have a very high tolerance for market and economic pressure, and will be quick to back off when tariffs cause pain. This is the TACO theory: Trump Always Chickens Out,\" Armstrong wrote on May 2.",
      "In the most recent case, the market dropped sharply on Friday after Mr. Trump said he planned to hike tariffs on European imports to 50%. But on Memorial Day, Mr. Trump said he would ease up on those plans until July to give the European Union and the U.S. more time to negotiate. On Tuesday, the day U.S. markets reopened after the holiday, the S&P 500 rallied 2.1%.",
      "When asked about the term by a reporter at the White House on Wednesday, Mr. Trump responded that it was a \"nasty question.\"",
      "\"It's called negotiation,\" Mr. Trump said. \"They wouldn't be over here today negotiating if I didn't put a 50% tariff\" on Europe.",
      "He added, \"[T]hey'll say, oh, he was chicken. He was chicken. That's unbelievable. I usually have the opposite problem. They say, 'You're too tough, Mr. President.'\"",
      "Whatever the strategy at the White House, investors are becoming more comfortable with the Trump administration's pattern of initially setting high tariff rates that it later reduces , noted Vital Knowledge analyst Adam Crisafulli.",
      "\"[T]he narrative is growing increasingly bullish as investors become more comfortable with the severity of the tariff threat (the \"TACO\" mindset is being embraced by more people) while companies demonstrate an ability to absorb the import tax hike relatively well (the hit to [earnings per share] hasn't been as draconian as feared),\" Crisafulli wrote in a May 28 research note.",
      "Still, there may be too much complacency in the market about the threat of Mr. Trump's tariffs, which major businesses like Walmart have warned will cause them to hike prices, as well as the wobbly fiscal outlook for the U.S., Crisafulli added. Earlier this month, Moody's downgraded the U.S. credit rating, highlighting investor concerns about the government's growing debt.",
      "\"That said, the tariff narrative could stay in a state of benign optimism for the next several weeks (the big deadline is early/mid-July, when the 90-day reciprocal tariff/50% EU tariff suspensions expires) while tariff-driven inflation may not appear in the data until July (when the June numbers are reported),\" the analyst noted.",

    "summary": "President Trump wants to divert federal funds from Harvard to trade schools. But experts say the process isn't that simple.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Monday said he's weighing whether to\u00a0redirect $3 billion\u00a0in grant money for Harvard University to trade schools across the U.S., but education experts say that process faces significant obstacles.",
      "Mr. Trump's comment, which was made on social media, comes as he escalates his attacks on the Ivy League school. Last week, the Trump administration moved to\u00a0block Harvard from enrolling international students, and the president has taken other steps to\u00a0freeze billions of dollars in Harvard's federal funding, as he claims the institution has not done enough to address anti-semitism on its campus.",
      "On Tuesday, the Trump administration wrote in a letter that all federal agencies should consider canceling their\u00a0government contracts\u00a0with Harvard, or move them to other organizations.",
      "Research universities apply for federal grants in a competitive process, with the money awarded for specific purposes, such as scientific research. That includes having the necessary faculty, researchers and other staff on hand to conduct the research, as well as laboratories or other facilities that are needed to complete the project.",
      "For instance, one recent National Science Foundation grant awarded to Harvard is for research into \"a complexity theoretic lens on near- and medium-term quantum devices,\" with the proposal describing the project as aiming to \"grapple with present-day challenges in quantum computing.\"",
      "By contrast, trade schools offer hands-on vocational training in fields ranging from cosmetology to plumbing, and typically don't undertake the type of research that is funded by agencies such as the NSF and National Institutes of Health, experts told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"It is both illegal and unrealistic as a proposal, and it's the sort of thing that a responsible administration shouldn't be saying,\" Jon Fansmith, senior vice president of the American Council on Education, a non-profit representing higher education institutions, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "He added, \"The money that has been awarded to Harvard is awarded because they competitively applied for, and were awarded, scientific research funding, which is what it overwhelmingly is.\"",
      "While other schools, including those that operate trade programs, can apply for similar grants, Harvard's money can't simply be funneled to another recipient, he said.",
      "Do trade schools get federal grants?",
      "Trade schools, which can be either for- or non-profit, typically offer certificates or associate degrees rather than the bachelor's, master's and PhDs offered by universities such as Harvard.",
      "Although a trade school could apply for and win a grant or contract for services that it's equipped to provide the government, they generally don't have the faculty, staff or facilities to undertake scientific or medical research, Albany Law School Professor Raymond Brescia told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"Trade schools can apply for and get grants from the NSF or NIH if they qualify,\" he said. \"But there are rules around government procurement and awarding grants to the applicants that are best-positioned to provide the services that the government seeks.\"",
      "Mr. Trump did not identify any institutions that might receive Harvard's grant funding beyond referring to them as \"trade schools.\"",
      "Different focuses",
      "If Mr. Trump wanted to redirect funding, he'd likely have to follow a prescribed process, according to experts.",
      "\"You can't, as president, simply take money that Congress has directed for a certain purpose and say, 'I am going to spend it somewhere else',\" Fansmith said. \"You need some basis for giving it to other schools.\"",
      "More specifically, the Trump administration would need to provide evidence that Harvard's grants were not awarded based on merit, according to Brescia. \"Then there are avenues that the government can take in the future to ensure it follows its own procurement rules better. But I haven't heard anyone allege any awards to Harvard were improperly given to them,\" he added.",
      "A range of schools that offer trade programs compete for federal grants. For example, LaGuardia Community College in Queens, New York, part of the City University of New York, in 2023 received more than $400,000 from the U.S. Department of Labor to enhance its vocational training offerings across electrical, plumbing, HVAC and similar fields.",
      "But such schools don't generally conduct the type of academic and scientific research that qualifies for the federal grants awarded to institutions like Harvard.",
      "\"Private trade schools and community colleges don't do that stuff, so he couldn't redirect the same academic responsibility from Harvard to a trade school,\" Jason Altmire, CEO of Career Education Colleges and Universities, a group representing 800 private postsecondary career schools, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Altmire said his group's organizations don't typically receive any federal funding for academic or scientific research, while noting that trade schools would welcome additional government support and financial aid for students. But such assistance is unlikely to come in the form of grants from the NIH or NSF, he said.",
      "\"They could fund apprenticeships and support students so they have access to career schools,\" Altmire said. \"There are appropriate ways the federal government can support the work of trade schools, both private and public, and we would be excited about that.\"",

    "summary": "Southwest Airlines, which previously had a free checked bag policy, says it will start charging $35 for each first checked bag.",
    "story": [
      "After more than 50 years, Southwest Airlines' \"bags fly free\" policy is finally coming to an end.",
      "Southwest on Tuesday announced the first checked bag will cost $35, while a second checked bag will cost $45. The policy will begin tomorrow, when some passengers may be subject to a checked bag fee when booking a flight on the discount carrier. Weight and size limits for bags will apply.",
      "The new policy only applies to flights booked on May 28 or later, which means today is the last day to book if passengers want to avoid the new fee.",
      "There are, however, some carve-outs to the new policy: Business Select/Choice Extra and A-List Preferred customers will receive two free checked bags, while A-List and Chase Rapid Reward credit card members will get one free checked bag.",
      "In addition to the checked bag fees, a new flight credit policy will also take effect tomorrow, affecting how long Southwest customers can use their travel vouchers.",
      "Flight credits issued May 28 or later will expire in six months or a year, depending on the fare type. This marks a change to the airline's previous policy\u00a0in place for three years, which had said flight credits never expire.",
      "The airlines stock price was up 2.1% in pre-trading.",
      "Southwest announced the end of its free bag check policy in March amid mounting pressure from activist investors to improve its financial performance. The airline in September predicted that the change would lead to $1.5 billion a year in revenue but said it also stood to lose $1.8 billion in business from loyal customers who flew Southwest because of its unique baggage policy.",
      "The new checked bag policy is part of a broader set of changes announced by Southwest. The airline\u00a0said last July\u00a0that it would start selling assigned seats, a major departure from its longstanding open seating policy.",

    "summary": "It doesn't take $1 million to secure a sense of financial well-being, according to new research from Vanguard.",
    "story": [
      "It doesn't take $1 million to achieve the top predictor of financial well-being, according to new research from investment firm Vanguard. Instead, it's something far more attainable: Socking away at least $2,000 in an emergency savings account.",
      "A survey of more than 12,000 Vanguard investors found that it's not assets or income that is most associated with a higher level of financial well-being, but rather $2,000 worth of emergency savings. Having that $2,000 in savings increased financial well-being by 21%, while an income of $500,000 increased well-being by 12%, and assets of $1 million or more boosted well-being by 18%.",
      "A sense of financial well-being signifies that an adult can fully meet their financial obligations and are secure in their financial future, allowing them to make choices to enjoy their life, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.",
      "The findings come as many Americans are feeling more financially stressed, with a separate study from Primerica finding that about half of middle-class households expect to be worse off financially in 2026, almost double the share in December, due to worries about the cost of living and the economy. Taking small steps to build an emergency savings account could prove to help alleviate financial anxiety, noted Paulo Costa, a behavioral economist and certified financial planner at Vanguard who co-authored the research.",
      "\"What's so powerful about this research is that it's not about gathering a lot of money to have that peace of mind,\" Costa told CBS MoneyWatch. \"That initial $2,000 makes a big difference.\"",
      "While it may seem that having $1 million in assets should boost financial well-being more than $2,000 in a savings account, the results show the importance of being prepared for an unplanned expense, Costa added. (To be sure, most people in the study had $2,000 in emergency savings \u2014 about 8 in 10 \u2014 versus $1 million in assets, at about 3 in 10.)",
      "The median cost of an emergency is about $2,000, which means having that cash on hand gives people the confidence that they can handle a sudden money stressor, he said.",
      "\"When is $2,000 more than a million dollars? It's when it comes to emergency savings,\" Costa said. \"The point of emergency savings is to have that money readily available if you need it. A lot of people have money, for example, in retirement accounts that may have some requirements about when you can withdraw that money and may have some tax consequences and some penalties.\"",
      "Retirement assets are generally not readily available to cover unexpected expenses, with people younger than 59 1/2 incurring a 10% penalty for taking out money. But having $2,000 set aside in a bank account means that you've got the peace of mind that you'll be able to handle a surprise car repair or medical bill.",
      "And people with $2,000 in emergency savings typically spend about 2 hours less each week thinking about their finances versus those without any savings, the study found.",
      "How many people can handle emergency expenses?",
      "To be sure, obtaining $2,000 in savings could prove out of reach for many Americans, especially those who are low income, struggling with debt or who reside in an area with a high cost of living. Vanguard's survey includes only people who have investment accounts at the company, which signals they have access to 401(k)s and other types of investment accounts that many Americans lack.",
      "Almost 4 in 10 Americans say they don't have the cash on hand to pay for an $400 emergency expense, according to research from the Federal Reserve.",
      "Still, more Americans appear to be socking away money for a rainy day, with the Primerica study finding that 64% of those surveyed in March said they had an emergency fund of at least $1,000, up from 58% two years earlier.",
      "Even if saving $2,000 seems out of reach, you can start small by saving as little as $10 week, Costa said. The best idea is to find a strategy that works for you, whether that's budgeting or automating savings by directing a certain amount into a dedicated account with each paycheck, he said.",
      "\"I love the idea of, 'out of sight, out of mind,' so when you get paid, you immediately send money to your savings account,\" he said. \"By saving $50 per week, you will build up to $2,000 in less than a year.\"",
      "He added, \"Saving something is better than saving nothing. So just getting started, that really makes a big difference.\"",

    "story": [
      "Recent college graduates are having a harder time finding work, despite their higher education degrees, which usually give job-seekers a leg up in the labor market.",
      "That's according to a new report from Oxford Economics which shows that unemployed recent college grads account for 12% of an 85% rise in the national unemployment rate since mid-2023. That's a high number, given that this cohort only makes up 5% of the total labor force.",
      "What's more, the rate of unemployment among workers who have recently graduated from college and are between the ages of 22 and 27, is nearing 6% \u2014which is above the national unemployment rate of 4.2%.",
      "\"People who have obtained a bachelor's degree or higher have a higher unemployment rate than national average, and this is the first time this has happened in the last 45 years of data,\" Matthew Martin, senior U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "That's noteworthy, he said, because \"those with higher educational attainment usually have better prospects overall than their peer with less.\"",
      "So why are recent college grads are having a tougher time finding work post-college than previous graduating classes did?",
      "While the report points to a couple of factors, it finds that a slowdown in hiring in formerly hot sectors is driving the growth in unemployment among degree holders.",
      "\"The rise in the recent graduate unemployment rate is largely part of a mismatch between an oversupply of recent graduates in fields where business demand has waned,\" according to the report.",
      "That holds especially true in the tech industry, as more college students graduate with degrees in computer science and related fields than any other major.",
      "\"Prospects for employment will remain minimal for these individuals, keeping the unemployment rate elevated in the near term,\" Oxford Economics researchers wrote in the report.",
      "Tech sector-centric",
      "Computer science is among the fastest-growing fields of study among undergrads, according to the National Center for Education Statistics, but jobs in the sector are particularly vulnerable to replacement by automation. Recent advances in artificial intelligence also expose workers in the field to being rendered obsolete.",
      "\"There's a mismatch between business demand and the labor supply overall,\" Martin said. \"And it's very concentrated in the technology sector.\"",
      "The industry hired at a fast clip when the economy reopened post-pandemic, before pulling back. Those cuts are likely still affecting the current unemployment rate, according to Martin.",
      "\"Some of it could be a normalization after the tech sector's hiring surge at the end of the pandemic around 2021,\" he said. \"But there's also evidence that AI is starting to impact lower-level computer science gigs,\" he added.",
      "Experienced workers who graduated with computer science degrees but have racked up more than a few years of experience are faring fine, noted Martin. It's those who do the kind of lower-level, rote work that AI is already adept at, who are seeing a mismatch between the number of jobs available and the supply of workers seeking them.",
      "\"Some of it might be businesses being productive with the workers they have and not wanting to increase costs overall by hiring. It could also be higher adoption rates of AI,\" Martin said. \"At the moment, it looks to be a bit of both.\"",
      "Uncertainty slows hiring",
      "Economic uncertainty, driven largely by President Trump's aggressive, yet ever-changing tariff agenda, is also leading a number of businesses to press pause on growth and investment. Because of this, the unemployment rate among recent college graduates could continue to inch upward, according to Martin.",
      "\"We are heading into a period where uncertainty is really high; the impact of tariffs is starting to bleed through, and businesses are facing higher input costs,\" he said.",
      "Although recent college graduates who have secured employment aren't being laid off at higher rates than the rest of the workforce, Martin doesn't expect things to get easier for young graduates on the hunt for employment, absent a surge in hiring by tech companies or mass exodus of workers from the labor force.",
      "\"There is some softening in demand overall, but a lot of it is concentrated at the moment in recent college graduates, and we are looking for the unemployment rate to rise,\" he said.",
      "The \"underemployment\" effect",
      "When qualified workers with college degrees try and fail to find work in their desired field, they tend to continue seeking work, sometimes looking for a job in another sector, as opposed to withdrawing from the labor force, the report notes. That can lead to college-educated workers finding themselves \"underemployed,\" or in roles where 50% of the workers who occupy them do not have a bachelor's degree or higher.",
      "This scenario can doom them for years to come: Underemployed workers tend to remain so for the rest of their careers, according to a report.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump\u00a0said again Tuesday he's working to take mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac public, winding down 17 years of federal control over two central parts of the U.S. housing market \u2014 a move that was cheered on by Trump ally and noted Wall Street investor Bill Ackman.",
      "Ending the conservatorship of Fannie and Freddie \u2014 which guarantee trillions of dollars worth of mortgages \u2014 would be complicated, and critics say it's risky. A plan to do so in Mr. Trump's first term did not come to pass. But the president announced last week he was considering the move, pointing to the firms' return to profitability since their 2008 government takeover.",
      "\"Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are doing very well, throwing off a lot of CASH, and the time would seem to be right,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social late Wednesday \u2014 prompting a double-digit rally in shares the next day of both Fannie and Freddie, which trade over the counter rather than on a major stock exchange.",
      "Mr. Trump confirmed Tuesday he is \"working on\" taking Fannie and Freddie public, but will continue overseeing the two enterprises even if their conservatorship ends. He also said the \"U.S. Government will keep its implicit GUARANTEES\" to Fannie and Freddie, referring to the decades-old belief that the government would rescue Fannie and Freddie if needed, which likely keeps their borrowing costs low by making them appear safe to investors. It's unclear what form the \"guarantee\" could take in the future.",
      "The idea of taking the two government-sponsored enterprises public has drawn some support for years, with advocates arguing Fannie and Freddie could function better if released from federal control. Releasing Fannie and Freddie could also benefit some investors who have bought shares in the firms over the years, betting on an eventual federal spinoff of the mortgage giants.",
      "One of the largest \u2014 and most vocal \u2014 is Ackman, whose hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management invested in Fannie and Freddie over a decade ago. The firm is the biggest private holder of Fannie, at just over 115 million shares according to S&P Capital IQ data \u2014 worth over $1.2 billion at Friday's price. Ackman said in an earnings call Thursday that Pershing Square owns about 220 million shares in Fannie and Freddie combined.",
      "Other major holders of the two enterprises include Capital Research and Management Company, which has the largest known stake in Freddie ($350 million) and the second-largest stake in Fannie (over $1 billion), according to S&P Capital IQ. Paulson & Co., founded by billionaire John Paulson, also invested in Fannie and Freddie at one point, the Wall Street Journal reported in 2021 \u2014 though the size of its current stake is unclear.",
      "Since Mr. Trump was reelected last year, Ackman has publicly pushed on X to end the federal conservatorship of Fannie and Freddie, calling it a good deal for taxpayers that could generate as much as $300 billion for the government. In January, Pershing Square put together a presentation called \"The Art of the Deal\" that made the case in more detail.",
      "\"Trump likes big deals and this would be the biggest deal in history. I am confident he will get it done,\" Ackman wrote on X in December.",
      "When Mr. Trump announced Wednesday he's \"giving very serious consideration\" to the idea, Ackman responded on X with a thumbs-up emoji. In Thursday's earnings call, Ackman said, \"[W]e're extremely encouraged by the president's announcement.\" Ackman also said Thursday the firm wasn't aware of any plans by the Trump administration to release Fannie and Freddie from conservatorship.",
      "Famous for his sharp-elbowed activist investing strategy and pandemic-era bets, Ackman has made waves in recent months for his political views. He endorsed Mr. Trump in 2024 and has taken aim at the leadership of Harvard University over its handling of Israel-Hamas war protests.",
      "Skeptics of releasing Fannie and Freddie, like Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren, have pushed back on the idea, warning it could benefit investors at the risk of disrupting the mortgage market.",
      "\"[The president] hasn't come to Congress with any kind of plan for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac \u2013 and the last thing we need is to privatize them in a way that rewards Wall Street while driving up housing prices for people already struggling to buy homes,\" Warren, a Massachusetts lawmaker and the top Democrat on the Senate banking committee, told CBS News in a statement.",
      "White House spokesperson Harrison Fields said in a statement, \"The Trump Administration is committed to strengthening the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) to advance the President's mission of restoring the dream of homeownership for all Americans. Any actions under consideration will be carefully evaluated in a safe and sound manner to deliver on the President's historic agenda.\"",
      "Ackman's Pershing Square declined to comment to CBS News. FHFA \u2014 which oversees Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac \u2014 did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "What are Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac \u2014 and why could they be privatized?",
      "The government created Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac \u2014 or, more formally, the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation \u2014 in the 20th century, with Fannie Mae dating back to the Great Depression. They essentially buy mortgages from lenders like banks and bundle them together into guaranteed mortgage-backed securities that can be sold to all kinds of investors \u2014 a space known as the secondary mortgage market.",
      "The point of this work is to bring more money into the nation's residential lending system, making it easier for average families to buy a home. Fannie Mae describes itself as \"the backbone of the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage.\"",
      "For decades, Fannie and Freddie were both publicly traded companies, though many observers believed they operated with an \"implicit guarantee\" that the government would step in if either company wobbled.",
      "But after a mortgage crisis sparked the 2008 recession, the Bush administration bailed out Fannie and Freddie and put them under federal conservatorship to save them from collapse. Since then, the FHFA has effectively controlled the two firms. That arrangement wasn't necessarily supposed to be permanent, but it has lasted for over a decade, with the two companies making billions in payments to the government.",
      "A push for the government to end its conservatorship of Fannie and Freddie has been brewing for years. Some critics view the firms as unfairly dominant in the mortgage industry and believe they fill a role that should be played by the private sector. Other supporters of privatization like Ackman argue it could provide a windfall to taxpayers, partly because, in a holdover from the financial crisis, the government has the right to purchase almost 80% of both firms' shares.",
      "Opponents of privatization argue it could push up mortgage rates, especially if Fannie and Freddie are no longer viewed as backstopped by the government. How that plays out could depend on how the government decides to end the conservatorship, though, and whether it still offers some kind of guarantee. Credit agency Fitch Ratings said it would keep rating Fannie and Freddie's debt similarly to the U.S. government's debt if the firms maintain a federal backstop, but if not, they would be rated separately \u2014 and could slip if their market dominance shrinks.",
      "The risk of higher mortgage costs could be a major stumbling block in an era of elevated interest rates. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told Bloomberg earlier this year, \"anything that is done around a safe and sound release [of Fannie and Freddie] is going to hinge on the effect of long-term mortgage rates.\"",
      "In part for that reason, Jaret Seiberg, an analyst at TD Cowen, said in a note Friday that the firm expects the Trump administration to make changes to Fannie and Freddie at a \"slower and more deliberate\" pace than it has moved on other issues, like tariffs.",
      "\"Tariffs may have impacted the stock market, but they did not result in immediate price hikes at Walmart or Dollar General. By contrast, the price of mortgages will respond to each recap and release development,\" Seiberg wrote. \"That makes the political cost more immediate and gives the President less room to alter positions as he has done on trade.\"",
      "In his first term, Mr. Trump's Treasury Department proposed ending Fannie and Freddie's conservatorship. While the first Trump administration ultimately didn't take this step, it made some changes to how the two institutions operate.",
      "Ackman's Pershing Square called releasing Fannie and Freddie the \"Unfinished Business of the First Trump Administration\" in its January presentation. The firm laid out a possible roadmap to turn Fannie and Freddie into independent publicly traded companies: It suggested holding initial public offerings by 2026 for Fannie and 2027 for Freddie, and then allowing the federal government to sell its stakes over five years.",
      "But it's unclear how \u2014 or if \u2014 the Trump administration may pursue the idea. In his Senate confirmation hearing earlier this year, FHFA Director William Pulte said he believed that any end to government control of Fannie and Freddie needed to be \"extremely thoughtful.\"",
      "\"While their conservatorship should not be indefinite, any exit from conservatorship must be carefully planned to ensure the safety and soundness of the housing market without upward pressure on mortgage rates,\" Pulte said.",

    "summary": "Trump Media, owner of the Truth Social app, says the agreement will help it create \"a bitcoin treasury.\"",
    "story": [
      "Trump Media and Technology Group on Tuesday said it's struck a deal to raise $2.5 billion that will be tapped to buy bitcoin, creating a reserve of the cryptocurrency.",
      "The company's move into cryptocurrency comes after Trump Media has ventured into other investment arenas, including starting exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, and separately managed accounts with investment strategies the company says are \"rooted in American values and priorities.\"",
      "In its Tuesday announcement, Trump Media said it has an agreement with about 50 institutional investors to buy $1.5 billion of the company's stock, along with another $1 billion in debt that can be converted into stock at a later date. The $2.5 billion in funds will be used to create a \"bitcoin treasury,\" which the company said will be added to its balance sheet.",
      "This would be in addition to cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments that Trump Media already holds, which it said were worth $759 million.",
      "President Trump, the largest investor in Trump Media, has increasingly focused on cryptocurrencies, both through his private business and his administration. He has directed his officials to create a national \"crypto strategic reserve\" that will include bitcoin, ethereum and lesser-known cryptocurrencies. The goal for Trump Media \u2014 best known for its Truth Social app \u2014 is to push the company into becoming more than a tech business, according to CEO Devin Nunes.",
      "\"It's a big step forward in the company's plans to evolve into a holding company by acquiring additional profit-generating, crown jewel assets consistent with America First principles,\" Nunes said in the Tuesday statement.",
      "Shares of Trump Media tumbled $2.14, or 8.3% to $23.58 in early afternoon trading. Because the deal is based on issuing $1.5 billion worth of new shares of the company, as well $1 billion in convertible debt, the offer could dilute the value of existing shareholders' stock, including Mr. Trump's.",
      "What's happening with Truth Social?",
      "Trump Media's push into money management and cryptocurrencies comes as Truth Social continues to lose money.",
      "In the first quarter, Truth Social lost $31.2 million, while its revenue rose 7% to $821.2 million. In a May 9 regulatory filing, Trump Media said its Truth Social has \"generated limited advertising revenue\" to date, while it expects to \"incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future\" as it builds its streaming business.",
      "Social media businesses typically rely on advertising as a core source of revenue, with companies targeting their ads to specific demographics, such as app users who are, say, young parents or retirees.",
      "Truth Social doesn't release data about the size of its user base, but rival social media apps have typically recorded much higher sales growth, such as Reddit, which said its fourth-quarter ad sales jumped 60% to $394.5 million from a year earlier.",
      "Why is Trump Media venturing into financial services?",
      "Trump Media describes its new division, called Truth.Fi, as mixing financial services and financial technology.",
      "\"By expanding into this realm, we aim to serve millions of investors in America and around the world who believe in the greatness of the American economy and want to invest in superior companies while avoiding the giant, woke investment funds and politically motivated debanking problems,\" the company's May 9 regulatory filing said.",
      "\"Debanking\" is the term used by some conservative figures who have accused banks of barring them from opening accounts or blocking access to their assets because of their political views, prompting a Senate hearing in February over the issue. It's\u00a0also been the focus of some crypto investors, such as Nathan McCauley, who testified in the Senate hearing that his bank had closed his company's account on short notice because they weren't comfortable with crypto transactions.",
      "Trump Media's crypto investment \"will help defend our Company against harassment and discrimination by financial institutions, which plague many Americans and U.S. firms, and will create synergies for subscription payments, a utility token and other planned transactions across Truth Social and Truth+,\" Nunes said in the statement.",

      "Analysts noted that the stop-and-go nature of the president's tariff policies have been a key driver of market volatility in recent weeks, with stock movements hinging upon news of potential trade deals. All the while, experts say that the president's moves could be part of his overall strategy to broker new deals.",

      "A partial rebound in consumer confidence added to Tuesday's positivity. The Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index, released Tuesday morning, found consumer confidence rose 12.3 points to reach 98.0, up from 85.7 in April. The upswing follows month of decline in the index, triggered by fears of inflation and tariff-induced economic uncertainty. Analysts, however, warned the positive turnaround may be short-lived.",
      "\"Consumer confidence in May rebounded after trade tensions eased, but this may only be temporary,\" said Jeffrey Roach, chief economist for LPL Financial, in a research note.",
      "The bond market remained steady after easing slightly on Friday, after concerns earlier in the week over the nation's debt led to an uptick in Treasury Yields. Yields on the 10-Year Treasury were at 4.5% as of Tuesday afternoon.",
      "Still, this moment of calm may also be temporary, some economists say. In a research note on Tuesday, UBS analysts said investors should brace for more volatility in the bond market, as Mr. Trump's budget bill still\u00a0awaits approval from the Senate.",

      "Tesla sales across Europe plummeted by almost 50% last month even as the broader market for electric cars saw growth in the region, according to data released Tuesday.",

      "At the same time, sales of battery-electric vehicles by all manufacturers rose about 28%, the group's data shows.",
      "The numbers are the latest indication of how much the Tesla brand is suffering because of the backlash against billionaire CEO Elon Musk over his far-right views. Crowds have gathered at Tesla dealerships in both Europe and the U.S., with protesters objecting to Musk's work with President Trump's Department of Government Efficiency, which has slashed the U.S. federal workforce and been the subject of multiple lawsuits.",
      "The protesters are aiming at Tesla to dent Musk's fortunes, given that much of his wealth is tied up in shares of the electric vehicle maker.",
      "\"2025 started off as a dark chapter for Musk and Tesla as Elon's role in the Trump Administration and DOGE created a life of its own which created brand damage and a black cloud over the story,\" noted Wedbush analyst Dan Ives in a May 23 research note.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/unemployment-rate-funtionally-unemployed-economy/",
    "published": "Tue, 27 May 2025 08:36:54 -0400",
    "summary": "Many workers aren't working as much as they'd like. Here's what one expert says the federal unemployment rate fails to capture.",
    "story": [
      "While the unemployment rate remains near a 50-year low, another measure of worker well-being indicates there may be bigger cracks in the labor market.",
      "The low unemployment rate, which stood at 4.2% in April, has signaled to economists and investors alike that the U.S. economy remains relatively healthy. Employers are also continuing to hire despite headwinds like tariffs and plunging consumer confidence.",
      "But another indicator suggests those pieces of government data may be painting an overly rosy picture of the economy, with a recent report from the Ludwig Institute for Shared Economic Prosperity (LISEP) finding the \"true rate\" of unemployment stood at 24.3% in April, up slightly from 24% in March, while the official Bureau of Labor Statistics rate remained unchanged at 4.2% over the same period.",
      "LISEP's measure encompasses not only unemployed workers, but also people who are looking for work but can't find full-time employment, as well as those stuck in poverty-wage jobs. By tracking functionally unemployed workers, the measure seeks to capture labor market nuances that other economic indicators miss, such as Americans who are left behind during periods of economic expansion.",
      "\"The unemployment data, as it's put out, has some flaws,\" LISEP chairman Gene Ludwig told CBS MoneyWatch. \"For example, it counts you as employed if you've worked as little as one hour over the prior two weeks. So you can be homeless and in a tent community and have worked one hour and be counted, irrespective of how poorly-paid that hour may be.\"",
      "LISEP, in a working paper on the gauge, says the measure prevents part-time jobs or poorly paid work from being counted as equal to full-time and better-paid work. LISEP also argues that the unemployment rate \"presents a very incomplete and, in many ways, misleading picture.\"",
      "In other words, people who lack steady work and don't earn living wages shouldn't be counted as functionally employed. Its True Rate of Unemployment (TRU), which began tracking the measure in 2020, encapsulates workers whose earnings don't allow them to make ends meet, and are struggling just to get by, according to LISEP.",
      "\"If you're part time and can't get a full-time job, then we count you as functionally unemployed,\" Ludwig noted. \"We also count as functionally unemployed people who don't earn above a poverty wage.\"",
      "\"Survival mode\"",
      "In so doing, it counts workers who can't afford to put roofs over their heads, can't procure nutritious meals and don't have the ability to save as being functionally unemployed.",
      "\"You don't have anything that gets you to the first rung of the American dream ladder. You're in survival mode,\" Ludwig said.",
      "When broken down by race and gender, TRU shows Hispanic, Black and women workers faring worse than White workers, as well as men.",
      "More than 28% of Hispanic workers, and nearly 27% of Black workers are functionally unemployed, compared to 23% of White workers. And more female workers \u2014 28.6% \u2014 are functionally unemployed than male workers, whose true rate of unemployment stands at 20%, according to LISEP.",
      "Millions of households are currently struggling to maintain a \"minimal quality of life,\" according to another recent analysis from LISEP.",
      "Its research found that the lowest-earning Americans around the U.S. are falling well short of what they need to maintain a decent standard of living. These households earned an average of $38,000 per year in 2023, but would need to make $67,000 to afford the items the group tracks as part of its index, which also includes the cost of professional clothing and basic leisure activities.",
      "The wide chasm between the the BLS's measure of unemployment and its true rate of unemployment is also concerning, according to Ludwig.",
      "\"If you say there's 4.2% unemployment, which makes political folks happy because it's a low number, it causes all kinds of poor policy decisions and assumes we are better off than we are,\" Ludwig said. \"There's less energy and less of a push to improve employment, and the people who get hurt are middle- and low-income Americans.\"",

      "But with the U.S. trade war unleashed against Canada\u00a0in recent months\u00a0\u2014 along with reports of detentions of travelers at the Canadian border by U.S. immigration authorities and threats of annexation by\u00a0President Trump, the chasm between the two neighbors has grown, as fewer Canadians make the trip south to the United States.",
      "According to Sault Ste. Marie's International Bridge Administration, the passenger car traffic in April was down 44% compared with last year. And while the waning bridge traffic may not mean much from the view of Canada's second-largest province and most popular\u00a0destination, to the historic Michigan town it certainly does.",
      "\"They have 70,000 people,\" Hoath said. \"And if they're not coming over and buying in our stores, then it affects us much more.\"",
      "Slowdown in travel to the U.S.",
      "Sault Ste. Marie is not alone in its tourism concerns. Though travel this Memorial Day weekend is expected to be the highest on record, one group has been noticeably absent at U.S. travel checkpoints in recent months: international travelers.",
      "International travel to the U.S.\u00a0fell 14% in March\u00a0compared with the same period last year, according to the the U.S. Travel Association. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the biggest dip in travel, 20.2%, was from Canada, according to research from Tourism Economics, a unit of investment advisory firm Oxford Economics.",
      "Earlier this year, former Prime Minister Trudeau urged Canadians to\u00a0refrain from vacationing in the U.S., after Mr. Trump slapped a 25% tariff\u00a0on Canadian goods. The drop-off in Canadian travel is a notable shift, given that Canada was the biggest source of inbound travel to the U.S. last year, according to the World Travel & Tourism Council.",
      "As to what's behind the overall slowdown in international travel to the U.S., experts point to the Trump administration's stricter immigration policies, the strength of the U.S. dollar and long visa wait times. Aggressive tariff policies have also left a bad taste in many travelers' mouths.",
      "\"Shifting sentiment and perceptions of the U.S. are expected to continue to weigh heavily on travel demand,\" said Aran Ryan, director of industry studies at Tourism Economics.",
      "As of April, flight bookings to the U.S. for the May\u2013July travel window are 10.8% lower than they were the same period last year, according to the research firm. It projects an 8.7% decline in international arrivals in 2025.",
      "Economic Impact",
      "The slowdown in international travel threatens to destabilize America's tourism industry which plays a vital role in supporting the nation's economy.",
      "\"International inbound travel is hugely important from an economic standpoint \u2014 people that come to the U.S. and visit spend on average $4,000 per visit,\" a spokesperson from the U.S. Travel Association, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Those dollars may already be slipping away: The World Travel & Tourism Council projects that spending by international visitors to the U.S. will drop to $169 billion, or 7%, this year, from $181 billion in 2024. That's a 22.5% decrease from peak tourist spending of $217 billion in 2019, before the pandemic.",
      "Fewer international travelers could also take a toll on the workforce that props up America's tourism industry: Nearly 10% of American jobs are tied to the travel industry, according to the World Travel & Tourism Council.",
      "An ongoing decline in international travel to the U.S. could result in a loss of over 230,000 jobs \u2014 with the dining and lodging industries expected to be the most hard hit, according to a recent analysis from the economic research firm IMPLAN.",
      "\"It's not going to devastate the U.S. economy in terms of GDP, but it is very significant in terms of employment,\" Jenny Thorvaldson, IMPLAN's chief economist and data officer, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Hoath, who runs the visitor center in Sault Ste. Marie, said she is already worried about what those losses could mean for her community.",
      "\"When we're looking at the bridge and it's packed, people have to get their employees together,\" she said. \"But if it's not so busy, what happens to your employees? They're not making the money. Some people will be laid off.\"",
      "Hotel bookings in the city of 14,000 are already down 77% year to date, according to the Sault Area Convention & Visitors Bureau.",
      "Shifting focus to domestic travelers",
      "As international tourism dampens, local communities like Flagstaff, Arizona, are rerouting their attention to domestic travelers.",
      "Despite the city's wide international appeal, the travel season has gotten off to a slow start. Flagstaff has seen a 15% to 20% drop in international tourists year over year, according to Trace Ward, director of Flagstaff's Convention and Visitors Bureau.",
      "While he hopes that decline will only be temporary, Ward is looking for ways to bring in more American tourists. One strategy he has in mind is adding more direct flights to the area and possibly attracting a new airline. The city is also promoting its\u00a0Lowell Observatory's new Astronomy Discovery Center, which offers visitors a glimpse of the cosmos.",
      "\"I look forward to the excitement of the international traveler coming back full steam, but until then, we're gonna sell to whoever is interested in coming here,\" Ward said.",
      "Hoath, likewise, has shifted her focus toward attracting visitors from within the States, and has decided to halt spending on any advertising in Canada.",
      "\"When you don't have a ton of funds, you've got to put them where you know they have a better possibility of working,\" she said.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/delta-air-lines-100th-year-takes-flight/",
    "published": "Sun, 25 May 2025 09:53:33 -0400",
    "summary": "What began as the world's first aerial crop-dusting operation in the Mississippi Delta in 1925 has survived mergers, recessions and bankruptcy to become a global carrier with 5,000 flights a day.",
    "story": [
      "When you picture a garage sale, you might think of your neighbor's driveway down the street, not an aviation workshop in the shadow of the world's busiest airport, where Delta Air Lines holds their monthly surplus sale.",
      "Delta fans came from as far as Michigan and even Korea to buy the stuff the airline no longer needs, from seats to engine parts. It's a chance, these folks say, to own a piece of airline history. And how would they get the stuff home? \"We actually flew down with empty bags,\" said one man.",
      "Sarah Zeis came in search of a particular piece of Delta history: a well-used beverage cart. \"I actually need a bar cart in my apartment of these exact dimensions,\" she said.",
      "Getting it home will be a journey all its own.",
      "Proceeds from the sale go right across the parking lot, to the Delta Flight Museum, now celebrating the airline's 100th year \u2013 a first for an American carrier.",
      "It's a century of service that started without beverage carts \u2026 or passengers!",
      "According to archives director Marie Force, Delta owes its existence to a tiny pest: the boll weevil. \"It is the most unique beginning of a U.S. airline, I think,\" she said. \"It's the only airline that started as a crop-dusting company\"",
      "Before Delta, there was Huff-Daland Dusters, started in 1925 in Macon, Georgia. Force said, \"After the first growing season, they realized that most of the center of the business was in the Mississippi Delta region. And so, that's where the name Delta comes from.\"",
      "And in 1929, Delta Air Lines' founder C.E. Woolman expanded the company from pest control to people. Its first passenger flight was from Dallas, Texas, to Jackson, Mississippi, with two stops in Louisiana along the way. A ticket cost $90 round trip \u2013 about $1,700 today. Expensive, and not for everyone. Force said, \"At that time, about 80% of Delta's passengers were businessmen\" \u2013 people trying to speed up a trip that took 12 hours by train to a five-hour flight.",
      "Nearly a century after that first flight, Delta now has more than 5,000 flights a day. The airline has survived mergers, recessions, and bankruptcy, growing from that single route to a nationwide carrier, and the global force we know today.",
      "\"Glamour personified\"",
      "If you've flown Delta lately, you've seen flight attendant Susan Slater in the pre-flight safety video. If you've flown Delta in the last 60 years, you may have shared a cabin with either Slater (who started with the airline on March 2, 1964) or Kay Carpenter (who started in January 1966). It was the \"Golden Age\" of air travel, that romanticized era of flights with exceptional service, extravagant meals, and everyone dressed to the nines.",
      "Back then, said Slater, \"You had to be unmarried. Your hair couldn't touch your collar. You had a weight restriction. Back then I think I weighed 103 pounds and I was 5 foot 2-and-a-half. I'm five feet now, barely, and not 103!\"",
      "I asked, \"What was it about the job that you think spoke to you so much?\"",
      "\"All I knew was that this was glamour personified,\" Slater replied.",
      "Atmosphere Research Group's Henry Harteveldt, an airline industry analyst, says there is no need to be so quite so nostalgic: \"We certainly had a so-called Golden Age of flying back in the early 1960s,\" he said. \"But it was less convenient. There were fewer flights. You often had to connect. And it certainly wasn't as reliable and safe as it is today.",
      "\"We're in the new type of Golden Age now, where flying is a lot more accessible,\" he said. \"You can either buy or create a much nice journey for yourself. You can buy an extra leg room seat. You can pay for priority boarding. And by the way, if you don't need or value those things or perhaps can't afford it, you're not being charged for services that you don't want.\"",
      "Ed Bastian, the CEO of Delta Air Lines, said, \"Air travel is one of the great bargains. If you think about the average fare today versus where it was 30, 40 years ago, it's less than half of what you pay in real dollars.\"",
      "While low fares are sought after by some fliers, Delta has built its business around a premium experience, according to Bastian: \"The single biggest reason why people chose an airline was fare; whoever had the lowest cost won. And Delta, well, yes, we have a product to compete on the lower end. [But] the majority of our revenue comes from higher-end tickets.\"",
      "Their 100th summer is about to take flight, amid clouds of uncertainty \u2026 worries about a slowing economy and aviation safety. But Bastian says it could still be their busiest ever, as he looks to the future.",
      "So, what does he see for Delta's next hundred years? \"When you think in the United States, you know, air travel is relatively ubiquitous \u2013 you jump on a plane almost any hour of the day and get to almost anywhere you want, you know, pretty, pretty easily,\" Bastian said. \"However, when you think about the world, and you realize that only one in five people in the world has even been on an airplane, it's pretty remarkable. We need to figure out ways to make it accessible, to make it affordable, to make it sustainable.\"",
      "I said, \"Part of that legacy is just how much the world has shrunk in those 100 years.\"",
      "\"Yeah, that's what we do,\" Bastian said. \"We make the world a more connected place, a smaller place. And that's needed now more than ever.\"",
      "While Delta helped shrink the world in the 20th century, they hope their own growth continues, thanks to folks like Susan Slater and Kay Carpenter.",
      "\"It's been a wonderful adventure,\" Carpenter said. \"I never dreamed that I would be here for this long. When I started, we had just small airplanes. We flew to small cities. And now we fly to six continents. So, I tell all these new hire flight attendants to always remember that one mile on a highway is going to take you exactly one mile. But a mile on a runway will take you anywhere.\"",

    "story": [
      "Boeing has reached a $1.1 billion deal with the Department of Justice that will allow it to avoid prosecution for two crashes involving its 737 Max jetliners that killed a total of 346 people.",
      "Boeing will be required to invest that money in improving the aviation giant's compliance, safety and quality program, while $445 million will be set aside to provide compensation for the families of the victims killed in the crashes, the Justice Department said.",
      "The agreement stems from the crashes of Lion Air Flight 610 in 2018 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 in 2019. The deal will allow the company to avoid criminal prosecution for allegedly misleading U.S. regulators about the\u00a0737 Max jetliner\u00a0before the crashes, according to court papers filed Friday.",
      "A statement issued on behalf of some relatives of those killed in the crashes blasted the government's deal with Boeing, saying the families felt \"tremendous grief and even anger\" at the agreement.",
      "\"This kind of non-prosecution deal is unprecedented and obviously wrong for the deadliest corporate crime in U.S. history. My families will object and hope to convince the court to reject it,\" Paul Cassell, a professor at the University of Utah's S.J. Quinney College of Law who is representing the families, said in the statement.",
      "The Justice Department defended the agreement. \"After careful consideration of the families' views, the facts and the law, the department's principles of federal prosecution and the professional and ethical obligations of prosecutors, it is the government's judgment that the agreement is a fair and just resolution that serves the public interest,\" the court papers state.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 House Republicans made a number of last-minute changes to the legislation containing President Trump's second-term agenda in order to win over opposing factions in the GOP. And, after an all-night session, the measure, entitled the \"one big, beautiful bill,\" squeaked through by a single vote.",
      "It'll now go to the Senate, which will leave its own mark on the bill. But here's what's in the legislation that was passed by the House Thursday.",
      "Tax cuts and extensions",
      "At the center of the legislation \u2014 and accounting for its biggest expense \u2014 are the provisions extending Mr. Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. With the cuts slated to sunset at year's end, the extension and new tax cuts have been a key priority for congressional Republicans and the White House.",
      "Beyond the 2017 tax cuts, the legislation includes a number of tax cuts that the president touted on the campaign trail. It includes no taxes on tips for workers in the service industry, like those who work at restaurants and bars, as well as people who work in the beauty industry. But it's a temporary exemption that expires at the end of 2028. The package also includes no taxes on overtime through 2028. And the new legislation would allow tax deductions on up to $10,000 in interest on auto loans for cars assembled in the U.S. This provision would be in place until 2029.",
      "The bill would also eliminate a longstanding $200 tax on gun silencers, which has been on the books since Congress passed the National Firearms Act in 1934.",
      "And among the bill's provisions is a temporary $500 increase in the child tax credit, bringing it to $2,500 through 2028.",
      "The package also includes a tax on remittances, imposing a tax on cash payments sent by non-U.S. citizens to family members in their home countries. Though the bill initially would have subjected individuals to a 5% excise tax, the managers amendment, which contained the updates to the bill, lowered the tax to 3.5%.",
      "Medicaid restrictions",
      "The legislation includes changes to Medicaid, a popular entitlement program that provides government-sponsored health care for low-income Americans \u2014 imposing work requirements for able-bodied adults without children, more frequent eligibility checks, cutting federal funds to states that use Medicaid infrastructure to provide health care coverage to undocumented immigrants and banning Medicaid from covering gender transition services for children and adults.",
      "The amendment speeds up the implementation of the work requirements from Jan. 1, 2029, to no later than Dec. 31, 2026, a change sought by hardliners. The work requirements would apply to Medicaid recipients without disabilities between the ages of 19 and 64 who are childless.",
      "Increasing the State and Local Tax Deduction, or SALT",
      "Also included in the package is an increase to the cap on the State and Local Tax Deduction, which was imposed by the 2017 Trump tax law and currently stands at $10,000.",
      "Before the rule, taxpayers could deduct all their state and local taxes from their federal taxes, which some policymakers have said mainly benefits wealthy homeowners in states with high taxes, such as New York and California. But advocates for increasing the caps argue that the $10,000 cap is increasingly impacting middle-class homeowners who live in regions where property taxes are rising.",
      "The package initially included a $30,000 cap, but blue-state Republicans threatened to withhold their support, and they ultimately reached an agreement with leadership to increase the deduction to $40,000 per household for incomes up to $500,000.",
      "Border security funding",
      "Though the bulk of the funding allocated in the legislation goes toward tax cuts, it also includes resources for border security and defense. Among the bill's provisions is $46.5 billion for the border wall, $4.1 billion to hire Border Patrol agents and other personnel and more than $2 billion for signing and retention bonuses for Border Patrol agents. It also includes an additional $1,000 fee for people who are filing for asylum in the U.S.",
      "The amendment to the legislation added an additional $12 billion for expenses related to border security.",
      "$1,000 \"Trump accounts\" for child savings",
      "The legislation also creates $1,000 savings accounts for children, which were originally titled \"MAGA accounts\" \u2014 Money Accounts for Growth and Advancement. The name has been updated to \"Trump accounts.\" Under the plan, the federal government will contribute $1,000 to the accounts of children born between 2024 and 2028. Parents can contribute up to $5,000 a year. The funds, which can begin to be distributed once the child turns 18, can be used for higher education, job training and the purchase of their first home.",
      "While income on the accounts can grow on a tax-deferred basis, distributions for qualified expenses, like those mentioned above, would be taxed at a long-term capital gains rate. Another type of education savings vehicle, 529 accounts, enables parents to save and grow the accounts on a tax-deferred basis, too, but the money can be withdrawn for specific education-related expenses tax-free.",
      "Restrictions on food stamps",
      "The package also raises the upper age requirement for able-bodied adults without children to qualify for benefits under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as SNAP, or food stamps. Currently, in order to qualify, able-bodied adults between 18-54 must meet work requirements. The House bill would update the age requirement to 18-64 and would also shift more of the costs to states.",
      "Rolling back clean energy programs",
      "The bill would also roll back some of the clean energy tax credits under the Biden-era climate and health care law, like an earlier phasing out of a tax break for clean energy vehicles. A late addition to the bill would move up the timeline to end tax credits for new renewable energy power plants as well, requiring them to begin construction within 60 days of the enactment of the legislation and be in service by the end of 2028. The measure makes an exception for nuclear plants, which must be under construction by the end of 2028.",
      "The legislation also adds annual federal registration fees for EV and hybrid car owners: $250 for electric vehicles and $100 for hybrids.",
      "Addressing the debt limit",
      "With a major deadline to address the debt limit on the horizon, the legislation would raise the debt ceiling by $4 trillion.",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has urged Congress to address the debt limit by mid July, warning that the U.S. could be unable to pay its bills as soon as August without action. Congressional Republicans added the debt ceiling to the larger budget package to bypass negotiating with Democrats on the issue, since the budget legislation can move forward in the Senate without support from across the aisle.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump has signed off on a full pardon for former Rep. Michael Grimm of New York, according to a White House official.",
      "Grimm, a Republican, was convicted in November 2014 of tax fraud and related charges stemming from his ownership of a Manhattan restaurant before joining Congress. Prosecutors said he underreported wages and revenue to the government, and that he filed false tax documents.",
      "They alleged Grimm employed unauthorized workers whom he paid \"off the books\" in cash, took deliberate steps to obstruct the federal and state governments from collecting taxes he properly owed, cheated the state of New York out of workers' compensation insurance premiums, caused numerous false business and personal tax returns to be filed for several years and lied under oath to cover up his crimes.",
      "When prosecutors successfully argued for a prison term for Grimm, they raised Grimm's threats against a reporter who questioned him about his case and statements he made in court about the impact of his sentencing.",
      "\"Though the defendant casts himself as an individual with a life 'nothing short of extraordinary in its commitment to service to this country and those in need', his habit of falsely denying and minimizing his criminal conduct and impugning anyone who questions him is indicative of an individual who has not come to terms with his own crimes,\" the Justice Department argued.",
      "Grimm won reelection in 2014 in spite of his indictment, but he pleaded guilty a month later to one count of tax fraud. He resigned from Congress in January 2015 and served eight months in prison.",
      "He was released from prison in May 2016, after serving approximately half a year.",
      "Grimm, who was former Marine and FBI agent before he was elected to Congress, represented Staten Island and part of Brooklyn from 2011 to 2015.",
      "Separately, he was\u00a0under investigation\u00a0for alleged campaign finance violations relating to his fundraising in his 2010 race.",

      "The federal government is working to secure a charter flight to return a man who was removed from the U.S. back to America so he can have proper due process proceedings, the Justice Department said in court documents filed Wednesday.",
      "Last week, U.S. District Judge Brian Murphy ordered the man, only known by the initials O.C.G., to be returned to the United States after he found that necessary due process steps in his removal proceedings were \"ignored\" by the Trump administration.",
      "O.C.G.'s attorneys argued that he has no criminal history and sought asylum in the United States after multiple violent attacks against him in his native country of Guatemala.",
      "In March 2024, O.C.G. entered the United States illegally and was deported. After making it back to the United States again last year, he presented himself to Border Patrol for asylum proceedings. An immigration judge found in February 2025 that O.C.G. would face serious harm if he were sent back to Guatemala and ordered a \"withholding of removal\" that barred deportation back to his home country.",
      "Two days after the immigration judge's February decision, O.C.G. says he was placed on a bus and removed without due process to Mexico, where his attorneys said he was previously held for ransom and raped during his second attempt to get to the United States. He submitted evidence at his immigration hearing of his experiences in Mexico, and as a result the immigration judge said that O.C.G. could not be removed to a country other than Guatemala without additional due process.",
      "After O.C.G. was sent to Mexico by the United States, Mexican authorities removed him to Guatemala, where he remains in hiding, according to court documents.",
      "\"[The] immigration judge told O.C.G.\u2014 consistent with this Court's understanding of the law\u2014that he could not be removed to a country other than his native Guatemala, at least not without some additional steps in the process,\" Murphy wrote in his order last week. \"Those necessary steps, and O.C.G.'s pleas for help, were ignored.\"",
      "Murphy had previously ordered additional fact finding in the case, after the Trump administration submitted a declaration under oath that O.C.G. told government officials that he had no fear of being sent to Mexico. O.C.G had previously submitted a declaration to the court stating that he was told at the last minute before his removal that he was being sent to Mexico, and that he was denied a request to speak to his attorneys beforehand.",
      "The Justice Department admitted to Murphy that there was no witness who could verify the government's account of O.C.G.'s removal under oath and the declaration was made in error.",
      "\"The only evidence before the Court therefore is O.C.G.'s uncontroverted assertion that he was given no notice of his transfer to Mexico and no opportunity to explain why it would be dangerous to send him there,\" Murphy wrote in his order mandating the man's return.",
      "\"Defendants' retraction of their prior sworn statement makes inexorable the already-strong conclusion that O.C.G. is likely to succeed in showing that his removal lacked any semblance of due process,\" the judge added.",
      "The Trump administration's push to ramp up deportations has drawn other scrutiny from other federal judges who argue deportees aren't being given enough due process.",
      "Another judge ordered the Trump administration to \"facilitate\" the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who the government admitted was sent to El Salvador in error. The Supreme Court affirmed that ruling, but Abrego Garcia remains in a Salvadoran prison, and the Trump administration says it's up to that country's government to return him.",
      "Jake Rosen is a reporter covering the Department of Justice. He was previously a campaign digital reporter covering President Trump's 2024 campaign and also served as an associate producer for \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan,\" where he worked with Brennan for two years on the broadcast. Rosen has been a producer for several CBS News podcasts, including \"The Takeout,\" \"The Debrief\" and \"Agent of Betrayal: The Double Life of Robert Hanssen.\""

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration has canceled $766 million awarded to drugmaker Moderna Inc. to develop a vaccine against potential pandemic influenza viruses, including the H5N1 bird flu.",
      "The company said it was notified Wednesday that the Health and Human Services Department had withdrawn funds awarded in July 2024 and in January to pay for development and purchase of its investigational vaccine.",
      "The funds were awarded through the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, or BARDA, a program that focuses on medical treatments for potential pandemics.",
      "The new vaccine, called mRNA-1018, used the same technology that allowed development and rollout of vaccines to fight COVID-19 in record time.",
      "Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has expressed deep skepticism regarding mRNA vaccines, despite real-world evidence that the vaccines are safe and saved millions of lives.",
      "The cancelation came as Moderna announced positive interim results from an early-stage trial of the vaccine that targeted H5 bird flu virus, tested in 300 healthy adults.",
      "\"While the termination of funding from HHS adds uncertainty, we are pleased by the robust immune response and safety profile observed in this interim analysis,\" CEO Stephane Bancel said in a statement.",
      "He added that Moderna would \"explore alternatives\" for funding the development and manufacturing of the vaccine, according to French news agency AFP.",
      "\"These clinical data in pandemic influenza underscore the critical role mRNA technology has played as a countermeasure to emerging health threats,\" AFP cited Bancel as saying.",
      "In a statement in March, Moderna told CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder that, \"Researchers have been exploring mRNA's potential in medicine for over 30 years, leading to the rapid deployment of mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines that transformed the course of the pandemic. With more than a billion doses distributed worldwide and an unprecedented amount of real-world safety and efficacy data, the benefits of mRNA vaccination ... are well established.\"",
      "Dr. Ashish Jha, a public health expert who served as former President Joe Biden's COVID-19 response coordinator, remarked about the funding withdrawal on X, saying, \"This move puts the lives of Americans at risk. The attack on mRNA vaccines is beyond absurd. It was President Trump's Operation Warp Speed that gave us mRNA vaccines. ... \u00a0If Bird Flu starts spreading from people to people, we will come to regret this as the day we decided to put the lives of the American people at grave risk. \"",
      "H5N1 bird flu viruses spilled from wild bird into cattle in the U.S. last year, infecting hundreds of animals in several states. At least 70 people in the U.S. have been sickened by bird flu infections, mostly mild. One person died.",
      "Scientists fear that continued mutation of the virus could enable it to become more virulent or more easily spread in people, with the possibility that it could trigger a pandemic.",
      "Moderna received $176 million in July 2024 and $590 million in January. The January award would have supported a late-stage clinical trial that could have determined the vaccine's efficacy against pandemic viruses, including bird flu, a company spokesman said.",

      "The federal government will begin revoking the visas of some Chinese international students, including those studying in \"critical fields,\" Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Wednesday \u2014 the latest restriction on foreign students.",
      "\"Under President Trump's leadership, the U.S. State Department will work with the Department of Homeland Security to aggressively revoke visas for Chinese students, including those with connections to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in critical fields,\" Rubio wrote in a statement.",
      "Rubio also said the government will \"revise visa criteria to enhance scrutiny of all future visa applications from the People's Republic of China and Hong Kong.\"",
      "China is the second-largest country of origin for international students, behind only India. In the 2023-24 school year, more than 270,000 international students were from China, making up roughly a quarter of all foreign students in the United States.",
      "Beijing blasted the announcement. French news agency AFP quoted foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning as saying the U.S. \"has unreasonably cancelled Chinese students' visas under the pretext of ideology and national rights. China firmly opposes this and has lodged representations with the U.S.\"",
      "The U.S. action comes at a time of intensifying scrutiny of the ties between U.S. higher education and China. House Republicans this month pressed Duke University to cut its ties with a Chinese university, saying it allowed Chinese students to gain access to federally-funded research at Duke.",
      "Last year, House Republicans issued a report warning that hundreds of millions of dollars in defense funding was going to research partnerships linked to the Chinese government, providing \"back-door access to the very foreign adversary nation whose aggression these capabilities are necessary to protect against.\"",
      "The announcement came a day after the State Department told embassies and consulates worldwide to temporarily stop scheduling new student visa interviews, in a cable obtained by CBS News. The cable said the department is preparing \"expanded social media vetting\" of visa applicants.",
      "The two policy changes from the State Department added to uncertainty for America's international students, who have faced intensifying scrutiny from the Trump administration.",
      "The government has attempted to revoke legal status for thousands of international students, many of whom appeared to draw federal scrutiny due to minor legal infractions \u2014 though a federal judge has halted that practice. And the administration has sought to deport several pro-Palestinian student activists under a law allowing visas to be revoked if somebody poses \"adverse foreign policy consequences.\"",
      "Earlier this week, the Trump administration tried to halt all international student enrollments at Harvard University. A judge blocked the move, part of a wider battle between the government and the Ivy League school over its handling of campus protests.",

    "story": [
      "A federal court on Wednesday froze most of the sweeping tariffs imposed by President Trump on virtually every foreign nation, ruling the levies exceed the president's legal authority.",
      "The ruling \u2014 issued by a panel of judges on the U.S. Court of International Trade \u2014 halted the sweeping 10% tariffs Mr. Trump assessed on virtually every U.S. trading partner on \"Liberation Day\" last month, with higher tariffs threatened for dozens of countries. The court also blocked a separate set of tariffs imposed on China, Mexico and Canada by the Trump administration, which has cited drug trafficking and illegal immigration as its reasoning for the hikes.",
      "Global markets rallied on the news.",
      "The Trump administration has justified the tariffs by citing the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977, or IEEPA, which gives the president the power to regulate imports during certain emergency situations. But the court on Wednesday rejected the government's interpretation of the law, and said it would be unconstitutional for any law passed by Congress to give the president blanket authority to set tariffs.",
      "\"The court does not read IEEPA to confer such unbounded authority and sets aside the challenged tariffs imposed thereunder,\" the judges wrote Wednesday.",
      "The court said Mr. Trump's global 10% tariffs aren't authorized by IEEPA because they're designed to deal with trade imbalances between the U.S. and the rest of the world, which the judges said should fall under non-emergency legislation.",
      "And the China, Canada and Mexico tariffs aren't legal because they \"do not deal with the threats set forth in those orders,\" the court also found.",
      "The three judges who wrote Wednesday's ruling were nominated to the bench by former President Ronald Reagan, former President Barack Obama and Mr. Trump in his first term.",
      "The Trump administration said in court papers that it will appeal the ruling to the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals.",
      "White House spokesperson Kush Desai responded to the ruling by defending the reasoning for the tariffs, saying the U.S.'s trade deficits with other countries have \"created a national emergency that has decimated American communities.\"",
      "\"It is not for unelected judges to decide how to properly address a national emergency. President Trump pledged to put America First, and the Administration is committed to using every lever of executive power to address this crisis and restore American Greatness,\" Desai said in a statement.",
      "Tariffs are a signature part of Mr. Trump's second-term agenda. He argues the levies are necessary to boost U.S. manufacturing and end what he views as unfair trade practices. But the moves have rattled financial markets and drawn rebuke from Democrats, as well as some Republicans.",
      "Mr. Trump has stood by his tariff strategy but halted many of the levies while vowing to negotiate with U.S. trading partners. A set of so-called \"reciprocal\" tariffs on dozens of countries were paused in April for a period of at least three months. Goods that fall under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement were exempted from 25% tariffs. Massive tariffs on Chinese goods have also been cut back amid negotiations.",
      "Meanwhile, the tariffs have drawn lawsuits from businesses, Democratic states and other parties. Wednesday's ruling was linked to two lawsuits: One from a group of businesses that say they have been harmed by the tariffs, and one from several states.",
      "Some of the lawsuits against the tariffs have raised legal doctrines long championed by conservative lawyers and judges to restrict the authority of executive branch agencies. Those include the major questions doctrine, which says Congress needs to give clear authorization for federal agencies to decide issues of major economic significance, and the nondelegation doctrine, which holds that Congress can't delegate its legislative power to the executive branch.",

      "Musk, a billionaire entrepreneur, will begin his offboarding process with the White House on Wednesday night, according to an administration official.",
      "Musk's DOGE team has upturned the government through employee cuts at nearly every federal agency and the termination of billions of dollars of government contracts. Musk has said the effort has cut around $160 billion in spending. However, some of the spending cuts cited by DOGE have\u00a0contained errors, and one report estimates the cuts could cost the government $135 billion due to lost productivity and the cost of putting staff on leave and re-hiring some workers.",
      "The White House said in February that Musk is a \"special government employee,\" or SGE. The designation allowed him to work for the executive branch, subject to different ethics rules than federal employees.",
      "But SGEs are limited to working 130 days in a 365-day period. Friday, May 30, would mark 130 days since Mr. Trump was inaugurated for his second term and when Musk's work at DOGE began.",

      "\"I was disappointed to see the massive spending bill, frankly, which increases the budget deficit, not just decreases it, and undermines the work that the DOGE team is doing,\" Musk told \"CBS Sunday Morning\" correspondent David Pogue in a broadcast exclusive interview.",

      "White House Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought said in a Fox Business interview on Wednesday that the Trump administration will make some of DOGE's cuts permanent through a bill in Congress known as a rescission package, which is a way for Congress to cancel funds it previously appropriated but that the federal government has not yet spent. Vought said that cuts to foreign aid and the U.S. Agency for International Development, as well as funds to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, would be included first.",

      "A federal judge in Massachusetts on Wednesday ordered the Trump administration to lift a pause it imposed on various immigration\u00a0applications, saying it was not in the public interest for hundreds of thousands of immigrants to lose their legal status in the U.S.",
      "The ruling by U.S. District Court Judge Indira Talwani is a reprieve for many immigrants from Afghanistan, Latin America, Ukraine and other parts of the world whose ability to remain and work in the U.S. lawfully had been threatened by several Trump administration actions.",
      "Agreeing with pro-immigrant advocates who sued the Trump administration, Talwani found that the government's actions were arbitrary and capricious, in violation of federal administrative law.",
      "\"This court emphasizes, as it did in its prior order, that it is not in the public interest to manufacture a circumstance in which hundreds of thousands of individuals will, over the course of several months, become unlawfully present in the country, such that these individuals cannot legally work in their communities or provide for themselves and their families,\" Talwani wrote in her order.",
      "The programs at the center of Talwani's order rely on a legal immigration authority known as parole, which allows the federal government to temporarily admit foreigners on humanitarian or public interest grounds. President Trump's appointees have sought to curtail the use of parole, arguing that the authority was broadly abused by the Biden administration.",
      "Talwani directed the Trump administration to end a pause it quietly enacted in February to suspend the processing of immigration benefit applications filed by immigrants allowed into the U.S. under several Biden administration programs that relied on the parole authority.",
      "That pause mainly affected 240,000 Ukrainians allowed into the U.S. under a sponsorship program known as Uniting for Ukraine set up after the Russian invasion of their homeland in February 2022, as well as 530,000 Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans who benefited from another Biden-era parole policy. It prevented those who entered the U.S. under those policies from obtaining other forms of legal status, like asylum, Temporary Protected Status or permanent residency.",
      "Talwani ordered the government to lift another pause, issued in January that has barred immigration officials from considering parole extension requests from Afghans, Ukrainians and other immigrant populations granted entry into the U.S. through parole programs, mostly under the Biden administration.",
      "Her ruling also blocked the Trump administration from taking any actions to stop processing parole applications under a longstanding program designed to give temporary legal relief to the immigrant relatives of U.S. service members or veterans. The administration has said this program has not been affected by its efforts to restrict the use of parole.",
      "Representatives for the Department of Homeland Security and its sub-agency, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), which oversees the parole programs, did not immediately comment on Wednesday's court order.",
      "The ruling by Talwani is the second time she ruled against the Trump administration's efforts to scale back parole programs.",
      "In April, Talwani blocked the administration from moving forward with a plan to terminate the legal status and seek the deportation of the hundreds of thousands of migrants who came to the U.S. under the parole program for citizens of Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela. The Trump administration justified the move by saying the parole initiative was plagued by fraud and inadequate vetting procedures.",

      "The Trump administration has leaned into cryptocurrency, looking to ease regulations, promote growth in the industry, and bring it into the mainstream. A longstanding backer of cryptocurrencies, Vance owned between $250,000 and $500,000 worth of Bitcoin, according to an August 2024 financial disclosure.",
      "\"We want our fellow Americans to know that crypto and digital assets and particularly Bitcoin, are part of the mainstream economy, and are here to stay,\" Vance said Wednesday.",
      "Vance said it's been a while since he's been to a conference with \"this level of energy,\" adding, \"but I promise I'm not just saying that to juice my own memecoins.\" Vance gave few policy specifics in his speech. But he insisted that, through decentralized finance, crypto has \"transformed\" how Americans make transactions and acts as a \"hedge\" against bad policy.",
      "\"Crypto is a hedge against bad policymaking from Washington, no matter what party's in control,\" he said. \"It's a hedge against skyrocketing inflation, which has eroded the real savings rates of Americans over the last four years. And as you all know well, it's a hedge against a private sector that's increasingly willing to discriminate against consumers on the basis of their basic beliefs, including their politics.\"",
      "Vance urged Congress to pass the GENIUS Act, which would create a regulatory framework for stablecoins. Stablecoins are a type of crypto tied to an underlying asset such as the U.S. dollar.",
      "\"In this administration, we do not think that stablecoin's threatened the integrity of the United States dollar, quite the opposite,\" Vance said Wednesday. \"In fact, we view them as a force multiplier of our economic might.\"",
      "Vance said he knows a lot of people in 2024 chose to \"speak up\" and \"get involved,\" and he needs them to step up again.",
      "\"Unless you guys get involved in politics, politics is going to ignore this industry,\" Vance said. \"... While Bitcoin is digital, none of you are. None of us are. What happens in the world of politics, what happens in the world of bureaucracy, it will affect even the most transformational and valuable technologies if we don't make the right decisions. So the first piece of advice, the first thing that I'd ask you, is to take the momentum of your political involvement in 2024 and carry it forward to 2026 and beyond.\"",

      "Vance is the highest-ranking sitting politician to address the Bitcoin Conference, which describes itself as \"the world's largest gathering of bitcoiners\" and often draws crypto-friendly lawmakers. Mr. Trump, then a presidential candidate, was the headline speaker last year.",

      "\"Under the previous administration, we have been subject to\u2026it was basically a carpet bombing of the entire industry,\" Tenev said.",
      "\"And now suddenly, you're allowed to play some offense\u2026And we have an administration that's open to the technology,\" he added.\"",
      "Bitcoin \u2014 and cryptocurrency more generally \u2014 has grown in prominence and drawn allies from both parties, despite skepticism about its volatility. The price of Bitcoin, the world's most widely used cryptocurrency, has leaped nearly 60% in the last year.",
      "Mr. Trump was once a crypto skeptic, calling Bitcoin a \"scam\" whose value is \"based on thin air.\" But in his second term, he has enthusiastically boosted crypto and promised to reverse strict Biden-era regulations.",
      "Mr. Trump and his family also have financial interests in crypto, which makes up $2.9 billion of his net worth, according to one recent report. Trump Media and Technology Group, the parent company of Truth Social, announced Tuesday it is raising $2.5 billion to invest in Bitcoin.",
      "Meanwhile, businesses linked to the president launched a Trump-branded \"meme coin\" earlier this year, and Mr. Trump hosted the digital currency's top investors at his Virginia golf club last week. The president and his sons are linked to crypto exchange World Liberty Financial. And Eric Trump co-founded a Bitcoin mining venture that's seeking to go public.",
      "The moves have drawn criticism from Democrats and some ethics experts who argue Mr. Trump's crypto ventures pose a conflict of interest, and investing in them could be a quick route to gaining access to the president.",

      "New York City \u2014 Frank Bisignano, commissioner of the Social Security Administration, told CBS News that he believes technology, and specifically artificial intelligence, could be the key to improving his agency's customer service, despite recent changes that have prompted concern among some of the nearly 69 million Americans that receive Social Security each month.",
      "\"We're bringing a massive technology effort to transform the servicing agenda,\" Bisignano said. \"We're gonna bring AI into the phone system...I intend it to be completed this year.\"",
      "The agency gets about 390,000 calls per day, according to SSA data. The average wait time for those calls as of April was 68 minutes, down from 112 minutes in January.",

We we'll always be there. You want to meet us on the web? We will be there. And you want to meet us on the phone, we'll be there.\"",
      "The SSA announced in March that it would require in-person identity checks at field offices for new and existing beneficiaries, with some limited exemptions.",

      "About six million seniors would have faced a 45-mile trip to reach an SSA office, according to an\u00a0analysis\u00a0from the Center on Budget and Public Policies.",
      "There are questions about how Bisgnano plans to implement changes despite a smaller workforce. In February, the agency said it intended to cut its staffing levels down from about 57,000 to 50,000, a 12% reduction. The website for the White House's Elon Musk-led\u00a0Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, has identified more than a dozen field offices for closure.",

    "story": [
      "A new acronym is popping up on Wall Street to explain investors' reaction to President Trump's on-again, off-again tariffs: TACO.",
      "Coined by Financial Times journalist Robert Armstrong in a May 2\u00a0column, the tongue-in-cheek term stands for \"Trump Always Chickens Out.\" That phrase is meant to describe a pattern of stocks plunging when the Trump administration announces stiff new tariffs, then surging when Mr. Trump eases up on them days or weeks later.",
      "Since Armstrong's column, Mr. Trump has pulled back on import duties on two other major U.S. trading partners. On May 12, he placed a 90-day freeze\u00a0on 145% tariffs on Chinese goods, while on May 26 he\u00a0delayed 50% tariffs on European goods until July. In both cases, the markets jumped after Mr. Trump offered to ease tariffs.",
      "\"[T]he recent rally has a lot to do with markets realizing that the U.S. administration does not have a very high tolerance for market and economic pressure, and will be quick to back off when tariffs cause pain. This is the TACO theory: Trump Always Chickens Out,\" Armstrong wrote on May 2.",
      "In the most recent case, the market dropped sharply on Friday after Mr. Trump said he planned to hike tariffs on European imports to 50%. But on Memorial Day, Mr. Trump said he would ease up on those plans until July to give the European Union and the U.S. more time to negotiate. On Tuesday, the day U.S. markets reopened after the holiday, the S&P 500 rallied 2.1%.",
      "When asked about the term by a reporter at the White House on Wednesday, Mr. Trump responded that it was a \"nasty question.\"",
      "\"It's called negotiation,\" Mr. Trump said. \"They wouldn't be over here today negotiating if I didn't put a 50% tariff\" on Europe.",
      "He added, \"[T]hey'll say, oh, he was chicken. He was chicken. That's unbelievable. I usually have the opposite problem. They say, 'You're too tough, Mr. President.'\"",
      "Whatever the strategy at the White House, investors are becoming more comfortable with the Trump administration's pattern of initially setting high tariff rates that it later reduces , noted Vital Knowledge analyst Adam Crisafulli.",
      "\"[T]he narrative is growing increasingly bullish as investors become more comfortable with the severity of the tariff threat (the \"TACO\" mindset is being embraced by more people) while companies demonstrate an ability to absorb the import tax hike relatively well (the hit to [earnings per share] hasn't been as draconian as feared),\" Crisafulli wrote in a May 28 research note.",
      "Still, there may be too much complacency in the market about the threat of Mr. Trump's tariffs, which major businesses like Walmart have warned will cause them to hike prices, as well as the wobbly fiscal outlook for the U.S., Crisafulli added. Earlier this month, Moody's downgraded the U.S. credit rating, highlighting investor concerns about the government's growing debt.",
      "\"That said, the tariff narrative could stay in a state of benign optimism for the next several weeks (the big deadline is early/mid-July, when the 90-day reciprocal tariff/50% EU tariff suspensions expires) while tariff-driven inflation may not appear in the data until July (when the June numbers are reported),\" the analyst noted.",

      "There's an 80% chance the world will break another annual temperature record in the next five years, and it's even more probable that the world will again exceed the international temperature threshold set 10 years ago, according to a five-year forecast released Wednesday by the World Meteorological Organization and the U.K. Meteorological Office.",
      "Last year's record was just the latest in a decade of record-breaking\u00a0heat, with every year since 2015 ranking among the 10 hottest ever recorded.",
      "\"Higher global mean temperatures may sound abstract, but it translates in real life to a higher chance of extreme weather: stronger hurricanes, stronger precipitation, droughts,\" said Cornell University climate scientist Natalie Mahowald, who wasn't part of the calculations but said they made sense. \"So higher global mean temperatures translates to more lives lost.\"",
      "With every tenth of a degree the world warms from human-caused climate change \"we will experience higher frequency and more extreme events (particularly heat waves but also droughts, floods, fires and human-reinforced hurricanes/typhoons),\" emailed Johan Rockstrom, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany. He was not part of the research.",
      "And for the first time there's a chance - albeit slight - that before the end of the decade, the world's annual temperature will shoot past the Paris climate accord goal of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) and hit a more alarming 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) of heating since the mid-1800s, the two agencies said.",
      "There's an 86% chance that one of the next five years will pass 1.5 degrees and a 70% chance that the five years as a whole will average more than that global milestone, they figured.",
      "The projections come from more than 200 forecasts using computer simulations run by 10 global centers of scientists.",
      "\"We have just experienced the ten warmest years on record. Unfortunately, this WMO report provides no sign of respite over the coming years, and this means that there will be a growing negative impact on our economies, our daily lives, our ecosystems and our planet,\" said WMO Deputy Secretary-General Ko Barrett.",
      "\"Continued climate monitoring and prediction is essential to provide decision-makers with science-based tools and information to help us adapt,\" she said.",
      "Fears of repeats",
      "Ten years ago, the same teams figured there was a similar remote chance - about 1% - that one of the upcoming years would exceed that critical 1.5 degree threshold and then it happened last year. This year, a 2-degree Celsius above pre-industrial year enters the equation in a similar manner, something UK Met Office longer term predictions chief Adam Scaife and science scientist Leon Hermanson called \"shocking.\"",
      "\"It's not something anyone wants to see, but that's what the science is telling us,\" Hermanson said. Two degrees of warming is the secondary threshold, the one considered less likely to break, set by the 2015 Paris agreement.",
      "Technically, even though 2024 was 1.5 degrees Celsius warmer than pre-industrial times, the Paris climate agreement's threshold is for a 20-year time period, so it has not been exceeded. Factoring in the past 10 years and forecasting the next 10 years, the world is now probably about 1.4 degrees Celsius (2.5 degrees Fahrenheit) hotter since the mid 1800s, World Meteorological Organization climate services director Chris Hewitt estimated.",
      "\"With the next five years forecast to be more than 1.5C warmer than preindustrial levels on average, this will put more people than ever at risk of severe heat waves, bringing more deaths and severe health impacts unless people can be better protected from the effects of heat. Also we can expect more severe wildfires as the hotter atmosphere dries out the landscape,\" said Richard Betts, head of climate impacts research at the UK Met Office and a professor at the University of Exeter.",
      "Ice in the Arctic - which will continue to warm 3.5 times faster than the rest of the world - will melt and seas will rise faster, Hewitt said.",
      "What tends to happen is that global temperatures rise like riding on an escalator, with temporary and natural El Nino weather cycles acting like jumps up or down on that escalator, scientists said. But lately, after each jump from an El Nino, which adds warming to the globe, the planet doesn't go back down much, if at all.",

What's more, the cycle repeats every 44 minutes, at least during periods of extreme activity.",
      "X-rays and radio waves are two different types of electromagnetic radiation. The correlation in their emission patterns in this case, along with other mysterious observations, led the study's authors to characterize what they found as \"unlike any known Galactic object.\"",

      "Or it could be \"something exotic\" and unknown, said Wang, lead author of the study published in the journal Nature.",
      "NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory spotted the X-ray emissions by chance last year while focusing on a supernova remnant, or the remains of an exploded star. Wang said it was the first time X-rays had been seen coming from a so-called long-period radio transient, a rare object that cycles through radio signals over tens of minutes.",
      "Given the uncertain distance, astronomers can't tell if the weird object is associated with the supernova remnant or not. A single light-year is 5.8 trillion miles.",
      "The hyperactive phase of this object \u2014 designated ASKAP J1832\u2212091 \u2014 appeared to last about a month. Outside of that period, the star did not emit any noticeable X-rays. That could mean more of these objects may be out there, scientists said.",
      "\"While our discovery doesn't yet solve the mystery of what these objects are and may even deepen it, studying them brings us closer to two possibilities,\" Wang said. \"Either we are uncovering something entirely new, or we're seeing a known type of object emitting radio and X-ray waves in a way we've never observed before.\"",

      "He added that the Super Heavy launch cadence for the next three flights will be faster, at approximately one per month or less, assuming, of course, engineers reviewing telemetry can quickly pin down what went wrong and implement fixes to correct the problems.",
      "The huge rocket's launching, known as Integrated Flight Test 9, got underway with a ground-shaking liftoff at 7:37 p.m. EDT from SpaceX's sprawling Boca Chica, Texas, manufacturing and flight facility \u2014 Starbase \u2014 on the Texas coast.",
      "The mission featured the first use of a previously flown Super Heavy first stage, which flew itself back to capture by giant mechanical arms on the launch tower during the program's seventh test flight in January.",
      "For the program's latest launch, the Super Heavy, powered by 33 methane-fueled Raptor engines generating up to 16 million pounds of thrust, followed the same ascent flight plan as previous missions, propelling the Starship upper stage out of the thick lower atmosphere on an easterly trajectory toward the Straits of Florida.",
      "Equipped with six Raptors of its own, the 160-foot-long Starship separated from its booster about two and a half minutes after liftoff, heading for a suborbital trajectory carrying it toward a planned vertical splashdown in the southern Indian Ocean.",
      "The Super Heavy, meanwhile, used a different method for flipping around for the trip back to the launch site in a bid to save propellants. It was also programmed to fly a much steeper descent than usual to learn more about the thermal and aerodynamic stresses it can safely endure.",
      "\"The booster will attempt to fly at a higher angle of attack during its descent,\" SpaceX said on its website. \"By increasing the amount of atmospheric drag on the vehicle, a higher angle of attack can result in a lower descent speed which in turn requires less propellant for the initial landing burn.\"",
      "\"Getting real-world data on how the booster is able to control its flight at this higher angle of attack will contribute to improved performance on future vehicles, including the next generation of Super Heavy,\" SpaceX said.",
      "As a result of the high-stress tests, SpaceX targeted a splashdown in the Gulf instead of attempting a launch pad capture where critical infrastructure could be damaged in a landing mishap.",
      "As it turned out, that was a good decision.",
      "Launch attempt follows two Starship breakups",
      "Tuesday's launch came on the heels of back-to-back Starship upper stage breakups during the two previous test flights that generated spectacular showers of flaming debris along the flight paths.",
      "Since then, SpaceX engineers have carried out extensive testing and implemented multiple upgrades and improvements to minimize the chances for similar failures. The Federal Aviation Administration, which oversaw both failure investigations, gave SpaceX permission to proceed with IFT-9 last week after wrapping up the IFT-8 review.",
      "\"The FAA conducted a comprehensive safety review of the SpaceX Starship Flight 8 mishap and determined that the company has satisfactorily addressed the causes of the mishap, and therefore, the Starship vehicle can return to flight,\" the agency said in a statement. \"The FAA will verify SpaceX implements all corrective actions.\"",
      "In both of the previous failures, commercial airline traffic in and around the Straits of Florida was held up pending confirmation falling debris was no longer a threat. For the ninth flight, the length of the Aircraft Hazard Area was expanded from about 1,000 statute miles to around 1,840 miles and SpaceX was required to launch the rocket during non-peak air travel periods.",
      "Plans for the moon and Mars",
      "The Super Heavy-Starship rocket is critical to NASA's plans to land astronauts on the moon in the next few years and to Musk's plans to eventually send humans to Mars.",
      "NASA plans to use a variant of the Starship upper stage as a lunar lander in the agency's Artemis program. NASA wants to use its own rocket and crew capsule to ferry astronauts to lunar orbit where the SpaceX lander will be waiting to carry them down to the surface.",
      "The Trump administration wants to cancel NASA's Space Launch System rocket and Orion crew capsule, leaving the future of the Artemis program, as it's currently envisioned, in doubt. For his part, Musk has argued the United States should pass up moon missions, which he called a \"distraction,\" and instead head directly to Mars.",
      "In any case, the Super Heavy-Starship rocket is expected to play a major role in future deep space exploration, regardless of the target. But multiple successful test flights will be needed to demonstrate the safety and reliability needed for astronauts and passengers heading to the moon, Mars or beyond.",
      "In an interview for \"CBS Sunday Morning,\" taped shortly before Tuesday's launch, Musk told correspondent David Pogue, \"If we're lucky, we've probably got about a 50% chance of sending ... ships from Earth to Mars at the end of next year. So November, December next year, in about 18 months.\"",
      "Asked if that timeline was realistic, Musk replied, \"Well, I try to give the 50th percentile. ... So you should expect half the time I'm wrong.\" [See more of the exclusive interview with Musk on \"CBS Sunday Morning,\" Sunday, June 1.]",
      "SpaceX made changes after two catastrophic explosions",
      "The last two Starships, launched Jan. 16 and March 6, both ended with unrelated catastrophic explosions as they neared their planned sub-orbital trajectories.",
      "During the January flight, a propellant leak in an unpressurized \"attic\" above the Raptor engines led to sustained fires that eventually triggered shutdown of all but one of the spacecraft's engines. Telemetry was lost eight minutes and 20 seconds after launch and moments later, the vehicle broke apart.",
      "\"The most probable root cause for the loss of ship was identified as a harmonic response several times stronger in flight than had been seen during testing, which led to increased stress on hardware in the propulsion system,\" SpaceX said on its website. \"The subsequent propellant leaks exceeded the venting capability of the ship's attic area and resulted in sustained fires.\"",
      "After extensive ground tests, SpaceX made changes to propellant feedlines, and thrust levels and installed additional vents and a new nitrogen purge system in the attic to reduce the potential for fire.",
      "Those fixes appeared to work as expected during the Starship's eighth test flight in March, but the upper stage again suffered a catastrophic failure. This time around, the Starship suffered a \"hardware failure in one of the upper stage Raptor engines that resulted in inadvertent propellant mixing and ignition,\" SpaceX said on its website.",
      "To fix the problem, upper stage Raptors now feature a new nitrogen purge system, improvements to the propellant drain system and tighter joints in key areas. SpaceX is also developing an improved Raptor engine that will eliminate several failure modes.",

      "Johann Strauss II's \"Blue Danube\" is heading into space this month to mark the 200th anniversary of the waltz king's birth.",
      "The classical piece will be beamed into the cosmos as it's performed by the Vienna Symphony Orchestra. The celestial send-off on May 31 \u2014 livestreamed with free public screenings in Vienna, Madrid and New York \u2014 also will celebrate the European Space Agency's founding 50 years ago.",
      "Although the music could be converted into radio signals in real time, according to officials, ESA will relay a pre-recorded version from the orchestra's rehearsal the day before to avoid any technical issues. The live performance will provide the accompaniment.",
      "The radio signals will hurtle away at the speed of light, or a mind-blowing 670 million mph (more than 1 billion kph).",
      "That will put the music past the moon in 1 \u00bd seconds, past Mars in 4 \u00bd minutes, past Jupiter in 37 minutes and past Neptune in four hours. Within 23 hours, the signals will be as far from Earth as NASA's Voyager 1, the world's most distant spacecraft at more than 15 billion miles (24 billion kilometers) in interstellar space.",
      "NASA also celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2008 by transmitting a song directly into deep space: the Beatles' \"Across the Universe.\" And last year, NASA beamed up Missy Elliott's\u00a0\"The Rain (Supa Dupa Fly)\" toward Venus.",
      "Music has even flowed from another planet to Earth \u2014 courtesy of a NASA Mars rover. Flight controllers at California's Jet Propulsion Laboratory sent a recording of will.i.am's \"Reach for the Stars\" to Curiosity in 2012 and the rover relayed it back.",
      "These are all deep-space transmissions as opposed to the melodies streaming between NASA's Mission Control and orbiting crews since the mid-1960s.",
      "Now it's Strauss' turn, after getting passed over for the Voyager Golden Records nearly a half-century ago.",
      "Launched in 1977, NASA's twin Voyagers 1 and 2 each carry a gold-plated copper phonograph record, along with a stylus and playing instructions for anyone or anything out there.",
      "The records contain sounds and images of Earth as well as 90 minutes of music. The late astronomer Carl Sagan led the committee that chose Bach, Beethoven, Mozart and Stravinsky pieces, along with modern and Indigenous selections.",
      "Among those skipped was Strauss, whose \"Blue Danube\" graced Stanley Kubrick's 1968 sci-fi opus \"2001: A Space Odyssey.\"",
      "The tourist board in Vienna, where Strauss was born on Oct. 25, 1825, said it aims to correct this \"cosmic mistake\" by sending the \"the most famous of all waltzes\" to its destined home among the stars.",
      "ESA's big radio antenna in Spain, part of the space agency's deep-space network, will do the honors. The dish will be pointed in the direction of Voyager 1 so the \"Blue Danube\" heads that way.",
      "\"Music connects us all through time and space in a very particular way,\" ESA's director general Josef Aschbacher said in a statement. \"The European Space Agency is pleased to share the stage with Johann Strauss II and open the imaginations of future space scientists and explorers who may one day journey to the anthem of space.\"",

      "Chapter 1",
      "Divine Right",
      "Everyone else had arrived, but Elon Musk was late as usual. It was the summer of 2015, and a group of men had gathered for a private dinner at Sam Altman's invitation to discuss the future of AI and humanity.",
      "Musk had met Altman, fourteen years his junior, a while earlier and had formed a good impression. President of the famed Silicon Valley startup accelerator Y Combinator, Altman's reputation preceded him. After starting his first company at age nineteen, he had rapidly established himself within Silicon Valley as a brilliant strategist and dealmaker with grand ambitions, even for the land of big\u2011thinking founders. Musk found him to be smart, driven, and, most important, someone who espoused like\u2011minded views on the need to carefully develop and govern artificial intelligence. It was as if, Musk would describe in a lawsuit years later, Altman had mirrored everything Musk had ever said about the subject to win his trust.",
      "For Altman's part, he often said that Musk had been a childhood hero. After the older entrepreneur had shown him around the sprawling SpaceX factory in Hawthorne, California, that admiration had only deepened. \"The thing that sticks in memory was the look of absolute certainty on his face when he talked about sending large rockets to Mars,\" Altman wrote later of the experience. \"I left thinking 'huh, so that's the benchmark for what conviction looks like.'\"",
      "Musk had been deeply concerned about AI for some time. In 2012, he'd met Demis Hassabis, the professorial CEO of the London\u2011based AI lab DeepMind Technologies. Shortly thereafter, Hassabis had also paid Musk a visit at his SpaceX factory. As the two men sat in the canteen, surrounded by the sounds of massive rocket parts being transported and assembled, Hassabis raised the possibility that more advanced AI, of the kind that might one day exceed human intelligence, could pose a threat to humanity. What's more, Musk's fail\u2011safe of colonizing Mars to escape would not work in this scenario. Superintelligence, Hassabis said with amusement, would simply follow humans into the galaxy. Musk, decidedly less amused, invested $5 million in DeepMind to keep tabs on the company.",
      "Later, at his 2013 birthday party in the lush wine\u2011growing landscapes of Napa Valley, Musk had gotten into a heated and emotional debate with his longtime friend and Google cofounder Larry Page over whether AI surpassing human intelligence was in fact a problem. Page didn't think so, calling it the next stage of evolution. When Musk balked, Page accused him of being a \"specist,\" discriminating against nonhuman species.",
      "After that, Musk began to speak incessantly about the existential risk of AI. At an MIT symposium, he described AI as probably the \"biggest existential threat\" to humanity and its development as \"summoning the demon.\" He met with publishers in New York, gripped by the thought of writing his own book about extinction\u2011level threats, including AI. Later, at a recurring AI Salon event at Stanford, a young researcher named Timnit Gebru would come up to him after a talk and ask him why he was so obsessed with AI when the threat of climate change was more clearly existential. \"Climate change is bad, but it's not going to kill everyone,\" he said. \"AI could render humanity extinct.\"",

      "President Trump threatened to impose a fresh round of tariffs Friday morning, including a 25% tariff on Apple if they do not shift some of their iPhone production to the U.S.",
      "\"I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhone's that will be sold in the United  States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else,\" he posted\u00a0Friday on his Truth Social social media platform. \"If that is not the case, a Tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the U.S. Thank your for your attention to this matter!\"",
      "In a subsequent post, Mr. Trump also threatened to impose a 50% tariff on the European Union, calling the group of countries \"very difficult to deal with.\"",
      "\"Our discussions with them are going nowhere!\" the president said in his post on Truth Social. \"Therefore, I am recommending a straight 50% Tariff on the European Union, starting on June 1, 2025.\"",
      "\"There is no Tariff if the product is built or manufactured in the United States,\" he added.",
      "President Trump met with Apple CEO Tim Cook at the White House on Wednesday, according to a White House official. The official did not disclose what was discussed at the meeting.",
      "Mr. Trump imposed sweeping tariffs in early April but later announced he would\u00a0exempt high-tech products, including Apple's iPhone, which is primarily manufactured in China. Still, tariffs are expected to hurt the company's earnings. Apple CEO Tim Cook said in a May 1 earnings call that the stepped up U.S. levies could cost the company $900 million in the current quarter.",
      "Apple shares fell 2.6% in early trading on Friday as broader financial markets also slid. The S&P 500 sank 60 points, or 1%, to 5,782, while the Dow Jones Industrial Complex and Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.7% and 1.1%, respectively.",
      "Apple did not immediately respond to a request for a comment.",
      "Apple invests in India",
      "Mr. Trump's threats come after Apple's supplier, contract electronics manufacturer Foxconn, on Tuesday\u00a0announced plans to invest $1.5 billion in its Indian operations.",
      "Apple continues to make most iPhones in China, but shifting its focus to other places like India, which is subject to lower levies than China.",
      "Mr. Trump initially imposed a 26% tariff on India, but that's on pause until July. A 10% universal tariff on goods shipped to the U.S. from overseas remains in place.",
      "In a March earnings call, Cook noted that over half of the iPhones produced for sale in the U.S. now are made in India, Wedbush Securities tech analyst Daniel Ives said in a research note on Friday. On that call, Cook also indicated the company would increase iPhone assembly production in India by up to 65% by this fall.",
      "Producing iPhones in the U.S. a \"fairy tale\"",
      "Apple announced in February it would invest $500 billion in U.S. manufacturing over the next four years, a move the tech giant described as its \"largest-ever spend commitment.\"",
      "\"This new pledge builds on Apple's long history of investing in American innovation and advanced high-skilled manufacturing,\" Apple posted in its announcement.",
      "The move was\u00a0cheered by the Trump administration, which has touted\u00a0corporate investment in the U.S. following the rollout of the president' tariffs.",
      "As part of their investment, Apple said it would built a new 250,000-square-foot factory in Houston, Texas where they will produce servers, which have previously been built outside of the U.S. The company hasn't announced any plans to ramp up domestic iPhone production.",
      "Ives thinks Apple is unlikely to shift its smartphone production to the U.S., noting the much higher domestic manufacturing costs and that revamping its supply chains to make that possible would take years. Producing iPhones in the U.S. would lift the cost for higher-end models to as much as $3,500 each.",
      "\"We believe the concept of Apple producing iPhones in the U.S. is a fairy tale that is not feasible,\" he said.",
      "President Trump has promoted tariffs as a way to reinvigorate U.S. manufacturing, secure more favorable trade deals with other countries and advance the White House's other policies, such as curbing unauthorized immigration and trafficking of illicit drugs.",
      "Many trade experts\u00a0are skeptical\u00a0that higher U.S. tariffs are likely to spur an upsurge in domestic manufacturing.

      "A federal court on Wednesday froze most of the sweeping tariffs imposed by President Trump on virtually every foreign nation, ruling the levies exceed the president's legal authority.",
      "The ruling \u2014 issued by a panel of judges on the U.S. Court of International Trade \u2014 halted the sweeping 10% tariffs Mr. Trump assessed on virtually every U.S. trading partner on \"Liberation Day\" last month, with higher tariffs threatened for dozens of countries. The court also blocked a separate set of tariffs imposed on China, Mexico and Canada by the Trump administration, which has cited drug trafficking and illegal immigration as its reasoning for the hikes.",
      "Global markets rallied on the news.",
      "The Trump administration has justified the tariffs by citing the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977, or IEEPA, which gives the president the power to regulate imports during certain emergency situations. But the court on Wednesday rejected the government's interpretation of the law, and said it would be unconstitutional for any law passed by Congress to give the president blanket authority to set tariffs.",
      "\"The court does not read IEEPA to confer such unbounded authority and sets aside the challenged tariffs imposed thereunder,\" the judges wrote Wednesday.",
      "The court said Mr. Trump's global 10% tariffs aren't authorized by IEEPA because they're designed to deal with trade imbalances between the U.S. and the rest of the world, which the judges said should fall under non-emergency legislation.",
      "And the China, Canada and Mexico tariffs aren't legal because they \"do not deal with the threats set forth in those orders,\" the court also found.",
      "The three judges who wrote Wednesday's ruling were nominated to the bench by former President Ronald Reagan, former President Barack Obama and Mr. Trump in his first term.",
      "The Trump administration said in court papers that it will appeal the ruling to the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals.",
      "White House spokesperson Kush Desai responded to the ruling by defending the reasoning for the tariffs, saying the U.S.'s trade deficits with other countries have \"created a national emergency that has decimated American communities.\"",
      "\"It is not for unelected judges to decide how to properly address a national emergency. President Trump pledged to put America First, and the Administration is committed to using every lever of executive power to address this crisis and restore American Greatness,\" Desai said in a statement.",
      "Tariffs are a signature part of Mr. Trump's second-term agenda. He argues the levies are necessary to boost U.S. manufacturing and end what he views as unfair trade practices. But the moves have rattled financial markets and drawn rebuke from Democrats, as well as some Republicans.",
      "Mr. Trump has stood by his tariff strategy but halted many of the levies while vowing to negotiate with U.S. trading partners. A set of so-called \"reciprocal\" tariffs on dozens of countries were paused in April for a period of at least three months. Goods that fall under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement were exempted from 25% tariffs. Massive tariffs on Chinese goods have also been cut back amid negotiations.",
      "Meanwhile, the tariffs have drawn lawsuits from businesses, Democratic states and other parties. Wednesday's ruling was linked to two lawsuits: One from a group of businesses that say they have been harmed by the tariffs, and one from several states.",
      "Some of the lawsuits against the tariffs have raised legal doctrines long championed by conservative lawyers and judges to restrict the authority of executive branch agencies. Those include the major questions doctrine, which says Congress needs to give clear authorization for federal agencies to decide issues of major economic significance, and the nondelegation doctrine, which holds that Congress can't delegate its legislative power to the executive branch.",

      "Two inmates \u2014 Antoine Massey and Derrick Groves \u2014  who were among 10 people who\u00a0escaped from a New Orleans jail nearly two weeks ago may be in other cities, Louisiana Attorney General Liz Murrill told CBS News in an interview on Wednesday.",
      "Eight of the 10 Orleans Parish Prison inmates have been recaptured after their May 16 jailbreak went unnoticed for hours. Some of them were found within the city's famous French Quarter and others elsewhere within the state of Louisiana, but two of them were found in Texas\u00a0following extensive surveillance efforts by the U.S. Marshals, authorities said Tuesday.",
      "Attorney General Murrill said the escapees' primary networks are based in New Orleans, and the high-profile case makes it tougher for them to walk around without being noticed.",
      "\"They can keep running, but they can't hide forever,\" Murrill said, adding that she's confident the two who are still on the run will be taken into custody.",
      "Investigations into what Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry called the worst jailbreak in recent state history are ongoing, with at least 13 people arrested in connection with the breakout.",
      "The state's top prosecutor said there are several factors that led to the escape, including the court system, jail staffing and infrastructure issues. A high-priority problem, Murrill added, is the issue of slow-moving criminal cases in the district's court system, which she says has led to overcrowding at the facility.",
      "Although one-third of the jail's security cameras weren't working at the time, according to the Orleans Parish Sheriff's Office, one\u00a0surveillance video\u00a0captured several inmates forcing open a cell door at about 12:22 a.m. CDT and breaching a wall behind the cell's toilet. At around 1 a.m., video showed, the inmates fled the building through a nearby loading dock, according to the Orleans Parish Sheriff's Office.",
      "The escape went unnoticed by the sheriff's office until approximately 8:30 a.m. that day. At the time of the escape, no sheriff's deputy was assigned to the area where the inmates initiated the jailbreak.",
      "The sheriff's office also said last week that locks on the cells were defective and the escapees were housed in that particular unit due to ongoing renovations at their previous unit, including new locks being installed.",
      "Murrill, who visited the jail on Tuesday, said that one unit has had all hinges and locks replaced, while another 160 cells need to have the same work done.",
      "\"I think that there is hardening that needs to happen at that facility that's just physical changes to things like light bulbs and locks that needs to happen,\" Murrill said Wednesday. \"But at the end of all this, you really have to be able to efficiently move cases, or you're still going to have a continuing problem with a violent population that's there for a very long time, and will continue to beat up and exploit any kind of weakness they can find in that facility.\"",
      "In a post on X, the Orleans Parish Sheriff's Office announced \"significant flooding\" problems at the jail following the escape, writing, \"despite emergency repairs over the weekend, the plumbing challenges still remain, and water is continuing to accumulate in parts of the facility.\"",
      "The sheriff's office added, \"OPSO is working to bring in an external water supply to temporarily accommodate the plumbing issue.\"",
      "On Wednesday afternoon, inmates at the facility yelled out to CBS News cameras outside the facility, \"we need water.\"",
      "The attorney general said she has spoken with the sheriff about those issues, as well.",
      "The dysfunction at the correctional facility dates back generations. In 1970, a federal judge declaring its overcrowding to be unconstitutional in 1970. In 2005, Hurricane Katrina stranded inmates in chest-high water and left the jail without power. In 2013, a video showed inmates using drugs, drinking beer and brandishing a gun.",
      "Issues continued even after the 2015 opening of the state-of-the-art Orleans Justice Center, which houses nearly 1,400 inmates. There were major issues with the building from the outset, including a lack of supervision and adequate housing for mentally ill inmates, The Associated Press reported.",
      "Following the escape nearly two weeks ago, Gov. Landry ordered the removal of all remaining state Department of Corrections prison inmates from the facility.",
      "The Orleans Parish District Attorney Jason Williams also vocalized concerns about the sheriff's office's ability to securely conduct business, telling CBS News in an interview Monday night he plans to request for a private security detail to temporarily secure the New Orleans courthouse.",
      "Orleans Parish Sheriff Susan Hutson, who oversees the jail, said she \"takes full accountability\" for the escape. She also\u00a0announced\u00a0she was temporarily suspending her reelection campaign, saying, in part: \"Now is the time to focus on security, accountability, and public safety.\"",
      "When asked what policy changes need to happen to ensure another jailbreak doesn't happen, Murrill said: \"I think that jail officials know the population at their jail, and they know whether that it's suitable for the population that they have.\"",
      "She added that everyone in the community needs to be paying attention and \"participates in insisting that the leadership, the facility, and the court system are all doing their part to protect us and to move these cases through.\"",

      "According to the statement from the Chrisley's law firm, the pair had sought a presidential pardon earlier this year by alleging \"serious misconduct by the government, including an illegal raid, reliance on tainted evidence and a trial that featured false testimony from a key government witness.\"",
      "Their daughter, Savannah Chrisley, was a speaker at the 2024 Republican National Convention, with the law firm noting that she \"publicly thanked President Trump for standing up against political prosecutions and fighting for families like hers.\"",
      "Their lawyer, Alex Little, said in the statement that the Chrisleys were targets because of their political views.",
      "\"This pardon corrects a deep injustice and restores two devoted parents to their family and community,\" Little said. \"President Trump recognized what we've argued from the beginning: Todd and Julie were targeted because of their conservative values and high profile. Their prosecution was tainted by multiple constitutional violations and political bias.\"",

    "story": [
      "A new acronym is popping up on Wall Street to explain investors' reaction to President Trump's on-again, off-again tariffs: TACO.",
      "Coined by Financial Times journalist Robert Armstrong in a May 2\u00a0column, the tongue-in-cheek term stands for \"Trump Always Chickens Out.\" That phrase is meant to describe a pattern of stocks plunging when the Trump administration announces stiff new tariffs, then surging when Mr. Trump eases up on them days or weeks later.",
      "Since Armstrong's column, Mr. Trump has pulled back on import duties on two other major U.S. trading partners. On May 12, he placed a 90-day freeze\u00a0on 145% tariffs on Chinese goods, while on May 26 he\u00a0delayed 50% tariffs on European goods until July. In both cases, the markets jumped after Mr. Trump offered to ease tariffs.",
      "\"[T]he recent rally has a lot to do with markets realizing that the U.S. administration does not have a very high tolerance for market and economic pressure, and will be quick to back off when tariffs cause pain. This is the TACO theory: Trump Always Chickens Out,\" Armstrong wrote on May 2.",
      "In the most recent case, the market dropped sharply on Friday after Mr. Trump said he planned to hike tariffs on European imports to 50%. But on Memorial Day, Mr. Trump said he would ease up on those plans until July to give the European Union and the U.S. more time to negotiate. On Tuesday, the day U.S. markets reopened after the holiday, the S&P 500 rallied 2.1%.",
      "When asked about the term by a reporter at the White House on Wednesday, Mr. Trump responded that it was a \"nasty question.\"",
      "\"It's called negotiation,\" Mr. Trump said. \"They wouldn't be over here today negotiating if I didn't put a 50% tariff\" on Europe.",
      "He added, \"[T]hey'll say, oh, he was chicken. He was chicken. That's unbelievable. I usually have the opposite problem. They say, 'You're too tough, Mr. President.'\"",
      "Whatever the strategy at the White House, investors are becoming more comfortable with the Trump administration's pattern of initially setting high tariff rates that it later reduces , noted Vital Knowledge analyst Adam Crisafulli.",
      "\"[T]he narrative is growing increasingly bullish as investors become more comfortable with the severity of the tariff threat (the \"TACO\" mindset is being embraced by more people) while companies demonstrate an ability to absorb the import tax hike relatively well (the hit to [earnings per share] hasn't been as draconian as feared),\" Crisafulli wrote in a May 28 research note.",
      "Still, there may be too much complacency in the market about the threat of Mr. Trump's tariffs, which major businesses like Walmart have warned will cause them to hike prices, as well as the wobbly fiscal outlook for the U.S., Crisafulli added. Earlier this month, Moody's downgraded the U.S. credit rating, highlighting investor concerns about the government's growing debt.",
      "\"That said, the tariff narrative could stay in a state of benign optimism for the next several weeks (the big deadline is early/mid-July, when the 90-day reciprocal tariff/50% EU tariff suspensions expires) while tariff-driven inflation may not appear in the data until July (when the June numbers are reported),\" the analyst noted.",

Haniyeh, a former Hamas political leader, was assassinated in Iran last year, an incident Iran blamed on Israeli forces but Israel did not take responsibility for.",
      "Since Yahya Sinwar's death, Mohammed Sinwar had been widely described in Israeli and Arab media as one of Hamas' top leaders in the Gaza Strip.",
      "Top Hamas leaders based in Qatar didn't pick Mohammed Sinwar as the group's sole leader after his brother's death, but militants in the Gaza Strip have largely followed him, the Wall Street Journal reported earlier this year, citing Arab negotiators. The younger Sinwar \u2014 a longtime Hamas member \u2014 has helped lead the group as it recruits new fighters, replacing some of the thousands of Hamas terrorists Israel says it has killed, according to the newspaper.",
      "\"Mohammed Sinwar is managing everything,\" retired Israeli Brig. Gen. Amir Avivi told the Journal.",
      "Mohammed Sinwar's reported death comes after nearly 20 months of war between Israel and Hamas, which began after Hamas-led militants launched an attack on southern Israel in October 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking 251 as hostages back into Gaza.",
      "At the White House, President Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff told reporters Wednesday he had \"very good feelings\" about getting to a temporary ceasefire and a long-term resolution to the conflict.",
      "A two-month ceasefire between the two sides ended in March after Israel resumed intense strikes on the Gaza Strip and enforced a blockade on all aid supplies entering the Palestinian territory, leading to widespread reports of shortages and hunger. Israel blames all the suffering in Gaza on Hamas, calling the blockade a tactic to pressure the terrorist group into releasing the 58 remaining hostages, although it is unclear how many are alive.",
      "In recent weeks, Israeli officials have vowed to push ahead with the war to capture and control the entire Gaza Strip and to dismantle Hamas, though Israel has allowed limited aid to enter Gaza this week.",
      "Over 54,000 people have been killed in Gaza since the Israeli offensive began more than a year and a half ago, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry, which does not distinguish between civilian and combatant casualties.",
      "Earlier this month, Hamas released Eden Alexander, believed to have been the last living American citizen held hostage in Gaza.",
      "The families of the remaining hostages have led large protests demanding that Netanyahu make a deal to bring their loved ones home and end the war. In a statement shared by his office following the release of Alexander, Netanyahu insisted that while there could be a temporary ceasefire to allow for more hostages to be freed, there is \"no way we will stop the war \u2026 we're going to the end.\"",

But the Crown Prosecution Service said this was the first time it confirmed the two had been criminally charged in Britain.",
      "Andrew Tate, 38, faces 10 charges related to three women that include rape, actual bodily harm, human trafficking and controlling prostitution for gain. Tristan Tate, 36, faces 11 charges related to one woman that include rape, human trafficking and actual bodily harm.",
      "A spokesperson for the two had no immediate comment when reached by The Associated Press.",
      "The brothers are both former professional kickboxers who have millions of followers on social media. Andrew is more well-known, having drawn a larger following with his unapologetic misogyny that has drawn boys and young men to the luxurious lifestyle he projects.",
      "The Tates were arrested in Romania in late 2022 and formally indicted last year on charges that they participated in a criminal ring that lured women there, where they were allegedly sexually exploited. Andrew Tate was also charged with rape.",

      "The brothers briefly returned to the U.S. earlier this year, after a travel ban imposed on them was lifted,\u00a0arriving at Florida's Fort Lauderdale airport\u00a0on Feb. 28.

      "The warrant issued by Bedfordshire Police for the siblings dates back to between 2012 and 2015.",
      "The whereabouts of the brothers was not immediately clear. They were photographed a week ago outside a police station in Voluntari, Romania, where they have to report regularly while facing charges there.",

    "story": [
      "German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said Wednesday during a visit by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy that Berlin will help Kyiv develop new long-range weapons that can hit targets in Russian territory. He said both countries' defense ministers would sign a memorandum of understanding for the production of long-range weapons systems, declining to provide technical details or name the manufacturers involved.",
      "\"There will be no range restrictions, allowing Ukraine to fully defend itself, even against military targets outside its own territory,\" he told a joint news conference.",
      "Zelenskyy's Berlin visit comes days after Russia launched some of its heaviest missile and drone attacks of the conflict on Ukraine, and as President Trump voices growing frustration with Russian President Vladimir Putin.",
      "The Ukrainian president accused Russia of stalling peace talks and said Moscow did not want to halt its three-year invasion, adding that \"they will constantly look for reasons not to end the war.\"",
      "Ongoing Russian strikes are war crimes, U.N. experts conclude",
      "Merz said \"the massive air strikes, particularly on the city of Kyiv over the weekend, do not speak the language of peace, but rather the language of a war of aggression,\" calling it, \"a slap in the face of all those who are trying to bring about a ceasefire in Ukraine itself, but also in Europe and the USA.\"",
      "Russia's military has committed \"crimes against humanity\" and \"war crimes\" in its drone attacks on civilian infrastructure in Ukraine's Kherson region in particular, a panel of United Nations experts concludes in a report published Wednesday. The Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine, established by the U.N. Human Rights Council, said Russian armed forces were \"systematically\" hitting civilians.",
      "\"Russian armed forces have committed the crimes against humanity of murder and the war crimes of attacking civilians, through a months-long pattern of drone attacks targeting civilians on the right bank of the Dnipro River in Kherson Province,\" the inquiry said in its atypically blunt assessment. \"These acts were committed with the primary purpose to spread terror among the civilian population, in violation of international humanitarian law.\"",
      "The U.N. panel added that \"the attacks are continuing at the time of the publication of this report.\"",
      "Germany calls Ukraine missile deal a \"new form of military-industrial cooperation\"",
      "Merz, who took power early this month, has vowed to keep strongly backing Ukraine, but without giving details of which weapons Germany is sending, in line with a policy of strategic ambiguity.",
      "The joint production of long-range weapons \"can take place both in Ukraine and here in Germany,\" he said. \"We will not provide any further details until further notice.\"",
      "Merz hailed the project as \"the beginning of a new form of military-industrial cooperation between our countries that has great potential.\"",
      "Merz had pointed out in a TV interview this week that already \"there are no longer any range restrictions on weapons delivered to Ukraine - neither by the British nor by the French nor by us nor by the Americans.\"",
      "\"This means that Ukraine can now defend itself, for example, by attacking military positions in Russia... With very few exceptions, it didn't do that until recently. It can now do that.\"",
      "Indeed, Ukraine has stepped up attacks on what it claims are military and military-industrial sites deep inside Russia, including a wave of almost 300 drones that Russia's military claimed to have intercepted overnight. Ukrainian military bloggers said the drones had targeted drone, missile and explosive manufacturing facilities, including one north of Moscow, and other sites near the capital itself.",
      "Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov was quoted by the state-run Tass news agency on Wednesday as saying the German-Ukrainian partnership would escalate tension between Russia and Europe, adding: \"Germany is directly drawn into this war.\"",
      "That is a charge Russia has issued for months, however, and Lavrov noted that German tanks were already on the battlefield, \"therefore, direct involvement in the war is already obvious.\"",
      "\"Germany is sliding down the same inclined plane along which it has already moved a couple of times in the last century - down to its collapse. I hope that responsible politicians in this country will still draw the right conclusion, stop the madness,\" Tass quoted Lavrov as saying.",

      "Taking over from center-left leader Olaf Scholz, Merz has changed the tone in Berlin and voiced harsh criticism of Putin who, the chancellor charged this week, \"obviously sees offers of talks as a sign of weakness.\"",
      "Mr. Trump, who had long promised that he would quickly broker an end to the war, issued a rare rebuke of Putin on social media on Sunday.",
      "\"I've always had a very good relationship with Vladimir Putin of Russia, but something has happened to him. He has gone absolutely CRAZY!\" the president said.",
      "Moscow at first appeared to downplay his remarks, with Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov suggesting that all parties were speaking under conditions of emotional overload.",
      "Asked about the U.S. president's remarks on Wednesday, however, longtime Putin aide Yuri Ushakov told Russia's state-run VGTRK news outlet that Moscow had concluded Mr. Trump, \"is not being informed enough, in particular, Trump is not being sufficiently informed about the massive terrorist attacks that Ukraine is carrying out against peaceful cities in the Russian Federation.\"",
      "He said the American leader failed to \"fully understand that the Russian Federation is striking exclusively at military infrastructure facilities or the military-industrial complex of Ukraine.\"",
      "The false claim comes after many months of Russian rocket and drone strikes hitting Ukrainian apartment buildings and other civilian infrastructure, killing hundreds of civilians.",
      "On Tuesday, Mr. Trump warned that Putin was \"playing with fire,\" amid unconfirmed reports that the U.S. leader is now considering fresh sanctions against Russia, something the United States' NATO allies have long called for.",

      "In a cable dated Tuesday and obtained by CBS News, Secretary of State Marco Rubio instructed diplomatic posts not to add any more appointments for student and foreign exchange visas in preparation for the expanded vetting, and to take any unfilled appointments off their calendars. If students have already scheduled their visa interviews, those can still go forward.",
      "The pause will last \"until further guidance is issued\" in the next few days.",
      "The State Department is preparing for an \"expansion of required social media screening and vetting,\" and all student visa applicants could be subject to social media checks, according to the cable. This extra screening would have \"significant implications\" for embassies and consulates' operations, making a pause on new appointments necessary, the cable said.",
      "A senior State Department official confirmed the cable's accuracy to CBS News.",
      "The memo was first reported by Politico.",
      "When asked about student visas, State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce told reporters Tuesday, \"We take very seriously the process of vetting who it is that comes into the country, and we're going to continue to do that.\"",
      "A State Department official said Wednesday that while the department does not comment on internal communications, the scheduling of nonimmigrant visa interview appointments is \"dynamic.\" The official said that an embassy or consulate's capacity reflects the time required for consular officers to adjudicate the cases before them in full compliance with U.S. law, including to ensure applicants do not pose a security or safety risk to the United States.",
      "\"Every visa adjudication is a national security decision,\" the State Department official said, adding that every prospective traveler to the United States undergoes interagency security vetting. \"Prohibiting entry to the United States by those who might pose a threat to U.S. national security or public safety is key to protecting U.S. citizens at home.\"",
      "International students who want to study in the U.S. are typically required to schedule interviews at an American embassy or consulate, usually in their home country, as part of the visa application process. Wait times vary widely: At most embassies, appointments for student visa interviews can be scheduled less than two months in advance, though some diplomatic posts have longer waits.",
      "Last month, the Department of Homeland Security said it would screen some visa applicants, including people seeking student visas, for what it called \"antisemitic activity on social media and the physical harassment of Jewish individuals.\"",

      "Le Scouarnec, one of the most prolific convicted sex predators in France's history, was already in prison after being sentenced in 2020 to 15 years for raping and sexually assaulting four children, including two of his nieces.",
      "The 20-year sentence for aggravated rape handed down by presiding judge Aude Buresi was the maximum that could be given on the charge of aggravated rape in France, where sentences are not added together on individual counts.",
      "Le Scouarnec will not be able to ask for parole until two-thirds of the verdict is served.",
      "\"It was taken into account that the acts committed are of particular gravity due to the number of victims, their young age and the compulsive nature\" of the crimes, said the verdict.",
      "But the court rejected a rare demand from prosecutors that he should be held in a center for treatment and supervision even after any release, citing his \"desire to make amends\" for what he had done.",
      "The prosecutor has said last week that in the United States \u2014 where the opposite is the case \u2014 Le Scouarnec could have been jailed for \"2,000 years.\"",
      "In this trial, which began in February in Vannes in the western region of Brittany, Le Scouarnec has admitted sexually assaulting or raping 299 patients \u2014 256 of them under 15 \u2014 in hospitals between 1989 and 2014, many while they were under anesthesia or waking up after operations.",
      "He was charged with 111 rapes and 189 sexual assaults.",
      "In March, during the trial, Le Scouarnec admitted without any solicitation that he had sexually abused his own granddaughter, too, though she was not among the alleged victims in the case.",
      "The former surgeon stood up and addressed the court just after his eldest son, whose name has not been used in the trial, gave evidence.",
      "\"This is possibly, almost certainly, the last time I will see my son, because I heard his anger and his distress,\" Le Scouarnec told the court that day. \"I respect that anger, it is well-founded. Yes, I admit to having abused my granddaughter, his daughter.\"",
      "He then turned to his son and said, \"forgive me.\"",
      "Survivors of the surgeon's abuse staged a protest outside the court in Vannes, holding signs such as \"Never again\" and \"I accuse you.\"",
      "They also held signs representing 355 victims of Le Scouarnec.",
      "That number included \"forgotten victims and those whose cases have been dismissed,\" said Manon Lemoine, one of the victims.",
      "\"We want to be together,\" she said.",
      "Another victim, Celine Mahuteau, on Wednesday sent a letter to President Emmanuel Macron saying that France has not implemented a national policy \"to prevent pedophilia.\"",
      "\"I am not asking the court for leniency,\" Le Scouarnec said in his closing statement on Monday.",
      "\"Simply grant me the right to become a better person,\" he said.",
      "One of the lawyers, Maxime Tessier, had asked the court to take into account the \"exceptional\" nature of Le Scouarnec's confession when he admitted all the charges against him.",
      "The retired surgeon also said he considered himself \"responsible\" for the death of two of his victims \u2014 Mathis Vinet, who died after an overdose in 2021 in what his family says was suicide, and another man who was found dead in 2020.",
      "Le Scouarnec documented his crimes, noting his victims' names, ages, addresses and the nature of the abuse.",
      "In his notes, the doctor described himself as a \"major pervert\" and a \"pedophile.\"",
      "\"And I am very happy about it,\" he recorded.",
      "Victims and child rights advocates say the case highlights systemic failures that allowed Le Scouarnec to repeatedly commit sexual crimes.",
      "In 2005, he received a four-month suspended prison sentence after investigators linked his credit card to the online purchase of child sexual abuse material.",
      "But Le Scouarnec was neither required to undergo treatment nor barred from practicing medicine.",
      "While Le Scouarnec has asked his victims for forgiveness, many of them have questioned the sincerity of his apologies, which he repeated almost mechanically over the weeks of the trial.",
      "\"You are the worst mass pedophile who ever lived,\" said one of the lawyers representing the victims, Thomas Delaby, describing Le Scouarnec as an \"atomic bomb of pedophilia.\"",

      "Tokyo\u00a0\u2014 Japan has a new sumo grand champion \u2014 or yokozuna \u2014 and the big news is he's Japanese. Onosato, the new grand champion, weighs 421 pounds and he is the first Japanese competitor to reach the top rank since 2017. By comparison, the average weight of an NFL lineman is just over 300 pounds.",
      "The sport has recently been dominated by Mongolians. Prior to Onosato, six of the previous seven yokozunas have been from Mongolia.",
      "\"I'll devote myself to training so that I will not disgrace the title of yokozuna,\" Onosato said Wednesday, dressed in a formal kimono and bowing as he sat on the floor. \"I will aim to become a one-and-only yokozuna.\"",
      "Onosato, whose real name is Daiki Nakamura, is only 24 and was promoted Wednesday to sumo's top rank by the Japan Sumo Association. Onosato was promoted by winning last week's Summer Grand Sumo Tournament, which came after he won another prestigious tournament in March.",
      "Onosato is from Ishikawa prefecture, which was hit on Jan. 1, 2024, by a devastating earthquake and tsunami that killed about 600 people in the prefecture and caused widespread damage. Much of the destruction was centered on an area known as the Noto Peninsula.",
      "\"I will work hard as a yokozuna to encourage and cheer up the Ishikawa prefecture and the Noto region,\" he said.",
      "He then added: \"I determined that yokozuna should be my goal once I entered the world of sumo,\" he said. \"It's not easy to achieve and I'm really delighted.\"",
      "Sumo is regarded as Japan's national sport, or most sacred sport, and many of the ritual elements are connected to Shinto, Japan's indigenous religion.",
      "Sumo's origins date back more than 1,000 years, and Japan is the only country where it is contested on a professional level, though competitors come from around the world.",

      "Washington \u2014 Get ready for several years of even more record-breaking heat that pushes Earth to more deadly, fiery and uncomfortable extremes, two of the world's top weather agencies forecast.",
      "There's an 80% chance the world will break another annual temperature record in the next five years, and it's even more probable that the world will again exceed the international temperature threshold set 10 years ago, according to a five-year forecast released Wednesday by the World Meteorological Organization and the U.K. Meteorological Office.",
      "Last year's record was just the latest in a decade of record-breaking\u00a0heat, with every year since 2015 ranking among the 10 hottest ever recorded.",
      "\"Higher global mean temperatures may sound abstract, but it translates in real life to a higher chance of extreme weather: stronger hurricanes, stronger precipitation, droughts,\" said Cornell University climate scientist Natalie Mahowald, who wasn't part of the calculations but said they made sense. \"So higher global mean temperatures translates to more lives lost.\"",
      "With every tenth of a degree the world warms from human-caused climate change \"we will experience higher frequency and more extreme events (particularly heat waves but also droughts, floods, fires and human-reinforced hurricanes/typhoons),\" emailed Johan Rockstrom, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany. He was not part of the research.",
      "And for the first time there's a chance - albeit slight - that before the end of the decade, the world's annual temperature will shoot past the Paris climate accord goal of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) and hit a more alarming 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) of heating since the mid-1800s, the two agencies said.",
      "There's an 86% chance that one of the next five years will pass 1.5 degrees and a 70% chance that the five years as a whole will average more than that global milestone, they figured.",
      "The projections come from more than 200 forecasts using computer simulations run by 10 global centers of scientists.",
      "\"We have just experienced the ten warmest years on record. Unfortunately, this WMO report provides no sign of respite over the coming years, and this means that there will be a growing negative impact on our economies, our daily lives, our ecosystems and our planet,\" said WMO Deputy Secretary-General Ko Barrett.",
      "\"Continued climate monitoring and prediction is essential to provide decision-makers with science-based tools and information to help us adapt,\" she said.",
      "Fears of repeats",
      "Ten years ago, the same teams figured there was a similar remote chance - about 1% - that one of the upcoming years would exceed that critical 1.5 degree threshold and then it happened last year. This year, a 2-degree Celsius above pre-industrial year enters the equation in a similar manner, something UK Met Office longer term predictions chief Adam Scaife and science scientist Leon Hermanson called \"shocking.\"",
      "\"It's not something anyone wants to see, but that's what the science is telling us,\" Hermanson said. Two degrees of warming is the secondary threshold, the one considered less likely to break, set by the 2015 Paris agreement.",
      "Technically, even though 2024 was 1.5 degrees Celsius warmer than pre-industrial times, the Paris climate agreement's threshold is for a 20-year time period, so it has not been exceeded. Factoring in the past 10 years and forecasting the next 10 years, the world is now probably about 1.4 degrees Celsius (2.5 degrees Fahrenheit) hotter since the mid 1800s, World Meteorological Organization climate services director Chris Hewitt estimated.",
      "\"With the next five years forecast to be more than 1.5C warmer than preindustrial levels on average, this will put more people than ever at risk of severe heat waves, bringing more deaths and severe health impacts unless people can be better protected from the effects of heat. Also we can expect more severe wildfires as the hotter atmosphere dries out the landscape,\" said Richard Betts, head of climate impacts research at the UK Met Office and a professor at the University of Exeter.",
      "Ice in the Arctic - which will continue to warm 3.5 times faster than the rest of the world - will melt and seas will rise faster, Hewitt said.",
      "What tends to happen is that global temperatures rise like riding on an escalator, with temporary and natural El Nino weather cycles acting like jumps up or down on that escalator, scientists said. But lately, after each jump from an El Nino, which adds warming to the globe, the planet doesn't go back down much, if at all.",
      "\"Record temperatures immediately become the new normal,\" said Stanford University climate scientist Rob Jackson.",

Joseph Harris-Birtill, born on Nov. 23, 2021, was admitted to the organization at the age of just 2 years and 182 days.",
      "\"It soon became clear that he was an exceptional little being,\" Harris-Birtill's mother Rose told Guinness World Records. \"He first rolled over at five weeks, said his first word at seven months, and read his first book out loud from cover to cover at one-and-three-quarter years.\"",
      "\"He's learning morse code, knows the Greek alphabet, and has recently gotten interested in the periodic table,\" his mother said. \"His interests are vast and varied, and he is always keen to learn more and loves a challenge.\"",
      "Harris-Birtill's parents \u2014 who both work at Scotland's prestigious University of St. Andrews \u2014 told Guinness World Records they first decided to reach out to Mensa to find more support for Joseph after seeing how early he'd started reading.",
      "\"I searched online for any further support available, and saw that Mensa offers resources and membership for highly able children,\" Rose said. \"We hope that this accomplishment can give him a sense of pride when he is older \u2014 it's a very unusual accolade and the credit is all his!\"",
      "Harris-Birtill is 13 days younger than the youngest female member of Mensa was, American\u00a0Isla McNabb, when she was admitted to the club in 2022. He also has, by default, taken the title of Britain's youngest Mensa member, topping Teddy Hobbs who achieved that rank at the age of 4 in 2023.",
      "Rose, Harris-Birtill's mother, said she hoped sharing her son's story would help raise awareness about the unique needs of children like her son.",
      "\"It is a common misconception that everything is super easy for gifted children. But everyone needs appropriate stimulation and understanding throughout their lives, and highly able learners can sadly have their unique talents dimmed by the pressure to fit into environments that simply haven't been properly designed for them,\" she told Guinness World Records. \"Joseph is fortunate enough to attend a brilliant nursery and has an excellent music teacher, and in Mensa we hope to provide him with a community of peers as a source of further support as his formidable intellect continues to grow and develop.\"",

    "story": [
      "A controversial new U.S. and Israel-backed aid group says it began operating in the war-torn Gaza Strip on Monday, despite objections from the United Nations, other humanitarian groups, and the recent, sudden resignation of its American executive director, who said it couldn't operate independently. The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) said it opened its first aid distribution hubs in the enclave on Monday and that truckloads of food had been delivered.",
      "The GHF said in a statement that about 8,000 food boxes had been distributed by Tuesday afternoon, each one containing enough to feed \"5.5 people for 3.5 days, totaling 462,000 meals.\"",
      "\"More trucks with aid will be delivered tomorrow, with the flow of aid increasing each day,\" GHF said in a statement.",
      "There were unconfirmed reports by Israeli and Palestinian media outlets that one of the aid hubs was abandoned by the security personnel in charge of securing the operation after thousands of people clambering for food overran the location. The Israel Hayom newspaper said the security forces withdrew to helicopters amid gunfire.",
      "In a statement, the GHF said there was a \"moment in the late afternoon\" at one of its Secure Distribution Sites when the number of people seeking aid \"was such that the GHF team fell back to allow a small number of Gazans to take aid safely and dissipate. This was done in accordance with GHF protocol to avoid casualties. Normal operations have resumed.\"",
      "The group said some Palestinians endured \"several hour delays in accessing the site due to blockades imposed by Hamas.\"",
      "In a separate statement, the Israeli military said troops had \"fired warning shots in the area outside the compound. Control over the situation was established, food distribution operations are expected to continue as planned, and the safety of IDF troops was not compromised.\"",
      "The GHF \u2014 the leadership and funding of which have remained unclear \u2014 was created as Israel and its closest ally, the U.S., faced a growing outcry over Palestinians in Gaza starving amid Israel's nearly three-month blockade of the territory. Under intense pressure from the international community, Israel began letting some food into Gaza last week, but aid organizations have called it a \"drop in the bucket\" given the level of need.",
      "\"As part of the gradual opening of the distribution centers, two of the centers, located in Tel al-Sultan and the Morag Corridor in the Rafah area, began operating today (Tuesday) and are distributing food packages to thousands of families in the Gaza Strip,\" the Israel Defense Forces said in a statement. \"The establishment of the distribution centers took place over the last few months, facilitated by the Israeli political echelon and in coordination with the US government. This process coincided with an ongoing dialogue and cooperation with the IDF.\"",
      "The IDF said the new aid system was \"operated by International Aid Organizations, and Secured by an American Civilian Security Company,\" but neither the military nor the GHF itself has named any global non-profit organizations involved in the effort, and it was unclear what security firm from the U.S. was helping secure the hubs.",
      "U.N. calls new aid operation a \"distraction\"",
      "On Tuesday, a spokesperson for the United Nations humanitarian office called the work of GHF a \"distraction from what is actually needed,\" which the spokesperson said was the reopening of crossings into Gaza and the end of Israeli restrictions on the kind of aid entering the territory.",
      "The GHF has been tasked by Israel with taking over the handling of aid in Gaza despite objections from the U.N., which, along with other aid groups, has pushed back against the new system. They assert that Israel is trying to use food as a weapon and say a new system won't be effective.",
      "Israel has pushed for an alternative aid delivery plan because it says it must stop Hamas from seizing aid. The U.N. has denied that Hamas has diverted large amounts of aid. Hamas, long designated a terrorist organization by Israel, the U.S. and the European Union, also denies the allegations.",
      "The GHF began operations just a day after its executive director, American Jake Wood, announced his resignation and said it had become clear the foundation would not be allowed to operate independently. GHF said it had appointed an interim leader, John Acree, to replace Wood.",
      "The organization, said to be made up of former humanitarian, government and military officials, has said its distribution points will provide aid for a million Palestinians \u2014 around half of Gaza's population \u2014 by the end of the week.",
      "Under pressure from allies, Israel began allowing a trickle of humanitarian aid into Gaza last week after blocking all food, medicine, fuel or other goods from entering since early March. Aid groups had issued multiple warnings of a looming famine in Gaza.",
      "Hamas tells Palestinians not to use new aid system",
      "Hamas warned Palestinians on Monday not to cooperate with the new aid system, saying it is part of Israel's plans to transfer much of Gaza's population to other countries or to force people out of the north into the southern part of Gaza.",

    "story": [
      "King Charles III spoke of a \"critical moment\" for Canada Tuesday as he addressed the Canadian Parliament in a rare gesture that comes as Canada grapples with tariffs and annexation threats by President Trump.",
      "\"The True North is indeed strong and free,\" Charles said, nodding to the Canadian national anthem.",
      "The British monarch, who formally serves as Canada's head of state, arrived in the capital of Ottawa on Monday, part of a two-day visit that's widely viewed as a form of pushback against Mr. Trump's calls to make Canada the 51st state.",
      "Why did King Charles speak to Canada's parliament?",
      "The king delivered a \"Speech from the Throne,\" which marked the start of a new session of Parliament after the center-left Liberal Party won last month's federal election. The speech \u2014 written by Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney's office, not the king \u2014 outlined the new government's agenda and priorities, while acknowledging the political and economic dynamics on the world stage affecting the country.",
      "Marking the start of Parliament with a speech is a longstanding tradition in Canada and other former parts of the British Empire \u2014 but it's highly unusual for the king to deliver the speech himself. Instead, the king's representative in Canada, the governor-general, normally speaks on his behalf. The last time the monarch personally gave the speech was in 1977, when Charles' mother, Queen Elizabeth II,\u00a0traveled to Canada's capital for the event.",
      "In his address, the king cited his mother's visit to Canada to open its parliament in 1957, saying that the visit came as \"the Second World War remained a fresh, painful memory,\" as the Cold War intensified, and \"freedom and democracy were under threat.\" Canada was \"emerging as a growing economic power and a force for peace in the world,\" he added, comparing the moment to the challenges of the present.",
      "\"Today, Canada faces another critical moment,\" Charles said, adding that \"Democracy, pluralism, the rule of law, self determination and freedom are values which Canadians hold dear, and ones which the government is determined to protect.\"",
      "Is King Charles' visit to Ottawa related to Trump?",
      "Some watchers of Canadian politics said so ahead of the visit, especially as Mr. Trump has repeatedly mused about the United States annexing Canada, stirring strong backlash.",
      "Jared Wesley, a political science professor at the University of Alberta, says the royal visit could be \"an indication that the king takes Canada's sovereignty seriously.\"",
      "\"The explicit threats to Canada's sovereignty probably got the attention of the king and his advisers,\" Wesley told CBS News.",
      "The visit could also play to domestic politics, Wesley says. Mr. Trump's comments have \"stirred up patriotism in some odd corners of Canada,\" and the country's status as a constitutional monarchy where the king is still technically the head of state is one major difference between Canada and its neighbor to the south. And even though most Canadians are fairly indifferent toward the monarchy, visits by royals always draw interest.",
      "\"It's seen as a point of pride and distinction between Canada and the U.S.,\" said Wesley, who previously served in several roles for Alberta's provincial government.",
      "University of Toronto political science professor Elizabeth McCallion said the visit is likely intended as a \"reminder that we are an independent country\" and a \"rallying together of Canadians.\"",
      "Earlier this month, Carney told Sky News the invitation to Charles was \"not coincidental.\" In a statement welcoming Charles on Monday, the prime minister didn't mention Mr. Trump, but did hint at Canada's \"distinct identity\" and \"historic ties that crises only fortify.\"",
      "Charles also has a longstanding relationship with Canada, visiting the country over a dozen times before ascending to the throne. Amid a rocky relationship with the United States, many Canadians have looked for signs of support from Charles, taking note of symbolic gestures like the crown's decision to plant a maple tree at Buckingham Palace earlier this year, McCallion said.",
      "McCallion says some Canadians also believe Mr. Trump's longstanding fascination with the British royal family could play to the country's benefit.",
      "\"There's hope that when he's visiting, Trump will take notice and respect the fact that Canada has connections to the British monarchy,\" McCallion told CBS News.",
      "Charles is the head of state for both Canada and the U.K., putting him in an unusual position as the U.K. seeks a stronger trade relationship with the Trump administration. Earlier this month, Carney criticized the U.K. government for inviting Mr. Trump to a state visit earlier this year, presenting Mr. Trump with an invitation from the king. The Canadian leader told Sky News most Canadians \"weren't impressed by that gesture.\"",
      "What did King Charles say in the speech about the U.S. and Trump?",
      "The king alluded to the relationship between Canada and the U.S. throughout his speech, as he addressed changes to the global trade systems. Charles said open global trade, while \"not perfect,\" has \"helped to deliver prosperity for Canadians for decades.\"",
      "\"Many Canadians are feeling anxious and worried about a drastically changing world around them,\" Charles said. \"Yet this moment is also an incredible opportunity \u2014 an opportunity for renewal. An opportunity to think big and to act bigger. An opportunity for Canada to embark on the largest transformation of its economy since the Second World War.\"",
      "The king emphasized that a \"confident Canada\" can \"seize this opportunity by recognizing that all Canadians can give themselves far more than any foreign power on any continent can ever take away.\" He added that by staying true to Canadian values, Canada can build new alliances and a new economy that serves all Canadians.",
      "The king made only a passing reference to Mr. Trump, saying Canada's prime minister and the U.S. president \"have begun defining a new economic and security relationship\" that he said was \"rooted in mutual respect and founded on common interests to deliver transformational benefits for both sovereign nations.\"",
      "What has Trump said about Canada \u2014 and how has Carney responded?",
      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly floated annexing Canada in recent months, rattling Canadian politics.",
      "The 51st-state jabs sometimes appear tongue-in-cheek: Mr. Trump referred to Carney's predecessor \u2014 who stepped down as prime minister ahead of new elections this year \u2014 as \"Governor Justin Trudeau of the Great State of Canada.\" In other cases, Mr. Trump has cast absorbing Canada as a tidy way of resolving the U.S.'s trade deficit with its northern neighbor.",
      "But Trudeau has reportedly called Mr. Trump's talk of absorbing Canada \"a real thing,\" telling business and labor leaders in a private meeting that he sees taking over Canada as a way of getting access to the country's mineral wealth, according to the public broadcaster CBC. Many Canadian voters hold the same view, according to McCallion.",
      "\"I think maybe the first or second time, people were offended but thought he was kidding. And at this point, certainly no Canadians think he's kidding,\" McCallion said. \"Most Canadians are taking it as a serious threat.\"",
      "When asked whether he would use military force to take over Canada, Mr. Trump said earlier this month, \"I don't see it.\" But in a White House meeting with Carney days later, the U.S. leader still called the idea of annexing Canada a \"wonderful marriage\" that would deliver \"tremendous\" benefits to Canada, and referred to the border between the two countries as \"artificial.\"",
      "Carney said in the meeting Canada \"won't be for sale, ever.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Mr. Trump has imposed sweeping tariffs on many Canadian goods, leading Canada to hit the U.S. with retaliatory levies.",
      "Last month's Canadian elections were dominated by Mr. Trump's tariffs and annexation comments, and the race was widely seen as a referendum on who Canadians trusted more to deal with the Trump administration.",
      "Carney's Liberal Party \u2014 which has held power for almost a decade \u2014 previously trailed the Conservatives in polling, but its fortunes rebounded after Mr. Trump's jabs at Canada. In a victory speech, Carney said the country's \"old relationship with the United States \u2026 is over,\" and argued Mr. Trump is \"trying to break us so that America can own us.\"",
      "\"Our national identity is at times muddied because it's made up of so many different cultures that have come together,\" McCallion told CBS News. \"Often, Canadians primarily express their national identity as not being American.\"",

      "The Congressional Budget Office (CBO), a nonpartisan analysis for the U.S. Congress, estimates that 8.6 million people in the United States will lose health insurance by 2034 through the One Big Beautiful Bill Act's Medicaid reform.",
      "\"Five million of those people are receiving a tax credit under the Affordable Care Act that was passed by the Democrats with a sunset date that was implemented by the Democrats. We're simply allowing the sunset date to expire as the Democrats originally intended,\" Houchin said.",
      "DEMS WARN HOUSE REPUBLICANS WILL PAY PRICE AT BALLOT BOX FOR PASSING TRUMP'S 'BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL'",
      "CBO estimates that 13.7 million Americans will lose coverage by 2034, which also includes the 5 million Americans who were already set to lose coverage. A number of Democrats have already deployed the figure in campaign messages rejecting Trump's \"big, beautiful bill\" passing in the House.",
      "\"I don't trust the CBO score, nor should the American people, because it's been proven again and again to be wildly off,\" added Houchin, who served on three major committees leading budget markup, including the House Rules, Budget and Energy and Commerce committees.",
      "The American Accountability Foundation, a conservative government research nonprofit, found that of the 32 staff members on CBO's Health Analysis Division, 26 of them have \"clearly\" verified liberal partisan biases, as a Democrat donor, registered Democrat or a Democratic primary voter, as Fox News Digital reported this month.",
      "Speaking with Fox News Digital, Rep. Erin Houchin defended Medicaid reform in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. (Getty Images)",
      "The One Big Beautiful Bill Act does not cut Medicaid for the most vulnerable, according to Houchin. Instead, she says targeting waste, fraud and abuse in the Medicaid program cuts benefits to illegal immigrants, those ineligible to receive benefits who are currently receiving benefits, duplicate enrollees in one or more states and those who are able-bodied but are choosing not to work.",
      "\"If you have to think about the four things that we're doing in Medicaid to strengthen it, we're removing anybody that is illegal, ineligible or duplicate, and we're ensuring that able-bodied adults, on the expansion population, have a very modest work requirement, in exchange for receiving benefits. Those things are overwhelmingly supported by the American people, yet the Democrats continue to lie about what this bill is actually doing,\" Houchin said.",
      "Republicans say they are cleaning up the program to ensure working families and the most vulnerable Americans can rely on the program for generations to come.",

      "\"What we're trying to do is protect precious Medicaid dollars for those who need it most,\" Houchin said. \"That's what we're doing. No one in the traditional Medicaid population needs to worry. And even if you're in the able-body expansion population, there are many opportunities to comply to participate in Medicaid.\"",
      "However, Democrats have already designated Medicaid cuts as a defining issue in 2026.",
      "\"House Republicans' giant tax scam will kick millions of people off their health insurance,\" Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) spokesperson Viet Shelton told Fox News Digital. \"It is fact. Independent analysts say it. Health care professionals say it. Hell, even Republican senators say so. Their saying anything to the contrary is just them trying to protect their already in danger majority.\"",
      "After weeks of negotiating through budget reconciliation, House Republicans finally reached a consensus and passed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act last week. The bill passed just 215 to 214, and all Democrats voted against it. Republicans' slim majority managed to deliver a legislative win for Trump.",
      "President Donald Trump departs the White House on May 22, 2025 in Washington, D.C. (Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)",
      "However, the \"big, beautiful\" fight is far from over as the Senate is tasked with drafting their own version of the bill. Senate Republicans have indicated they do not support the bill in its current form.",
      "\"I don\u2019t want to see rural hospitals close their doors because funding got cut. I also don\u2019t like the idea of a hidden tax on the working poor. That\u2019s why I\u2019m a NO on this House bill in its current form,\" Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., said.",
      "The sweeping, multitrillion-dollar legislation advances Trump's agenda on taxes, immigration, energy, defense and the national debt. The bill includes Trump's key campaign promises, including no tax on tips and overtime, and it seeks to permanently extend his 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.",
      "\"By passing the largest cut to Medicaid in history, Republicans are ripping away health care from millions of Americans and levying a de facto hidden tax on working-class families,\" DCCC Chair Suzan DelBene said in a statement after the bill passed. \"Now that vulnerable Republicans are\u00a0on the record voting for it, this betrayal of the American people will cost them their jobs in the midterms and Republicans the House Majority come 2026.\"",

      "While Democrats target vulnerable Republicans for supporting Medicaid reform in Trump's \"big, beautiful bill,\" Republicans are taking aim at Democrats for voting against the bill's tax cuts.",
      "\"House Democrats voted for the largest tax increase in generations while giving taxpayer-funded freebies to illegal immigrants. The NRCC will make sure voters don't forget how they betrayed working families,\" National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC) spokesman Mike Marinella said in a statement to Fox News Digital.",

      "\"We're encouraging all of our caucus, our conference members to continue to communicate with the local and national media to reiterate what we know to be true about this One Big Beautiful Bill,\" Houchin said.",
      "\"It puts Americans first and will ensure that these programs will be around for the next generation, because we're not wasting any tax dollars, any precious benefits on people who are illegal, ineligible, enrolled in multiple states or are able-bodied and could be working. These programs were designed for our most vulnerable Americans, and the One Big Beautiful Bill protects benefits for those people.\"",

      "The bill, approved by both chambers of the state Legislature and now awaiting Gov. Greg Abbott\u2019s signature mandates that each classroom feature a poster or framed copy of the Ten Commandments that is at least 16 inches wide and 20 inches tall, and legible from anywhere in the room.",

      "Shawn Carney is a father of eight and the president and CEO of 40 Days for Life, a pro-life organization. (Courtesy of 40 Days for Life)",
      "\"This is great,\" Carney said. \"The Ten Commandments are good. It's basically the moral code for most people who have ever lived. No matter what their belief system, most people don\u2019t believe we should steal, kill, or commit adultery.",
      "\"It\u2019s a beautiful thing,\" he added. \"I\u2019m proud to be a Texan where they\u2019re supporting this, and it\u2019s something that we need in the classrooms.\"",
      "Carney, who leads what he describes as the world\u2019s largest pro-life organization, operating in 64 countries, linked the legislation to a broader cultural shift. On its website, the group explains it is \"an internationally coordinated 40-day campaign that aims to end abortion locally through prayer and fasting, community outreach, and a peaceful all-day vigil in front of abortion businesses.\"",

      "Looking to the future, Carney hopes the bill encourages greater moral formation nationwide.",

They need to access real online sources to work.\u00a0In other words, your data is already out there on the internet; AI tools just make it easier to find.\u00a0And if you look at the sources, most of the information you wouldn\u2019t want shared online, like your address, relatives and so on, is made public by people-search sites. Other sources include social media, like LinkedIn and Facebook, as well as public databases. But none of them are as invasive as people-search sites.",

      "Now, you\u2019ll have to go through each of these people-search sites and submit opt-out requests. These usually aren\u2019t complicated, but they're definitely time-consuming. The opt-out forms are typically located at the bottom of each site, in the footer. The naming can vary from \"Do Not Sell My Info\" to \"Opt-Out\" or something similar. Each people-search site is a little different. Opting out of every people-search site that exposes your personal information is a mammoth task. I\u2019ve discussed it in more detail\u00a0here. Alternatively, you can automate this process.",

But what if your data is exposed on a people-search site not covered by any data removal service?",
      "Every removal service out there has limitations on the number of data brokers it supports. It\u2019s not about a lack of effort; it\u2019s mostly because brokers are generally unwilling to cooperate, to put it mildly. But there\u2019s a way to address this issue without going back to manual opt-outs. The top names in the data removal industry now offer custom removals. In simple terms, this means you can ask them to remove your personal information from websites not currently covered by their standard plans.",
      "The catch is that you\u2019ll need to do the research yourself and point out which sites are exposing your data. It\u2019s not as convenient as having everything done automatically, but it\u2019s a relatively minor inconvenience for the sake of your online privacy.",

      "OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, known for creating ChatGPT, has launched World, a project that uses an eye scan to prove you are a real person online. The idea is to help people stand out from bots and AI by creating a digital ID with a quick scan from a device called the Orb.",
      "While Altman says this technology keeps humans central as AI advances, it also raises serious concerns about privacy and the security of sensitive biometric data, with critics and regulators questioning how this information will be used and protected.",

      "A woman looking into an Orb (World) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How World ID works",
      "World ID relies on a device called the Orb, a spherical scanner that captures a person's iris pattern to generate a unique IrisCode. It stores the code on a blockchain-based platform, ensuring that users can verify their identity without revealing personal details.",
      "Once scanned, individuals receive their World ID, which can be used for authentication across various platforms where the World ID protocol has been integrated, including Reddit, Telegram and Shopify.",
      "Additionally, those who sign up are rewarded with WLD cryptocurrency as an incentive. They get the equivalent of $40 worth of tokens, which they can spend, exchange or share with other World ID holders.",
      "A man looking into an Orb (World) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "10 SIGNS YOUR IDENTITY HAS BEEN COMPROMISED",
      "Aggressive US rollout targets 180M users",
      "World ID is currently available in Austin, Texas, Atlanta, Los Angeles, Nashville, Tennessee, Miami and San Francisco, with plans to expand further. The company aims to deploy 7,500 Orb devices across the U.S. by the end of the year, targeting 180 million users. While the technology promises enhanced security, the debate over its privacy implications continues to grow.",

      "Privacy concerns halt World ID from being widely adopted",
      "World ID has ambitious goals, but despite this, the project has faced significant backlash. Many people worry that storing eye scan data in a worldwide database could put their personal information at risk. Adding to the controversy, critics point out the irony of Sam Altman, whose company, OpenAI, contributes to the very AI challenges World ID aims to solve, being at the helm of this project.",
      "Governments in Spain, Argentina, Kenya and Hong Kong have either suspended or investigated the project due to concerns over excessive data collection. Furthermore, cybersecurity experts warn that once biometric data is linked to an identity system, it becomes irreversible, raising fears of potential surveillance.",

      "World ID helps prove that people online are real humans and not AI bots, something that is on the rise. In this AI-driven world, it can be an essential security measure to ensure the internet is a safer and more trustworthy place. Since the system is integrated with blockchain technology, it can definitely provide secure authentication across multiple platforms.

      "AI tools are leaking sensitive data",
      "One of the biggest risks of using AI tools is what users accidentally share with them. A recent analysis by cybersecurity firm Check Point found that\u00a01 in every 80 AI prompts includes high-risk data, and about 1 in 13 contains sensitive information that could expose users or organizations to security or compliance risks.",
      "This data can include passwords, internal business plans, client information, or proprietary code. When shared with AI tools that are not secured, this information can be logged, intercepted, or even leaked later.",
      "Deepfake scams are now real-time and multilingual",
      "AI-powered impersonation is getting more advanced every month. Criminals can now fake voices and faces convincingly in real time. In early 2024, a British engineering firm lost 20 million pounds after scammers used live deepfake video to impersonate company executives during a Zoom call. The attackers looked and sounded like trusted leaders and convinced an employee to transfer funds.",
      "Real-time video manipulation tools are now being sold on criminal forums. These tools can swap faces and mimic speech during video calls in multiple languages, making it easier for attackers to run scams across borders.",
      "Illustration of a person video conferencing on their laptop. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "AI is running phishing and scam operations at scale",
      "Social engineering has always been a part of cybercrime. Now, AI is automating it. Attackers no longer need to speak a victim\u2019s language, stay online constantly, or manually write convincing messages.",
      "Tools like GoMailPro use ChatGPT to create phishing and spam emails with perfect grammar and native-sounding tone. These messages are far more convincing than the sloppy scams of the past. GoMailPro can generate thousands of unique emails, each slightly different in language and urgency, which helps them slip past spam filters. It is actively marketed on underground forums for around $500 per month, making it widely accessible to bad actors.",
      "Another tool, the X137 Telegram Console, leverages Gemini AI to monitor and respond to chat messages automatically. It can impersonate customer support agents or known contacts, carrying out real-time conversations with multiple targets at once. The replies are uncensored, fast, and customized based on the victim\u2019s responses, giving the illusion of a human behind the screen.",
      "AI is also powering large-scale\u00a0sextortion scams. These are emails that falsely claim to have compromising videos or photos and demand payment to prevent them from being shared. Instead of using the same message repeatedly, scammers now rely on AI to rewrite the threat in dozens of ways. For example, a basic line like \"Time is running out\" might be reworded as \"The hourglass is nearly empty for you,\" making the message feel more personal and urgent while also avoiding detection.",
      "By removing the need for language fluency and manual effort, these AI tools allow attackers to scale their phishing operations dramatically. Even inexperienced scammers can now run large, personalized campaigns with almost no effort.",
      "Stolen AI accounts are sold on the dark web",
      "With AI tools becoming more popular, criminals are now targeting the accounts that use them. Hackers are stealing ChatGPT logins, OpenAI API keys, and other platform credentials to bypass usage limits and hide their identity. These accounts are often stolen through malware, phishing, or credential stuffing attacks. The stolen credentials are then sold in bulk on Telegram channels and underground forums. Some attackers are even using tools that can bypass multi-factor authentication and session-based security protections. These stolen accounts allow criminals to access powerful AI tools and use them for phishing, malware generation, and scam automation.",

      "Some AI models can even be tricked into jailbreaking themselves. Attackers prompt the model to create input that causes it to override its own restrictions. This shows how AI systems can be manipulated in unexpected and dangerous ways.",
      "AI-generated malware is entering the mainstream",
      "AI is now being used to build malware, phishing kits, ransomware scripts, and more. Recently, a group called\u00a0FunkSac was identified as the leading ransomware gang using AI. Its leader admitted that at least 20% of their attacks are powered by AI. FunkSec has also used AI to help launch attacks that flood websites or services with fake traffic, making them crash or go offline. These are known as denial-of-service attacks. The group even created its own AI-powered chatbot to promote its activities and communicate with victims on its public website..",
      "Some cybercriminals are even using AI to help with marketing and data analysis after an attack. One tool called\u00a0Rhadamanthys Stealer 0.7 claimed to use AI for \"text recognition\" to sound more advanced, but researchers later found it was using older technology instead. This shows how attackers use AI buzzwords to make their tools seem more advanced or trustworthy to buyers.",
      "Other tools are more advanced. One example is DarkGPT, a chatbot built specifically to sort through huge databases of stolen information. After a successful attack, scammers often end up with logs full of usernames, passwords, and other private details. Instead of sifting through this data manually, they use AI to quickly find valuable accounts they can break into, sell, or use for more targeted attacks like ransomware.",

This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android & iOS devices.",
      "3) Turn on two-factor authentication (2FA):\u00a02FA adds an extra layer of protection to your accounts, including AI platforms. It makes it much harder for attackers to break in using stolen passwords.",
      "4) Be extra cautious with unexpected video calls or voice messages: If something feels off, even if the person seems familiar, verify before taking action. Deepfake audio and video can sound and look very real.",
      "5) Use a personal data removal service: With AI-powered scams and deepfake attacks on the rise, criminals are increasingly relying on publicly available personal information to craft convincing impersonations or target victims with personalized phishing. By using a reputable personal data removal service, you can reduce your digital footprint on data broker sites and public databases. This makes it much harder for scammers to gather the details they need to convincingly mimic your identity or launch targeted AI-driven attacks.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0 They aren\u2019t cheap - and neither is your privacy.\u00a0 These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0 It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0 By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "6) Consider identity theft protection: If your data is leaked through a scam, early detection is key. Identity protection services can monitor your information and alert you to suspicious activity. Identity Theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security Number (SSN), phone number, and email address, and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account.\u00a0 They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "7) Regularly monitor your financial accounts: AI-generated phishing, malware, and account takeover attacks are now more sophisticated and widespread than ever, as highlighted in the 2025 AI Security Report. By frequently reviewing your bank and credit card statements for suspicious activity, you can catch unauthorized transactions early, often before major damage is done. Quick detection is crucial, especially since stolen credentials and financial information are now being traded and exploited at scale by cybercriminals using AI.",
      "8) Use a secure password manager: Stolen AI accounts and credential stuffing attacks are a growing threat, with hackers using automated tools to break into accounts and sell access on the dark web. A secure\u00a0password manager helps you create and store strong, unique passwords for every account, making it far more difficult for attackers to compromise your logins, even if some of your information is leaked or targeted by AI-driven attacks.

      "Have you ever wished your daily commute could be as easy and comfortable as driving a car, but as fun and eco-friendly as riding a bike? You are not alone. That is exactly the kind of thinking that inspired the Acticycle. This four-wheeled electric vehicle is shaking up city transportation by blending the best parts of both worlds. With the Acticycle, you get the comfort, weather protection, and storage you would expect from a car, but with the agility, efficiency, and low cost of a bike.",

      "Four-wheeled electric vehicle. (Acticycle)",
      "Acticycle specs: What you need to know",
      "Let's start with the numbers, since they really set the\u00a0Acticycle apart. The vehicle measures about 93 inches long, 36 inches wide, and 60 inches tall, making it compact enough for bike lanes and city streets, but roomy enough for two adults or one adult and two small children. It weighs just 220 pounds, about one-fifth the weight of a typical electric car, and can carry up to 660 pounds of passengers and cargo.",
      "The Acticycle rides on four 20-inch reinforced wheels with puncture-resistant tires, and it uses hydraulic disc brakes for reliable stopping power. Depending on the model, you can choose from a 250-watt, 750-watt, or dual 2000-watt motor setup. Top speeds range from 16 miles per hour with the 250-watt motor to 28 miles per hour with the more powerful versions. The removable lithium-ion batteries provide a range of up to 62 miles per charge, and you can double that by adding a second battery. The Acticycle also features a total of 6 cubic feet of cargo space, divided between a secure hard trunk and a flexible soft compartment, so you can haul groceries, gear, or whatever your day demands.",

      "TURN ANY BIKE INTO AN E-BIKE IN SECONDS WITH THIS NIFTY GADGET",
      "A new kind of urban mobility",
      "The Acticycle is not just about impressive specs, though. It is about reimagining how we move through our cities. Unlike most bikes, the Acticycle is built for companionship and comfort. The two ergonomic seats are designed to make even long rides enjoyable, so you and a friend can chat and relax on your way to work or out on the town. The seating is plush and supportive, which means you can say goodbye to the aches and pains that come with traditional cycling.",

      "One of the most frustrating things about biking in the city is dealing with the weather. The Acticycle takes care of that with a full canopy, roof, and windshield that keep you dry and protected from rain and splashes. Mudguards help keep the mess off your clothes, so you can show up at your destination looking as fresh as when you left home. This weather protection means you do not have to worry about rain gear or last-minute wardrobe changes, making the Acticycle a true year-round solution.",

      "A PEDAL-ELECTRIC HYBRID THAT'S HALF BIKE, HALF CAR",
      "Agility without compromise",
      "Despite its four wheels, the Acticycle is surprisingly agile. Its tight steering angle and low center of gravity let you weave through traffic, navigate narrow bike lanes, and handle sharp corners with ease. Even when you are carrying a full load of passengers or cargo, the Acticycle maintains stable and responsive handling, so you always feel in control.",
      "Four-wheeled electric vehicle. (Acticycle)",
      "Power and range",
      "Range anxiety is a thing of the past with the Acticycle. The removable batteries can be charged at home with a standard outlet, and swapping them out is quick and simple. With up to 62 miles of range per battery, most daily commutes are easily covered, and you can add a second battery for longer trips. The powerful motor delivers up to 133 pound-feet of torque, which means you can climb hills and accelerate into traffic without breaking a sweat. This kind of performance is usually reserved for much heavier and more expensive electric vehicles, but the Acticycle brings it to a whole new category.",
      "HOW SECURE IS MY PASSWORD? USE THIS TEST TO FIND OUT",
      "Four-wheeled electric vehicle. (Acticycle)",
      "How much storage does this thing have",
      "City living often means making tough choices about what you can carry with you. The Acticycle makes that a non-issue. With about 6 cubic feet of storage, split between a lockable hard trunk and a roomy soft compartment, you can carry everything from groceries and work supplies to picnic gear and gym bags. The storage is designed to keep your cargo secure and balanced, so you never have to worry about tipping or losing control.",
      "Four-wheeled electric vehicle. (Acticycle)",
      "Eco-friendly and budget-smart",
      "The Acticycle is not just good for your commute, it is good for the planet and your wallet. Its lightweight frame and efficient battery system mean it uses far less energy than a car, and its maintenance needs are similar to a cargo bike rather than a car. You will save money on fuel, parking, insurance, and repairs, all while reducing your environmental impact. It is a win-win for anyone looking to make smarter choices in the city.",
      "Four-wheeled electric vehicle. (Acticycle)",
      "What does the Acticycle cost?",
      "When it comes to price, the Acticycle is designed to be a smart investment for urban commuters who want all the benefits of a car and a bike, but without the hefty price tag. While official U.S. pricing has not been widely announced yet, early European versions start at around $8,000 to $10,000, depending on the motor and battery configuration you choose. This puts it in a unique spot, since it is much less expensive than most electric cars, but does cost more than a high-end electric bike or cargo bike.",

With its weather protection, roomy storage, and smooth ride, it makes daily commuting or running errands so much easier and more enjoyable. You get to skip the hassle of traffic jams, parking headaches, and high fuel costs, all while doing your part for the environment.",

      "In the ongoing debate over regulating social media, one company is urging parents to take matters into their own hands.",
      "We stay on top of updates for our phones and laptops. Some of us even make sure our smartwatches and security cameras are running the latest firmware. But routers often get overlooked. If it's working, we assume it's fine, but that mindset can be risky.",
      "Now, the FBI has issued a warning that cybercriminals are actively exploiting old, unpatched and outdated routers. The alert, released in May 2025, explains how aging network devices with known flaws are being hijacked by malware and used to power anonymous cybercrime operations. A forgotten device in your home can silently become a tool for attackers.",

      "Devices manufactured around 2010 or earlier are especially vulnerable, as vendors have long ceased providing firmware updates for them. According to the FBI, such end-of-life routers have been breached by cyber actors using a variant of the \"TheMoon\" malware, allowing attackers to install proxy services on the devices and conduct illicit activities anonymously.",
      "In essence, home and small-office routers are being quietly conscripted into proxy networks that mask the perpetrators' identities online. The alert notes that through networks like \"Anyproxy,\" criminals have been selling access to the infected routers as proxy nodes. In these schemes, paying customers can route their internet traffic through unwitting victims' routers, obscuring their own location while the victim's device (and IP address) bears the blame.",

      "WHAT EXACTLY IS A DATA BREACH? WHY SHOULD I CARE?",
      "How hackers exploit these routers",
      "Many recent infections stem from devices with remote administration exposed to the internet. Attackers scan for such routers, exploiting known firmware flaws without needing passwords. A single crafted web request can trick an older device into running malicious code. Once inside, malware often alters settings, opening ports or disabling security features, to maintain control and connect to external command-and-control servers.",
      "One prominent threat is\u00a0TheMoon, a malware strain first seen in 2014 that exploited flaws in Linksys routers. It has since evolved into a stealthy botnet builder, transforming infected routers into proxy nodes. Instead of launching direct attacks, TheMoon reroutes third-party traffic, masking hackers' identities behind everyday home networks. Cybercrime platforms like Faceless sell access to these infected routers as \"residential proxies,\" making them valuable assets in the digital underground.",
      "For users, a compromised router means slower connections, exposure to phishing and spyware, and potential legal trouble if criminals abuse their IP address. For businesses, the risk is even higher: Outdated routers can be exploited for deeper network intrusions, data theft and ransomware attacks. In critical sectors, the consequences can be severe, affecting safety and compliance.",

      "6 ways to stay safe from router hackers",
      "Given the serious threats posed by outdated and compromised routers, taking proactive measures is essential. Here are six practical steps you can follow to protect your network and keep hackers at bay.",
      "1) Replace your old router if it's no longer supported:\u00a0If your router is more than five to seven years old, or if you can't find any recent updates for it on the manufacturer's website, it might be time to upgrade. Older routers often stop getting security fixes, which makes them an easy target for hackers. To check, look at the label on your router for the model number, then search online for \"[model number] firmware update.\" If the last update was years ago, consider replacing it with a newer model from a trusted brand.",
      "If you're not sure which router to get, check out my list of\u00a0top routers for the best security. It includes models with strong security features and compatibility with\u00a0VPN services.",
      "2) Keep your router's firmware updated:\u00a0Your router runs software called firmware, which needs to be updated just like your phone or computer. To do this, open a web browser and type your router's IP address (often 192.168.0.1 or 192.168.1.1), then log in using the username and password (usually found on a sticker on the router). Once inside, look for a section called \"Firmware Update,\" \"System\" or \"Administration,\" and check if an update is available. Apply it if there is one. Some newer routers also have apps that make this even easier.",
      "3) Turn off remote access:\u00a0Remote access lets you control your router from outside your home network, but it also opens the door for hackers. You can turn this off by logging into your router's settings (using the same steps as above), then finding a setting called \"Remote Management,\" \"Remote Access\" or \"WAN Access.\" Make sure this feature is\u00a0disabled, then save the changes and restart your router.",
      "4) Use a strong password for your router settings:\u00a0Don't leave your router using the default login, like \"admin\" and \"password.\" That's the first thing hackers try. Change it to a long, strong password with a mix of letters, numbers and symbols. A good example would be something like\u00a0T#8r2k!sG91xm4vL. Try to avoid using the same password you use elsewhere. You can usually change the login password in the \"Administration\" or \"Security\" section of the router settings. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "5) Look out for strange behavior and act quickly:\u00a0If your internet feels unusually slow, your devices randomly disconnect or your streaming buffers more than usual, it could mean something is wrong. Go into your router settings and check the list of connected devices. If you see something you don't recognize, it could be a sign of a breach. In that case, update the firmware, change your passwords and restart the router. If you're not comfortable doing this yourself, call your internet provider for help.",
      "6) Reporting to authorities:\u00a0The FBI asks that victims or those who suspect a compromise report incidents to the\u00a0Internet Crime Complaint Center, which can help authorities track and mitigate broader threats.",
      "SUBSCRIBE TO KURT\u2019S YOUTUBE CHANNEL FOR QUICK VIDEO TIPS ON HOW TO WORK ALL OF YOUR TECH DEVICES",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "This isn't just about asking everyone to upgrade their old gear. It's about the bigger issue of who's actually responsible when outdated devices turn into security risks. Most people don't think twice about the router sitting in a corner, quietly doing its job years past its prime. But attackers do. They see forgotten hardware as easy targets. The real challenge isn't just technical. It's about how manufacturers, service providers and users all handle the long tail of aging tech that still lives on in the real world.",

      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson discusses LEVA, the autonomous robot that walks, rolls and lifts 187 pounds of cargo for all-terrain deliveries.",
      "Autonomous delivery robots are already starting to change the way goods move around cities and warehouses, but most still need humans to load and unload their cargo. That's where LEVA comes in. Developed by engineers and designers from ETH Zurich and other Swiss universities, LEVA is a robot that can not only navigate tricky environments but also lift and carry heavy boxes all on its own, making deliveries smoother and more efficient.",

      "Delivery robot (LEVA) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What makes LEVA different?",
      "Most delivery robots either roll on wheels or walk on legs, but LEVA combines both. It has four legs, and each leg ends with a motorized, steerable wheel. This means on smooth surfaces like sidewalks, LEVA can roll quickly and efficiently, almost like a little car. When it encounters stairs, curbs or rough ground, it locks its wheels and walks or climbs like a four-legged animal. This unique design lets LEVA handle both flat urban streets and uneven terrain with ease.",

      "RICE-SIZED ROBOT COULD MAKE BRAIN SURGERY SAFER AND LESS INVASIVE",
      "How LEVA sees and moves around",
      "LEVA uses a mix of GPS, lidar sensors and five cameras placed around its body to understand its surroundings. These tools help it navigate city streets or indoor hallways while avoiding obstacles. One camera even looks downward to help LEVA line itself up perfectly when it's time to pick up or drop off cargo.",

      "DRIVERLESS BIG-RIG ROBOTRUCKS ARE NOW ON THE ROAD IN THIS STATE",
      "The big deal: Loading and unloading itself",
      "What really sets LEVA apart is its ability to load and unload cargo boxes without any human help. It spots a standard cargo box, moves right over it, lowers itself by bending its legs and then locks onto the box using powered hooks underneath its body. After securing the box, LEVA lifts itself back up and carries the load to its destination. It can handle boxes weighing up to 187 pounds, which is pretty impressive for a robot of its size.",

      "Delivery robot (LEVA) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Where could you see LEVA in action?",
      "LEVA's flexibility makes it useful in many places. It could deliver packages right to your doorstep, even if you live in a building with stairs. Farmers might use it to move supplies across fields. On construction sites, it could carry tools and materials over uneven ground. It might even assist in emergency situations by bringing supplies through rubble or rough terrain.",
      "Delivery robot (LEVA) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What does this mean for you?",
      "For folks like us, LEVA could mean faster, more reliable deliveries, especially in tricky urban areas where stairs and curbs often slow things down. For businesses, it means cutting down on the need for manual labor to load and unload heavy items, which can reduce injuries and lower costs.",
      "It also means deliveries and material handling could happen around the clock without breaks, boosting efficiency. In industries like farming, construction and emergency response, LEVA's ability to get through tough terrain while carrying heavy loads could make a big difference in how quickly and safely supplies get where they need to go.",

    "story": [
      "A skydiver lost his iPhone during a 14,000-foot fall, but the phone miraculously survived without a scratch.",
      "Fingerprint sensors have been around for quite some time, and they\u2019ve become a standard feature in most smartphones. Apple introduced Touch ID on the iPhone 5s in 2013. Since then, it has appeared on 12 major iPhone models (and some iPads as well).",
      "Though Apple removed it from most phones after the iPhone 8, it\u2019s still found in the iPhone SE series. On the flip side, almost every Android phone on the market has a fingerprint scanner. But are fingerprint scanners impossible to bypass? Frank from Deerton, Michigan, asked a similar question that I want to highlight and address because it helps all of us:",
      "\"Can a website be hacked/compromised with password and fingerprint protection (multiple verification)?\"",
      "I get what you\u2019re saying, Frank. You\u2019d think that since a fingerprint scanner literally requires your fingerprint, it couldn\u2019t be bypassed. But you\u2019d be wrong. While fingerprint scanners are generally more secure than facial recognition and passwords, they\u2019re not foolproof. In fact, there are several ways bad actors can bypass them to steal your identity.",

      "A smartphone on a table\u00a0\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "5 ways bad actors can bypass fingerprint scanners",
      "There are multiple ways hackers use to bypass fingerprint scanners. Below, I will discuss five of the more prominent methods.",
      "Hackers exploit the concept of \"masterprints,\" which are fingerprints engineered to match multiple individuals' prints. Researchers at\u00a0NYU Tandon developed \"DeepMasterPrints\" using machine learning to generate synthetic fingerprints that can deceive sensors by mimicking common fingerprint features. These artificial prints can match with a significant percentage of stored fingerprints, especially on devices with less stringent security settings.",
      "Another trick hackers use is making fake fingerprints. They can lift prints off things you\u2019ve touched and then use stuff like fabric glue or even 3D printers to make molds. For example,\u00a0researchers at Cisco Talos tried out a bunch of different ways to do this using 3D printing and tested them on phones like the iPhone 8 and Samsung S10; laptops like the Samsung Note 9, Lenovo Yoga and HP Pavilion X360; and even smart gadgets like padlocks.",
      "On average, the fake fingerprints worked about 80% of the time. They were able to fool the sensors at least once. Interestingly, they couldn\u2019t crack the biometric systems on Windows 10 devices, but they pointed out that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean those are more secure. It just means this particular method didn\u2019t work on them.",
      "19 BILLION PASSWORDS HAVE LEAKED ONLINE: HOW TO PROTECT YOURSELF",
      "Attackers have found a cheap way to break into smartphones by brute force fingerprint authentication. The method, called BrutePrint, lets attackers get around the usual limits that stop too many failed fingerprint attempts. It works by taking advantage of two previously unknown flaws in the fingerprint system. These flaws, named Cancel-After-Match-Fail (CAMF) and Match-After-Lock (MAL), exist because of weak protection for fingerprint data on a part of the hardware called the Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI).",
      "Basically, BrutePrint uses a hardware-based man-in-the-middle attack to hijack fingerprint data. It sits between the fingerprint sensor and the phone\u2019s secure area (called the Trusted Execution Environment) and tries as many fingerprint images as needed until it finds a match. The relieving part is that the attacker needs to have physical access to the phone for this method to work.",
      "PrintListener is a side-channel attack that captures the sound of a finger swiping on a screen to extract fingerprint features. It might sound like something out of a sci-fi movie, but researchers have already built a proof of concept. By analyzing the friction sounds, attackers can reconstruct fingerprint patterns, potentially enhancing the effectiveness of masterprint attacks.",
      "Some devices store fingerprint data without adequate encryption. If attackers gain access to this unprotected data, they can replicate fingerprints to bypass authentication. For example, in 2024, a misconfigured server exposed nearly 500 GB of sensitive biometric data, including fingerprints, facial scans and personal details of law enforcement applicants.",

      "So, can you trust fingerprint scanners?",
      "Fingerprint scanners make it easy and fairly secure to unlock your devices. Since everyone has unique fingerprints, you don\u2019t need to remember complicated passwords. Just a quick touch and you are in. Most modern devices store your fingerprint data in secure parts of the system, and they use things like liveness detection to make sure someone is not trying to trick the scanner with a fake finger.",
      "Still, no security method is perfect. Skilled attackers have found ways to get past fingerprint scanners using high-resolution photos or 3D-printed fingers or by taking advantage of flaws in how the scanner communicates with the rest of the device. The risk really depends on how well the scanner is designed and how much effort someone puts into breaking it. For most people, fingerprint authentication is quick, easy and secure enough. However, if you are dealing with very sensitive information, relying only on biometrics might not be the best idea.",

      "Safeguard your biometric identity with these essential security measures.",
      "1. Choose trusted phone brands:\u00a0If you're buying a phone, stick with well-known brands like Apple, Samsung or Google. These companies take extra steps to protect your fingerprint data by storing it in secure areas of the phone that are harder to access. Cheaper or lesser-known brands may not have these protections, which makes it easier for attackers to steal your data.",
      "2. Keep your phone updated:\u00a0Phone updates are not just about new features. They fix security problems that hackers might use to break into your device. If your phone asks you to install an update, do it. Most phones also let you turn on automatic updates, so you don\u2019t have to worry about remembering. Keeping your software updated is one of the easiest and most important ways to stay protected.",
      "3. Use strong antivirus software: Install strong antivirus software to detect malware that could compromise biometric data storage.\u00a0Strong antivirus software offers real-time threat detection, anti-phishing and privacy features to block unauthorized access to fingerprint data. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "4. Don\u2019t rely only on your fingerprint:\u00a0Using a fingerprint to unlock your phone is convenient, but it shouldn\u2019t be your only line of defense, especially for sensitive apps like banking or email. Always set up a PIN, password or pattern as a backup on your\u00a0iPhone and\u00a0Android. This way, even if someone manages to copy your fingerprint, they still need another piece of information to get in.",
      "5. Be careful about who handles your phone:\u00a0If someone else uses your phone, especially a stranger or someone you don\u2019t know well, they might be able to copy your fingerprint from the screen. It\u2019s rare, but it happens. To reduce this risk, avoid handing your phone to people unnecessarily and wipe your screen occasionally to remove any clear fingerprints.",
      "6. Only use fingerprint login with trusted apps:\u00a0Not every app that asks for your fingerprint is trustworthy. It\u2019s safest to use fingerprint login only with apps from known and reliable companies, like your bank, phone manufacturer or email provider. If an unfamiliar app asks for fingerprint access, it\u2019s better to skip it and use your password instead.",
      "7. Consider using a personal data removal service: Even fingerprint scanners can be bypassed, and large amounts of personal and biometric data have been exposed in breaches. Using a personal data removal service helps reduce your risk by removing your sensitive information from public databases and data broker sites, making it harder for hackers to piece together details that could be used to steal your identity.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "WHAT HACKERS CAN LEARN ABOUT YOU FROM A DATA BROKER FILE",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Passwords are generally easier to hack than biometric data like fingerprints or facial recognition. However, the key difference is that passwords can be changed if they\u2019re compromised. Your biometrics cannot. Most modern devices allow both options, and biometrics can offer an extra layer of security by making it harder for someone else to access your phone or apps. They're also fast and convenient, since you don\u2019t need to remember or type anything. That said, in most cases, your device still falls back on a password or PIN when biometric identification doesn\u2019t work, so both systems often go hand in hand.",

    "summary": "Massive password leak reveals cybersecurity flaws. Learn how to protect your accounts with strong passwords, two-factor authentication and data removal services.",
    "story": [
      "From face recognition to dynamic lock, there are options you may be unfamiliar with.",
      "Passwords are outdated, and it's time for both tech companies and users to move on. There, I said it. Like it or not, the weakest link in cybersecurity is anything that relies on human input. While organizations continue to invest in firewalls and endpoint security, the most persistent vulnerability remains the human password.",
      "The internet has long struggled with poor password practices, but a recent discovery highlights just how serious the problem is.",
      "Security researchers have uncovered more than 19 billion newly leaked passwords, collected from hundreds of breaches between April 2024 and April 2025. An astonishing 94% of these passwords were either reused, predictable or both.",

      "Illustration of a hacker at work. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What you need to know",
      "Between April 2024 and April 2025, data from nearly 200 separate cybersecurity incidents became publicly available, as discovered by\u00a0Cybernews. These were not isolated events. They involved massive leak repositories including combolists, stealer logs and compromised databases. In total, over 3 terabytes of raw leaked data were analyzed, comprising more than 19 billion passwords. Only 6 percent of these, just over 1.1 billion, were unique.",
      "Among the most used passwords, \"123456\" appeared in over 338 million instances. Words like \"Password\" and \"admin\" followed close behind, despite years of public warnings. Such defaults often originate from devices like routers or enterprise tools, where they are rarely changed and frequently reused elsewhere.",
      "1.7 BILLION PASSWORDS LEAKED ON DARK WEB AND WHY YOURS IS AT RISK",
      "Personal names remain a common pattern as well. The name \"Ana\" appeared in nearly 179 million passwords, followed by countless other first names and name-based combinations. Pop culture, food, cities and even swear words were frequent themes. Words like \"Mario,\" \"love,\" \"pizza,\" \"Rome\" and various profanities were not just creative choices. They are now security liabilities.",
      "Even worse, attackers do not need to guess anymore. They have automation. Credential stuffing tools now run through billions of known passwords across hundreds of platforms, breaching accounts at success rates as high as two percent. That equates to thousands of compromised profiles, bank accounts, emails and cloud tools every single day.",
      "Illustration of a hacker at work. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "200 MILLION SOCIAL MEDIA RECORDS LEAKED IN MAJOR X DATA BREACH",
      "The bigger problem",
      "According to CyberNews researcher Neringa Macijauskaite, the core issue is not just weak passwords but how often they are reused. Only six percent of passwords are unique. For most users, security depends entirely on\u00a0two-factor authentication, if it is enabled at all.",
      "Most passwords fall between eight to 10 characters, with eight being the most common. Around 27 percent of them contain only lowercase letters and digits, making them highly vulnerable to brute force attacks. Less than 20 percent use a mix of cases and numbers, and only a small fraction includes symbols.",
      "HOW SECURE IS MY PASSWORD? USE THIS TEST TO FIND OUT",
      "Despite widespread education efforts, user habits remain stagnant, but one positive trend has emerged. In 2022, only one percent of passwords used a mix of lowercase, uppercase, numbers and symbols. Now that figure has grown to 19 percent, likely driven by stricter password requirements across platforms.",

A single compromised password can trigger a domino effect, exposing multiple accounts across services. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords.

      "Four ways to stay safe from password-stealing scammers",
      "Protecting your data requires a mix of smart security habits and reliable tools. Here are four effective ways to keep your information safe.",
      "1. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA):\u00a0Even if your password is stolen,\u00a02FA adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as a code from an authentication app or biometric confirmation. Cybercriminals rely on stolen usernames and passwords to break into accounts, but with 2FA enabled, they cannot gain access without the additional security step. Make sure to enable 2FA on important accounts like email, banking and work-related logins.",
      "2. Use strong antivirus software and be cautious with downloads and links:\u00a0Infostealer malware is the root cause of why your password is out there. It often spreads through malicious downloads, phishing emails and fake websites. Avoid downloading software or files from untrusted sources, and always double-check links before clicking them. Attackers disguise malware as legitimate software, game cheats or cracked applications, so it is best to stick to official websites and app stores for downloads.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "3. Keep software updated:\u00a0Cybercriminals exploit outdated software to deliver malware.\u00a0Keeping your operating system, browsers, and security software up to date ensures that known vulnerabilities are patched. Enable automatic updates whenever possible, and install reputable antivirus or endpoint protection software that can detect and block infostealer threats before they compromise your system.",
      "4. Consider a personal data removal service:\u00a0These services can help remove your personal information from data broker sites, reducing your risk of identity theft, spam and targeted scams. While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "SUBSCRIBE TO KURT\u2019S YOUTUBE CHANNEL FOR QUICK VIDEO TIPS ON HOW TO WORK ALL OF YOUR TECH DEVICES",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "When it comes down to it, passwords just aren't cutting it anymore. The sheer number of leaked passwords and the fact that so few are unique show how vulnerable we really are. Cybercriminals are getting smarter and faster, but we don't have to make it easy for them. By using password managers, enabling two-factor authentication, keeping our software updated and considering extra privacy tools, we can take back some control over this situation. It might take a little effort to change old habits, but the peace of mind you get is worth it.",

      "For Caroline Laubach, being a Wandercraft test pilot is about more than just trying out new technology. It's about reclaiming a sense of freedom and connection that many wheelchair users miss. Laubach, a spinal stroke survivor and full-time wheelchair user, has played a key role in\u00a0demonstrating the personal AI-powered prototype exoskeleton's development, and her experience highlights just how life-changing this device can be.",
      "\"When I'm in the exoskeleton, I feel more free than I do in my daily life,\" said Laubach. \"It gives me the opportunity to walk around and talk to people at eye level. I don't have to look up at people all the time.",

    "summary": "AI technology in NYC subways aims to improve safety by monitoring behavior patterns, led by MTA&apos;s Michael Kemper, while ensuring rider privacy is protected.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News anchor Bret Baier has the latest on the Murdoch Children's Research Institute's partnership with the Gladstone Institutes for the \"Decoding Broken Hearts\" initiative on \"Special Report.\"",
      "Imagine having a tireless guardian watching over you during your subway commute. It notices every detail with steady focus, all with one goal in mind: keeping you safe on the subway.",
      "New York City's subway system is testing artificial intelligence to boost security and reduce crime. Michael Kemper, a 33-year NYPD veteran and the chief security officer for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA), which is the largest transit agency in the United States, is leading the rollout of AI software designed to spot suspicious behavior as it happens.",

      "New York City subway (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "How AI surveillance will work in the New York City Subway",
      "The AI system will analyze real-time camera feeds across subway platforms and train cars to detect unusual or potentially dangerous behaviors. Instead of identifying individuals, the technology focuses on behavior patterns that might signal trouble, such as erratic movements or confrontations. When the AI flags something suspicious, it can alert transit police to respond quickly, which could help prevent crimes before they escalate.",
      "Currently, about 40% of subway cameras are monitored live by staff. The AI aims to expand this coverage without needing additional personnel, which could enhance safety across the system. While details about the AI providers and full deployment timelines have not been shared, the MTA emphasizes that facial recognition technology will not be part of this system. This is intended to protect rider privacy.",

      "Crime in NYC subways has seen ups and downs over recent years. While major crimes dropped by about 7.7% through mid-2024, assaults have unfortunately increased. To bolster safety, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul deployed 1,000 National Guard members to support transit police efforts. AI technology is viewed as a complementary tool in this broader strategy to keep subways safe, not a standalone solution.",

      "Is AI being used in public transit elsewhere?",
      "New York is not alone in exploring AI for transit security. Cities like Los Angeles and Chicago have experimented with AI-powered cameras for tasks ranging from weapons detection to issuing parking citations. These initiatives reflect a growing interest in using technology to enhance public safety in transit environments.",

      "While the promise of AI surveillance is encouraging, several questions remain unanswered. We do not yet know exactly which behaviors the system will flag or how effective it will be in practice. Perhaps more importantly, privacy advocates and civil liberties groups warn about potential biases in AI systems and the risk of false positives that could unfairly target certain groups.",
      "The MTA's decision to exclude facial recognition is a positive step, but ongoing transparency and oversight will be crucial. Michael Kemper's extensive experience leading the NYPD's Transit Bureau, where he helped reduce subway crime, adds credibility to the initiative. Still, as this technology rolls out, balancing safety with privacy and fairness will be key to earning public trust.",

      "In an interview with Fox News Digital, Levy said that it is crucial that Hamas not remain in power \u2014 and that it is also vital to save the hostages languishing in tunnels under Gaza.",
      "\"If this war ends with the Hamas regime that perpetrated October 7th still in power, it won't end, it will just pause, and the next war will be a matter of time,\" Levy said. \"Israelis don\u2019t want war.

      "Israel has faced international criticism over its handling of the war in Gaza, with the U.K., France and Canada releasing a joint statement earlier this month demanding that Jerusalem end its military operations in the Gaza Strip. The U.K. also suspended trade talks with Israel because of London\u2019s objections to the war. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney of being \"on the wrong side of humanity.\"",
      "\"I think anyone criticizing Israel needs to come up with a better plan for how you remove Hamas from power, because otherwise they're just giving it political power and trying to save [it] from the war that it started,\" Levy told Fox News Digital.",
      "The international community has been pressuring Israel regarding hostage swaps. Jerusalem has been pressured to free Palestinian prisoners in exchange for the release of hostages taken on Oct. 7.

      "\"Here's the absurdity of international pressure on Israel to pay a ransom. Most countries don't pay ransoms to terrorist hostage takers because they understand it only incentivizes more hostage taking, it rewards it, it encourages more of it,\" Levy told Fox News Digital. \"Israel has paid a ransom to get hostages out in two cease-fires because we say we know the dangers, we know it's risky, but we've got to get out these poor people who are being starved and tortured and even executed in the dungeons.\"",
      "Levy believes Israel \"found itself stymied along the way\" as countries that initially backed efforts to defeat Hamas \"got cold feet very quickly\" as they understood what removing the terror group from power would entail.",
      "Looking at the broader picture, Levy wonders if Israel had taken on a different strategy from day one, whether the war would have ended sooner, though he admits it would have meant \"defying international pressure.\"",

      "\"I do wonder if that had been the strategy from the beginning\u2014defying international pressure\u2014then it's possible the war might have ended sooner,\" Levy said. \"But again, Israel is caught in this impossible bind because there are still hostages who are trapped in Gaza, whom Hamas is threatening to execute if the Israeli army gets anywhere near them to try to rescue them.\"",
      "This is not a new or empty threat. Several former hostages reported being threatened and said they were told that their captors would execute them if Israeli forces got close. Six other former hostages, including American-Israeli Hersh Goldberg-Polin, met this fate when they were fatally shot just before the IDF could reach them.",

While the Biden administration put more pressure on Netanyahu, Trump appears to support Israel doing what it must to end the war.",
      "Levy told Fox News Digital that \"Israelis definitely got the impression that the Trump administration has Israel's back and is willing to endorse any military strategy that it wants to implement, but there are also signs the Trump administration, you know, may want to wrap this up very quickly.\"",

      "In their judgment Wednesday, the U.S. Court of International Trade panel said that Trump\u2019s tariffs lacked \u201cany identifiable limits,\u201d and found that the decades-old International Emergency Economic Powers Act, a federal law that Trump cited in many of his executive orders, did not \u201cdelegate an unbounded tariff authority to the President.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe instead read IEEPA\u2019s provisions to impose meaningful limits on any such authority it confers,\" they wrote.",
      "The ruling blocks most of the tariffs Trump has rolled out so far in his second term, including the 10% rate applied to most trading partners and those on China. It also includes fentanyl-related levies on Canada and Mexico.",
      "The panel's judgment on Wednesday pertained to two lawsuits over Trump's tariffs \u2014 in one a group of states led by Arizona and Oregon had sued over the tariffs, and in another, several small businesses had sued, both arguing that Trump had exceeded his authority.",

    "summary": "Billionaire Tesla CEO Elon Musk's time working for President Donald Trump is over.",
    "story": [
      "Elon Musk's days working at the White House are over.",
      "Musk, the billionaire Tesla CEO whom President Donald Trump enlisted to cut waste in the federal government, started offboarding from his role Wednesday, a White House official told NBC News, a day after he criticized a Republican bill to fund much of Trump\u2019s agenda.",
      "Two sources later confirmed to NBC News that Musk's more than 114-day long tenure as a special government employee officially concluded Wednesday evening.",
      "Musk commented on his exit Wednesday on X, his social media platform. He called for the \u201cDOGE mission\u201d to become \u201ca way of life throughout the government,\u201d referring to his Department of Government Efficiency initiative.",
      "\u201cAs my scheduled time as a Special Government Employee comes to an end, I would like to thank President @realDonaldTrump for the opportunity to reduce wasteful spending,\u201d wrote Musk, the richest person in the world.",
      "While a senior White House official has previously stressed that Musk is a friend of Trump\u2019s, the White House did not provide an on-the-record comment Wednesday about Musk\u2019s departure.",
      "NBC News has reported that special government employees, a class of temporary worker that included Musk, can typically work up to 130 days in a calendar year, though the days can be split up. The White House first publicly acknowledged Musk\u2019s role on Feb. 3, so he was most likely nearing the end of that tenure.",
      "Musk\u2019s official departure came at a charged moment in his relationship with Trump. On Tuesday, CBS News\u2019 \u201cSunday Morning\u201d shared a clip of him sharing his disappointment in the \u201cmassive spending bill,\u201d which he said \u201cundermines\u201d the work of his DOGE operation, which has aimed to reduce federal spending by slashing the size of the federal workforce, cutting government programs and eliminating grants deemed wasteful.",
      "The Congressional Budget Office estimated the Republican funding package would add $2.3 trillion to the federal deficit over 10 years, largely because of the extensions of Trump\u2019s 2017 tax cuts and new expenditures that outweigh the savings.",
      "Musk initially set out to cut upward of $2 trillion through the operation, a goal he later significantly walked back.",
      "Now he leaves the government with DOGE having thus far fallen well short of the trillions of dollars of savings he once touted on the campaign trail. As of Wednesday evening, the DOGE government website claimed $175 billion in savings, though its claims have been found to be questionable.",
      "Trump responded to Musk's criticisms Wednesday afternoon in the Oval Office, defending the funding package. He said the legislation would deliver on several of his key priorities, but he also noted the complexities of passing such a sprawling bill through a sharply divided House.",
      "\u201cMy reaction\u2019s a lot of things. No. 1, we have to get a lot of votes. We can\u2019t be cutting a \u2014 you know \u2014 we need to get a lot of support, and we have a lot of support. We had to get it through the House,\u201d Trump said.",
      "Musk was among the most visible people in the early days of the second Trump administration, securing Trump's favor after having fueled his 2024 presidential campaign with upward of $250 million, according to campaign finance reports.",
      "He was frequently seen alongside Trump, often wearing a Trump hat while appearing with one of his young children. Musk appeared to relish his role as Trump\u2019s waste and fraud czar, taking the stage at the Conservative Political Action Conference in February with a sizable chain saw to tout his cost-cutting initiative.",
      "Musk also at one point threatened to use his wealth to fund challengers to any Republicans who dared to oppose Trump\u2019s agenda.",
      "But behind the scenes, tensions between Musk and other Trump administration members mounted, with some of those making their way to the public through news reports about tense meetings and shouting matches. Musk also took some of his grievances public, including criticism of Trump\u2019s tariffs.",
      "Meanwhile, Musk\u2019s public profile suffered \u2014 as did the perception of his most consumer-centric business, Tesla. Public poll numbers showed that he and DOGE were relatively unpopular, and Tesla vehicles and dealerships became the targets of protests and vandalism. Tesla\u2019s stock is down 11% so far this year.",
      "Trump continued to support Musk, at one point in March turning the South Lawn of the White House into an impromptu Tesla showroom and buying one of the vehicles.",
      "Musk\u2019s power, both in terms of his cash contributions as well as his political clout, took a hit in late March when Republicans lost a high-profile judicial election in Wisconsin in which Musk spent heavily and became a target for Democrats.",
      "Musk had maintained that his participation in the Trump administration and DOGE was temporary, but in recent weeks he has signaled that he may pull back from politics more broadly. Over the weekend, he wrote on X that he was \"Back to spending 24/7 at work and sleeping in conference/server/factory rooms.\" Last week, he said he planned to scale down his sizable spending on politics, though said he would spend in the future if he saw a reason to do so. \u201cI don\u2019t currently see a reason,\u201d he said.",
      "While Musk has said DOGE will continue to operate, it\u2019s unclear just how much pull it will have without him at the helm.",
      "The legacy of the Musk-led effort will most likely be reflected legislatively, as the House is expected to soon put forth a rescissions package to codify DOGE cuts.",
      "\u201cWe want to make sure that Congress passes its first rescissions bill, including the DOGE [cuts], and we will send more if they pass it,\u201d Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought told Fox Business on Wednesday."

      "Scores of Palestinian men, women and children raced across a dusty expanse toward an aid warehouse in the Gaza Strip on Wednesday. A few minutes later, a few emerged with bags and boxes of food.",
      "Those were the desperate scenes that marked the first turbulent week of a new U.S. and Israel-backed plan for aid distribution in the enclave.",
      "The United Nations World Food Programme said in a statement Wednesday that \u201chordes of hungry people\u201d broke into its Al-Ghafari warehouse in central Gaza's Deir al-Balah attempting to get a hold of supplies being prepared for distribution.",
      "The UNWFP cited \"initial reports\" that at least two people were killed and several more injured in the incident. NBC News was not immediately able to independently verify those details.",
      "An Israeli military spokesperson said they were not aware of their forces being connected to the reported deaths, or of any shots being fired by troops.",
      "Those reported deaths came after chaotic events Tuesday, when thousands of hungry Palestinians flooded a controversial new aid distribution center set up by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation \u2014 or GHF \u2014 which is tasked with distributing supplies in the U.S. and Israel-backed plan that came into effect Monday.",
      "In that case, Israeli soldiers fired live rounds into the air to disperse crowds, with the GHF seeking to quell concerns over its rocky first week of operations in a news release Wednesday.",
      "The GHF rejected the claims of Gaza's Hamas-run government media office, that three Palestinians were killed, 46 others injured and seven people missing after the incident. The foundation said that no one was killed while trying to access their distribution site.",
      "NBC News was not immediately able to verify the facts on the ground.",
      "GHF was tasked with distributing aid in Gaza after Israel earlier this month lifted an almost three-month-long blockade barring the entry of food, medicine and other vital supplies following warnings of rising starvation in the enclave.",
      "Under the plan, aid will be distributed from at least four distribution points in southern Gaza, with the aim of expanding with additional sites. GHF took over aid distribution after Israel lifted a more than two-month blockade barring the entry of food, medicine and other vital supplies into the enclave earlier this month.",
      "The United Nations, which has refused to participate in the plan, has condemned the initiative as a \u201cdistraction\u201d that undermines a longstanding humanitarian framework in Gaza. The U.N. says the effort poses a threat to the independence of aid operations, while simultaneously displacing Palestinians en-masse to Gaza's south.",
      "Israel has maintained that a new aid distribution system was necessary, alleging that Hamas was diverting supplies. The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) and other humanitarian groups have told NBC News they have not seen evidence of aid being diverted to Hamas or other armed groups during the war.",
      "Israel has long been deeply critical of the United Nations and its work in the Gaza Strip and the broader Palestinian territories."

      "The airline is returning to New York\u2019s John F. Kennedy International Airport again, this time through a partnership with JetBlue Airways.",
      "The partnership, called Blue Sky, will allow JetBlue customers to earn frequent-flyer miles on United and vice versa. It also includes reciprocal loyalty benefits like priority boarding and roomier seats for travelers with elite status.",
      "Some aspects of the partnership, which the carriers announced Thursday, will begin as early as the fall, though the airlines didn\u2019t provide exact timing. They also did not provide financial details of the deal.",
      "JetBlue\u2019s leaders have long said they need a partnership to better compete against larger airlines like United and their shared rival Delta Air Lines.",

Last year, a judge blocked JetBlue\u2019s plan to buy struggling budget carrier Spirit.",
      "\u201cThis collaboration with United is a bold step forward for the industry \u2014 one that brings together two customer-focused airlines to deliver more choices for travelers and value across our networks,\u201d JetBlue CEO Joanna Geraghty said in a news release.",
      "United left JFK in 2015, and current CEO Scott Kirby has called that a mistake because moving transcontinental flights to Newark allowed American to win over some corporate clients. It briefly returned in 2021, thanks to a Covid-era lull in traffic at the airport, where capacity is normally tightly controlled by the Federal Aviation Administration.",
      "United left JFK again in 2022 because it wasn\u2019t able to secure longer term slots there.",
      "Kirby has repeatedly said he wants the airline to return to JFK. The carrier has struggled in recent weeks with air-traffic staffing shortages and congestion at its Newark hub.",
      "Under the new agreement, United will be able to fly up to seven daily round-trip flights at congested Kennedy Airport, giving it more breadth in the New York City area, though the new operation will still be dwarfed by United\u2019s main hub in the area at Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey.",
      "United\u2019s JFK flights will begin in 2027 at the earliest, the carriers said. JetBlue, meanwhile, will get eight flights at Newark. United didn\u2019t say which routes it plans to operate at JFK, though its last foray was for service to Los Angeles and San Francisco.",

Regional police said a 64-year-old man was reported missing, and search and rescue operations involving a drone with thermal camera were under way.",
      "\"What I can tell you at the moment is that about 90% of the village is covered or destroyed, so it's a major catastrophe that has happened here in Blatten,\" Stephane Ganzer, the head of security in the southern Valais region, told local TV channel Canal9.",
      "The regional government said in a statement that a large chunk of the Birch Glacier above the village had broken off, causing the landslide which also buried the nearby Lonza River bed, raising the possibility of dammed water flows.",

      "In 2023, residents of the village of Brienz, in eastern Switzerland, were evacuated before a huge mass of rock slid down a mountainside, stopping just short of the community. Brienz was evacuated again last year because of the threat of a further rockslide."

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 Early battle lines are forming over a centerpiece of the sprawling domestic policy bill that House Republicans narrowly passed, with Medicaid spending cuts emerging as a flash point that could define the 2026 midterm elections.",
      "Democrats are fine-tuning their message as they blast the legislation, which now heads to the GOP-led Senate, as a tax cut for the wealthy that would be funded by cutting health care, after Republicans broadly promised they wouldn't cut Medicaid.",
      "A recent memo from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee vows to make the GOP\u2019s \u201ctax scam\u201d and Medicaid cuts \u201cthe defining contrast of the 2026 election cycle\u201d in its efforts to win the House majority next year.",
      "The DCCC is advising Democratic candidates to criticize the Republican bill as a Trojan horse designed to throw millions off of Medicaid \u2014 not address waste \u2014 with new red tape, said a separate source with knowledge of the private conversations.",
      "And Republicans are trying to frame the fight on their terms. The National Republican Congressional Committee is advising members to tout the bill as \u201cstrengthening Medicaid\u201d by limiting the program to those who need it \u2014 \u201cnot fraudsters, able-bodied adults who refuse to work, or illegal immigrants.\u201d",
      "Underneath the clash is a wonky debate about what, exactly, constitutes a Medicaid \u201ccut.\u201d",
      "Republicans insist they aren't directly cutting benefits for low-income and disabled people, so their bill shouldn't be defined as a cut. Democrats and outside critics say it would strip away coverage for millions of people, including those who need the program the most, who would fall through the cracks if they can't meet the new bureaucratic requirements to keep proving their eligibility.",
      "The bulk of the cost savings would come from strict new rules to maintain eligibility for Medicaid, which would require adult recipients to prove they\u2019re working or engaging in \u201ccommunity service\u201d for at least 80 hours per month, with limited exceptions that include pregnant women. That rule would kick in at the end of 2026. Other new rules would involve verifying addresses, proving lawful immigration status and screening eligibility more frequently, once every six months, instead of once a year.",
      "The bill would impose about $700 billion in cuts to Medicaid relative to current law, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, and rescind health coverage for about 8.6 million people. (The estimate was based on the work requirement\u2019s beginning in 2029, before it was moved up in the revised bill, meaning the uninsured number could be larger.)",
      "Still, Republicans are seeking to steer the debate toward the work requirements, which surveys say voters generally support for able-bodied adults, and selling the bill as an attempt to return Medicaid to those who need it the most.",
      "Asked to respond to the GOP argument on the bill's work requirements, DCCC spokesperson Viet Shelton said in an email: \u201cHouse Republicans got caught lying about their vote to rip health care away from millions of people and are now scrambling to change the subject. Their tax scam bill was specifically designed to be the largest cut to Medicaid in history and Republicans are now stuck in a doomloop debating how many and how quickly people will get kicked off their health insurance \u2014 not if.\u201d",
      "The politics of the escalating fight could prompt Senate Republicans to make changes to the bill. Some have already expressed discomfort with the changes proposed for Medicaid, though they broadly favor work requirements and don\u2019t count them as \u201ccuts.\u201d",
      "President Donald Trump has similarly said he doesn't want to cut Medicaid, yet he championed the House legislation. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee released a digital ad last week describing the GOP Medicaid policies as \u201cdevastating.\u201d",
      "Americans favor work requirements, but the support is soft",
      "A recent national survey by KFF, a nonpartisan health research group, highlights the nuances of the issue.",
      "Overall, the poll found that 62% of U.S. adults support new legislation \u201crequiring nearly all adults to work or be looking for work in order to get health insurance through Medicaid\u201d \u2014 including 6 in 10 independents.",
      "But the KFF poll found the support to be soft. It plummets to 32% when respondents hear the argument that most Medicaid recipients are already working or are unable to work. When respondents hear the argument that such new rules would raise administrative costs without significantly affecting the share of Medicaid recipients who are working, support drops to 40%.",
      "There are other headwinds for Republicans.",
      "Overall, the KFF poll found that Medicaid funding cuts are unpopular: 82% of respondents said they wanted Medicaid spending to increase or stay about the same, while just 17% said they want it to decrease. Even among Republican respondents, just 33% said Medicaid spending should be reduced.",
      "The survey found that 3 in 4 U.S. adults said the legislation was about reducing government spending, while just one-fourth of them said it was about improving how Medicaid works.",
      "Still, the GOP focus has tripped up at least one Democratic candidate. Manny Rutinel, who is eying the seat of freshman Rep. Gabe Evans, R-Colo., declined three times in an interview on NBC affiliate KUSA of Denver to say whether he favors work requirements for able-bodied adults.",
      "\u201cIt was painful to watch,\u201d said a national Democratic strategist, who spoke candidly on condition of anonymity.",
      "The strategist said the onus is on Democrats to elevate the voices of regular people in their districts who would be harmed by the new rules and to make the case that \u201cpeople who need Medicaid are going to lose it because of what Republicans are doing.\u201d",
      "As top Democrats echo their successful message from the 2018 election cycle, whereas Republicans tried to repeal the Affordable Care Act and enacted the Trump tax cuts, some in the party warn that the dynamics are different this time.",
      "The Republican \u201cmessage today is about requiring able-bodied Americans to work, preventing fraud and ensuring noncitizens are not covered,\u201d said Ashley Schapitl, a former Democratic Senate communications aide. \u201cWhile Medicaid cuts poll horribly, these individual policies poll well. Democrats can still win the argument, but members need a sharp message and discipline around the issues of work requirements and immigration, not to feel complacent around rerunning the exact 2017 playbook.\u201d",
      "House Majority Forward, a political group focused on electing Democrats, launched a six-figure ad campaign Wednesday in 26 Republican-held districts, accusing those lawmakers of voting to raise prices for ordinary people through Medicaid cuts.",
      "An ad running in Pennsylvania\u2019s 8th District says freshman GOP Rep. Rob Bresnahan \u201cjust cast the deciding vote to raise the cost of your groceries and cut your health care including Medicaid \u2014 to pay for tax cuts for the ultra-rich.\u201d A similar script is used against other incumbents, all of whom were pivotal in the 215-214 vote to pass the legislation last week and send it to the Senate.",
      "Republicans, notably, are focusing a new ad campaign of their own on touting the bill's tax cuts, not its spending cuts.",
      "The NRCC announced new ads Friday targeting 25 Democratic incumbents in competitive districts, saying they voted \u201cfor the largest U.S. tax hike in generations\u201d by opposing the bill that extends the expiring 2017 Trump tax cuts. The ad obliquely refers to citizenship verification for benefits, saying that under the status quo, \u201cillegals get freebies, you get the bill.\u201d",
      "The ad doesn\u2019t mention Medicaid."

      "Israel captured the West Bank, along with the Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem, in the 1967 Mideast war and the Palestinians want all three territories for their future state. Most of the international community views settlements as illegal and an obstacle to resolving the decades-old conflict.",

      "He added it was also \u201ca strategic move that prevents the establishment of a Palestinian state that would endanger Israel.\u201d",
      "Israel has already built well over 100 settlements across the territory that are home to some 500,000 settlers. The settlements range from small hilltop outposts to fully developed communities with apartment blocks, shopping malls, factories and public parks.",
      "The West Bank is home to 3 million Palestinians, who live under Israeli military rule with the Western-backed Palestinian Authority administering population centers. The settlers have Israeli citizenship.",
      "Israel has accelerated settlement construction in recent years \u2014 long before Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023, attack ignited the war in Gaza \u2014 confining Palestinians to smaller and smaller areas of the West Bank and making the prospect of establishing a viable, independent state even more remote.",
      "During his first term, President Donald Trump\u2019s administration broke with decades of U.S. foreign policy by supporting Israel\u2019s claims to territory seized by force and taking steps to legitimize the settlements. Former President Joe Biden, like most of his predecessors, opposed the settlements but applied little pressure to Israel to curb their growth."

      "A federal judge in New Jersey ruled Wednesday that the Trump administration's effort to deport pro-Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil on foreign policy grounds is most likely unconstitutional but stopped short of releasing him from detainment.",
      "In a lengthy order, U.S. District Judge Michael Farbiarz said Khalil was \"likely to succeed\" in his claim that the administration\u2019s determination that he is a threat to U.S. foreign policy is \"unconstitutionally vague.\"",
      "Farbiarz said the rarely used provision in immigration law the government cited for Khalil's detention was \"unconstitutional as applied\" to Khalil and added that Secretary of State Marco Rubio did not \"affirmatively determine\" that Khalil's conduct had any impact on U.S. relations with another country.",
      "Farbiarz said deporting Khalil under the provision would be \u201cunprecedented.\u201d",
      "Khalil\u2019s legal team said in a statement, \u201cThe district court held what we already knew: Secretary Rubio\u2019s weaponization of immigration law to punish Mahmoud and others like him is likely unconstitutional.\u201d",
      "They added that his continued detention is an \u201caffront to justice\u201d and vowed to continue fighting for his freedom.",
      "The Justice and State departments did not immediately respond to requests for comment Wednesday night.",
      "The ruling is the first time a federal judge has weighed in on the constitutionality of the Trump administration's use of the immigration provision.",
      "Farbiarz ordered Khalil's legal team to submit additional information while he considers its request to release Khalil and block the administration from invoking the law against other noncitizens who have spoken out in support of Gaza or were critical of Israel while the case proceeds.",
      "Still, Farbiarz said, Khalil's attorneys have not made a \"substantial argument\" against the government's allegations that Khalil withheld information from his permanent residency application. Farbiarz said his attorneys are permitted to address the issue in subsequent filings.",
      "Khalil, who is a permanent U.S. resident, was arrested at his Columbia University apartment in March as part of President Donald Trump\u2019s crackdown on foreign students who his administration alleges are a threat to U.S. foreign policy.",
      "After he was arrested in New York, Khalil was transported briefly to a facility in New Jersey and then transferred to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Jena, Louisiana, where he is currently held.",
      "Assistant Homeland Security Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement Wednesday night: \"It is a privilege to be granted a visa to live and study in the United States of America. When you advocate for violence and terrorism that privilege should be revoked, and you should no longer be in this country.\"",
      "Khalil\u2019s attorneys have submitted evidence rebuking allegations of antisemitism, and they denied he ever provided support to Hamas or any other terrorist organization.",
      "Multiple federal judges in recent weeks have ordered the government to release other pro-Palestinian activists, including Mohsen Mahdawi, R\u00fcmeysa \u00d6zt\u00fcrk and Badar Khan Suri, from immigration detention while they fight the administration's efforts to deport them."

    "story": [
      "BOSTON \u2014 Harvard University will relinquish 175-year-old photographs believed to be the earliest taken of enslaved people to a South Carolina museum devoted to African American history as part of a settlement with a woman who says she is one of the subjects\u2019 descendants.",
      "The photos of the subjects identified by Tamara Lanier as her great-great-great-grandfather Renty, whom she calls \u201cPapa Renty,\u201d and his daughter Delia will be transferred from the Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology to the International African American Museum in Charleston, South Carolina, the state where they were enslaved in 1850 when the photos were taken, a lawyer for Lanier said Wednesday.",
      "The settlement marks the end of a 15-year battle between Lanier and the university to release the 19th-century daguerreotypes, a precursor to modern-day photographs. Lanier\u2019s attorney Joshua Koskoff told The Associated Press that the resolution is an \u201cunprecedented\u201d victory for descendants of those enslaved in the U.S. and praised his client\u2019s yearslong determination in pursuing justice for the people she had identified as her ancestors.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s one of one in American history, because of the combination of unlikely features: to have a case that dates back 175 years, to win control over images dating back that long of enslaved people \u2014 that\u2019s never happened before,\u201d Koskoff said.",
      "A key question of the case was whether Harvard could legally be allowed to continue owning dehumanizing images of enslaved people who couldn\u2019t consent to taking part. The Massachusetts court system ultimately sided with Harvard on the question of ownership, but allowed Lanier to continue to pursue emotional damages from the institution.",
      "Harvard said Wednesday that it had long been working to relinquish ownership of the images \u201cto put them in the appropriate context and increase access to them for all Americans.\u201d",
      "Negotiations between Harvard and Lanier lawyers resulted in a settlement that included the removal of the images from Harvard\u2019s ownership.",
      "On Wednesday, Lanier stood holding a portrait of Papa Renty while arm-in-arm with Susanna Moore, the great-great-great-granddaughter of Harvard biologist Louis Agassiz, who commissioned the images on behalf of the university and whose theories on racial difference were once used to support slavery in the U.S. Both great-great-great grandaughters \u2014 one of enslaved people and another of a man who exploited them \u2014 praised the resolution.",
      "\u201cThis is a moment in history where the sons and daughters of stolen ancestors can stand with pride and rightfully proclaim a victory for reparations,\u201d Lanier said. \u201cThis pilfered property, images taken without dignity or consent and used to promote a racist psychoscience will now be repatriated to a home where their stories can be told and their humanity can be restored.\u201d",
      "Moore called the images captured by her ancestor, Agassiz, a \u201cdeeply racist project.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis victory reminds us that the meaning of such objects in museums can and should change,\u201d she said. \u201cThis woman standing next to me, she knew all along she was not small and she was not alone.\u201d",
      "A question of ownership",
      "In 2019, Lanier sued Harvard, alleging the images were taken \u201cwithout Renty\u2019s and Delia\u2019s consent and therefore unlawfully retained.\u201d The suit attacked Harvard for its \u201cexploitation\u201d of Renty\u2019s image at a 2017 conference and in other uses. It said Harvard has capitalized on the images by demanding a \u201chefty\u201d licensing fee to reproduce them.",
      "Agassiz came across Renty and Delia while touring plantations in search of racially \u201cpure\u201d enslaved individuals born in Africa, according to Lanier\u2019s suit. To create the images, both Renty and Delia were posed shirtless and photographed from several angles.",
      "\u201cTo Agassiz, Renty and Delia were nothing more than research specimens,\u201d the suit said. \u201cThe violence of compelling them to participate in a degrading exercise designed to prove their own subhuman status would not have occurred to him, let alone mattered.\u201d",
      "In 2021, a Massachusetts court ruled that photos are the property of the photographer, not the subject \u2014 a stance affirmed by the Massachusetts Supreme Court.",
      "However, while Harvard sought to have the case dismissed, the state high court allowed the case to proceed on Lanier\u2019s claim to emotional distress damages.",
      "The state\u2019s highest court recognized \u201cHarvard\u2019s complicity in the horrific actions surrounding the creation of the daguerreotypes,\u201d saying that \u201cHarvard\u2019s present obligations cannot be divorced from its past abuses.\u201d",
      "In a statement, Harvard said it had \u201clong been eager to place the Zealy Daguerreotypes with another museum or other public institution.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis settlement now allows us to move forward towards that goal,\u201d the university said. \u201cWhile we are grateful to Ms. Lanier for sparking important conversations about these images, this was a complex situation, particularly since Harvard has not confirmed that Ms. Lanier was related to the individuals in the daguerreotypes.\u201d",
      "A new home for Renty and Delia",
      "Tonya M. Matthews, the CEO of the International African American Museum, called Harvard\u2019s relinquishing of the images a moment \u201c175 years in the making.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe bravery, tenacity, and grace shown by Ms. Lanier throughout the long and arduous process of returning these critical pieces of Renty and Delia\u2019s story to South Carolina is a model for us all,\u201d she said in a statement.",
      "The South Carolina museum has committed to working with Lanier and including her in decisions about how the story of the images will be told.",
      "In Lanier\u2019s lawsuit, she asked for Harvard to acknowledge its complicity in slavery, listen to Lanier\u2019s oral family history and pay an unspecified sum in damages. An undisclosed financial settlement was part of the resolution with Harvard announced Wednesday, but Koskoff said Harvard still hasn\u2019t publicly acknowledged Lanier\u2019s connection to them or its connection to perpetuating slavery in the U.S., Koskoff said.",
      "\u201cThat is just left unanswered by Harvard,\u201d he said. Koskoff said he wants to be clear that Lanier and his team \u201cfirmly support\u201d Harvard\u2019s current fight against the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump as the White House moves to cut billions in federal aid and block the enrollment of international students, accusing the institution of being a hotbed of liberalism and antisemitism.",
      "\u201cWe are not here today to bash Harvard... but that doesn\u2019t mean that they are perfect, and that doesn\u2019t mean that they don\u2019t have the obligation to tell a full history, even one that sheds poorly on their own veritas,\u201d he said.",
      "He said Lanier isn\u2019t expecting or waiting to hear from the institution, but that the settlement speaks for itself.",
      "\u201cIn the end, the truth will find you \u2014 you can, you can only hide from it for so long,\u201d he said. \u201cYes, history is written by the winners. But over time, you know, those winners look like losers sometimes.\u201d"

In 2021, it won 22 games during a Covid-shortened season, the fourth-worst record in the NBA and the franchise\u2019s fewest victories since it moved from Seattle to Oklahoma in 2008.

      "One day after the trade, the Thunder made a far more under-the-radar roster decision by signing an undrafted Arizona State wing named Lu Dort, who has since become a perennial all-defense candidate while underpinning what has become the NBA's best defense during both the regular season and the postseason.",

      "After being convicted of wire fraud, conspiracy to commit bank fraud and conspiracy to defraud the United States in 2022, the \u201cChrisley Knows Best\u201d stars were released from their respective prisons on May 28. Both were heading back to their home in Nashville, Tennessee, Wednesday night.",
      "A judge originally sentenced the couple to a combined 19 years in prison. Though their sentences have been shortened and revised over the past two years, the couple's Wednesday release comes years earlier than expected.",
      "One day prior, on May 27, President Donald Trump revealed on social media that he planned to pardon the couple.",

      "\u201cChrisley Knows Best,\u201d which aired on USA Network (owned by NBCUniversal), followed the wealthy life of millionaire real estate mogul Todd Chrisley, his wife and their five children.",

      "Why were Todd and Julie Chrisley in prison?",
      "In 2019, Todd and Julie Chrisley were indicted by a federal grand jury in Atlanta, Georgia, for 12 counts of wire fraud, conspiracy to commit bank fraud and conspiracy to defraud the United States, according to NBC News.",
      "In 2022, the couple was found guilty of federal fraud charges and hiding their wealth from tax authorities. Months later, Todd Chrisley was sentenced to serve 12 years at Federal Prison Camp Pensacola, Florida, while Julie Chrisley was given a seven-year sentence at the Federal Medical Center Lexington in Kentucky.",
      "The couple's accountant, Peter Tarantino, was also found guilty of tax fraud for filing false corporate tax returns on their behalf. He is currently serving a three-year prison sentence.",
      "The couple reported to their respective prisons in January 2023. After serving for nine months, their prison sentences were reduced, per the Federal Bureau of Prisons.",
      "As of September 2023, Todd Chrisley was set to be released on Jan. 22, 2033, two years less than his original sentence. Julie Chrisley's sentence was reduced by 14 months, changing her release date to Oct. 19. 2028.",
      "Julie Chrisley's sentence was entirely thrown out in June 2024, when judges in the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the judge from the original trial miscalculated her prison term.This vacated her sentence, prompting a lower court to resentence the reality television star.",
      "During the resentencing hearing in September 2024, a judge subsequently declined to reduce Julie Chrisley's prison sentence. Instead, she was resentenced to 84 months (seven years) in prison and five years of supervised release. She was thus expected to be released on April 22, 2028 prior to the pardon."

    "story": [
      "Well, it's official. The cast of \"Survivor 50: In the Hands of the Fans\" has been announced and features a wealth of familiar faces.",
      "In celebration of half of decade of outwitting, outplaying and outlasting on a desolate island, \"Survivor\" Season 50's castaways are all former contestants.",
      "One competitor who will be returning has gained particular fame since his time on the island, after penning HBO's hit show \"The White Lotus.\" That's right, Mike White is back to compete again.",
      "In honor of the writer's return to an island that won't be nearly as luxurious as his \"White Lotus\" sets, let's take a walk down memory lane and reflect on his first run on \"Survivor.\"",
      "When was Mike White on 'Survivor?'",
      "White originally competed on \"Survivor\" Season 37, \"David vs. Goliath,\" which aired in the fall of 2018.",
      "Inspired by the Biblical story, Season 37 split castaways into two tribes: the \u201cDavids,\" or underdogs, and \u201cGoliaths,\" or people perceived as successful in society. White started out in the Goliath tribe due to his success as a screenwriter, known for Hollywood hits like \"School of Rock\" and \"Chuck & Buck.\"",
      "Two of his fellow Season 37 castaways will also be returning for Season 50: Christian Hubicki and Angelina Keeley. White, who likes to cameo fellow islanders from \"Survivor\" on \"The White Lotus,\" has already given both of them screen time.",
      "What happened when Mike White was on 'Survivor'?",
      "White had multiple memorable moments during his season, often bringing the comedic relief. He famously called a tree a \"b----\" while drunk on red wine after winning it as a reward. He also said he regretted not bringing his sleep mask to the island.",
      "Besides his relatable lines, White was a stellar competitor, proving his love for the game through strong social moves. After initially aiming to appear non-threatening, toward the end of the season, he went on the offensive, organizing multiple blindsides, including the eliminations of Davie Rickenbacker, Gabby Pascuzzi and Hubicki.",
      "White then had to compete in a fire-making challenge to make it to the final three. He successfully beat Kara Kay, winning a spot in the finale, alongside original David tribe member Nick Wilson and fellow Goliath Keeley.",
      "During the Final Tribal Council, White made his case for winning, claiming he purposefully tried to appear weak at the beginning before attacking at the end, while maintaining a strong social game throughout.",
      "However, he did not win Season 37. Wilson won with seven votes, and White came in second after receiving three.",
      "What has Mike White said about his time on 'Survivor'?",
      "Fans of White shouldn't be shocked by his return. After all, he's never been shy about his love for the game, even shouting out the show in one of his Emmy acceptance speeches in 2022.",
      "\u201cI just want to say, I was on 'Survivor,' and on 'Survivor,' the way to stay in the game is you lower your threat level,\u201d he said while accepting the Emmy for writing for a limited or anthology series or movie. \u201cNow, I feel like I\u2019ve raised my threat level. I just want to stay in the game. Awards are great. I love writing. I love doing what I do. Don\u2019t come for me. Don\u2019t vote me off the island, please!\u201d",
      "In 2018, he told IndieWire that he actually begged the \"Survivor\" producers for years for a chance to be on the show.",
      "\"The truth is I was a 'Survivor' fanatic from the beginning,\" he said at the time. \"'The Amazing Race' always looked more fun to me, you\u2019re traveling. 'Survivor,' in a way, is a more fun show to watch, but it looked like it would be more hellish to do. However, after watching around 35 seasons, my philosophy is, don\u2019t just be a spectator \u2014 be a participant. It took a while for me to convince them. But I was down to do it for years.\"",
      "After coming in second, White told Entertainment Weekly that he was \"happy\" with his results. He said that he \"did want to win\" and he \"played to win,\" but during the finale, he realized others may have had better reasons for winning and believed \"it all worked out for the best.\""

      "In her new memoir, \u201cMaybe This Will Save Me,\u201d the actor, 33, recalled how the relationship started. Flynn, one night, hosted the cast of the Netflix show at his place. While others were \u201ccasually drinking,\u201d Dorfman said she opted to smoke a cigarette on the balcony.",
      "\u201cWithin a few puffs, I looked over to find that Brandon had joined me,\u201d Dorfman wrote. \u201cHis boyish tipsy charm was intoxicating, he carried confidence with ease, and his blue eyes sparkled, perhaps this is what people meant when they said star quality. Whatever it was, Brandon embodied it.\u201d",
      "Dorfman then described feeling an \u201cundeniable charge between us when we locked eyes.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe held each other\u2019s gaze for what felt like forever, and next thing I knew, we were up in his bedroom, ripping each other\u2019s clothes off,\u201d she continued. \u201cIt was lusty and fun in the most beautiful, magical of ways.\u201d",
      "The co-stars \u201cenjoyed a short lived romance\u201d over the course of a \u201cfew days,\u201d Dorfman wrote, explaining that Flynn \u201cwas open to something more serious.\u201d",
      "\"...I couldn't offer anything more than casual fun so eventually, he called it off,\" Dorfman wrote.",
      "Though noting the breakup was \u201cfor the best,\u201d as she \u201cneeded to focus on my work,\u201d Flynn soon after began dating their fellow co-star, Miles Heizer. At this point, Dorfman admitted she wondered at the time if she \u201cmade a terrible mistake.\u201d",
      "\u201cSeeing Miles and Brandon so in love sparked an unexpected jealousy in me, a yearning for that excitement and fire, perhaps even more serious feelings lingered for Brandon at that time, but I couldn\u2019t do anything about it,\u201d she wrote. \u201cMy bed was made, and I needed to focus on the task at hand: memorizing my lines.\u201d",
      "Flynn's reps did not immediately responded to TODAY.com's request for comment.",
      "Up until the release of the actor's new memoir, which was published May 27, neither Dorfman nor Flynn had confirmed romantic involvement. In 2017, Heizer's rep denied dating rumors between him and Flynn to Page Six.",
      "\u201c13 Reasons Why\u201d aired for four seasons from 2017 to 2020. Dorfman played the role of Ryan Shaver, while Flynn played Justin Foley and Heizer starred as Alex Standall.",
      "Dorfman came out as transgender in a 2021 interview with Time and kept her first name.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m named after my mom\u2019s brother who passed a month after I was born, and I feel very connected to that name, to an uncle who held me as he was dying. This is an evolution of Tommy. I\u2019m becoming more Tommy,\u201d she said."

The F1 Academy aims to highlight women in racing and give them the chance to advance to higher levels of motorsport with the ultimate goal of getting a woman on the F1 grid.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s something that doesn\u2019t happen overnight,\u201d F1 Academy driver Abbi Pulling previously told TODAY.com. \u201cBut we\u2019re seeing more young girls get into go-karting.\u201d",

They\u2019re already established racing drivers. Whereas we\u2019re on that journey, we\u2019re on that progression path, and we\u2019re fighting to prove why we deserve to move up the ladder, one step closer to Formula 1.\u201d",
      "But just like \u201cDrive to Survive,\u201d the drivers\u2019 personal lives are explored throughout the docuseries. Bianca Bustamante, another Academy driver featured in the show, tells TODAY.com that this aspect was challenging at times.",

      "She says she knows there are some people who will \u201cnever change their viewpoint\u201d on believing women are inferior in racing. But since the Academy\u2019s inception, she thinks a lot of people are starting to see and believe in women\u2019s potential in motorsport.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s quite intimidating in that aspect, as it\u2019s a lot, but I think it will only help in showing breaking that stigma and seeing the work we\u2019re putting in off the track,\u201d she adds.",
      "Bustamante hopes that the series \u201cresonates\u201d with fans.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a few of us featured in the storyline, all different drivers with all different histories and trajectories and all in different stages of our lives,\u201d she says. \u201cSo I hope (viewers) find someone they resonate with \u2014 whether it be a hero story of them coming from this or that, experiencing the same issues in life \u2014 and they take away a lesson of some sort from our experiences. And not just that, but to also champion the next generation.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s always about passing the torch a little bit brighter, to give them a bit more insight,\u201d she adds, noting that they are all still rookies trying to make a name for themselves."

      "French courts convicted Le Scouarnec, 74, of sexually assaulting 299 victims over three decades, most of them girls and boys whose average age was 11. Many were assaulted while they were under the effects of anesthesia or recovering from surgery, prosecutors said.",
      "Himself a father of three, Le Scouarnec confessed to committing \u201chideous acts\u201d during the trial in the northwestern town of Vannes in the region of Brittany, where he admitted to all of the charges.",
      "\u201cI am not asking the court for leniency,\u201d Le Scouarnec said in his closing statement, adding, \u201cSimply grant me the right to become a better person.\u201d",
      "His sentence will run concurrently with the 15 years he is serving after he was found guilty in 2020 of raping a young neighbor and three others when they were children.",
      "The court said Le Scouarnec's sentence cannot be adjusted until he has served two-thirds of it, in order to prevent recidivism, according to the French newspaper Le Monde. The judges also followed the public prosecutor\u2019s recommendations about the sentence.",
      "After lawyers for some of the victims complained that he could be released by 2030 if his pretrial detention and parole eligibility were taken into account, the prosecution made a rare request that he be held in a treatment center under supervision even after his release. It was not clear whether the court granted the request.",
      "Hundreds of witnesses testified at the trial, including Le Scouarnec\u2019s niece and a family friend. Now in their 40s, both said he assaulted them in the early 1980s. However, French law did not allow him to be prosecuted for their alleged abuse because it happened too long ago.",
      "Many victims have said they do not remember being assaulted, but police were able to build a case against Le Scouarnec because he meticulously cataloged his abuse in digital diaries.",
      "In France it is illegal for an adult to have sex with a minor under age 15, though child advocates say many adults are never charged.",
      "The case has put a spotlight on the French medical system, which allowed Le Scouarnec, a once-respected local doctor, to continue working despite many warning signs, including a 2005 conviction for possessing images depicting child abuse.",
      "Lawyers for some of the victims said Le Scouarnec should have been stripped of his medical privileges after that case. Instead, he worked across nine public hospitals and private clinics in five regions of France, where he specialized in appendectomies, abdominal and gynecological surgery.",
      "Victims\u2019 advocates also hope the case will prompt a hard look at what they call the lax pursuit of child abuse allegations, particularly when doctors \u2014 who are in short supply in many areas \u2014 are accused of misconduct.",
      "\u201cThere were warnings over 30 years,\u201d Francesca Satta, a lawyer who represented 10 victims and families, said previously, adding, \u201cThis man benefited from a system that opened the door for him to have his own hunting ground.\u201d",
      "During the trial, many victims watched the proceedings through a video link in a 450-seat auditorium, a short walk from the courthouse, which was too small to cope with the number of people who wanted to watch the case unfold. Two other transmission rooms in a former law school broadcast the trial to the media and spectators."

      "Those were the desperate scenes that marked the first turbulent week of a new U.S. and Israel-backed plan for aid distribution in the enclave.",
      "The United Nations World Food Programme said in a statement Wednesday that \u201chordes of hungry people\u201d broke into its Al-Ghafari warehouse in central Gaza's Deir al-Balah attempting to get a hold of supplies being prepared for distribution.",
      "The UNWFP cited \"initial reports\" that at least two people were killed and several more injured in the incident. NBC News was not immediately able to independently verify those details.",
      "An Israeli military spokesperson said they were not aware of their forces being connected to the reported deaths, or of any shots being fired by troops.",
      "Those reported deaths came after chaotic events Tuesday, when thousands of hungry Palestinians flooded a controversial new aid distribution center set up by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation \u2014 or GHF \u2014 which is tasked with distributing supplies in the U.S. and Israel-backed plan that came into effect Monday.",
      "In that case, Israeli soldiers fired live rounds into the air to disperse crowds, with the GHF seeking to quell concerns over its rocky first week of operations in a news release Wednesday.",
      "The GHF rejected the claims of Gaza's Hamas-run government media office, that three Palestinians were killed, 46 others injured and seven people missing after the incident. The foundation said that no one was killed while trying to access their distribution site.",
      "NBC News was not immediately able to verify the facts on the ground.",
      "GHF was tasked with distributing aid in Gaza after Israel earlier this month lifted an almost three-month-long blockade barring the entry of food, medicine and other vital supplies following warnings of rising starvation in the enclave.",
      "Under the plan, aid will be distributed from at least four distribution points in southern Gaza, with the aim of expanding with additional sites. GHF took over aid distribution after Israel lifted a more than two-month blockade barring the entry of food, medicine and other vital supplies into the enclave earlier this month.",
      "The United Nations, which has refused to participate in the plan, has condemned the initiative as a \u201cdistraction\u201d that undermines a longstanding humanitarian framework in Gaza. The U.N. says the effort poses a threat to the independence of aid operations, while simultaneously displacing Palestinians en-masse to Gaza's south.",
      "Israel has maintained that a new aid distribution system was necessary, alleging that Hamas was diverting supplies. The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) and other humanitarian groups have told NBC News they have not seen evidence of aid being diverted to Hamas or other armed groups during the war.",
      "Israel has long been deeply critical of the United Nations and its work in the Gaza Strip and the broader Palestinian territories."

      "Israel captured the West Bank, along with the Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem, in the 1967 Mideast war and the Palestinians want all three territories for their future state. Most of the international community views settlements as illegal and an obstacle to resolving the decades-old conflict.",
      "Defense Minister Israel Katz said the settlement decision \u201cstrengthens our hold on Judea and Samaria,\u201d using the biblical term for the West Bank, \u201canchors our historical right in the Land of Israel, and constitutes a crushing response to Palestinian terrorism.\u201d",
      "He added it was also \u201ca strategic move that prevents the establishment of a Palestinian state that would endanger Israel.\u201d",
      "Israel has already built well over 100 settlements across the territory that are home to some 500,000 settlers. The settlements range from small hilltop outposts to fully developed communities with apartment blocks, shopping malls, factories and public parks.",
      "The West Bank is home to 3 million Palestinians, who live under Israeli military rule with the Western-backed Palestinian Authority administering population centers. The settlers have Israeli citizenship.",
      "Israel has accelerated settlement construction in recent years \u2014 long before Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023, attack ignited the war in Gaza \u2014 confining Palestinians to smaller and smaller areas of the West Bank and making the prospect of establishing a viable, independent state even more remote.",
      "During his first term, President Donald Trump\u2019s administration broke with decades of U.S. foreign policy by supporting Israel\u2019s claims to territory seized by force and taking steps to legitimize the settlements. Former President Joe Biden, like most of his predecessors, opposed the settlements but applied little pressure to Israel to curb their growth."

      "LIVERPOOL, England \u2014 Images of a car plowing into a large crowd of soccer fans celebrating their team's English Premier League title win had barely made it to national newscasts when notorious right-wing voices started to call the incident a \"suspected terrorist attack\" on social media.",
      "The X account of Tommy Robinson, a convicted fraudster who is well known as the leader of the English far right, retweeted video of the vehicle knocking down people dressed in Liverpool Football Club\u2019s ketchup-red strip, writing that it looked \"very intentional.\" (The posts were labeled \"admin,\" a probable reference to the fact that Robinson did not write them himself since he was in prison at the time.)",

      "For many, it was a sign of lessons learned after the 2024 Southport stabbing attack, in which the same police force was pilloried for not sharing enough information soon enough and allowing rumors to run rampant. In this vacuum, speculation turned into calls for action, which soon bloomed into racist riots that rocked Britain in the aftermath of the deadly assault that killed three young girls, with more injured.",
      "In Southport, violent riots erupted last summer after false information shared on social media claimed the suspect in the stabbings was a radical Islamist migrant. Police were accused of failing to share accurate information on the suspect quickly enough, allowing rumors to circulate unchallenged.",

      "\u201cI think that was to dampen down some of the speculation from the far-right that sort of continues on X even as we speak,\u201d he said, adding that it appeared to be a lesson learned as a direct result of what happened after the Southport attack.",
      "In that case, he noted rumors swelled of the suspect being \u201can asylum seeker who arrived on a boat and it was a Muslim extremist \u2014 and that wasn\u2019t the case.\u201d",

In that case too, Europe\u2019s far right was quick to tap into fears around the deadly attack.",

      "\"Many Canadians are feeling anxious and worried about the drastically changing world around them. Fundamental change is always unsettling,\" he said in the speech, switching between English and French.",
      "The country faces another \"critical moment,\" he said.",
      "\"Democracy, pluralism, the rule of law, self-determination and freedom are values that Canadians hold dear and one which the government is determined to protect,\" Charles said. \"The system of open global trade that, while not perfect, has helped to deliver prosperity for Canadians for decades, is changing. Canada\u2019s relationships with partners is also changing.\"",
      "Charles said Carney and Trump \"have begun defining a new economic and security relationship,\u201d adding that it was \"rooted in mutual respect and founded on common interests to deliver transformational benefits for both sovereign nations.\"",
      "Charles, still undergoing cancer treatment, is the nonpartisan head of state in Canada \u2014 a member of the British Commonwealth of former colonies \u2014 but he did not write the speech. Instead, he read what was presented to him by Canada\u2019s government in the country\u2019s capital, Ottawa.",
      "Among them was former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who wore green and orange sneakers with his suit.",
      "\"Every time I come to Canada, a little more of Canada seeps into my bloodstream and from there straight to my heart,\" Charles said. \"I\u2019ve always had the greatest admiration for Canada\u2019s unique identity, which is recognized across the world for bravery and sacrifice in defense of national values and for the diversity and kindness of Canadians.\"",
      "Concluding his speech, Charles praised Canada as a \"force for good\" in the world.",
      "\"As the anthem reminds us: The true north is indeed strong and free,\" he said, earning a round of applause from lawmakers.",
      "Before the speech, Charles was taken to the Senate of Canada Building in a horse-drawn carriage with Queen Camilla. There, he received the Royal Salute from the 100-person guard of honor from the 3rd Battalion, Royal Canadian Regiment before he entered the chamber.",
      "Charles also met Monday with Carney and Mary Simon, Canada's first Indigenous governor general, who is the king\u2019s representative to the country.",
      "Canadians are largely indifferent to the royal family, and it is rare for the monarch to deliver what is known as the Speech from the Throne. The last time was in 1977, when Charles\u2019 mother, Queen Elizabeth II, read it for only the second time in her 70-year reign.",
      "But Carney, who won a party race to become prime minister in March before he secured victory in Canada\u2019s election last month by vowing to stand up Trump, said in a statement Monday that Charles\u2019 visit spoke \u201cto the vitality of our constitutional monarchy and our distinct identity, and to the historic ties that crises only fortify.\u201d",
      "It was a change in tone from earlier this month, when he criticized Britain\u2019s invitation to Trump for a second state visit, saying it undermined his government\u2019s effort to project a united front against Trump\u2019s talk of annexing Canada.",
      "Since he took office in January, Trump has repeatedly said he wants Canada to become the 51st U.S. state, a suggestion that has angered Canadians and left the U.K. trying to tread a fine line between the two North American countries.",
      "Charles has also made a number of symbolic gestures in recent months, wearing Canadian medals, planting a maple tree and referring to himself as the king of Canada.",
      "Even so, Carney this month told British broadcaster Sky News, NBC News\u2019 international partner, that Canadians \u201cweren\u2019t impressed\u201d by Trump\u2019s invitation to the palace.",
      "\u201cIt was at a time when we were being quite clear about the issues around sovereignty,\u201d he said.",

      "Wracked by violence in which thousands of civilians have been slaughtered, aid camps burned to the ground and hundreds of children raped, Africa\u2019s largest war has torn Sudan apart and forced more than 12 million people from their homes.",
      "The cataclysmic battle for supremacy has pitted the Sudanese military, controlled by the country\u2019s top commander, Gen. Abdel-Fattah Burhan, against the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), led by his former deputy, Gen. Mohammed Hamdan Daglo Mousa \u2014 a former camel dealer widely known as Hemedti.",
      "The conflict has created the world\u2019s biggest humanitarian crisis, according to the United Nations, which says at least 24,000 people have been killed, though activists say the number is far higher.",
      "Both sides face war crimes accusations from the United States, which sanctioned the northeast African nation's government for using chemical weapons Thursday \u2014 a claim it denied.",
      "The RSF meanwhile, has denied accusations of ethnic cleansing in the country where \u201csome 30.4 million people \u2014 over two thirds of the total population \u2014 are in need of assistance, from health to food and other forms of humanitarian support,\u201d according to a February report from the United Nations refugee agency.",
      "After the war entered its third year last month, NBC News spoke to three people who have been caught in the crossfire.",
      "\u2018You just have to walk\u2019",
      "Around seven months pregnant with her first child, Abeir Abdelrahman said she was resigned to losing her baby as she fled her home in the Jabra neighborhood in the south of Sudan\u2019s capital, Khartoum, which had been overrun by RSF gunmen in September 2023, five months after the fighting began.",
      "\u201cYou have to walk. Just walk. And you have to walk quickly because at any time bombs and shots are going to be there,\u201d she told NBC News in a telephone interview this month. \u201cAt one point I thought: \u2018It\u2019s OK. You lose the baby, but you will be alive with your family. You\u2019ll be safe with your husband, so God will give it to you again,\u2019\u201d she added.",
      "But as they trekked south, she said they lost contact with her 63-year-old father, who had fallen behind. After four days of frantic backtracking, she said they discovered he had been arrested at an RSF checkpoint and accused of stealing his own belongings.",
      "\u201cWe were all very scared,\u201d she said, adding that they feared he might be shot. \u201cMy mom didn\u2019t eat for a long time,\u201d she said. Around the same time she found out that her brother, who had decided to stay home, had been seriously wounded in a rocket attack, she said.",
      "After 35 days in captivity, Abdelrahman said her father was released. Although he had cholera and malaria, he was relatively unharmed, she said. Her brother survived surgery despite almost losing a leg.",
      "Abdelrahman moved with the rest of her family farther south to Jazirah state, where she gave birth to her daughter, Samiya, now 16 months old.",
      "\u201cEveryone was in tears, my mom, me and dad, just a moment full of joy, and I just felt lucky, and I felt blessed that God helped me and protected her,\u201d said Abdelrahman, who is now teaching English in the eastern city of Kassala.",
      "\u201cSamiya is a girl of the war because she\u2019s strong. And whenever she\u2019s going through things in her life, even when she gets bigger, I\u2019m sure she will overcome them,\u201d she added.",
      "\u2018Guns at my face\u2019",
      "Others like, Amr Ali, 39, did not get the chance to flee.",
      "An IT worker and freelance photographer, he said he spent 10 years in the Netherlands before returning to Sudan in August 2021 with plans to open a photography business and settle down.",
      "Just over two years later, as the fighting neared his home in eastern Khartoum, he said he recorded final messages for his mom and sister with \u201cthe sound of the shooting and the bombing\u201d in the background.",
      "On Oct. 5, 2023, as bullets ripped into his apartment and rockets exploded nearby, he said he hid under his bed. When he emerged, he said eight or nine RSF members had surrounded him and asked if he was a member of the military.",
      "Refusing to believe he was a civilian, Ali said they started \u201cbeating me like crazy.\u201d Accusing him of being in the military, he said they \u201cwere just pointing guns at my face, shooting it next to my ears, next to my feet\u201d and threatening to kill him.",
      "Transferred to a nearby gas station that had been turned into a makeshift prison, he said he was hit with \u201cso many hands, so many punches, so many slaps and the kicking and kicking.\u201d",
      "He said he could smell \u201cweed and alcohol\u201d on the breath of the fighters who hit him with pipes and sticks and threatened to shoot him in mock executions. The beatings only stopped at night after other RSF fighters complained about the screaming because they were trying to sleep, Ali added.",
      "After 10 days, Ali said he was allowed to contact his family who provided evidence that he was a civilian. This, he said, led to a complete change in attitude from his captors, who took him somewhere for a shower and gave him new clothes. Over a large meal, he said an RSF member apologized for his mistreatment.",
      "\u201cI was just confused. We\u2019d gone from beating and \u2018We will kill you\u2019 and \u2018We will destroy you\u2019, to \u2018Sorry, we will take care of you,\u2019\u201d Ali said.",
      "After he was released on Oct. 31, he said he immediately sought medical treatment. His hand had to be re-broken so it could heal properly, he added.",
      "Then he fled Sudan for Egypt, where he is waiting to be resettled by the U.N. Asked whether he accepted the RSF\u2019s apology, he said, \u201cAbsolutely not. They ruined my country.\u201d",
      "\u2018We had to find a way out\u2019",
      "Just across the River Nile in the city of Omdurman, Natasha, a British mother of four, said the \u201cbombing became so bad\u201d they had to leave her home where the army had set up positions on the roof. NBC News agreed not to use her last name because she fears for her safety.",
      "With her husband back in the U.K., she said she moved in with her mother-in-law, Asmaa, 70, and over the course of 18 months watched as law and order broke down and armed gangs roamed the neighborhood \u201cstealing from houses and people were getting killed.\u201d",
      "A 12-year-old friend of her son \u201cwas shot by a sniper,\u201d Natasha, 47, tearfully recalled, adding that the bullet \u201cwent through him and it went through his sister.\u201d",
      "His death was the catalyst in her decision to leave her home, she said, adding that electricity and water had begun to cut out and food had become scarce.",
      "With kidnapping common in Sudan, she said she knew her status as a foreigner with white skin made things \u201cvery, very dangerous\u201d for her, so she donned sunglasses and wrapped herself from head to toe before they made their escape in a rickshaw in September.",
      "\u201cI thought: \u2018OK, I might die on my way out. You know, if I don\u2019t do this I\u2019m going to die. I can\u2019t just sit here like this. One of us is going to get shot.\u2019 So it was just a numb feeling,\u201d Natasha said.",
      "She said that her driver cleared RSF checkpoints without stopping, before dropping her off near a military checkpoint.",
      "As they neared, Natasha said soldiers fired above their heads and she quickly waved a piece of white clothing. The shooting stopped and they were allowed across the checkpoint.",
      "\u201cI just remember when my husband\u2019s mum said to me, \u2018That\u2019s it. It\u2019s over. You can take off your shades,\u2019\u201d Natasha said, starting to cry.",
      "After the military regained control of Omdurman, she said she was planning to move to a nicer part of the city and open another kindergarten.",
      "War crimes and hunger",
      "Sudan\u2019s military said Tuesday it had taken full control of the Greater Khartoum region, but the RSF still controls most of the western region of Darfur and some other areas where battles continue to rage.",
      "The fighting has been marked by atrocities including mass rape and ethnically motivated killings that amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity, especially in Darfur, according to the U.N. and international rights groups. In March the United Nations Children\u2019s Fund reported that armed men have raped hundreds of children, including some as young as 1.",
      "On Thursday, the United States said it would impose sanctions on\u00a0Sudan's government after it determined that Sudan used chemical weapons last year. They will include limits on U.S. exports and government lines of credit, and they will take effect around June 6, State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said in a statement.",
      "Sudan rejected the move and described the allegations as false in a statement.",
      "Nonetheless, 24.6 million people, or around half the population, face acute hunger, according to the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification \u2014 an organization that sets a scale the United Nations and governments use to assess hunger.",
      "\u201cI did my very best not to leave Sudan, but yeah, the situation just wasn\u2019t really helping,\u201d Ali, the photographer, said. \u201cIt\u2019s not getting better. It\u2019s heartbreaking.\u201d"

      "HONG KONG \u2014 The United States will start \u201caggressively\u201d revoking the visas of Chinese students, Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Wednesday, including those with connections to the ruling Chinese Communist Party or studying in critical fields.",
      "The announcement is the latest move in the Trump administration\u2019s campaign against U.S. universities and international students in particular, after it revoked thousands of students\u2019 visas, detained or deported other students over political activism and sought to bar international students from enrolling at Harvard University.",
      "Rubio said in a statement that visa criteria would also be revised to \u201cenhance scrutiny\u201d of all future visa applications from the People\u2019s Republic of China and the Chinese territory of Hong Kong.",
      "\u201cUnder President Trump\u2019s leadership, the U.S. State Department will work with the Department of Homeland Security to aggressively revoke visas for Chinese students,\u201d he said.",
      "China said Friday that the U.S. was \u201cunjustifiably\u201d canceling Chinese student visas \u201cunder the pretext of ideology and national security.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis politically discriminatory move exposes the hypocrisy of America\u2019s long-proclaimed values of freedom and openness, and will only further damage the United States\u2019 international image and credibility,\u201d Mao Ning, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said at a regular briefing in Beijing.",
      "China is the second-biggest source of international students in the United States after India, though numbers have been dropping in recent years amid growing U.S.-China tensions and disruptions from the Covid-19 pandemic.",
      "About 277,000 Chinese students were in the United States in the 2023-24 academic year, down from a peak of more than 370,000 in 2019. By contrast, there were only about 800 Americans studying in China last year, down from a peak of about 15,000 in 2014.",
      "Though Rubio did not specify what he meant by \u201ccritical fields,\u201d both the U.S. and China are concerned about each other\u2019s advancements in strategically sensitive areas such as biotechnology, quantum computing and artificial intelligence.",
      "It is also unclear what Rubio meant by \u201cconnections\u201d to the Chinese Communist Party.",
      "There were more than 99 million members of the Chinese Communist Party as of the end of 2023, or about 7% of China\u2019s 1.4 billion people, official figures showed. The party also runs the Communist Youth League, which has about 74 million members ages 14 to 28, with some overlap between the two groups.",
      "Up to 75% of university students in the Chinese capital, Beijing, which has the most higher education institutions in the country, apply for party membership during their undergraduate years, according to a paper published in 2016.",
      "Another study in 2014 found that the youngest party members are more likely to report self-interest, such as helping their careers, advancing politically and improving social status, as their reasons for joining.",
      "John Burns, an emeritus professor at the University of Hong Kong who specializes in Chinese politics and governance, said the move to revoke visas for Chinese students showed that the U.S. is \u201cparanoid\u201d about the Chinese Communist Party.",
      "However, the American government has \u201cno independent way\u201d of verifying whether a Chinese student is a party member, unless individual students or people they know reveal it, Burns told NBC News in a phone interview on Thursday.",
      "The best students in China\u2019s elite universities are approached by the party and asked to join, Burns said, and it\u2019s \u201cprobably a wise decision on their part\u201d as the CCP is the \u201cnetwork of all networks\u201d to get ahead in China.",
      "\u201cPragmatism is the order of the day,\u201d he said. \u201cChinese people are not more or less pragmatic, I would say, than anyone else.\u201d",
      "Burns said the loss of students from China or other countries would do \u201chuge damage\u201d to the advancement of science and tech in the U.S.",
      "\u201cThey need to be recruiting the best of the best \u2014 wherever they\u2019re from \u2014 not based on some ideological bias,\u201d he said."

      "Video on social media and Swiss TV showed the mudslide near Blatten, in the southern L\u00f6tschental valley, with homes and buildings partially submerged under a mass of brownish sludge. Regional police said a 64-year-old man was reported missing, and search and rescue operations involving a drone with thermal camera were under way.",

      "Swiss glaciologists have repeatedly expressed concerns about a thaw in recent years, attributed in large part to global warming, that has accelerated the retreat of glaciers in Switzerland.",
      "The landlocked Alpine country has the most glaciers of any country in Europe, and saw 4% of its total glacier volume disappear in 2023. That was the second-biggest decline in a single year after a 6% drop in 2022.",
      "In 2023, residents of the village of Brienz, in eastern Switzerland, were evacuated before a huge mass of rock slid down a mountainside, stopping just short of the community. Brienz was evacuated again last year because of the threat of a further rockslide."

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s administration has emerged as a staunch defender of Alternative for Germany, a political party with Nazi echoes that has risen in popularity \u2014 and that German intelligence officials recently classified as a \u201cproven right-wing extremist organization.\u201d",
      "The party is known by its German initialism, AfD, and it has included leaders who have embraced old Nazi slogans and minimized the atrocities of Adolf Hitler and the Holocaust.",
      "Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio have criticized the German government\u2019s efforts to isolate and investigate AfD, arguing that such actions amount to undemocratic persecution of a rival political group.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s one thing to say that a particular set of views is gross ... or somehow outside the Overton window, outside the bounds of reasonable discourse,\u201d Vance said in an interview last week in Rome, where he attended Pope Leo XIV\u2019s inaugural Mass. \u201cI think that it is very, very dangerous to use the neutral institutions of state \u2014 the military, the police forces ... the intel services \u2014 to try to delegitimize another competing political party. I think that\u2019s especially true when that political party just got second in an election and is, depending on which poll you believe, either the [most] popular or the second-most popular party.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, billionaire Elon Musk, a Trump confidant who has wielded significant White House power, has gone further than Vance and Rubio, having campaigned with AfD ahead of elections in February, when the party finished in second place and further established its popularity.",
      "\u201cOnly the AfD can save Germany,\u201d Musk posted on X, his social media site, in December.",
      "The Rubio-led State Department reinforced the Trump administration\u2019s line Tuesday.",
      "In a post on Substack, Samuel Samson, a senior adviser in the department\u2019s Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, wrote that the German government \u201chas established elaborate systems to monitor and censor online speech under the guise of combating disinformation and preventing offense.\u201d",
      "Samson specifically cited the recent decision to label AfD as extremist. He also raised concerns about the treatment of far-right parties and leaders in other European countries, including Marine Le Pen, whose recent embezzlement conviction in France could prevent her from running for president in a 2027 race she had been favored to win.",
      "\u201cAmericans are familiar with these tactics. Indeed, a similar strategy of censorship, demonization, and bureaucratic weaponization was utilized against President Trump and his supporters,\u201d Samson wrote. \u201cWhat this reveals is that the global liberal project is not enabling the flourishing of democracy. Rather, it is trampling democracy, and Western heritage along with it, in the name of a decadent governing class afraid of its own people.\u201d",
      "Samson added that \u201cEurope\u2019s democratic backsliding not only impacts European citizens but increasingly affects American security and economic ties, along with the free speech rights of American citizens and companies.\u201d",
      "\u201cOur hope,\u201d he continued, \u201cis that both Europe and the United States can recommit to our Western heritage, and that European nations will end the weaponization of government against those seeking to defend it.\u201d",
      "Vance emphasized similar themes in a speech in February at the Munich Security Conference, where he chastised German leaders for, among other things, refusing to include AfD in the country\u2019s governing coalition despite its electoral gains. While he was in Germany, Vance met with Friedrich Merz, now the chancellor, and with Alice Weidel, a co-chair of the AfD.",
      "An AfD spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment. The party has long denied the charge that it is an extremist group, and it sued Germany\u2019s Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution over the intelligence agency\u2019s recent classification. A spokesperson for the agency, citing the lawsuit, declined to comment.",
      "During last week\u2019s interview, Vance emphasized that he has not endorsed AfD or encouraged Germans to support it. He described his and Rubio\u2019s advocacy as a matter of democratic principles.",
      "Trump\u2019s first campaign for president in 2016 fed on chants by his supporters to \u201clock her up!\u201d \u2014 a reference to his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, who had not been charged with any crime. More recently, he and his allies accused former President Joe Biden, who beat Trump in his 2020 re-election bid, of weaponizing the Justice Department against Trump and other Republicans.",
      "The Trump administration launched an investigation this month of former FBI Director James Comey, a Trump critic who had shared on social media a photo of seashells arranged to spell out \u201c8647.\u201d",
      "Trump allies interpreted the message as an assassination threat, noting that \u201c86\u201d can be a slang term for getting rid of something and that Trump is the 47th president. Trump\u2019s director of national intelligence, Tulsi Gabbard, has called for Comey to be imprisoned over the post. But the number 86 does not always have violent connotations; it\u2019s use in the hospitality industry can refer to removing or refusing service to a customer.",
      "Asked how his and Rubio\u2019s concerns square with such Trump administration actions and rhetoric, Vance argued that there is a \u201creasonable\u201d question about whether Comey had advocated for Trump\u2019s assassination.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m a pretty big believer in free speech,\u201d Vance said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think that saying you should kill Donald Trump is an acceptable part of public debate. Everybody\u2019s going to draw their line. I think where I draw the line is encouraging violence against political opponents. If there\u2019s a determination that Comey encouraged violence against a political opponent, then that\u2019s a problem. And if there\u2019s a determination that he didn\u2019t, then that\u2019s a different question.\u201d",
      "While Vance has not endorsed AfD, he described a pro-AfD piece Musk wrote in December as \u201cinteresting.\u201d",
      "\u201cAlso interesting; American media slanders AfD as Nazi-lite,\u201d Vance wrote in his Jan. 2 social media post that called attention to Musk\u2019s piece. \u201cBut AfD is most popular in the same areas of Germany that were most resistant to the Nazis.\u201d",
      "AfD was founded in 2013, its early messaging geared toward anti-European Union voters. In subsequent years, the party became known for its strident anti-immigrant rhetoric. In 2017, an AfD ad criticized as Islamophobic asked: \u201cBurkas? We prefer bikinis.\u201d Another, featuring the image of a pregnant woman, asked: \u201cNew Germans? We\u2019ll make them ourselves.\u201d",
      "The party has grown in popularity, coinciding with a rise of right-wing voter sentiment across the United States and Europe. Last year, AfD became the first far-right party to win a state election in Germany since the Nazis.",
      "Meanwhile, links and comparisons between AfD and the Nazis have been inescapable.",
      "At an AfD rally in 2017, attendees chanted that they would \u201cbuild a subway\u201d to Auschwitz for their political opponents. A founding AfD member, Alexander Gauland, once described the Nazi era as a mere \u201cspeck\u201d of bird excrement in German history. A party leader, Bj\u00f6rne H\u00f6cke, has twice been found guilty by a German court of purposefully employing Nazi rhetoric. (He has appealed the rulings.) Another AfD politician, Maximilian Krah, resigned his party leadership post under pressure and suspended campaign activities last year after he said the SS, the Nazis\u2019 main paramilitary force, were \u201cnot all criminals.\u201d",
      "When Musk appeared virtually at an AfD campaign event in January, he leaned into a talking point consistent with the party\u2019s desire to move beyond the guilt over Nazi-era atrocities, lamenting that \u201cthere is too much focus on past guilt.\u201d The same week, Musk faced criticism after he offered a gesture many found similar to a Nazi salute at a Trump rally in Washington.",
      "In its designation of AfD as an extremist organization on May 2, the German intelligence agency asserted that the party \u201caims to exclude certain population groups from equal participation in society.\u201d AfD also does not consider German nationals with histories of migration from Muslim countries as equal to German people, the agency added at the time.",
      "The report drew a quick rebuke from Rubio, who is also Trump\u2019s national security adviser.",
      "\u201cGermany just gave its spy agency new powers to surveil the opposition,\u201d Rubio wrote on X. \u201cThat\u2019s not democracy \u2014 it\u2019s tyranny in disguise.\u201d",
      "Vance then piggybacked on Rubio\u2019s post with a Cold War analogy.",
      "\u201cThe AfD is the most popular party in Germany, and by far the most representative of East Germany. Now the bureaucrats try to destroy it,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe West tore down the Berlin Wall together. And it has been rebuilt \u2014 not by the Soviets or the Russians, but by the German establishment.\u201d",
      "Vance contended in last week\u2019s interview that holding down a rival political party because of its beliefs allows its beliefs to \u201ctake on an almost mystical power\u201d by removing them from the public dialogue.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t like Nazism, and I don\u2019t like people who are sympathetic with Nazis,\u201d Vance said. \u201cBut I think the way to beat back against it is to debate it and defeat it and not believe that you can, kind of, like, bury this thing underground, because you can\u2019t.\u201d"

      "Researchers in Spain say they have found evidence that Neanderthals were capable of creating art \u2014 challenging the idea that art began with the modern humans who succeeded them.",
      "The canvas was a quartz-rich granite pebble that was excavated from a rock shelter in central Spain in 2022, in a layer dating back 42,000 to 43,000 years. Measuring more than 8 inches long, the pebble has curves and indentations that make it resemble a human face.",
      "In the middle of its surface is a single red dot, right where a nose would be, researchers said in a study published Saturday in the journal Archaeological and Anthropological Sciences, adding that it appeared to be a nonutilitarian object rather than a tool.",
      "\u201cFrom the outset we could tell it was peculiar,\u201d said David \u00c1lvarez-Alonso, lead author of the paper.",
      "Analysis showed that the red dot consisted of ocher, a natural earth pigment. The next step was to determine how it got there.",
      "While not visible to the naked eye, the red dot was confirmed by Spanish forensic police to be a fingerprint, leaving \u201cno doubt\u201d that it was applied to the stone intentionally by a finger dipped in ocher, \u00c1lvarez-Alonso, an archaeologist at Complutense University in Madrid, said in an email Tuesday.",
      "The researchers postulate that the Neanderthal, who, based on the fingerprint, was possibly an adult male, perceived the pebble as resembling a face \u2014 a psychological phenomenon known as pareidolia \u2014 and was inspired to complete the depiction, creating \u201cone of the oldest known abstractions of a human face in the prehistoric record.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt would be a clear act of symbolization \u2014 apparently very simple, yet meaningful,\u201d \u00c1lvarez-Alonso said.",
      "The discovery is \u201cdoubly exceptional\u201d since it\u2019s the \u201cmost complete\u201d Neanderthal fingerprint identified to date, apart from a partial one previously found in Germany, the researchers said.",
      "Neanderthals, a distinct species that went extinct around 40,000 years ago, lived alongside early modern humans in Europe, Asia and the Middle East for at least part of their existence. Characterized by a large nose and relatively short and stocky bodies, the species is very closely related to humans, or Homo sapiens.",
      "The remains of Neanderthals do not show clear evidence of lower intelligence than modern humans, some scientists have argued.",
      "The stone is \u201cone of a small but growing number of discoveries that point to the existence of symbolic behavior among Neanderthals,\u201d \u00c1lvarez-Alonso said.",
      "However, it\u2019s \u201cclearly an isolated object, with no known parallels\u201d that can be used for comparison, he added.",
      "\u201cWe should not try to draw direct analogies between the Neanderthal and sapiens worlds,\u201d \u00c1lvarez-Alonso said, as Neanderthals did not create a visual symbolic system as complex and diverse as the one developed by Homo sapiens.",
      "\u201cThis pebble doesn\u2019t solve the mystery, but it offers one more clue suggesting the presence of a complex mind \u2014 one capable of producing symbols,\u201d he said."

      "But Bongiorno said Labor had been working on increasing women\u2019s representation since the party introduced a quota in 1994 that stated 35% of candidates in winnable seats had to be female.",
      "\u201cThe fact that we now have not 50%, but 57% is partly a function of obviously just the size of the swing, but it is also, I think, very deliberate changes that have occurred within the Labor Party over about 30 years from what was a very male-dominated culture and environment,\u201d Bongiorno said.",
      "The odds had been stacked against Walker being elected as her party\u2019s third choice in South Australia, Bongiorno said."
