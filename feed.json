      "Ren\u00e9e Victor, who voiced the no-nonsense, sandal-throwing Abuelita in Disney\u2019s animated hit \u201cCoco\u201d and played the wisecracking Lupita on Showtime\u2019s \u201cWeeds,\u201d has died. She was 86.",
      "Victor\u2019s death was confirmed on Monday by a representative, Julie Smith, who said the actor had lymphoma for several years. She died Friday at her home in Sherman Oaks, California, Smith said, with family by her side.",
      "A post on the Instagram feed of Pixar, which produced \u201cCoco,\u201d said: \u201cWe are heartbroken to hear of the passing of Ren\u00e9e Victor, the voice (of) Abuelita in \u2018Coco\u2019 and an incredible part of the Pixar family. We will always remember you.\u201d",
      "Victor appeared in 22 episodes of \u201cWeeds\u201d as sassy housekeeper Lupita between 2005 and 2012, among many other TV credits including \u201cER,\u201d \u201cMatlock\u201d and \u201cThe Addams Family.\u201d But she was perhaps best known for what she called the chancla-throwing grandmother in \u201cCoco,\u201d the 2017 family-friendly movie that explored death through the journey of a young Mexican boy to the land of the dead.",
      "\u201cI play the part of \u2018Abuelita,\u2019 the chancla throwing grandma that preaches \u2018No Music!\u2019\u201d she wrote on Instagram, looking back several years ago. \u201cEnjoy \u2018Coco\u2019 with your family this Dia de los Muertos and forever more!\u201d",
      "She also looked back at \u201cThe Apostle,\u201d the 1997 movie that Robert Duvall wrote, directed and starred in. \u201cHe took a chance on me with this film,\u201d Victor wrote on Instagram. \u201cThis is where I got my nickname \u2018one take Ren\u00e9e,\u2019\u201d she said, adding laughter emojis. \u201cI had a small role but what a great one!

She moved to Los Angeles in the 1960s, according to biography material provided by her representatives, where she launched her career singing with prominent big band leaders Xavier Cugat and P\u00e9rez Prado. She also taught Latin dancing, including the salsa and tango.",
      "She met her future husband, Ray, during that period, and from 1963 to 1973, they performed together as \u201cRay & Ren\u00e9e,\u201d a variety show took them around the world \u2014 including Australia, where \u201cthey enjoyed particular fame,\u201d the materials said.",
      "In the 1970s, Victor hosted the \u201cPacesetters\u201d public affairs show on KTLA, her representatives said, and by the \u201980s had moved into TV and film work.",

      "When he was first asked to lead the Broadway hit musical \u201cDeath Becomes Her,\u201d director and choreographer Christopher Gattelli loved it, but refused to work on the big, splashy opening number",
      "NEW YORK -- When he was first asked to helm the Broadway hit musical \u201cDeath Becomes Her,\u201d director and choreographer Christopher Gattelli loved it, but refused to work on the big, splashy opening number. It was just too delicious.",
      "\u201cWhen they sent it to me, I was cooking and I burnt dinner because my mind was spinning,\" he says. \"I was, like, \u2018This is a gift. I will never get an opening number like this again.\u2019\u201d",
      "So Gattelli worked out everything else about how to put Robert Zemeckis\u2019 1992 comic cult classic onto a stage and only then turned to the big, brassy song, \u201cFor the Gaze,\u201d a winking valentine to gay men, punning along the way.",
      "\u201cI was able to do the show and then have my full brain on that number because I knew the potential of what it could be,\u201d he says.",
      "What Gattelli crafted is an opening number for the ages, led by Megan Hilty: There are mid-song costume changes, dance breaks, chorus boys hoisting Hilty, spangly jumpsuits and tuxedos, high-kicking Vegas showgirls with feather headdresses, a body double doing somersaults, a rainbow flag of top-hatted dancers, and Hilty doing a Liza Minnelli cameo, all ending with the grand finale of Hilty as Judy Garland's Dorothy from \u201cThe Wizard of Oz,\u201d complete with a little stuffed dog.",
      "\u201cI heard the pocket in that song, and I was like, \u2018I know there\u2019s a giant laugh there. I can hear giant laughs, what\u2019s that giant laugh?'\u201d says Gattelli. \u201cWhat\u2019s the biggest gay reference? Then I literally I just worked backwards.\u201d",
      "That number telegraphs to the audience exactly what to expect for the rest of the night \u2014 a perfectly rehearsed, lushly costumed, silly, self-aware comedy.",
      "\u201cOnce we hit \u2018For the Gaze,\u2019 the audience knows exactly what the show is,\" he says. \"And then I think they\u2019re in for the ride.\u201d",
      "The work on \u201cFor the Gaze\u201d has helped Gattelli see his show earn 10 Tony Award nominations, including one for his Broadway debut as a director and another for his choreography.",
      "The musical is based on the film, which starred Meryl Streep as a self-centered actor and Goldie Hawn as her suffering-in-the-shadows writer friend. Their mutual desperate measures for achieving eternal youth turn comically grotesque. Hilty plays the Streep role, while Jennifer Simard plays the Hawn one.",
      "\u201cIt felt like just the perfect fit for what I do and what I love to do,\" Gattelli says. \"I love comedy and I love to direct comedy and I love to do these big splashy numbers. It felt like everything I\u2019ve been itching to do.\u201d",
      "Gattelli \u2014 who was a dancer in the original \u201cCats\u201d \u2014 has been a mainstay on Broadway of late, able to choreograph such venerable works as \u201cThe King and I\u201d and \u201cMy Fair Lady\u201d but also irreverent musicals as \u201cSpongeBob SquarePants\u201d and the jukebox variety, like \u201cThe Cher Show.\u201d",
      "He made his directing debut off-Broadway in 2011 with \u201cSilence!\u201d a parody musical of \u201cThe Silence of the Lambs,\u201d complete with a chorus of dancing lambs running across the stage.",
      "Lowe Cunningham, lead producer of \u201cDeath Becomes Her,\u201d saw it in Los Angeles and later asked Gattelli about the experience, how he collaborated and his approach to the work. She was impressed by his openness to all ideas and his caring.",
      "\u201cI think first and foremost, his talent is clear and it\u2019s been out there in the world of choreography for a long time. He is innovative, he does things other people aren\u2019t doing, but the other thing is that he\u2019s renowned as being an incredibly kind human being,\u201d she says.",
      "Gattelli, who won a 2012 Tony for choreographing \u201cNewsies the Musical\u201d \u2014 one of his show-stopping moments was dancers sliding on newspapers \u2014 was brought in relatively late to \u201cDeath Becomes Her,\u201d only a year and half before opening on Broadway.",
      "\u201cIt was a great lesson in trusting your instincts,\u201d he says. \u201cThey said, \u2018We want a lush, opulent, sexy, magical sparkling evening.\u2019 And we just started taking big swings.\u201d",
      "It started with \u2014 of all things \u2014 the curtain. The audience filing into the theater is greeted by a purple, royal fabric. \u201cWhen people walk in, they immediately feel like that it\u2019s lush and sexy and mysterious.\u201d",
      "The musical is filled with very funny special effects that are decidedly low-tech. At one point, the two leading ladies are replaced by two men duking it out in dresses and wigs. The audience roars at the deception and Gattelli even advised one of the male combatants not to shave his arm hair.",
      "\u201cThe audience is in on the joke,\u201d he says. \u201cI love that they go on that ride with us. They\u2019re laughing with us. We\u2019re all laughing together and it feels good.\u201d",
      "One scene from the movie needed a lot of planning to make it on stage: The tumble down the elegant mansion stairs by Hilty's character. Hollywood CGI magic would have to be replicated by Broadway ingenuity.",
      "\u201cThe people that know the movie and the fans especially are going to go, \u2018How are they going to do it?\u2019 It was keeping me up at night forever because we tried everything,\u201d says Gattelli.",
      "The creative team \u2014 which also included set designer Derek McLane, lighting designer Justin Townsend and sound designer Peter Hylenski \u2014 decided to make it a dance punctuated by sound effects.",
      "Warren Yang \u2014 an actor with a gymnastics background \u2014 wears Hilty's outfit and a wig as he tumbles slowly, acrobatically and theatrically down the stairs, somersaulting as thunder sounds crash and we hear what seems like bones cracking. (The stairs were made of the rubber Neoprene for safety.)",
      "\u201cThere are very simple techniques that make a big impact,\u201d says Gattelli. \u201cI just went back to it\u2019s a beautiful, lush, gorgeous show, but, at the core, it\u2019s just theatrical magic and stagecraft.\u201d",

      "\u201cLilo & Stich\u201d and \u201cMission: Impossible\u2014The Final Reckoning\u201d dominated the box office charts again after fueling a record-breaking Memorial Day weekend.

      "Disney\u2019s live-action hybrid \u201cLilo & Stitch\u201d took first place again with $63 million from 4,410 locations in North America. It was enough to pass \u201cSinners\u201d to become the second-highest grossing movie of the year with $280.1 million in domestic ticket sales. Globally, its running total is $610.8 million. \u201cSinners,\u201d meanwhile, is still going strong in its seventh weekend with another $5.2 million, bumping it to $267.1 million domestically and $350.1 million globally.",
      "The eighth \u201cMission: Impossible\u201d movie also repeated in second place, with $27.3 million from 3,861 locations. As with \u201cLilo & Stitch,\u201d that's down 57% from its opening. With $122.6 million in domestic tickets sold, it\u2019s performing in line with the two previous installments. But with a reported production budget of $400 million, profitability is a ways off. Internationally, it added $76.1 million (including $25.2 million from China where it just opened), bringing its global total to $353.8 million.",
      "\u201cThis is the year of longterm playability,\u201d said Paul Dergarabedian, Comscore\u2019s senior media analyst. \u201cThe currency of word of mouth and the strong hold is more important than opening weekend dollars.\u201d",
      "Leading the newcomers was Sony\u2019s \u201cKarate Kid: Legends,\u201d with an estimated $21 million from 3,809 locations. The movie brings Jackie Chan and Ralph Macchio together to train a new kid, the kung fu prodigy Li Fong ( Ben Wang ). Chan starred in a 2010 reboot of the 1984 original, while Macchio has found a new generation of fans in the series \u201cCobra Kai,\u201d which just concluded a six-season run.",
      "Reviews might have been mixed, but opening weekend audiences gave the PG-13 rated film a strong A- CinemaScore and 4.5 stars on PostTrak. It also only cost a reported $45 million to produce and has several weeks until a new family-friendly film arrives. \u201cKarate Kid: Legends\u201d opened earlier internationally and has a worldwide total of $47 million.",
      "Fourth place went \u201cFinal Destination: Bloodlines,\u201d which earned $10.8 million in its third weekend. The movie is the highest-grossing in the franchise, not accounting for inflation, with $229.3 million globally.",
      "The weekend\u2019s other big newcomer, \u201cBring Her Back\u201d rounded out the top five with $7.1 million from 2,449 screens. Starring Sally Hawkins as a foster mother with some disturbing plans, the film is the sophomore feature of twin filmmakers Danny and Michael Philippou, who made the 2023 horror breakout \u201cTalk to Me.\u201d It earned a rare-for-horror B+ CinemaScore and is essentially the only new film in the genre until \u201c28 Years Later\u201d opens on June 20.",
      "A new Wes Anderson movie, \u201cThe Phoenician Scheme,\u201d also debuted in New York and Los Angeles this weekend, where it made $270,000. It expands nationwide next weekend.",
      "The summer box office forecast remains promising, though there\u2019s a long way to go to get to the $4 billion target (a pre-pandemic norm that only the \u201cBarbenheimer\u201d summer has surpassed). The month of May is expected to close out with $973 million \u2013 up 75% from May 2024, according to data from Comscore.",

      "VIENNA -- Strauss\u2019 \u201cBlue Danube\u201d waltz has finally made it into space, nearly a half-century after missing a ride on NASA\u2019s twin Voyager spacecraft.",
      "The European Space Agency\u2019s big radio antenna in Spain beamed the waltz into the cosmos Saturday. Operators aimed the dish at Voyager 1, the world\u2019s most distant spacecraft more than 15 billion miles (24 billion kilometers) away. Traveling at the speed of light, the music was expected to overtake Voyager 1 within 23 hours.",
      "The Vienna Symphony Orchestra performed the \u201cBlue Danube\u201d during the space transmission, which actually sent up a version from rehearsal. It's part of the yearlong celebration marking the 200th birthday of Johann Strauss II, who was born in Vienna in 1825. The Strauss space send-off also honors the 50th anniversary of ESA's founding.",
      "Launched in 1977 and now in interstellar space, each of the two Voyagers carries a Golden Record full of music but nothing from the waltz king. His \u201cBlue Danube\u201d holds special meaning for space fans: It's featured in Stanley Kubrick's 1968 sci-fi film \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey.\u201d",

      "\u201cLA is a city that is known by innovation, taking risks in productions and musically,\u201d Hindoyan said in New York, where his wife is currently singing at the Metropolitan Opera. \u201cThe idea is to do new pieces, commissions and modern pieces, something to really have a balance between what is classic and go further as much as we can.\u201d",
      "Hindoyan will conduct two productions in 2026-27 and three in each of the following four seasons, LA Opera President Christopher Koelsch said. Koelsch hopes Hindoyan can lead works with Yoncheva, who has not sung a staged production at the LA Opera.",
      "Like other companies, the LA Opera has struggled with increased costs following the pandemic and scrapped a planned pair of world premieres over finances. Tenor and conductor Pl\u00e1cido Domingo was a key figure in fundraising for the company as general director from 2003-19.",
      "\u201cPart of my job as a music director and the job of any musician is to really take care of the art form as much as we can,\" Hindoyan said, \"not only on stage, not only studying at home (but also) the connection with the community and the connection to the donors.\u201d",
      "Hindoyan was born in Caracas, played violin and is a product of El Sistema, the Venezuelan music education system that was instrumental in the careers of Gustavo Dudamel and Rafael Payare. He was an assistant to Daniel Barenboim at Berlin\u2019s Staatsoper unter den Linden.",
      "\u201cGiven Barenboim's extremely exacting standards, I was impressed that he had that job and held onto that job,\" Koelsch said. \u201cAnd then I saw a performance of 'Tosca' and was kind of immediately struck by the elegance of the baton technique and just the sort of the absolute clarity of what he was conveying.\u201d",
      "Hindoyan has been chief conductor of the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic since the 2021-22 season. He first conducted the LA Opera last November in Gounod\u2019s \u201cRom\u00e9o et Juliette.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a kind of a natural warmth and charisma to him. In my experience, he almost always coaxes the best out of people,\" Koelsch said. \u201cThe 'Rom\u00e9o' run for me was kind of a test run of how those qualities resonated inside our building, how it worked with the orchestra and the chorus and the administration and the audiences.\u201d",

      "Clausen, who also scored TV series including \u201cMoonlighting\u201d and \u201cAlf\u201d (\"no relation,\" he used to joke) was nominated for 30 Emmy Awards, 21 of them for \u201cThe Simpsons,\u201d winning twice.",

      "While Danny Elfman wrote the show's theme song, Clausen joined the Fox animated series created by Matt Groening in 1990 and provided essentially all of its music until 2017, composing nearly 600 scores and conducting the 35-piece orchestra that played it in the studio.",
      "His colleagues said his music was a key component of the show's comedy, but Clausen believed the best way to back up the gags of Homer, Marge Bart and Lisa was by making the music as straight as possible.",
      "\u201cThis is a dream job for a composer,\u201d Clausen told Variety, which first reported his death, in 1998. \u201cMatt Groening said to me very early on, \u2018We\u2019re not a cartoon. We\u2019re a drama where the characters are drawn. I want you to score it like a drama.\u2019 I score the emotions of the characters as opposed to specific action hits on the screen.\u201d",
      "Groening, in a 1996 interview, called him \u201cone of the unacknowledged treasures of the show.\u201d",
      "Clausen was born in Minneapolis and raised in Jamestown, North Dakota. He graduated from the Berklee College of Music in 1966, and moved to Los Angeles seeking a career in music.",
      "In the 1970s he was a musical director on several TV variety shows including \u201cDonny & Marie.\u201d",
      "Clausen worked as an orchestrator for composer Lee Holdridge in his scores for 1980s films including \u201cSplash\u201d and \u201cThe Beastmaster.\u201d",
      "It was Holdridge who first got the composing job on \u201cMoonlighting,\" the late-80s ABC rom-com detective series starring Bruce Willis and Cybil Shepherd, but he handed the gig off to Clausen, who would get six Emmy nominations for his music on it.",
      "Clausen won his Emmys for \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d in 1997 and 1998 and also won five Annie Awards, which honor work in animation in film and television.",
      "He was fired from \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d in a cost-cutting move in 2017, to the outrage of his collaborators and fans. He sued over his dismissal.",
      "Clausen is survived by his wife Sally, children Kaarin, Scott and Kyle, stepchildren Josh and Emily, and 11 grandchildren.",

      "The multi-platinum singer had been scheduled to headline the opening celebrations Saturday night at Nationals Park. The reasons are apparently an extension of equipment issues related to her Thursday night concert in Boston's Fenway Park, which was also cancelled hours before it was set to begin. A Friday night concert at Fenway for country star Jason Aldean was also cancelled.",

      "The Alliance noted that the full slate of citywide events was still on for opening weekend, and said the kickoff ceremony would be relocated and reorganized.",

      "Trump\u2019s public antipathy for trans protections and drag shows has already prompted two international LGBTQ+ organizations, Eagle Canada and the African Human Rights Coalition, to issue warnings against traveling to the U.S. at all. The primary concern is that trans or non-binary individuals would face trouble entering the country if passport control officers enforce the administration\u2019s strict binary view of gender status.",

      "PBS filed suit Friday against President Donald Trump and other administration officials to block his order stripping federal funding from the 330-station public television system, three days after NPR did the same for its radio network.",
      "In its lawsuit, PBS relies on similar arguments, saying Trump was overstepping his authority and engaging in \u201cviewpoint discrimination\u201d because of his claim that PBS' news coverage is biased against conservatives.",
      "\u201cPBS disputes those charged assertions in the strongest possible terms,\u201d lawyer Z.W. Julius Chen wrote in the suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Washington. \u201cBut regardless of any policy disagreements over the role of public television, our Constitution and laws forbid the President from serving as the arbiter of the content of PBS's programming, including by attempting to defund PBS.\u201d",
      "It was the latest of many legal actions taken against the administration for its moves, including several by media organizations impacted by Trump's orders.",
      "PBS was joined as a plaintiff by one of its stations, Lakeland PBS, which serves rural areas in northern and central Minnesota. Trump's order is an \u201cexistential threat\u201d to the station, the lawsuit said.",
      "A PBS spokesman said that \u201cafter careful deliberation, PBS reached the conclusion that it was necessary to take legal action to safeguard public television\u2019s editorial independence, and to protect the autonomy of PBS member stations.\u201d",
      "Through an executive order earlier this month, Trump told the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and federal agencies to stop funding the two systems. Through the corporation alone, PBS is receiving $325 million this year, most of which goes directly to individual stations.",
      "PBS, which makes much of the programming used by the stations, said it gets 22% of its revenue directly from the feds. Sixty-one percent of PBS' budget is funded through individual station dues, and the stations raise the bulk of that money through the government.",
      "Trump's order \u201cwould have profound impacts on the ability of PBS and PBS member stations to provide a rich tapestry of programming to all Americans,\u201d Chen wrote.",
      "PBS said the U.S. Department of Education has canceled a $78 million grant to the system for educational programming, used to make children's shows like \u201cSesame Street,\u201d \u201cClifford the Big Red Dog\u201d and \u201cReading Rainbow.\u201d",
      "For Minnesota residents, the order threatens the \u201cLakeland Learns\u201d education program and \u201cLakeland News,\u201d described in the lawsuit as the only television program in the region providing local news, weather and sports.",
      "Besides Trump, the lawsuit names other administration officials as defendants, including Education Secretary Linda McMahon, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. PBS says its technology is used as a backup for the nationwide wireless emergency alert system.",
      "The administration has fought with several media organizations. Government-run news services like Voice of America and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty are struggling for their lives, The Associated Press has battled with the White House over press access and the Federal Communications Commission is investigating television news divisions.",

      "The CBS show aired for 11 years from 1972 to 1983, revolving around life at the 4077th Mobile Army Surgical Hospital, which gave the show its name. The two-and-a-half-hour finale on Feb. 28, 1983, lured over 100 million viewers, the most-watched episode of any scripted series ever.",
      "Rolling Stone magazine put \u201cM.A.S.H.\u201d at No. 25 of the best TV shows of all time, while Time Out put it at No. 34. It won the Impact Award at the 2009 TV Land annual awards. It won a Peabody Award in 1975 \u201cfor the depth of its humor and the manner in which comedy is used to lift the spirit and, as well, to offer a profound statement on the nature of war.\u201d",
      "In Altman\u2019s 1970 film, Houlihan was a one-dimensional character \u2014 a prickly, rules-bound head nurse who was regularly tormented by male colleagues, who gave her the nickname \u201cHot Lips.\u201d Her intimate moments were broadcast to the entire camp after somebody planted a microphone under her bed.",
      "Sally Kellerman played Houlihan in the movie version and Swit took it over for TV, eventually deepening and creating her into a much fuller character. Her sexuality was played down and she wasn\u2019t even called \u201cHot Lips\u201d in the later years.",
      "The growing awareness of feminism in the \u201970s spurred Houlihan\u2019s transformation from caricature to real person, but a lot of the change was due to Swit\u2019s influence on the scriptwriters.",
      "\u201cAround the second or third year I decided to try to play her as a real person, in an intelligent fashion, even if it meant hurting the jokes,\u201d Swit told Suzy Kalter, author of \u201cThe Complete Book of \u2018M.A.S.H.\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cTo oversimplify it, I took each traumatic change that happened in her life and kept it. I didn\u2019t go into the next episode as if it were a different character in a different play. She was a character in constant flux; she never stopped developing.\u201d",
      "\u201cM.A.S.H.\u201d wasn\u2019t an instant hit. It finished its first season in 46th place, out of 75 network TV series, but it nabbed nine Emmy nominations. It was rewarded with a better time slot for its sophomore season, paired on Saturday nights with \u201cAll in the Family,\u201d then TV\u2019s highest-rated show. At the 1974 Emmys, it was crowned best comedy, with Alda winning as best comedy actor.",
      "The series also survived despite cast churn. In addition to Swit and Alda, the first season featured Wayne Rogers, McLean Stevenson, Larry Linville and Gary Burghoff. Harry Morgan, Mike Farrell and David Ogden Stiers would later be added, while Jamie Farr and William Christopher had expanded roles.",
      "\u201cLoretta Swit\u2019s portrayal of Margaret \u2018Hot Lips\u2019 Houlihan was groundbreaking \u2014 bringing heart, humor, and strength to one of television comedy\u2019s most enduring roles. Her talent extended well beyond that iconic character, with acclaimed work on both stage and screen that showcased her intelligence, versatility, and passion,\" National Comedy Center Executive Director Journey Gunderson said in a statement.",
      "Swit appeared in all but 11 episodes of the series, nearly four times longer than the Korean War itself, exploring issues like PTSD, sexism and racism. Swit pushed for a better representation for women.",
      "\u201cOne of the things I liked, with Loretta\u2019s prodding, was every time I had a chance to write for her character, we\u2019d get away from the Hot Lips angle and find out more about who Margaret was. She became more of a real person,\u201d Alda told The Hollywood Reporter in 2018.",
      "The series ended on a happy note for Houlihan, who spends much of the finale debating whether she wants to head to Tokyo or Belgium for her next overseas post. Ultimately she opts to return to America and work at a hospital, citing her father \u2014 a career Army man.",
      "Swit didn\u2019t personally agree that was the correct decision for a military-minded official: \u201cI didn\u2019t think that was correct for my Margaret,\u201d she told Yahoo Entertainment in 2023. \u201cI think her next move was Vietnam. So I didn\u2019t agree with that, but that\u2019s what they wanted her to do.\u201d",
      "But the actor did get to write the speech that Houlihan delivers to her fellow nurses on their final night together, in which she says: \u201cIt\u2019s been an honor and privilege to have worked with you. And I\u2019m very, very proud to have known you.\u201d",
      "\u201cI was consumed with writing that. And I still get letters from women all over the world who became nurses because of Margaret Houlihan. To have contributed to someone\u2019s life like that is remarkable,\u201d she told Yahoo Entertainment.",
      "During her run, Houlihan had an affair with Hawkeye\u2019s foil, the bumbling Frank Burns, played by Linville in the TV version, and in Season 5, Houlihan returns from a stay in Tokyo engaged to a handsome lieutenant colonel, a storyline that Swit says she advocated for with the writers.",
      "\u201cI told them: \u2018Can you imagine what fun you\u2019re going to have with Larry when I come back to town and I tell him I\u2019m engaged? He\u2019ll rip the doors off of the mess tent!\u2019 And that\u2019s exactly what they had him do. So we were all of the same mind.\u201d",
      "Toward the end, Swit was tempted to leave the show. She played the role of Chris Cagney in a 1981 television movie, \u201cCagney & Lacey,\u201d and was offered the part when it was picked up as a midseason series for the spring of 1982. But producers insisted she stay with \u201cM.A.S.H.\u201d for its last two seasons.",
      "Swit told The Florida Times-Union in 2010 she might have stayed with \u201cM.A.S.H.\u201d anyway. \u201cYou can\u2019t help but get better as an actor working with scripts like that,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you\u2019re in something that literate, well, we got spoiled.\u201d",
      "In 2022, James Poniewozik, The New York Times\u2019s chief television critic, looked back on the show and said it held up well: \u201cIts blend of madcap comedy and pitch-dark drama \u2014 the laughs amplifying the serious stakes, and vice versa \u2014 is recognizable in today\u2019s dramedies, from \u2018Better Things\u2019 to \u2018Barry,\u2019 that work in the DMZ between laughter and sadness.\u201d",
      "After the TV series, Swit became a vocal animal welfare activist, selling SwitHeart perfume and her memoir through her official website, with proceeds benefiting various animal-related nonprofit groups.",
      "In 1983, she married actor Dennis Holahan, whom she\u2019d met when he was a guest star on \u201cM.A.S.H.\u201d They divorced in 1995.",
      "Born in Passaic, New Jersey, the daughter of Polish immigrants, Swit enrolled in the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, then paid her dues for years in touring productions.",
      "In 1969, she arrived in Hollywood and was soon seen in series such as \u201cGunsmoke,\u201d \u201cHawaii Five-O,\u201d \u201cMission Impossible\u201d and \u201cBonanza.\u201d Then in 1972, she got her big break when she was asked to audition for the role of \u201cHot Lips.\u201d",
      "She would regularly return to theater, starring on Broadway in 1975 in \u201cSame Time, Next Year\u201d and \u201cThe Mystery of Edwin Drood\u201d in 1986. She was in \u201cAmorous Crossing,\u201d a romantic comedy, at Alhambra Theatre & Dining in 2010 and in North Carolina Theatre\u2019s production of \u201cMame\u201d in 2003.",

      "The lighthouse appeared overnight",
      "MARSEILLE, France -- The lighthouse appeared overnight. Painted on a wall tucked away in a quiet Marseille street, its beam aligned perfectly with the real-life shadow of a metal post on the pavement. At its center, stenciled in crisp white, are the words: \u201cI want to be what you saw in me.\u201d",
      "Banksy had struck again.",
      "On Friday, the elusive British street artist confirmed the work by posting two images on his official Instagram account \u2014 without caption or coordinates. Fans quickly identified the location as 1 Rue F\u00e9lix Fr\u00e9gier, in the Catalans district of Marseille\u2019s 7th arrondissement, near the sea.",
      "Since then, crowds have gathered at the site. Tourists snap photos. Children point. Locals who usually walk past the building stop to take a closer look.",
      "There is no official explanation for the phrase. But its emotional pull is unmistakable \u2014 a quiet plea for recognition, love or redemption. Some speculate it references a country ballad by Lonestar. Others call it a love letter. Or a lament. Or both.",
      "The image is deceptively simple: a lone lighthouse, dark and weathered, casting a stark white beam. But what gives it power is the way it plays with light \u2014 the real and the painted, the seen and the imagined. The post in front of the wall becomes part of the piece. Reality becomes the frame.",
      "Marseille\u2019s mayor, Beno\u00eet Payan, was quick to react online. \u201cMarseille x Banksy,\u201d he wrote, adding a flame emoji. By midday, the hashtag #BanksyMarseille was trending across France, and beyond.",
      "Though often political, Banksy\u2019s art is just as often personal, exploring themes of loss, longing and identity. In recent years, his works have appeared on war-ravaged buildings in Ukraine, in support of migrants crossing the Mediterranean and on walls condemning capitalism, Brexit, and police brutality.",
      "The artist, who has never confirmed his full identity, began his career spray-painting buildings in Bristol, England, and has become one of the world\u2019s best-known artists. His mischievous and often satirical images include two male police officers kissing, armed riot police with yellow smiley faces and a chimpanzee with a sign bearing the words, \u201cLaugh now, but one day I\u2019ll be in charge.\u201d",
      "His work has sold for millions of dollars at auction, and past murals on outdoor sites have often been stolen or removed by building owners soon after going up. In December 2023, after Banksy stenciled military drones on a stop sign in south London, a man was photographed taking down the sign with bolt cutters. Police later arrested two men on suspicion of theft and criminal damage.",
      "In March 2024, an environmentally themed work on a wall beside a tree in north London was splashed with paint, covered with plastic sheeting and fenced off within days of being created.",
      "Despite the fame \u2014 or infamy \u2014 at least in Marseille, not everyone walking past noticed it. Some didn\u2019t even know who Banksy was, according to the local press.",
      "On Instagram observers say this Marseille piece feels quieter. More interior.",
      "And yet, it is no less global. The work arrives just ahead of a major Banksy retrospective opening June 14 at the Museum of Art in nearby Toulon featuring 80 works, including rare originals. Another exhibit opens Saturday in Montpellier.",
      "But the Marseille mural wasn\u2019t meant for a museum. It lives in the street, exposed to weather, footsteps and time. As of Friday evening, no barriers had been erected. No glass shield installed. Just a shadow, a beam and a message that\u2019s already circling the world.",

      "Former Japanese princess Mako Komuro has given birth to her first child",
      "TOKYO -- TOKYO (AP) \u2014 Former Japanese princess Mako Komuro has given birth to her first child, palace officials confirmed Friday, though they gave no details, saying she is no longer a royal member.",
      "The Imperial Household Agency said both the mother and child are in good health, but did not disclose the baby's date of birth or gender.",
      "The former princess, 33, is a niece of Emperor Naruhito. She married a former college classmate Kei Komuro, a commoner, and renounced her royal status in 2021 as required by Japan's Imperial House Law. Days after their marriage, the couple moved to New York where her husband works as a lawyer.",
      "Officials said that while the birth involved a former royal, the palace decided to publicly confirm the news after media reports earlier this month on the baby's arrival. They added that they hoped Mako would live in a quiet environment.",
      "Mako's parents, Crown Prince Akishino and his wife Kiko, and younger siblings \u2014 Princess Kako and Prince Hisahito \u2014 are delighted and wished Mako's family happiness, officials said.",
      "Japanese tabloid magazine Josei Seven recently published images of Mako and Kei Komuro seen walking with a baby stroller in a neighborhood of New York.",
      "Mako and her husband met at Tokyo\u2019s International Christian University. They announced in September 2017 their intention to marry the following year, but the wedding was suspended for four years due to a financial dispute involving Kei Komuro's mother.",
      "Due to the controversy, Mako also declined a dowry to which she was entitled for leaving the imperial family.",
      "Mako\u2019s loss of royal status comes from the Imperial House Law, which allows only male succession.",
      "The rule leaves only Akishino and his son Hisahito in line to succeed Naruhito. A government panel is discussing a more stable succession system, but conservatives reject female succession and only plan to allow female royals to help perform public duties after marriage.",

      "Brand, who turns 50 next week, denied two counts of rape, two counts of sexual assault and one count of indecent assault. He said \"not guilty\u201d after each charge was read in Southwark Crown Court.",
      "His trial was scheduled for June 3, 2026 and is expected to last four to five weeks.",
      "Prosecutors said that the offenses took place between 1999 and 2005 \u2014 one in the English seaside town of Bournemouth and the other three in London.",
      "Brand didn't speak to reporters as he arrived at court wearing dark sunglasses, a suit jacket, a black collared shirt open below his chest and black jeans. In his right hand, he clutched a copy of the \u201cThe Valley of Vision,\u201d a collection of Puritan prayers.",
      "The \u201cGet Him To The Greek\u201d actor known for risqu\u00e9 stand-up routines, battles with drugs and alcohol, has dropped out of the mainstream media in recent years and built a large following online with videos mixing wellness and conspiracy theories, as well as discussing religion.",
      "On a five-minute prayer video he posted Monday on social media, Brand wrote: \u201cJesus, thank you for saving my life.\u201d",
      "When the charges were announced last month, he said that he welcomed the opportunity to prove his innocence.",
      "\u201cI was a fool before I lived in the light of the Lord,\u201d he said in a social media video. \u201cI was a drug addict, a sex addict and an imbecile. But what I never was was a rapist. I\u2019ve never engaged in nonconsensual activity. I pray that you can see that by looking in my eyes.\u201d",

      "Big Ocean, the world\u2019s first K-pop group composed entirely of deaf and hard-of-hearing artists, is breaking barriers with high-tech tools and inclusive performances",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- Big Ocean, a three-member K-pop group composed entirely of artists with hearing disabilities, is redefining the limits of music and performance \u2014 one beat at a time.",
      "When Big Ocean takes the stage, they seamlessly incorporate sign language into their performances. But their polished shows are built on extensive preparation using high-tech tools born from necessity \u2014 vibrating smartwatches that pulse with musical beats and LED visual metronomes that flash timing cues during practice sessions. This technological approach represents significant progress in South Korea\u2019s entertainment industry, where career opportunities for people with disabilities have historically been limited.",
      "The trio, PJ, Jiseok and Chanyeon, made their debut in April 2024 and recently wrapped a solo European tour marking their first anniversary. The band performed in four countries, including France and the U.K., while promoting their second mini-album, \u201cUnderwater,\u201d which dropped on April 20.",
      "PJ rose to prominence as a YouTuber who educated viewers about hearing disabilities. Chanyeon previously worked as an audiologist. Jiseok was a professional ski racer.",
      "To achieve the precision crucial in K-pop\u2019s demanding choreography and music, Big Ocean relies on technologies rarely seen in the genre. Members wear modified vibrating smartwatches that deliver rhythmic cues to their wrists and practice with visual metronomes \u2014 flashing light guides displayed on monitors \u2014 to help stay in sync when audio alone isn\u2019t enough.",
      "Chanyeon uses a hybrid hearing device with Bluetooth that streams music directly from mobile devices. The group also uses a pitch-checking app and AI voice conversion technology to support vocal training and enhance audio output after recordings.",
      "\u201cWe each felt rhythm differently when dancing,\u201d PJ told The Associated Press. \u201cSo when we\u2019d play the same song and dance in front of the mirror, one of us would move faster while another would move slower. To solve this timing issue, we decided to memorize everything together and create our own cues with each other.\u201d",
      "This precision becomes critical during live performances, where unexpected disruptions can derail even experienced performers. \u201cWhen we performed in France, our fans were cheering so loudly we lost the beat,\u201d said Jiseok. \u201cBut we looked at each other and quickly handled the situation \u2014 just like we practiced.\u201d",
      "Stage effects and certain musical styles create additional obstacles. \u201cWhen a lot of smoke comes up, sometimes we momentarily can\u2019t see the stage movements in front of us,\u201d PJ said. \u201cOur concentration gets disrupted instantly in those moments.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen there\u2019s no clear beat in a song, it\u2019s really hard for us to stay synchronized,\u201d Jiseok said. \u201cWhen the bass is overwhelming, it\u2019s difficult for us to catch it accurately.\u201d",
      "Despite these challenges, Big Ocean\u2019s commitment to accessibility and inclusion has inspired their global fanbase. Big Ocean\u2019s global fanbase \u2014 known as PADO \u2014 has responded with similar commitment.",
      "\u201cWhile communicating with PADO, we\u2019ve heard that they\u2019re actually learning Korean sign language for us, or learning various sign languages to communicate with us,\u201d Jiseok said. \u201cWhen we see how much they\u2019re preparing and putting in that effort, we feel so grateful.\u201d",
      "The group uses English for basic communication with international fans and incorporates Korean Sign Language, American Sign Language and International Sign to promote accessibility and inclusion.",
      "Jiseok credits BTS\u2019s RM with inspiring his musical journey. He said RM\u2019s donation to his former school \u2014 a private institution for deaf and hard of hearing students \u2014 gave him access to music and dance for the first time. \u201cWithout those learning opportunities, I probably never would have dreamed of becoming a K-pop idol,\u201d he said.",
      "Looking ahead, Big Ocean hopes to build on its growing global profile.",
      "\u201cWe recently saw Justin Bieber\u2019s Instagram post asking for music collaborators, so we sent him a DM,\u201d PJ said. \u201cAll of us would love the opportunity to work with him. And personally, I\u2019d also love to work with Billie Eilish.\u201d",
      "As the band reflects on its first year, Chanyeon said their biggest growth has been internal.",

      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- A New Zealand flag printed with the words \u201cplease walk on me\u201d and laid on the floor of an art gallery has once again been packed away following public outcry, 30 years after protests forced the removal of the same artwork.",
      "The Suter Art Gallery in the city of Nelson said Thursday it had taken down the work by M\u0101ori artist Diane Prince due to escalating tensions and safety fears. The episode mirrored an Auckland gallery's removal of the work amid public backlash and complaints to law enforcement in 1995.",
      "This time, the flag was meant to remain on display for five months. Instead, it lasted just 19 days, reigniting long-running debates in New Zealand over artistic expression, national symbols and the country\u2019s colonial history.",
      "Police told The Associated Press on Friday that officers were investigating \u201cseveral\u201d complaints about the exhibition.",
      "The piece, titled Flagging the Future, is a cloth New Zealand flag displayed on the floor with the words \u201cplease walk on me\u201d stenciled across it. The flag features the British Union Jack and red stars on a blue background.",
      "The work was part of an exhibition, Diane Prince: Activist Artist, and was meant to provoke reflection on the M\u0101ori experience since New Zealand's colonization by Britain in the 19th century. Prince created the piece in 1995 in response to a government policy that limited compensation to M\u0101ori tribes for historical land theft.",
      "\u201cI have no attachment to the New Zealand flag,\u201d Prince told Radio New Zealand in 2024. \u201cI don\u2019t call myself a New Zealander. I call myself a M\u0101ori.\u201d",
      "Prince couldn\u2019t be reached immediately for comment Friday.",
      "New Zealand\u2019s reckoning with its colonial past has gathered pace in recent decades. But there has been little appetite among successive governments to sever the country\u2019s remaining constitutional ties to Britain or change the flag to a design that doesn't feature the Union Jack.",
      "New Zealand is among countries where desecrating the national flag is considered taboo and prohibited by law. Damaging a flag in public with intent to dishonor it is punishable by a fine of up to 5,000 New Zealand dollars ($2,984), but prosecutions are fleetingly rare.",
      "As in the United States and elsewhere, the country\u2019s flag is synonymous for some with military service. But for others, particularly some M\u0101ori, it\u2019s a reminder of land dispossession, and loss of culture and identity.",
      "Protests of the artwork in the city of Nelson, population 55,000, included videos posted to social media by a local woman, Ruth Tipu, whose grandfather served in the army\u2019s M\u0101ori Battalion during World War II.

      "A veterans\u2019 group also denounced the piece as \u201cshameful\u201d and \u201coffensive.\u201d City council member Tim Skinner said he was \u201chorrified\u201d by the work\u2019s inclusion.",
      "But others welcomed it. Nelson\u2019s deputy mayor, Rohan O\u2019Neill-Stevens, posted on social media \u201cin strong defense of artistic expression and the right for us all to be challenged and confronted by art.\u201d",
      "The work was perhaps expected to provoke controversy and in the exhibition\u2019s opening days, The Suter Gallery defended its inclusion. But a statement on its Facebook page late Thursday said a \u201csharp escalation in the tone and nature of the discourse, moving well beyond the bounds of respectful debate\u201d had prompted the flag\u2019s removal.",
      "\u201cThis should not be interpreted as a judgement on the artwork or the artist\u2019s intent,\u201d the statement said. The gallery didn\u2019t detail specific incidents of concern and a gallery spokesperson didn\u2019t respond to a request for an interview on Friday.",
      "New Zealand\u2019s Police said in a statement Friday that while officers were investigating complaints, they weren\u2019t called to any disturbances at the exhibition. Prince said when she revived the work in 2024 that threats of prosecution by law enforcement had prompted its removal from the Auckland gallery in 1995.",
      "The Nelson gallery didn't suggest in its statement that police involvement had influenced Thursday's decision.",

      "As he turned 80 this week, John Fogerty was in a mood to honor his past and to revise it",
      "NEW YORK -- As he turned 80 this week, John Fogerty was in a mood to honor his past and to revise it.",
      "We should all be so alive and so remembered at his age. Fogerty, in the midst of an international tour, played a rowdy 100-minute set Thursday night to an adoring, near-capacity audience at Manhattan's Beacon Theatre. Crowd members spanned from those likely to remember \u201cProud Mary,\u201d \u201cFortunate Son\u201d and other Creedence Clearwater Revival hits when first released a half-century ago to those looking young enough to have heard about them through their grandparents.",
      "At least from a distance, Fogerty didn't look or sound much different from his prime with Creedence, which was rarely off the charts between 1969 and 1971. He wore his trademark flannel shirt; had the same shaggy haircut, although with his bangs brushed back; sang with a vintage roar that has mellowed only slightly; and even played the same guitar, a Rickenbacker, that he had acquired back in the late '60s.",
      "Fogerty presented himself as a proud rock \u2018n' roller, and a very proud family man. His band includes two of his sons on guitar, Shane and Tyler, with daughter Kelsy briefly joining them on a third guitar. Off to the side was his wife, Julie, whom he praised as the love and the hero of his life, if only because she gave one of the greatest gifts an old rock star could ask for: She helped win back rights to his song catalogue. Fogerty had battled over his copyrights for decades, and at one point found himself being sued for plagiarizing one of his Creedence hits, which at the time he didn\u2019t own.",
      "He has marked his victory with an upcoming album, \u201cLegacy,\u201d for which he recorded new versions of 20 songs. If you were in the house Thursday night, you couldn't help hearing about it. A promotional film about \u201cLegacy\u201d opened the show and Fogerty mentioned it again before his encore set. Both the album, subtitled \u201cThe Creedence Clearwater Revival Years,\u201d and his concert tell a story of how he wants to look back.",
      "As Fogerty noted at one point Thursday night, Creedence Clearwater Revival soared to the highest heights before imploding bitterly in the early \u201870s and never again recording or touring together. Only Creedence diehards would have known the identity of the other band members \u2014 drummer Doug Clifford, bassist Stu Cook, and guitarist Tom Fogerty, John\u2019s brother, who died in 1990. Their names were never mentioned, their faces near-invisible among the rush of images that appeared Thursday on a screen behind Fogerty and his band. The new tracks on \u201cLegacy,\u201d each labeled \u201cJohn's Version,\u201d leave only John Fogerty from the original group.",
      "The Beacon show was very much about where is he now, and how much he likes it. He dashed about the stage, rocked out on his Rickenbacker with the joy of a teenager on air guitar and even poured himself champagne. Fans clapped and danced, while being showered with confetti and dazzled with lasers and fog. The more informed sang along with \u201cHave You Ever Seen the Rain\u201d and the baseball anthem \u201cCenterfield,\" Fogerty's most famous post-Creedence song. Virtually all stood and cheered to serenade the night\u2019s guest of honor, whose birthday was the day before.",

      "The special screening of the blockbuster horror film included an appearance by Director Ryan Coogler and was made possible by a community petition.",
      "\u201cI have family from Mississippi \u2014 my uncle, my grandfather \u2014 and I had never been until working on this script,\u201d Coogler said, addressing the crowd. \u201cIt really changed me, just to come here.\u201d",
      "The movie, starring Michael B. Jordan as twins, is about two brothers coming home to Mississippi to launch a juke joint. It's also a supernatural vampire flick that blends elements of drama, action and music.",
      "\u201cSinners\u201d composer Ludwig G\u00f6ransson, actor Miles Canton and others who worked on the film also attended the screening.",

      "The film is set in 1930s Clarksdale, Mississippi, but current day Clarksdale doesn\u2019t have a movie theater, making it difficult for people to see the film about their hometown. Community organizers decided to change that, starting a petition to invite the cast and crew to Clarksdale and to collaborate on hosting a public screening.",

      "During the screening, the crowd was expressive \u2014 in response to various scenes, they gasped, laughed and cheered. Afterward, Coogler and others stayed for a Q&A.",

      "NEW YORK -- President Donald Trump suffered \u201cmental anguish\u201d from CBS News' editing of a \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview with Democratic opponent Kamala Harris last fall, his lawyers are arguing in court papers.",
      "Trump's status as a \u201ccontent creator\u201d was also damaged by attention given to the interview, lawyers said. It was part of their argument opposing CBS parent Paramount Global's effort to dismiss the president's $20 billion lawsuit against the company, filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Amarillo, Texas. Trump has claimed the editing was done to advantage Harris, which CBS rejects.",
      "Even with the effort to dismiss the case, Paramount is engaged in settlement discussions with Trump. The prospect of a settlement has so rattled CBS News that two of its top executives have resigned in protest.",
      "Trump, who did not agree to be interviewed by \u201c60 Minutes\" during the campaign, has protested editing where Harris is seen giving two different answers to a question by the show's Bill Whitaker in separate clips aired on \u201c60 Minutes\u201d and \u201cFace the Nation\u201d earlier in the day. CBS said each reply came within Harris' long-winded answer to Whitaker, but was edited to be more succinct.",
      "Trump's lawyer, Edward Andrew Paltzik, said that \u201cthis led to widespread confusion and mental anguish of consumers, including plaintiffs, regarding a household name of the legacy media apparently deceptively distorting its broadcasts, and then resisting attempts to clear the public record.\u201d",
      "Because they were misled, voters withheld attention from Trump and his Truth Social platform, Paltzik argued.",
      "Trump, described as a \u201cmedia icon\u201d by his lawyers, was \u201cforced to redirect significant time, money and effort to correcting the public record,\u201d he said.",
      "Paramount and controlling shareholder Shari Redstone are seeking the settlement with Trump, whose administration must approve the company's proposed merger with Skydance Media. CBS News' president and CEO, Wendy McMahon, and \u201c60 Minutes\u201d executive producer Bill Owens, who both opposed a settlement, have resigned in recent weeks.",
      "Meanwhile, the Freedom of the Press Foundation, a media advocacy group that says it is a Paramount shareholder, said that it would file a lawsuit in protest if a settlement is reached.",
      "Seth Stern, the foundation's advocacy director, said a settlement of Trump's \u201cmeritless\u201d lawsuit \u201cmay well be a thinly veiled effort to launder bribes through the court system.\u201d U.S. Sens. Ron Wyden, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have said they are investigating whether a settlement would violate bribery laws.",
      "The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday that Paramount has offered $15 million to settle but that Trump wants more money \u2014 and an apology. A company representative would not comment on the report.",

      "Five bodies that appeared to be members of a Mexican regional music group who had gone missing have been found in the northern city of Reynosa along the Texas border",
      "CIUDAD VICTORIA, Mexico -- Five bodies that appeared to be members of a Mexican regional music group who had gone missing were found in the northern city of Reynosa, along the Texas border, authorities said on Thursday.",
      "The musicians from the band Grupo Fugitivo, which played at parties and local dances in the region, had been reported missing since Sunday.",
      "The genre they played \u2013 Mexican regional music, which encapsulates a wide range of styles including corridos and cumbia \u2013 has in recent years gained a spotlight as it's entered a sort of international musical renaissance. Young artists have mixed the classic genre with trap and sometimes pay homage to leaders of drug cartels, often portrayed as Robin Hood-type figures.",
      "While it was not immediately clear if the group played such songs, other artists have faced death threats by cartels, while others have had their visas stripped by the United States under accusations by the Trump administration that they were glorifying criminal violence.",
      "Few details were released about where the bodies were found and in what conditions, but Tamaulipas state prosecutors had been investigating the case, according to a statement by state security officials. The last time they had communicated with their families was Sunday night, when they said they were going to a venue where they were hired to play.",
      "After that, nothing else was heard of them. Officials said the bodies shared characteristics of artists, though did not provide further detail.",
      "Their disappearance caused an uproar in Tamaulipas, a state long eclipsed by cartel warfare. Their families reported the disappearances, called on the public for support and people took to the streets in protest.",
      "On Wednesday, protesters blocked the international bridge connecting Reynosa and Pharr, Texas, later going to a local cathedral to pray and make offerings to the disappeared.",
      "As of midday Thursday, the state prosecutor\u2019s office had not released further details on the case.",
      "Reynosa is a Mexican border city adjacent to the United States and has been plagued by escalating violence since 2017 due to internal disputes among groups vying for control of drug trafficking, human smuggling and fuel theft.",
      "This case follows another that occurred in 2018, when armed men kidnapped two members of the musical group \u201cLos Norte\u00f1os de R\u00edo Bravo,\u201d whose bodies were later found on the federal highway connecting Reynosa to R\u00edo Bravo, Tamaulipas.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- A judge declared Thursday that a man is mentally incompetent to stand trial on charges of stalking Jennifer Aniston and crashing his car through her front gate.",
      "The move in a Los Angeles County mental health court came after a second psychiatrist examined the defendant, Jimmy Wayne Carwyle, and reached the same conclusion as the first: that his mental health would not allow him to answer to felony charges of vandalism and stalking of the \u201cFriends\u201d star.",
      "\u201cThe court finds the defendant is not currently competent to stand trial,\u201d Judge Maria Cavalluzzi said. \u201cCriminal proceedings will remain suspended.\u201d",
      "Carwyle, 48, of Mississippi, has pleaded not guilty. He appeared behind glass in a custody area of the courtroom and did not speak. He looked vastly different than his previous two court hearings. His scraggly gray hair and beard had been shorn, and he was wearing bright yellow county jail clothing after previously appearing with bare shoulders, wrapped in a blanket-like smock meant for suicide prevention.",
      "Carwyle had argued that he is competent, and exercised his right to a second opinion after an initial incompetence finding last week.",
      "\u201cIt's not the outcome my client would have preferred,\" Deputy Public Defender Robert Krauss told the judge.",
      "A conviction on the charges, along with an aggravating circumstance of the threat of great bodily harm, could bring up to three years in prison for Carwyle. The incompetence finding has no set end date but it is temporary, and the standard criminal process could resume later.",
      "Cavalluzzi ordered more comprehensive mental evaluations to help determine where and how he'll be held, and what his treatment will be. The judge will get a report on the results at a June 26 hearing, where Aniston or her attorney will be allowed to share her perspective on the case.",
      "Aniston's lawyer, Blair Berk, was in the courtroom observing Thursday, but did not speak. Berk and the deputy district attorney handling the case declined comment outside court.",
      "Prosecutors allege Carwyle had been harassing Aniston with a flood of voicemail, email and social media messages for two years before driving his Chrysler PT Cruiser through the gate of her home in the wealthy Bel Air neighborhood of Los Angeles on May 5, causing major damage. A security guard stopped him in her driveway until police arrived. Authorities said Aniston was home at the time, but did not come into contact, and no one was injured.",
      "Aniston became one of television's biggest stars in her 10 years on NBC's \u201cFriends,\u201d from 1994 until 2004. She won an Emmy Award for best lead actress in a comedy for the role, and she has been nominated for nine more. She currently stars in \u201cThe Morning Show\u201d on Apple TV+.",

      "The number of former rugby players taking legal action against sports governing bodies on claims they suffered brain injuries during their careers has grown to more than 1,000, a British law firm said on Monday.",
      "Rylands Garth, based in London, said more than 520 ex-players from rugby union and rugby league joined the lawsuit by Friday last week, which was the deadline for new applicants set by a court ahead of a hearing in July and before the case potentially goes to trial next year.",
      "It takes the total number of players who are part of the lawsuit to approximately 1,100, Rylands Garth said in a statement.",
      "The former players contend, according to Rylands Garth, that \u201crugby governing bodies failed to take reasonable action to protect them from the impacts of concussive and sub-concussive blows during their playing careers, despite knowing of the risks.\u201d",
      "Claimants are seeking compensation from World Rugby, the English Rugby Football Union and Welsh Rugby Union \u2014 governing bodies in 15-a-side rugby \u2014 and the English Rugby Football League and British Amateur Rugby League Association \u2014 from 13-a-side rugby league \u2014 for lost earnings, medical bills and care costs associated with their injuries, the firm said.",
      "\u201cRylands Garth is also calling for urgent and substantive reform of the game to better protect the safety of current and future players \u2014 including the creation of an independent brain health ombudsman for the sport,\u201d it said.",
      "Among those to have previously joined the class action was World Cup-winning former England hooker Steve Thompson, former New Zealand prop Carl Hayman and former Wales flanker Alix Popham.",
      "\u201cThis surge in claimants exposes the deep-rooted issues in rugby,\u201d Rylands Garth said, adding: \"Players continue to play almost all-year round, with many elite players soon to embark on extremely physical summer tours across the rugby world. We will continue to fight for justice for those who gave so much to the game.\u201d",
      "In a joint statement issued by World Rugby, the RFU and the WRU, the governing bodies said they \u201care aware of the latest update shared by the claimants\u2019 legal representatives with the final number of claimants.\u201d",

      "U.S. Health Secretary Robert F",
      "WASHINGTON -- Emery Eversoll and her mother shared a good laugh when Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said that some autistic children will never write poems.",
      "The 16-year-old\u2019s bedroom is full of notebooks featuring her prose. Sometimes, she quietly recites poetry to get through an outburst of anger. Her mother began suspecting she may have autism, in part, because she had memorized every word from a favorite book by age 2.",
      "Still, this Kansas family is optimistic about Kennedy\u2019s plans to launch a broad-based study of what causes autism, the complex developmental disorder that impacts the brain and causes delays in language or learning, social withdrawal and an unusual need for routine. Kennedy has vowed to identify some of the causes of autism, which has been studied for decades, by September.",
      "Kennedy has said autism \u201ddestroys families.\u201d He said children with autism \u201cwill never pay taxes, they\u2019ll never hold a job, they\u2019ll never play baseball, they\u2019ll never write a poem, they\u2019ll never go out on a date. Many of them will never use a toilet unassisted.\u201d",
      "His comments and his plan to swiftly study its causes, have splintered a community of millions of people living with autism. For some, they were an overdue recognition of the day-to-day difficulties for families with autistic loved ones. To others, Kennedy deeply misrepresented the realities of their disability, provoking concern about his ability to handle a sweeping assessment of the disorder.",
      "Some worry, too, that Kennedy has spent years suggesting that vaccines might cause autism, despite decades of scientific research that shows no such link.",
      "Ohio father Scott Copeland, himself autistic and a parent to two autistic children, does not trust that Kennedy will conduct a legitimate study.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019d be like standing up and saying you\u2019re going to have the cure for cancer in six months,\u201d said Copeland, who's 56. \u201cAngry isn\u2019t a sufficient word.\u201d",
      "While announcing plans to study the causes of autism, Kennedy described a grim life for those who have to cope with it.",
      "For Kelly Van Den Berghe, Kennedy\u2019s comments reflect a painful reality for the son she loves. The Massachusetts mom of five has an 18-year-old son, Daniel, who has profound autism.",
      "Daniel cannot speak, although a tablet helps him communicate. He frequently punches himself so hard that he\u2019s at risk for fracture or concussion. About a decade ago, doctors recommended he enter a full-time residential facility for his safety. It took years for his mother to agree to that, and, even now, tears well up in her eyes as she talks about that decision.",
      "\u201cMy child, I do truly believe, that if he were able to tell us, he would not want autism because this has not affected him in a positive way,\u201d Van Den Berghe said. \u201cSo, for me, having someone finally recognize my son and his population is amazing.\u201d",
      "The Eversolls viewed Kennedy\u2019s comments that way, too. Emery Eversoll struggles with fits of anger. Loud noises can bug her. And clothes can feel weird, especially jeans or socks, which often need to be worn inside out.",
      "\u201cIt is hard if your child has any kind of thing that they have to work through or deal with that\u2019s extra,\u201d said Jessica Eversoll. \u201cJust like if your child had lost their hand, it\u2019s still the same child, but they\u2019re going to have struggles navigating the world around them.\u201d",
      "Eileen Lamb knows those struggles well. She was diagnosed with autism after she started noticing signs a decade ago that her first son, Charlie, may have autism.",
      "Days in Austin, Texas, can be daunting with Charlie, younger brother Jude, a 9-year-old who also has autism, and a 2-year-old sister, Billie.",
      "At 12, Charlie still requires constant supervision, especially with his habit of eating non-food items; last year he swallowed a screw. At night, she monitors Charlie with a video camera, a motion detector and a tent-like safety bed to make sure that he does not bang his head or try to eat the walls. On a blog, Eileen Lamb shares therapy tips, family wins \u2014 like taking all three kids to a little league soccer game \u2014 and mourns some of the milestones that Charlie has missed.",
      "Lamb said it\u2019s unlikely Charlie will ever play baseball or go on a date \u2014 as Kennedy said last month when describing autism \u2014 but she also doesn\u2019t only view her child\u2019s limitations.",
      "\u201cI see where he was going with his comments,\u201d Lamb said. \u201cBut I also think that\u2019s not how you measure the value of our children\u2019s lives. The language we use matters.\u201d",
      "Copeland, the Ohio father, also believes his 21-year-old son fit Kennedy\u2019s description of autism. His son is non-verbal, lives at home and requires around-the-clock care because he doesn\u2019t sense danger.",
      "Kennedy\u2019s comments, however, made it clear to Copeland that he\u2019s had little experience with the disorder.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t appreciate people presenting themselves as experts when they don\u2019t know a damn thing about something,\u201d he said.",
      "Kennedy has described autism as a \u201cpreventable disease.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s rattled families that see a clear-cut answer for the cause of autism: genetics. Scientists, too, have concluded that genetics play a significant factor.",
      "Ashley Seliquini, a 40-year-old mom and speech pathologist living in Greensboro, North Carolina, can clearly see the connections in her family. She and her 5-year-old daughter have both been diagnosed with the disorder. Both sometimes lose their ability to speak. Her daughter, too, gets overwhelmed by loud noises.",
      "\u201cYou see it run in families,\u201d Seliquini said. \u201cSometimes the parents are not aware that they are autistic. After their child gets diagnosed they go, \u2018Oh, my goodness, I\u2019m autistic, too.\u2019\u201d",
      "Doctors and medical experts have attributed the rise in autism cases \u2014 about 1 in 31 U.S. kids are now diagnosed with it \u2014 to increased awareness, especially around milder forms of the disorder.",
      "Kennedy has flatly rejected that explanation.",
      "Both he and President Donald Trump have suggested that vaccines could be to blame for rising rates of autism, despite longstanding research that says otherwise. The National Institutes of Health has identified other environmental risk factors such as prenatal exposure to pesticides or air pollution, extreme prematurity or parents who conceive at an older age.",
      "Last week, Kennedy said in an interview with CNN that the health department would start awarding grants to a team of 15 scientists who will study autism, although he has provided no details about who will lead the studies.",
      "Eileen Lamb hopes that the studies do not look into vaccines because researchers have already firmly concluded there is no link. Instead, she'd like to see a focus on ways to support families like hers.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not just about what\u2019s the cause but how do we help,\u201d she said.",
      "For Van Den Berghe, Kennedy\u2019s study may hold answers she\u2019s wrestled with since Daniel was diagnosed many years ago. She\u2019s aware that research has found no link between vaccines and autism, but she\u2019s still not convinced. Daniel\u2019s severe reaction to the shots all those years ago is the only thing she can point to as a cause; no one else in her family has been diagnosed with autism.",
      "\u201cWhy did this happen to him?\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve been searching for years and years and years.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "In Uganda, where more than 40% of the population live in extreme poverty, many families live in homes with dirt floors",
      "JINJA, Uganda -- Simon Tigawalana dreamed for years of doing something about the dirt floors in his small house, blaming them for making his family sick. But in a rural area in one of the world's poorest countries, making them over with concrete was simply out of reach.",
      "Then a company called EarthEnable approached him to offer an alternative: a clay-based earthen floor that could give him a durable, sealed floor for less than half the cost of concrete. Tigawalana now has the new floor in two rooms and hopes to add it soon in the last room.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m happy that we now have a decent home and can also comfortably host visitors,\" said Tigawalana, a 56-year-old father of 16. \"Ever since we got a clay floor my kids no longer get cough and flu that used to come from the dust raised while sweeping the dirt floors.\u201d",
      "EarthEnable, which seeks to upgrade housing across Africa, has been promoting and installing the clay-based floors in Uganda since 2017. Besides eliminating dust that can irritate breathing, they're credited with reducing infestations of jiggers \u2014 a parasitic flea that can burrow into the skin and lead to pain, itching and infection. Uganda's health ministry says poor hygiene due to dirt floors contributes to such infestations.",
      "\u201cOur floors help to prevent pathogens and other illnesses linked to dust floors, since most of these families can\u2019t afford hospital care,\u201d said Noeline Mutesi, a sales and marketing manager for EarthEnable.",
      "The first step in building the floor is digging and leveling the surface. Then murram \u2014 local red soil rich in iron and aluminum oxides \u2014 is mixed with sand and water and then compacted. After two weeks of drying time, masons use wooden floats to smooth and further compact the surface. Next is pasting: applying a fine clay screed to further smooth the surface and prepare it for a final sealant, a flaxseed-based varnish that hardens into a durable plastic-like resin.",
      "A typical floor costs around 240,000 Uganda shillings (about $65), which Earth Enable says is about 70% cheaper than concrete. Buyers can pay in installments. EarthEnable, a U.S.-based nonprofit, operates for-profit subsidiaries in Uganda, Rwanda and Kenya, and says any profits are invested into startup costs in new markets as well as research and development.",
      "EarthEnable said it's installed about 5,000 floors in Uganda, more than 39,000 in Rwanda and more than 100 in Kenya. The company also does wall plastering to help reduce dust, moisture and insect infestations common in mud homes.",
      "In Jinja, the company's program employs more than 100 masons from within the community. Many are disadvantaged boys who have dropped out of school because they can't afford fees, said Alex Wanda, a construction officer at the company.",
      "\u201cWe focus on employing these young village boys that we train in skills to build these earthen floors, thus creating for them employment opportunities,\u201d Wanda said in an interview.",
      "About 42% of Ugandans live in extreme poverty. Its Bureau of Statistics says the country has a housing deficit of 2.6 million units, and it's growing. The country needs to add 300,000 housing units per year to make up the deficit, mainly in rural areas, where many Ugandans live and where housing quality and availability remain pressing concerns.",
      "The company also touts the clay floors as a more sustainable alternative to concrete, which besides being more expensive generates major carbon emissions in production.",
      "The cement industry is one of Uganda's biggest contributors to carbon emissions, accounting for about 628,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide in 2023, its highest recorded level. More broadly, building and construction accounts for 37% of global emissions, according to the United Nations Environment Programme.",
      "Uganda, like much of the rest of the world, has seen a rise in extreme weather events made more likely by climate change, including flooding and prolonged drought.",
      "\u201cInitiatives like this are crucial in the global effort to decarbonize the construction sector,\u201d said Penina Atwine, a program officer at the Uganda-based organization Environmental Alert. \u201cSuch innovative local solutions that address both climate change and social needs like EarthEnable\u2019s model could inspire similar approaches across the globe.\"",
      "In the village of Budima, Rehema Namukose spent most of her family's savings to build a house. She couldn't afford a cleaner floor until she worked through EarthEnable to pay for a clay floor in installments. She lives there with her three children and credits the new floor for improving the health of a sickly daughter.",
      "\u201cThis is affordable for my family and will help us maintain hygiene,\u201d she says \u201cWe are now living a better life.\u201d",

      "A ban on disposable vapes has come into force across the U.K. as the British government aims to stem their illegal use by children, reduce litter and prevent the leaking of harmful chemicals into the environment",
      "LONDON -- A ban on disposable vapes came into force across the U.K. on Sunday as the British government aims to stem their use by children, reduce litter and prevent the leaking of harmful chemicals into the environment.",
      "The ban makes it illegal for any retailer \u2014 online or in-store \u2014 to sell vapes, whether they contain nicotine or not. They will still be able to sell reusable vapes.",
      "The crackdown follows the soaring use of disposable vapes in schools and a rising tide of trash as users dispose of the vapes. It is estimated that as many as 5 million disposable vapes are thrown in bins or littered every week across the U.K., rather than being recycled.",
      "A number of countries are seeking to regulate the vape market, which has grown exponentially over the past decade or so. Australia outlawed the sale of vapes outside pharmacies last year in some of the world\u2019s toughest restrictions on electronic cigarettes, while Belgium became the first European Country to ban the use of disposable vapes at the start of this year. California has been at the forefront of bringing in new regulations in the U.S.",
      "The U.K.'s Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said usage among young people remained too high, and the ban would \u201cput an end to their alarming rise in school playgrounds and the avalanche of rubbish flooding the nation\u2019s streets.\u201d",
      "Also known as single-use vapes, disposable vapes are non-refillable and unable to be recharged, and are typically thrown away with general waste or just thrown on the street. Even when they are recycled, they need to be taken apart by hand, while their batteries are a fire risk to recycling facilities and can leak harmful chemicals into the environment and potentially harming wildlife.",
      "Businesses were given six months to prepare for the change by selling any existing stock. Rogue traders who continue to sell them risk a fine of 200 ($260) in the first instance, followed by an unlimited fine or jail time for repeat offending.",
      "The U.K. Vaping Industry Association said its members had moved quickly to comply with the June 1 deadline, but warned of \u201cserious unintended consequences\u201d emanating from too much regulation.",
      "\u201cWe are concerned that this ban will encourage former smokers who have already transitioned from cigarettes, which kill 220 people every day in the U.K, to return to combustible tobacco or opt for unregulated vapes,\" said its director general, John Dunne.",
      "Separately, the British government is legislating to potentially restrict the packaging, marketing and flavors of e-cigarettes.",

      "ROME -- French scientist Etienne-Emile Baulieu, best known as the inventor of the abortion pill, died on Friday aged 98 at his home in Paris, his institute said in a statement.",
      "Both a doctor and a researcher, Baulieu was known around the world for the scientific, medical and social significance of his work on steroid hormones.",
      "\u201cHis research was guided by his attachment to the progress made possible by science, his commitment to women\u2019s freedom, and his desire to enable everyone to live better, longer lives,\u201d the Institut Baulieu said in the statement posted on its website.",
      "Born Etienne Blum in Strasbourg on Dec. 12, 1926, he took the name \u201c\u00c9mile Baulieu\u201d when he joined the French Resistance against the Nazi occupation at the age of 15.",
      "An endocrinologist with a doctorate in medicine completed in 1955 and one in science eight years later, in 1963 Baulieu founded a pioneering research unit working on hormones at INSERM, the French institute for health and medical research. He remained as head of the unit until 1997.",
      "He is best known for his development, in 1982, of RU 486, the so-called \u201cabortion pill\u201d that changed the lives of millions of women throughout the world, offering them the possibility of voluntary medical termination of pregnancy, in physical and psychological safety.",
      "The Institut Baulieu said it was \u201ca non-invasive method, less aggressive and less delayed than surgery,\u201d noting that following his discovery the researcher faced fierce criticism and even threats from opponents of women's abortion rights.",
      "\u201cEven today, access to this method is opposed, banned in some countries, and is currently being challenged in the United States, where it is the most widely used abortion method,\u201d the institute added.",
      "Baulieu\u2019s research into DHEA, a hormone whose secretion and anti-aging activity he had discovered, led him to work on neurosteroids -- or steroids of the nervous system. He also developed an original treatment to combat depression, for which a clinical trial is currently underway in several university hospitals.",
      "In 2008, he founded the Institut Baulieu to understand, prevent and treat neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's.",
      "Honored with the grand crosses of the L\u00e9gion d\u2019honneur (legion of honor) and the Ordre national du M\u00e9rite (national order of merit), he was elected to the French Academy of Sciences in 1982, which he chaired in 2003 and 2004.",
      "He was a member of the national advisory committee on life sciences and health (1996-2002) and received numerous awards, both in France and abroad.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron paid tribute to Baulieu in a post on X, calling him \u201ca beacon of courage\u201d and \u201ca progressive mind who enabled women to win their freedom.\u201d",
      "\u201cFew French people have changed the world to such an extent,\u201d he added.",

      "The attorneys filed a motion Friday to voluntarily dismiss the lawsuit, but did not give a reason for seeking to drop the case. The lawsuit had been filed last year in state court in Louisville on behalf of a woman who was seven weeks pregnant at the time and identified only by the pseudonym Mary Poe to protect her privacy.",

      "\u201cPeople have the right to control their own bodies without government interference, and we will never stop fighting to restore abortion access in Kentucky,\u201d said Amber Duke, executive director of the ACLU of Kentucky. \u201cWe are strategizing our next steps in this fight.\u201d",

      "Americans are losing an array of people and programs dedicated to keeping them healthy",
      "CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Americans are losing a vast array of people and programs dedicated to keeping them healthy. Gone are specialists who were confronting a measles outbreak in Ohio, workers who drove a van to schools in North Carolina to offer vaccinations and a program that provided free tests to sick people in Tennessee.",
      "State and local health departments responsible for invisible but critical work such as inspecting restaurants, monitoring wastewater for new and harmful germs, responding to outbreaks before they get too big \u2014 and a host of other tasks to protect both individuals and communities \u2014 are being hollowed out.",
      "\u201cNobody wants to go swim in a community pool and come out of it with a rash or a disease from it. Nobody wants to walk out their door and take a fresh breath of air and start wheezing,\" said Lori Tremmel Freeman, executive director of the National Association of County and City Health Officials.",
      "But local health officials say they now have no choice but to do a lot less of it. The Trump administration is cutting health spending on an unprecedented scale, experts say, including pulling $11 billion of direct federal support because the pandemic is over and eliminating 20,000 jobs at national health agencies that in part assist and support local public health work. It\u2019s proposing billions more be slashed.",
      "Together, public health leaders said, the cuts are reducing the entire system to a shadow of what it once was, threatening to undermine even routine work at a time when the nation faces the deadliest measles outbreak since at least the 1990s, rising whooping cough cases and the risk that bird flu could spread widely among people.",
      "The moves reflect a shift that Americans may not fully realize, away from the very idea of public health: doing the work that no individual can do alone to safeguard the population as a whole. That's one of the most critical responsibilities of government, notes James Williams, county executive in Santa Clara County, California. And it goes beyond having police and fire departments.",
      "\"It means not having babies suffering from diseases that you vanquished. It means making sure that people have access to the most accurate and up-to-date information and decisions that help their longevity,\u201d Williams said. \u201cIt means having a society and communities able to actually prosper, with people living healthy and full lives.\u201d",
      "Just outside a Charlotte, North Carolina, high school in March, nurse Kim Cristino set out five vaccines as a 17-year-old girl in ripped jeans stepped onto a health department van. The patient barely flinched as Cristino gave her three shots in one arm and two in the other to prevent diseases including measles, diphtheria and polio.",
      "Like many other teens that morning, the girl was getting some shots years later than recommended. The clinic\u2019s appearance at Independence High School gave her a convenient way to get up to date.",
      "\u201cIt lessens the barriers for parents who would have to be taking off from work and trying to get their kids to a provider,\u201d Cristino said.",
      "The vaccinations also help the community around her. The teen won\u2019t come down with a life-threatening disease and the whole community is protected from outbreaks \u2014 if enough people are vaccinated.",
      "The Mecklenburg County department, with \"Protecting and Promoting the Public\u2019s Health\u201d emblazoned on its van, is similar to other U.S. health departments. They run programs to reduce suicides and drug overdoses, improve prenatal health and help people stop smoking. They educate people about health and test for and treat diseases such as HIV and tuberculosis. Some, including Mecklenburg, operate medical and dental clinics too.",
      "\u201cYou come to work every day and think: What\u2019s going to be my challenge today? Sometimes it\u2019s a new disease,\u201d said Raynard Washington, Mecklenburg\u2019s director. \u201cThat\u2019s why having a backbone infrastructure is so important.\u201d",
      "What they do is cost-effective, experts have found. For every dollar spent on childhood immunizations, the country is estimated to save $11; on tobacco cessation, $2-$3; on asthma control, $70.",
      "Critical care can be glamorous \u2014 surgeons, cardiologists and cancer doctors can pull off breathtaking medical feats to save lives at the last possible moment. Prevention work is low key. It\u2019s impossible to identify who was saved because, if it goes well, the person never knows when they\u2019ve fended off a mortal threat with the invisible shield of public health.",
      "\u201cPeople don\u2019t appreciate it,\u201d said Dr. Umair Shah, former health director for Washington state. \u201cTherefore, they don\u2019t invest in it.\u201d",
      "State health departments are funded by a varying mix of federal and state tax money. Some states deliver services in a centralized way while others provide resources to local departments, which generally also get money from counties, cities or towns. Some large cities get direct federal funding for their health departments.",
      "Mecklenburg \u2014 a large department with around 1,000 workers serving 1.2 million people \u2014 has an annual budget of around $135 million, while some metro hospitals have operating expenses in the billions. About 70% of the department's budget comes from local funds, which helps fill gaps in state and federal money. But Mecklenburg is still strapped for cash and resources.",
      "At times, employees work 12- to 14-hour days, especially during outbreaks. Nurse Carmel Jenkins recalled responding to mpox exposures at a day care center \u2014 arriving before 5:30 a.m. to alert the children\u2019s parents and working late into the evening.",
      "\u201cEven though there may be limited resources, we still have a service to provide,\u201d said Jenkins, a director of clinical services for the department. \u201cWe don\u2019t mind going above and beyond to be able to do that.\u201d",
      "In March, the Trump administration pulled $11 billion from state and local health departments without warning under the leadership of Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime anti-vaccine activist and public health critic. The cuts abruptly ended COVID-era grants, which had also been approved for non-COVID work including vaccination and disease detection, tracking and testing.",
      "A week later, thousands of people were laid off at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Many had worked closely with state and local health departments to provide information, grants and other support.",
      "The sudden, one-two punch delivered a serious blow to the system, public health leaders said in interviews, court filings and public testimony.",
      "A Kennedy spokesman said in an email that America remains unhealthy compared with other developed nations and HHS is reorganizing what he said were \u201cbroken systems\u201d and reprioritizing resources to \u201ccentralize programs and functions that will improve our service to the American people.\u201d",
      "\u201cThese cuts are not about abandoning public health \u2014 they\u2019re about reforming it,\u201d spokesman Andrew Nixon said, adding: \u201cWe reject the implication that HHS has turned its back on urgent health threats.\u201d",
      "HHS justified the grant cancellations by saying the money was for COVID and the pandemic is over. But most of the cuts were in areas that are especially important given today\u2019s health threats. The biggest chunk, more than $8.9 billion, involved epidemiology and laboratory capacity related to infectious diseases, while another $2 billion was related to immunizations. In some places, the cuts are on hold due to a federal judge\u2019s order in a lawsuit by states. But elsewhere, cuts are continuing.",
      "In Mecklenburg, for example, 11 community health workers lost their jobs, meaning less outreach to groups like the Hispanic community. All eight employees dedicated to the mobile vaccine program were laid off.",
      "In Columbus, Ohio \u2014 one of several communities in Republican-led states suing over the cuts \u2014 the health department had to lay off nine disease intervention specialists. This left it operating at 25% capacity in its disease tracing and investigation work just as it prepared to address a measles outbreak.",
      "Kansas City, Missouri, will not be able to do its own testing for infectious diseases because the cut came just as the city was about to buy $500,000 worth of equipment. And Nashville had to end a program offering free flu and COVID tests and cancel plans to buy a van to deliver vaccinations.",
      "The cities complained the cuts had created \u201csevere budget uncertainty\u201d and forced them to redirect their limited resources \u201cto respond to the resulting chaos.\u201d",
      "CDC staff cuts are also having a ripple effect on state and local departments. Children who are deaf or hard of hearing will no longer benefit from an early intervention program run by states after everyone who worked on the program at CDC was laid off. The team in the Office on Smoking and Health, which funds state tobacco hotlines that help people quit, was let go.",
      "So was the CDC team that worked to reduce drownings, partly through funding low-cost swimming lessons in local communities. Drownings kill 4,000 people a year in the U.S.",
      "\u201cThe experts who know the things that can be done to help prevent the No. 1 cause of death from children ages 1 to 4 have been eliminated,\u201d Connecticut state health commissioner Dr. Manisha Juthani told a Democratic congressional hearing in April, referring to drownings.",
      "She said the abrupt and disorganized nature of the cuts leaves her department scrambling as officials try to understand what is being cut and to close important programs on the federal government\u2019s impractical timelines.",
      "\u201cThe current uncertainty puts lives at risk,\u201d she said.",
      "The new cuts are especially damaging because health departments are funded differently than other government agencies meant to protect the public: Funding pours in during emergencies and slows to a relative trickle when they subside. Mecklenburg\u2019s Washington notes the contrast with fire departments, which are kept ready at all times, not scrambling to find firefighters and fire trucks when houses are already burning.",
      "With health departments, \u201cthere\u2019s a long-established pattern of boom-and-bust funding,\u201d said Dr. Steven Stack, Kentucky\u2019s public health commissioner and past president of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials.",
      "A temporary surge of money during the pandemic allowed some health departments to expand and strengthen programs. In Alabama, the influx of COVID money allowed the state to reopen a health department in largely rural Coosa County that closed a decade ago due to a lack of money. In California\u2019s Santa Clara County, a COVID-era lab grant paved the way for a new science branch with nearly 50 positions.",
      "But by early this year, most of that money had disappeared, along with other COVID-era grants across the nation \u2014 some because they ended and some because the government rescinded them. Departments were again left brittle and vulnerable.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re facing funding cliff after funding cliff after funding cliff,\u201d said Dr. Sara Cody, Santa Clara County\u2019s health director. \u201cWhat really worries me is I felt that we had finally built the infrastructure in the public health department. ... We were still pretty trim, but we weren\u2019t just, like, bones.\u201d",
      "In Chicago, one-time COVID grants made up 51% of the health department budget, and their ending will push staff numbers below the pre-pandemic level of 588 \u2014 slowing responses to outbreaks and forcing officials to scale back food safety, violence prevention and other programs.",
      "In Mecklenburg, the department lost 180 employees as COVID funds dried up. It also lost a wastewater monitoring partnership with the University of North Carolina at Charlotte that helped the county react quickly to changing COVID variants and could have also been used to detect new threats like bird flu.",
      "The cuts are not over.",
      "The Trump administration has proposed cutting billions more from CDC\u2019s budget, enough to cut the agency\u2019s spending in half. CDC sends about 80 percent of its budget to states and local communities.",
      "Michael Eby, director of clinical services in Mecklenburg, said the relentless cuts to the system leave departments unable to respond to new pandemics and old diseases returning across the United States.",
      "\u201cWithout the appropriate funding, we can\u2019t properly address these threats,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re at risk of them getting out of control and really causing a lot of damage and death to individuals that we could have saved, that we could have protected.\u201d",

      "The nation\u2019s top public health agency has posted new recommendations that healthy children and pregnant women may \u2014 but no longer should \u2014 get COVID-19 vaccinations",
      "NEW YORK -- The nation's top public health agency posted new recommendations that say healthy children and pregnant women may get COVID-19 vaccinations, removing stronger language that those groups should get the shots.",
      "The change comes days after U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced that COVID-19 vaccines will no longer be recommended for healthy children and pregnant women.",
      "But the updated guidance on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's website sends a more nuanced message, saying shots \u201cmay\u201d be given to those groups.",
      "\u201cThe announcement from earlier this week sounded like CDC was going to fully withdraw any statement that could be construed as a recommendation for these vaccines in these populations,\u201d said Jason Schwartz, a Yale University health policy researcher. \u201cIt's not as bad as it could have been.\"",
      "Kennedy announced the coming changes in a 58-second video posted on the social media site X on Tuesday. No one from the CDC was in the video, and CDC officials have referred questions about the announcement to Kennedy and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.",
      "On Thursday, the CDC updated its website. The agency said that shots may be given to children ages 6 months to 17 years who do not have moderate or severe problems with their immune systems. Instead of recommending the shots, the CDC now says parents may decide to get their children vaccinated in consultation with a doctor.",
      "A subtle update to a CDC page on the adult immunization schedule indicated a similar change for the recommendation for pregnant women, excluding them from the routine recommendation made for other adults.",
      "\u201cThe old COVID-19 vaccine recommendations for healthy children under 18 and for pregnant women have been removed from the CDC vaccine schedule,\u201d a HHS spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cThe CDC and HHS encourage individuals to talk with their healthcare provider about any personal medical decision.\"",
      "That kind of recommendation, known as shared decision-making, still means health insurers must pay for the vaccinations, according to the CDC. However, experts say vaccination rates tend to be lower when health authorities use that language and doctors are less emphatic with patients about getting shots.",
      "Childhood vaccination rates for COVID-19 are already low \u2014 just 13% of children and 23% of adults have received the 2024-25 COVID-19 vaccine, according to CDC data.",
      "Talk of changing the recommendations has been brewing. As the COVID-19 pandemic has waned, experts have discussed the possibility of focusing vaccination efforts on people 65 and older \u2014 who are among those most as risk for death and hospitalization.",
      "A CDC advisory panel is set to meet in June to make recommendations about the fall shots. Among its options are suggesting shots for high-risk groups but still giving lower-risk people the choice to get vaccinated. A committee work group has endorsed the idea.",
      "But Kennedy, a leading anti-vaccine advocate before becoming health secretary, decided not to wait for the scientific panel\u2019s review.",
      "The new vaccine recommendation changes, their timing and the way there were announced have created confusion that can be \"incredibly harmful to the success of vaccination programs,\u201d Schwartz said.",
      "\u201cIt would be understandable if the public is completely baffled in terms of what the federal government thinks and what the science suggests ... about the evidence for the safety and value of these vaccines,\u201d he added.",

      "Carlos Alcaraz has been wearing nasal strips in some matches since last season",
      "PARIS -- If more tennis players find themselves breathing easier, it might just be thanks to Carlos Alcaraz.",
      "The four-time Grand Slam champion, whose bid for a second consecutive French Open title was scheduled to continue with a third-round match Friday night, has often worn a nasal strip in matches since last season \u2014 although not during his first two contests at Roland-Garros this week \u2014 and the sport's other athletes took note.",
      "After all, if Alcaraz finds something useful on the court, their thinking goes, maybe it makes sense to give the adhesive bands a shot.",
      "\u201cI saw Carlos playing in it,\u201d said 18-year-old Mirra Andreeva, a semifinalist in Paris last year and the No. 6 women's seed this time. \u201cI\u2019d be pretty interested to try and see if there is really a difference. If he plays matches in it, then probably there is.\u201d",
      "At the 2024 season-ending ATP Finals last November, Alcaraz said: \u201cIt is something that I\u2019m going to wear more often. I could recover better between points.\u201d",
      "Once associated with Pro Football Hall of Famer Jerry Rice and soccer stars like Cristiano Ronaldo and Neymar, the bands, which essentially look like a Band-Aid worn across the bridge of the nose, are popping up on tennis courts \u2014 sometimes out of necessity, sometimes out of curiosity.",
      "They are designed to open the nostrils slightly, making it easier to breathe through the nose. Originally marketed to reduce snoring, they\u2019re being embraced to enhance air intake during physical exertion.",
      "The idea is simple: Better breathing could mean better oxygen intake.",
      "In practice, the science is less convincing.",
      "In 2021, Brazilian academic Ricardo Dinardi reviewed more than 600 studies on nasal strips and found they didn\u2019t make a real difference in how much air athletes took in, their heart rate or how strenuous exercise felt.",
      "\u201cThe effect on athletic performance is mostly placebo,\u201d Dinardi said. \u201cBut in elite sports, even perceived benefits can count.\u201d",
      "Three-time major finalist Casper Ruud, who wore the strips in matches earlier this year, knows the evidence is shaky. But he still liked using them \u2014 both on the court and while sleeping. Like Alcaraz, Ruud did not wear one in Paris before his second-round exit.",
      "But he has been testing a prototype of a different version.",
      "\u201cI tried out a device that\u2019s very early in development. It will be a bit more comfortable to wear, because it\u2019s inside the nose and it looks like I have this bullring under,\u201d said Ruud, who was the runner-up at Roland-Garros to Rafael Nadal in 2022 and Novak Djokovic in 2023. \u201cIt will return, don\u2019t worry.\u201d",
      "For other players, like Nicol\u00e1s Jarry, the strips are more than a trend \u2014 they\u2019re a necessity. After nasal surgery in 2020, the Chilean still needed help to draw air into his nose, so he puts them on for every practice and every match he plays.",
      "\u201cWithout it, I cannot breathe. My nostrils shut when I try,\u201d he said, inhaling to demonstrate for a reporter. \u201cOthers don\u2019t have that issue and still use them.\u201d",
      "Jarry definitely has noticed a recent spike in interest among players. He said that even though he's worn the strips for years, including at this French Open, other competitors on tour never asked about them \u2014 until Alcaraz started wearing one last year, sometimes in black, sometimes in pink.",
      "\u201cOthers have asked me, and many are trying it,\" said Jarry, who sported a beige-colored strip in Paris. \"But before him? Nothing.\u201d",
      "There are those, like 2024 US Open runner-up Jessica Pegula, who are tempted to try.",
      "\u201cI have a horrible deviated septum. I can\u2019t really breathe out of one side of my nose,\" said Pegula, who will play 2023 Wimbledon champion Marketa Vondrousova in the third round Saturday. \u201cMaybe I should start wearing one.\u201d",
      "She admits, though, that the aesthetic aspect might be a deal-breaker.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know,\" Pegula said with a smile, \u201cif I have the confidence to rock one.\u201d",

      "Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who was a longtime anti-vaccine activist, said this week that the shots are no longer recommended for healthy children and pregnant women, usurping a decision normally made by scientific experts, not political appointees.",
      "The announcement follows an earlier Trump administration step to limit COVID-19 vaccinations among healthy people under age 65.",
      "Until now, the U.S. \u2013 following guidance from independent experts who advise the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \u2013 has recommended yearly COVID-19 vaccinations for everyone age 6 months and older.",
      "Together, the moves have left health experts, vaccine makers and insurers uncertain about what to advise and what comes next.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to add a lot of confusion overall,\u201d said Ajay Sethi, an epidemiologist at the University of Wisconsin, Madison.",
      "Some of this season\u2019s vaccine is still available. Insurance industry experts say if people had insurance coverage before Kennedy\u2019s announcement, it\u2019s highly unlikely that would have ended instantly based on the secretary\u2019s video announcement. That means if someone could find a shot, they'd likely be able to get one for now.",
      "Who will be able to get what vaccines this fall is still unclear.",
      "Vaccine manufacturers plan to issue updated COVID-19 shots in the late summer or fall. But the Food and Drug Administration has said it plans to limit approval of seasonal shots to seniors and others at high risk, pending more studies of everyone else.",
      "Even if the U.S. approves vaccines only for certain groups, it still may be possible for others to get the shot depending on the outcome of upcoming advisory meetings, regulatory moves and decisions from insurers and employers.",
      "Insurers base coverage decisions on the recommendations of that CDC panel, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. It\u2019s not clear what role that panel now will play. Paying out of pocket could cost about $200.",
      "But some insurers and employers may decide to still cover the shots regardless of the new recommendations, said Jen Kates, a senior vice president at the non-profit KFF, which studies health care issues. She noted that they may view the expense as worthwhile if it avoids a higher bill from someone hospitalized by the coronavirus.",
      "The FDA published a list of health conditions it said would qualify, including asthma, cancer, diabetes, obesity and physical inactivity. The CDC has a more extensive list.",
      "But, again, it isn't yet known how this will play out. For example, it could be hard for people to prove they're qualified. If they're vaccinated at a drugstore, for instance, the pharmacist wouldn't normally know about underlying health problems or even ask. Kates said it's unclear whether Kennedy's move would affect whether doctors recommend the shot.",
      "And Sethi, the UW-Madison expert, said \u201cthis elephant in the room\u201d is that blocking vaccination to the healthy may mean people who have a risk factor and simply don't know it will miss out.",
      "Adding to the confusion, the FDA included pregnancy and recent pregnancy on the list of conditions that would qualify someone for a shot \u2014 but Kennedy said that pregnancy was no longer a qualification in his announcement this week.",
      "COVID-19 complications during pregnancy can include preterm birth as well as serious illness in the mother, and the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine said it \u201cstrongly reaffirms\u201d its recommendation for vaccination during pregnancy.",

      "A verdict is expected in one of France's largest-ever child sex abuse cases",
      "A French court will deliver its verdict Wednesday in one of the country\u2019s largest-ever child sex abuse cases, which has raised questions about how a pedophile surgeon was able to rape hundreds of victims over a period spanning more than two decades.",
      "Jo\u00ebl Le Scouarnec, a 74-year-old former surgeon, stands accused of raping and sexually assaulting 299 children. On Friday, prosecutors requested the maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, describing Le Scouarnec as \u201ca devil in a white coat.\u201d He's already serving a 15-year prison sentence, for a conviction in 2020 for the rape and sexual assault of four children, including two nieces.",
      "The new trial in Brittany, western France, began in February and has laid bare a pattern of abuse between 1989 and 2014. Most of the victims were unconscious or sedated hospital patients at the time of the assaults. The average age was 11. Among the victims were 158 boys and 141 girls.",
      "During the trial, advocacy groups have accused health authorities of inaction after they were notified as soon as 2005 of Le Scouarnec\u2019s conviction for possessing child pornography pictures.",
      "At the time, no measures were taken to suspend his medical license or limit his contact with children and Le Scouarnec continued his abuse in hospitals until his arrest in 2017.",
      "\u201cShould Jo\u00ebl Le Scouarnec have been the only one in the defendant\u2019s box?\u201d prosecutor St\u00e9phane Kellenberger asked during his closing arguments.",
      "\u201cMore could have been done,\" Kellenberger said. \"Things could have been done differently, even within the notorious layers of French bureaucracy, where responsibilities are so often passed from one authority to another until, eventually, that responsibility is lost, and hits innocent lives.\"",
      "Le Scouarnec has confessed to all the sexual abuse alleged by the 299 civil parties, as well as to other assaults that are now beyond the statute of limitations. In a shocking admission during the trial, he also acknowledged sexually abusing his granddaughter \u2014 a statement made in front of her visibly distraught parents.",
      "Le Scouarnec had been convicted in 2005 for possessing and importing child sexual abuse material and sentenced to four months of suspended prison time. Despite that conviction, he was appointed as a hospital practitioner the following year. Child protection groups that have joined the proceedings as civil parties hope that the case will help strengthen the legal framework to prevent such abuse.",
      "Le Scouarnec\u2019s trial came as activists continue to push to dismantle taboos that have long surrounded sexual abuse in France. The most prominent case was that of Gis\u00e8le P\u00e9licot, who was drugged and raped by her now ex-husband and dozens of other men who were convicted and sentenced in December to three to 20 years in prison.",
      "In a separate case focusing on alleged abuse at a Catholic school, an inquiry commission of the National Assembly, France\u2019s lower house of parliament, is investigating allegations of physical and sexual abuse over five decades.",
      "Victims of Le Scouarnec have, however, complained of a perceived lack of attention.",
      "\"This trial, which could have served as an open-air laboratory to expose the serious failings of our institutions, seems to leave no mark on the government, the medical community, or society at large,\u201d a group of victims said in a statement.",
      "Not all victims were initially aware they had been abused. Some were contacted by investigators after their names appeared in journals kept by Le Scouarnec, in which he meticulously documented his crimes. Others only realized they had been hospitalized at the time after checking medical records. Two of his victims took their own lives some years before the trial.",
      "Using the cover of medical procedures, the former abdominal and digestive surgeon took advantage of moments when children were alone in their hospital rooms. His method was to disguise sexual abuse as clinical care, targeting young patients who were unlikely to remember the encounters.",
      "The notebooks, which detail the abuse in graphic language, have become central to the prosecution\u2019s case.",
      "Despite the scope of the allegations, Le Scouarnec has remained calm and composed throughout the trial.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t see them as people,\u201d he told the court. \u201cThey were the destination of my fantasies. As the trial went on, I began to see them as individuals, with emotions, anger, suffering and distress.\u201d",
      "He said his first act of abuse occurred in 1985, when he raped his 5-year-old niece.",
      "While he offered apologies to some victims, his demeanor struck many as detached and emotionless.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t show emotion, that\u2019s just how I am,\u201d he said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t feel it, but I don\u2019t express it.\u201d",
      "The case first came to light in April 2017, when a 6-year-old neighbor told her mother that the man next door had exposed himself and touched her through the fence separating their properties.",
      "A search of his home uncovered more than 300,000 photos, 650 pedophilic, zoophilic and scatological video files, as well as notebooks where he described himself as a pedophile and detailed his actions.",
      "\u201cJo\u00ebl Le Scouarnec says he no longer feels any sexual attraction to children, but there\u2019s no way to verify that,\u201d Kellenberger, the prosecutor, told the court. \u201cExperts concluded that we cannot rely on his word alone and that his potential for future danger remains significant.\u201d",
      "Prosecutors are seeking not only a 20-year prison sentence with a two-thirds minimum term, but also a post-sentence preventive detention, a rarely used measure in France that applies to the country\u2019s most dangerous offenders. If approved, Le Scouarnec could be held indefinitely in a secure socio-medical facility, even after serving his time.",
      "A third trial is expected in the coming years, following the emergence of new allegations during this trial, including further abuse involving his granddaughter.",

      "The ruling comes after a group of six nonbinary people filed a lawsuit against Puerto Rico\u2019s governor, its health secretary and other officials.",

      "Millions of South Koreans are voting for a new president in a snap election triggered by the ouster of Yoon Suk Yeol, a conservative who faces a criminal trial over his short-lived imposition of martial law in December",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- Millions of South Koreans are voting Tuesday for a new president in a snap election triggered by the ouster of Yoon Suk Yeol, a conservative who now faces an explosive trial on rebellion charges over his short-lived imposition of martial law in December.",
      "Pre-election surveys suggested Yoon\u2019s liberal archrival, Lee Jae-myung, appeared headed for an easy win, riding on deep public frustration over the conservatives in the wake of Yoon\u2019s martial law debacle.",
      "The main conservative candidate, Kim Moon Soo, has struggled to win over moderate, swing voters as his People Power Party remains in a quagmire of internal feuding over how to view Yoon\u2019s actions.",
      "This election serves as another defining moment in the country\u2019s resilient democracy, but observers worry a domestic divide worsened by Yoon is far from over and could pose a big political burden on the new president.",
      "The past six months saw large crowds of people rallying in the streets to either denounce or support Yoon, while a leadership vacuum caused by Yoon\u2019s impeachment and ensuing formal dismissal rattled the country\u2019s high-level diplomatic activities and financial markets.",
      "The winning candidate will immediately be sworn in as president Wednesday for a single, full term of five years without the typical two-month transition period. The new president will face major challenges including a slowing economy, President Donald Trump\u2019s America-first policies and North Korea\u2019s evolving nuclear threats.",
      "The election commission says voting began at 6 a.m. at 14,295 polling stations nationwide that will close at 8 p.m. Observers say the winner could emerge as early as midnight.",
      "Lee, whose Democratic Party led the legislative effort to oust Yoon, has emerged as the clear frontrunner in opinion surveys released in recent weeks.",
      "More than 15 million people already have cast ballots during a two-day early voting period last week, accounting for nearly 35% of the country\u2019s 44.4 million eligible voters.",
      "In his final campaign speeches Monday, Lee promised to revitalize the economy, reduce inequality and ease national divisions. He urged the people to vote for him, arguing that a win by Kim would allow Yoon\u2019s \u201crebellion forces\u201d to return.",
      "\u201cIf they somehow win, that would mean the return of the rebellion forces, the destruction of democracy, the deprival of people\u2019s human rights, the normalization of martial law and our country\u2019s downfall into a backward, third-world nation,\u201d Lee told the crowd gathered at a Seoul park.",
      "Kim, a former labor minister under Yoon, warned that a Lee win would allow him to wield excessive power, launch political retaliation against opponents and legislate laws to protect him from various legal troubles, as his party already controls parliament.",
      "Lee \u201cis now trying to seize all power in South Korea and establish a Hitler-like dictatorship,\u201d Kim told a rally in the southeastern city of Busan.",
      "Lee, who led the opposition-led campaign to oust Yoon, has been a highly divisive figure in South Korean politics for years.",
      "As a former child laborer known for his inspirational rags-to-riches story, Lee came to fame through biting criticism of the country\u2019s conservative establishment and calls to build a more assertive South Korea in foreign policy. That rhetoric has given him an image as someone who can institute sweeping reforms and fix the country\u2019s deep-seated economic inequality and corruption.",
      "His critics view him as a dangerous populist who relies on a political division and backpedals on promises too easily.",
      "On foreign policy, Lee has not made any contentious remarks recently and has steadfastly vowed to pursue pragmatic diplomacy. He has called South Korea\u2019s alliance with the U.S. the foundation of its foreign policy and promised to solidify a trilateral Seoul-Washington-Tokyo partnership, a stance that is not much different than the position held by South Korea\u2019s conservatives.",
      "Experts say there aren\u2019t many diplomatic options for South Korea as it tries to address Trump\u2019s tariff hikes and calls for South Korea to pay more for the cost of the U.S. military presence, as well as North Korea\u2019s headlong pursuit of nuclear weapons. Experts say that has made both Lee and Kim avoid unveiling ambitious foreign policy goals.",
      "Lee\u2019s government still could become engaged in \u201ca little bit of friction\u201d with the Trump administration, while Kim\u2019s government, which prioritize relations with Washington, will likely offer more concessions to the U.S., said Chung Jin-young, a former dean of the Graduate School of Pan-Pacific International Studies at South Korea\u2019s Kyung Hee University.",
      "Chung predicted Lee won\u2019t be able to pursue overly drastic steps on foreign policy and security, given the country\u2019s foreign exchange and financial markets are very vulnerable to such changes.",
      "Lee has preached patience over Trump\u2019s tariff policy, arguing it would be a mistake to rush negotiations in pursuit of an early agreement with Washington. Kim has said he would meet Trump as soon as possible.",
      "On Monday, South Korean trade officials held an emergency meeting to discuss a response to Trump\u2019s announcement that the U.S. will raise tariffs on steel and aluminum products to 50% beginning June 4.",
      "South Korea\u2019s central bank last week sharply lowered its 2025 growth outlook to 0.8%, citing the potential impact of Trump\u2019s tariff hikes and weak domestic demand worsened by the political turmoil of past months.",
      "Relations with North Korea remain badly strained since 2019, with the North focused on expanding its nuclear arsenal while refusing dialogues with South Korea and the U.S.",
      "Since his second term began in January, Trump has repeatedly expressed his intent to resume diplomacy with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, but Kim has so far ignored the offer while making Russia his priority in foreign policy.",
      "Lee, who wants warmer ties with North Korea, recently acknowledged it would be \u201cvery difficult\u201d to realize a summit with Kim Jong Un anytime soon. Lee said he would support Trump\u2019s push to restart talks with Kim Jong Un, which he believed would eventually allow South Korea to be involved in some projects in North Korea.",
      "Foreign policy strategists for Lee understand there isn\u2019t much South Korea can do to bring about a denuclearization of North Korea, said Paik Wooyeal, a professor at Seoul\u2019s Yonsei University.",
      "He said Lee also doesn\u2019t share the Korean nationalistic zeal held by ex-liberal President Moon Jae-in, who met Kim Jong Un three times during his 2017-22 term.",

      "JOHANNESBURG -- A second group of white South Africans has arrived in the United States under a refugee program announced by the Trump administration, officials and advocacy groups said Monday.",
      "Nine people, including families and children, arrived late last week, said Jaco Kleynhans, head of international liaison at the Solidarity Movement, a group representing members of South Africa's white Afrikaner minority. The group traveled on a commercial flight, he said.",
      "A spokesperson for the U.S. Embassy said in an email to The Associated Press that \u201crefugees continue to arrive in the United States from South Africa on commercial flights as part of the Afrikaner resettlement program\u2019s ongoing operations.\u201d",
      "An initial group of 59 white South Africans arrived at Dulles International Airport in Virginia on a chartered flight last month under the new program announced by U.S. President Donald Trump in February. The Trump administration fast-tracked the resettlement of white South Africans after indefinitely suspending other U.S. refugee programs.",
      "The Trump administration said it is offering refugee status to white South Africans it alleges are being persecuted by their Black-led government and are victims of racially motivated violence. The South African government has denied the allegations and said they are a mischaracterization of the country.",
      "Trump has falsely claimed that white South African farmers are targeted in widespread attacks that amount to genocide and are having their land taken away. Trump confronted South African President Cyril Ramaphosa with those baseless claims during a meeting at the White House last month.",
      "Ramaphosa has said the relatively small number of attacks on white farmers are part of South Africa\u2019s larger problems with violent crime, which affects all races.",
      "The Trump administration initially said the refugee program was aimed at members of South Africa's Afrikaner minority, who are descendants of mainly Dutch and French colonial settlers. In new guidance published by the U.S. Embassy last month, applicants must be \u201ca member of a racial minority\u201d in South Africa and \u201cmust be able to articulate a past experience of persecution or fear of future persecution.\u201d",
      "There are approximately 2.7 million Afrikaners among South Africa's population of 62 million, which is more than 80% Black. They are not the only white minority. There are around 4.5 million whites in total, including those with British or other heritage.",

      "While U.S. officials have not said how many South Africans have applied to be relocated, Kleynhans said there have been around 8,000 applications. Another group helping white South Africans apply for refugee status has said tens of thousands have applied.",

      "Now an international team of archaeologists has found new evidence to support the theory.",
      "The team undertook testing to determine the construction dates of some of the massive earthen structures and found that they spanned several centuries, beginning around the time of a famous slave rebellion in the 9th century A.D. The research findings were published Monday in the journal Antiquity.",
      "The enslaved people from that era are known today as the \u201cZanj,\u201d a medieval Arabic term for the East African Swahili coast, although there are different theories about where in Africa most of them actually came from.",
      "They carried out a large-scale revolt in Iraq in 869 AD under the Abbasid state, known today as the \u201cZanj rebellion.\u201d The rebellion lasted for more than a decade until the Abbasid state regained control of the region in 883 A.D.",
      "Many descendants of those enslaved people now live in the southern port city of Basra in modern-day Iraq.",

      "Their findings demonstrate \u201cthat these features were in use for a substantially longer period than previously assumed and, as such, they represent an important piece of Iraqi landscape heritage,\u201d the researchers wrote.",
      "The finding comes at the time of a resurgence of archaeology in Iraq, a country often referred to as the \u201ccradle of civilization,\u201d but where archaeological exploration has been stunted by decades of conflict that halted excavations and led to the looting of tens of thousands of artifacts.",

      "From there, the drones flew to strike Russia\u2019s strategic bombers. Social media footage shared by Russian media on the day of the attack showed drones rising from inside the containers. By the end, over 40 Russian warplanes were severely damaged or destroyed with costs estimated to be around $7 billion, according to Ukraine's security service.",
      "Among the most striking targets was Belaya air base in the Siberian region of Irkutsk \u2014 over 4,000 kilometers (2,500 miles) away from Ukraine.",
      "Russia\u2019s Defense Ministry in a statement confirmed the attacks, saying they damaged aircraft and sparked fires on air bases in the Irkutsk region, as well as the Murmansk region in the north. It said strikes were also repelled in the Amur region in Russia\u2019s Far East and in the western regions of Ivanovo and Ryazan, the ministry said.",
      "There was no way to independently verify the claims from either side.",
      "Strategic aircraft, including the A-50, Tu-95 and Tu-22M, were destroyed in the attack, according to the SBU.",
      "Moscow has previously used Tu-95 and Tu-22M long-range bombers to launch missiles at Ukraine, while A-50s are used to coordinate targets and detect air defenses and guided missiles. Ukraine has long hoped to degrade Russia\u2019s ability to deploy bombers that launch deadly missile barrages against Ukrainian cities, against which Kyiv has limited means to respond.",
      "The loss of the planes could reduce Russia\u2019s ability to deliver devastating missile barrages against Ukraine.",
      "The attack comes right as Moscow has unleashed a record-breaking number of drones and missiles against Ukraine to degrade domestic weapons production capabilities, shatter morale and consume Kyiv\u2019s limited quantities of air defense missiles. Often these attacks have also struck civilians.",
      "The attack also gives Ukraine a morale boost at a time when peace talks have sputtered and could undermine Russian confidence that it can win the war with ease.",
      "It was launched a day before a round of direct peace talks took place in Istanbul on Monday. It also occurred on the same day as Russia launched a record number of 472 drones against Ukraine in yet another barrage.",
      "\u201cThe enemy thought it could bomb Ukraine and kill Ukrainians with impunity and without end. But that is not the case. We will respond to Russian terror and destroy the enemy everywhere \u2014 at sea, in the air, and on land,\u201d said the head of the SBU, Vasyl Maliuk, on Monday.",
      "\u201cAnd if necessary, we\u2019ll get them from underground too,\u201d he added.",
      "Despite suffering setbacks and shortcomings on the battlefield, throughout the war Kyiv has sought to focus on Russia\u2019s rear to cripple and neutralize combat capabilities.",
      "Sunday\u2019s operation is perhaps the most brazen in a series mounted by Ukraine.",
      "In April 2022, Ukraine sank the Moskva, the flagship of Russia\u2019s Black Sea Fleet, after striking it with two Ukrainian Neptune anti-ship missiles. The sinking marked a major Ukrainian victory in the war.",
      "In October 2022, a Ukrainian attack damaged the Kerch Bridge, which links Russia to Moscow-annexed Crimea. The bridge, which holds important strategic and symbolic value, was hit again in July 2023.",
      "A year later, in August 2024, Ukrainian forces launched a daring military incursion into Russia\u2019s Kursk region, the first time Russian territory was occupied by an invader since World War II. It dealt a humiliating blow to the Kremlin. Russia claimed in April 2025 that it had fully reclaimed the border territory, though Ukraine insists it still has troops present there.",

      "Xu joined the PLA in 1966 just as China was plunged into the violent decade-long Cultural Revolution under Communist China\u2019s founder Mao Zedong.",
      "After climbing the ranks, Xu wielded considerable influence as a vice chairman of the Central Military Commission without, it appears, falling afoul of China's party anti-corruption forces, who brought down several other high ranking retired and serving military leaders, including two former defense ministers. China has offered no information on the situation involving the pair, stirring rumors of a major shakeup in the ranks concerning corruption or spying for the U.S..",
      "China has not fought a major campaign since the 1950-53 Korean War, so Xu built his career largely on his adherence to the party line and fealty to the leader of the time, who like Xi now, serves as chairman of the Central Military Commission.",
      "In a February 2018 report, the official Xinhua News Agency quoted Xu as calling on the Chinese army to \u201cthoroughly study and implement the spirit of the 19th party National Congress and President Xi Jinping\u2019s strategy for strengthening the military.\u201d",
      "Xu also helped oversee the PLA's transformation into a modern fighting force, eliminating its Cold War-era jets for stealth fighters and nuclear bombers.",
      "Xu also met with foreign delegations, including then-U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis in 2018, with whom he discussed \u201cthe importance of substantive military-to-military contacts to reduce risk and strategic uncertainty.\u201d Relations between the militaries have since nose-dived, along with relations in general.",

      "The European Union is preparing \u201ccountermeasures\u201d against the United States if the two sides cannot reach a deal after surprise U.S. tariffs on steel rattled global markets and complicated the ongoing negotiations between Brussels and Washington",
      "BARCELONA, Spain -- The European Union on Monday said it is preparing \u201ccountermeasures\u201d against the United States after the Trump administration's surprise tariffs on steel rattled global markets and complicated the ongoing, wider tariff negotiations between Brussels and Washington.",
      "Last week, ahead of Friday's surprise announcement, EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and U.S. President Donald Trump agreed to \u201caccelerate talks\u201d on a deal. \u201cIn the event that our negotiations do not lead to a balanced outcome, the EU is prepared to impose countermeasures, including in response to this latest tariff increase,\u201d European Commission spokesperson Olof Gill told a press conference in Brussels.",
      "He said the EU is finalizing an expanded list of countermeasures that would automatically take effect on July 14 or earlier. That\u2019s the date when a 90-day pause, intended to ease negotiations, ends in tariffs announced by the two economic powerhouses on each other. About halfway through that grace period, Trump announced a 50% tariffs on steel imports.",
      "Trump\u2019s return to the White House has come with an unrivaled barrage of tariffs, with levies threatened, added and, often, taken away. Top officials at the EU\u2019s executive commission says they\u2019re pushing hard for a trade deal to avoid a 50% tariff on imported goods.",
      "Negotiations will continue on Wednesday in Paris in a meeting between the EU\u2019s top trade negotiator, Maro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d, and his counterpart, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer.",
      "The EU could buy more liquefied natural gas and defense items from the U.S., and lower duties on cars, but it isn't likely to budge on calls to scrap the value added tax \u2014 which is akin to a sales tax \u2014 or open up the EU to American beef.",
      "The EU has offered the U.S. a \u201czero for zero\u201d outcome in which tariffs would be removed on both sides for industrial goods including autos. Trump has dismissed that, but EU officials have said it\u2019s still on the table.",
      "The announcement Friday of a staggering 50% levy on steel imports stoked fear that big-ticket purchases from cars to washing machines to houses could see major price increases. But those metals are also so ubiquitous in packaging that they\u2019re likely to pack a punch across consumer products.",

      "The AP and Frontline spoke with more than 80 adoptees in the U.S., Australia and Europe and examined thousands of pages of documents to reveal evidence of kidnapped or missing children ending up abroad, fabricated child origins, babies switched with one another and parents told their newborns were gravely sick or dead, only to discover decades later they\u2019d been sent to new parents overseas.",

      "\u201cWe have to recognize the world has changed,\" Starmer told the BBC. \u201cWith greater instability than there has been for many, many years, and greater threats.\u201d",
      "The government is to respond to a strategic defense review commissioned by Starmer and led by George Robertson, a former U.K. defense secretary and NATO secretary general. It's the first such review since 2021, and lands in a world shaken and transformed by Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, and by the re-election of President Donald Trump last year.",
      "Months after Britain's last major defense review was published in 2021, then-Prime Minister Boris Johnson said with confidence that the era of \u201cfighting big tank battles on European landmass\u201d are over. Three months later, Russian tanks rolled into Ukraine.",
      "Starmer's center-left Labour Party government says it will accept all 62 recommendations made in the review, aiming to help the U.K. confront growing threats on land, air sea and in cyberspace.",
      "Defense Secretary John Healey said the changes would send \u201ca message to Moscow, and transform the country's military following decades of retrenchment, though he said he does not expect the number of soldiers \u2014 currently at a historic low \u2014 to rise until the early 2030s.",
      "Healey said plans for defense spending to hit 2.5% of national income by 2027 a year are \u201con track\u201d and that there's \u201cno doubt\u201d it will hit 3% before 2034.",
      "Starmer said the 3% goal is an \u201cambition,\u201d rather than a firm promise, and it's unclear where the cash-strapped Treasury will find the money. The government has already, contentiously, cut international aid spending to reach the 2.5% target.",
      "Starmer said he wouldn't make a firm pledge until he knew \u201cprecisely where the money is coming from.\u201d",
      "Even 3% falls short of what some leaders in NATO think is needed to deter Russia from future attacks on its neighbors. NATO chief Mark Rutte says leaders of the 32 member countries will debate a commitment to spend at least 3.5% of GDP on defense when they meet in the Netherlands this month.",
      "Monday's announcements include building \u201cup to 12\u201d nuclear-powered, conventionally armed submarines under the AUKUS partnership with Australia and the United States.

      "Starmer said rearming would create a \u201cdefense dividend\u201d of well-paid jobs \u2014 a contrast to the post-Cold War \u201cpeace dividend\u201d that saw Western nations channel money away from defense into other areas.",

      "Healey said Russia is \u201cattacking the U.K. daily,\u201d with 90,000 cyberattacks from state-linked sources directed at the U.K.\u2019s defense over the last two years. A cyber command to counter such threats is expected to be set up as part of the review.",
      "\u201cThis is a message to Moscow,\u201d Healey told the BBC.",
      "It's also a message to Trump that Europe is heeding his demand for NATO members to spend more on their own defense.",
      "European countries, led by the U.K. and France, have scrambled to coordinate their defense posture as Trump transforms American foreign policy, seemingly sidelining Europe as he looks to end the war in Ukraine. Trump has long questioned the value of NATO and complained that the U.S. provides security to European countries that don\u2019t pull their weight.",

    "story": [
      "Mexico is holding its first ever judicial elections",
      "MEXICO CITY -- Mexico held its first-ever judicial elections Sunday, stirring controversy and sowing confusion among voters who struggled to understand a process set to transform the country's court system.",
      "Polls closed and poll workers began counting colored ballots Sunday night with the question hanging in the air of what will become of Mexico's judiciary, the answer to which will only emerge in the coming days as results roll in.",
      "Mexico's electoral authority announced late in the night that 13% of Mexico's 100 million voters cast ballots at the polls, lagging far behind the 60% turnout just a year before during the country's presidential election.",
      "Nevertheless, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum called the voting \u201ca complete success.\"",
      "\u201cMexico is the most democratic country in the world,\u201d she added.",
      "Experts warned of startling low turnout in the lead up to the historic elections due to the mindboggling array of unfamiliar choices and the novelty of voting for judges. Experts say those factors may throw into question the legitimacy of the election, which has faced months of fierce scrutiny.",
      "Sheinbaum, a member of Mexico\u2019s ruling party, Morena, rejected the criticisms and insisted the election would only only make Mexico more democratic and root out corruption in a system that most people in the country believe is broken.",
      "\u201cWhoever says that there is authoritarianism in Mexico is lying,\u201d she said. \u201cMexico is a country that is only becoming more free, just and democratic because that is the will of the people.\u201d",
      "While some voters said they felt pushed to vote in an election they felt would determine the fate of the country\u2019s democracy, many more expressed a deep sense of apathy, citing disillusionment due to decades of corruption and lack of basic information about the vote.",
      "\u201cI'm not interested (in voting). Parties and their messages \u2014 they come and they go. It's all the same,\u201d said Raul Bernal, a 50-year-old factory worker in downtown Mexico City walking is dog.",
      "Even without the final tally, the results of the vote are set to transform Mexico's judiciary. Morena overhauled the court system late last year, fueling protests and criticism that the reform is an attempt by those in power to seize on their political popularity to gain control of the branch of government until now out of their reach.",
      "\u201cIt's an effort to control the court system, which has been a sort of thorn in the side\" of those in power, said Laurence Patin, director of the legal organization Juicio Justo in Mexico. \u201cBut it's a counter-balance, which exists in every healthy democracy.\u201d",
      "Instead of judges being appointed on a system of merit and experience, Mexican voters have cast ballots to choose between some 7,700 candidates vying for more than 2,600 judicial positions.",
      "Some of the country's voting centers opened with only a trickle of people and small lines forming throughout the day.",
      "Esteban Hern\u00e1ndez, a 31-year-old veterinary student, said he didn\u2019t agree with electing judges and doesn\u2019t support Morena, but came to vote because \u201csince there isn\u2019t much participation, my vote will count more.\u201d",
      "He had studied the candidates on a website listing their qualifications and decided to pick those who had doctorates. Other critics said they only voted for the Supreme Court and other top courts.",
      "Francisco Torres de Le\u00f3n, a 62-year-old retired teacher in southern Mexico, called the process \"painstaking because there are too many candidates and positions that they\u2019re going to fill.\u201d",
      "Sheinbaum's predecessor and political mentor, former President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, who had pushed through the judicial reform but remained out of the public eye since leaving office last year, voted in Chiapas near his ranch.",
      "\u201cI wanted to participate in this historic election,\u201d he said. \u201cNever in the history of our country \u2026 have the people decided and had the right to elect judges.\u201d",
      "The process has raised concerns.",
      "Civil society organizations like Defensorxs have raised red flags about a range of candidates running for election, including lawyers who represented some of Mexico's most feared cartel leaders and local officials who were forced to resign from their positions due to corruption scandals.",
      "Also among those putting themselves forward are ex-convicts imprisoned for years for drug trafficking to the United States and a slate of candidates with ties to a religious group whose spiritual leader is behind bars in California after pleading guilty to sexually abusing minors.",
      "Others like Martha Tamayo, a lawyer and former congresswoman from conflict-ravaged Sinaloa, cast doubt on projections that the election could hand even more power over to criminals and criminal groups, simply because they already have a strong control over courts.",
      "\u201cThe influence of criminal groups already exists,\u201d she said. \u201cThe cartels go with the judges (bribe them) whether they are elected or not.\u201d",
      "The public has been plagued by confusion over a voting process that Patin warned has been hastily thrown together. Voters often have to choose from more than a hundred candidates who are not permitted to clearly voice their party affiliation or carry out widespread campaigning.",
      "As a result, many Mexicans said they were going into the vote blind, though others voting Sunday noted they supported the process despite the confusion.",
      "Mexico's electoral authority has investigated voter guides being handed out across the country, in what critics say is a blatant move by political parties to stack the vote in their favor.",
      "\u201cPolitical parties weren\u2019t just going to sit with their arms crossed,\u201d Patin said.",
      "While still unsure if his vote would improve access to justice for many Mexicans, 61-year-old actor Manuel Jos\u00e9 Contreras defended the election, Sheinbaum and her party. He cast his ballot with a tone of hope.",
      "\u201cThe reform has its problems but we needed an urgent change,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to start with something.\u201d",

      "Here's what to know about Karol Nawrocki, Poland\u2019s newly elected conservative president:",
      "Nawrocki is a 42-year-old historian who had no political experience prior to the campaign and who was not even a party member until he was tapped by the conservative Law and Justice party that governed Poland from 2015 to 2023.",
      "Nawrocki heads the Institute of National Remembrance, which embraces nationalist historical narratives. He led efforts to topple monuments to the Soviet Red Army in Poland. Russia responded by putting him on a wanted list, according to Polish media reports.",
      "Nawrocki\u2019s supporters describe him as the embodiment of traditional, patriotic values. Many of them oppose abortion and LGBTQ+ visibility and say Nawrocki reflects the traditional values they grew up with.",
      "He was also the preferred favorite of U.S. President Donald Trump, with the American conservative group CPAC holding its first meeting in Poland last week during the campaign to give him a boost. Kristi Noem, the U.S. Homeland Security Secretary and a prominent Trump ally, strongly praised him and urged Poles to vote for him.",
      "His campaign echoed themes popular on the American right. A common refrain from his supporters is that Nawrocki will restore \u201cnormality,\u201d as they believe Trump has done. U.S. flags appeared at his rallies.",
      "Nawrocki performed better in the first round than expected, an indication he was underestimated in the polling.",
      "Nawrocki's quick political rise has not been without controversy, with reports linking him to underworld figures whom he met while boxing or working as a hotel security guard in the past.",
      "Nawrocki has also been linked to a scandal involving the acquisition of a Gdansk apartment from an elderly pensioner named Jerzy. Allegations suggest Nawrocki promised to care for Jerzy in return but failed to fulfill the commitment, leading the man to end up in a publicly funded retirement home.",
      "His shifting explanations raised questions about his transparency and credibility. After the scandal erupted he donated the apartment to a charity.",
      "It recently emerged that Nawrocki took part in a 2009 Gdansk brawl involving about 140 rival soccer fans, some later convicted of crimes. Nawrocki described the fight as a form of \u201cnoble\u201d combat.",
      "Polish media have also reported on his connections to gangsters and the world of prostitution.",
      "His critics say all of these things make him unfit to represent Poland as the head of state but many right-wing voters don\u2019t believe the allegations and accuse the media of using its power to hurt him, creating what appears to be a rallying effect around him.",
      "It's unclear what effect, if any, these scandals had on the outcome of Sunday's result.",

      "The deal lasts 90 days, creating time for U.S. and Chinese negotiators to reach a more substantive agreement. But the pause also leaves tariffs higher than before Trump started ramping them up last month. And businesses and investors must contend with uncertainty about whether the truce will last.",

      "Trump stirred further controversy Friday, saying he will no longer be nice with China on trade, declaring in a social media post that the country had broken an agreement with the United States.",
      "Hours later, Trump said in the Oval Office that he will speak with Chinese President Xi Jinping and \u201chopefully we\u2019ll work that out,\u201d while still insisting China had violated the agreement.",

      "WARSAW, Poland -- Conservative Karol Nawrocki won Poland\u2019s weekend presidential runoff election, according to the final vote count on Monday. Nawrocki won 50.89% of votes in a very tight race against liberal Warsaw Mayor Rafa\u0142 Trzaskowski, who received 49.11%.",
      "The race had Poland on edge since a first round of voting two weeks earlier, revealing deep divisions in the country along the eastern flank of NATO and the European Union.",
      "An early exit poll released Sunday evening suggested Trzaskowski was headed to victory before updated polling began to reverse the picture a couple of hours later.",
      "The outcome suggests that Poland can be expected to take a more populist and nationalist path under its new leader, who was backed by U.S. President Donald Trump.",
      "Most day-to-day power in the Polish political system rests with a prime minister chosen by the parliament. However, the president's role is not merely ceremonial. The office holds the power to influence foreign policy and veto legislation.",
      "Nawrocki will succeed Andrzej Duda, a conservative whose second and final term ends on Aug. 6.",
      "Under the Polish constitution, the president serves a five-year term and may be re-elected once.",
      "Prime Minister Donald Tusk came to power in late 2023 with a coalition government that spans a broad ideological divide \u2014 so broad that it hasn't been able to fulfill certain of Tusk's electoral promises, such as loosening the restrictive abortion law or passing a civil partnership law for same-sex couples.",
      "But Duda's veto power has been another obstacle. It has prevented Tusk from fulfilling promises to reverse laws that politicized the court system in a way that the European Union declared to be undemocratic.",
      "Now it appears Tusk will have no way to fulfill those promises, which he made both to voters and the EU.",
      "Some observers in Poland have said the unfulfilled promises could make it more difficult for Tusk to continue his term until the next parliamentary election scheduled for late 2027, particularly if Law and Justice dangles the prospect of future cooperation with conservatives in his coalition.",
      "Nawrocki, a 42-year-old amateur boxer and historian, was tapped by the Law and Justice party as part of its push for a fresh start.",
      "The party governed Poland from 2015 to 2023, when it lost power to a centrist coalition led by Tusk. Some political observers predicted the party would never make a comeback, and Nawrocki was chosen as a new face who would not be burned by the scandals of the party's eight years of rule.",
      "The strategy clearly worked.",
      "Nawrocki has most recently been the head of the Institute of National Remembrance, which embraces nationalist historical narratives. He led efforts to topple monuments to the Soviet Red Army in Poland, and Russia responded by putting him on a wanted list, according to Polish media reports.",
      "Nawrocki\u2019s supporters describe him as the embodiment of traditional, patriotic values. Those who oppose secular trends, including LGBTQ+ visibility, have embraced him, viewing him as a reflection of the values they grew up with.",
      "Nawrocki\u2019s candidacy was clouded by allegations of past connections to criminal figures and his participation in a violent street brawl. He denies the criminal links but was unapologetic about the street fight, saying he had taken part in \u201cnoble\u201d fights in his life. The revelations did not seem to hurt his support among right-wing voters, many of whom see the allegations as politically motivated.",
      "Trump made it clear he wanted Nawrocki as Poland's president.",
      "He welcomed Nawrocki to the White House a month ago. And last week the conservative group CPAC held its first meeting in Poland to give Nawrocki a boost. Kristi Noem, the U.S. Homeland Security Secretary and a prominent Trump ally, strongly praised Nawrocki and urged Poles to vote for him.",
      "The U.S. has about 10,000 troops stationed in Poland and Noem suggested that military ties could deepen with Nawrocki as president.",
      "A common refrain from Nawrocki's supporters is that he will restore \u201cnormality,\u201d as they believe Trump has done. U.S. flags often appeared at Nawrocki's rallies, and his supporters believed that he offered a better chance for good ties with the Trump administration.",
      "Nawrocki has also echoed some of Trump's language on Ukraine. He promises to continue Poland's support for Ukraine but has been critical of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, accusing him of taking advantage of allies. He has accused Ukrainian refugees of taking advantage of Polish generosity, vowing to prioritize Poles for social services such as health care and schooling.",

The new leader faces the urgent tasks of trying to heal the deep domestic divide over Yoon's action as well as focusing on U.S. President Donald Trump's America-first policy and North Korea\u2019s advancing nuclear program.",
      "Lee, who represents the main liberal Democratic Party, is the favorite to win the elections. In three Gallup Korea surveys released last week, 46% to 49% of respondents picked Lee as their choice for next president, giving him a comfortable lead over Kim with 35% to 37%.",
      "Lee narrowly lost the 2022 election to Yoon, and spearheaded parliament\u2019s two votes to overturn Yoon\u2019s martial law decree and impeach him, before the Constitutional Court formally dismissed him in April.",
      "Lee\u2019s outspoken criticism of South Korea's conservative establishment and calls to punish those involved in Yoon's martial law enactment have caused worries among his opponents that Lee's election would further polarize the country.",
      "Kim, a former labor minister under Yoon, has fought an uphill battle against Lee as his People Power Party struggles to restore public confidence. Kim's opposition to Yoon's impeachment and reluctance to explicitly criticize the disgraced leader drove him away from moderate voters, analysts say.",
      "Four other politicians are running for the presidency, including Lee Jun-seok of the small conservative New Reform Party, who has categorically rejected Kim's request to field a unified candidate between them to prevent a split in conservative votes.",
      "The election has got ugly, with candidates levelling damaging statements, personal attacks and even sexually offensive language against each other without unveiling clear, long-term vision for South Korea.",
      "During last week's televised debate, Lee Jae-myung labelled Kim as \"Yoon Suk Yeol\u2019s avatar,\u201d while Kim called Lee a \u201charbinger of monster politics and dictatorship.\u201d Lee Jun-seok faced withering public criticism after he used graphic references to women\u2019s bodies to criticize Lee Jae-myung's son over his purported sexually explicit online slur targeting a female singer.",
      "Unlike past elections, North Korea's nuclear program hasn't emerged as a hot-button topic, suggesting that most candidates share a view that South Korea has few immediate ways to convince North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons. Dealing with Trump's aggressive tariffs policy hasn't been a divisive issue either.",
      "Kim has instead focused on portraying Lee Jae-myung as a dangerous leader who would likely wield excessive power by putting the judiciary under his control and revising laws to stop his criminal trials. Lee Jae-myung, for his part, has repeatedly questioned Kim's ties with Yoon.",
      "South Korea\u2019s new president will have little time to negotiate with the United States before July 9, when Trump\u2019s 90-day pause on global tariffs expires, potentially exposing South Korean products to 25% tax rates. A U.S. federal court has recently ruled that Trump lacks authority to impose the tariffs, but the White House has appealed, leaving the long-term outcome unclear.",
      "South Korea's outgoing administration was trying to finalize a comprehensive \u201cpackage\u201d deal with the U.S. by early July to soften the blow to the country\u2019s trade-dependent economy.",
      "Lee has accused government officials of rushing negotiations for short-term political gains and said it wouldn\u2019t serve national interests to obsess over securing an early agreement with Washington. Kim said he would place a priority on a meeting with Trump as soon as possible to resolve trade issues.",
      "The next government in Seoul may also struggle to ease security tensions over North Korea\u2019s advancing nuclear weapons program, which has been complicated by North Korea's support of Russia's war against Ukraine.",
      "Lee has expressed a willingness to improve ties with North Korea but acknowledged that it would be difficult to hold a summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un anytime soon. He said he would support Trump's push to resume nuclear diplomacy with North Korea. Kim Moon Soo has promised to build up South Korea's military capability and win a stronger U.S. security support, suggesting he would uphold Yoon's hard-line approach on North Korea.",
      "The most pressing domestic issue facing the new president will be a starkly divided nation that had seen millions rallying for months to either support or denounce Yoon.",
      "Yoon had labeled Lee\u2019s party as \u201canti-state\u201d forces abusing their legislative majority to block his agenda. He also endorsed unsubstantiated conspiracy theories that the liberals had benefited from election fraud, prompting his supporters to rally in the streets with \u201cStop the Steal\u201d signs.",
      "Lee has issued a message of unity and vowed not to seek political vengeance against his rivals if elected. But his critics doubt that, suspecting Lee could use investigations of Yoon's martial law decree as a vehicle to suppress his opponents.",
      "Yoon\u2019s legal saga is likely to overshadow the early months of Seoul\u2019s next government, as the former president continues to stand trial on high-stakes rebellion charges, which carry a possible sentence of death or life in prison.",

      "DEADHORSE, Alaska -- Three Trump Cabinet members began a tour at a key point of operations at a prolific oil field near the Arctic Ocean in Alaska on Monday, part of a multiday trip aimed at highlighting President Donald Trump\u2019s push to expand oil and gas drilling, mining and logging in the state.",
      "The arrival of Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin at Deadhorse came hours after Burgum's agency said it would follow through with plans to repeal Biden-era restrictions on future leasing and industrial development in portions of the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska.",
      "The petroleum reserve is west of Deadhorse, which is located at Prudhoe Bay at the starting point for the nearly 50-year-old, 800-mile (1,287-kilometer) Trans-Alaska Pipeline System.",
      "Government and industry representatives from several Asian countries also were expected to participate in a portion of the U.S. officials' trip, as Trump has focused renewed attention on a massive, proposed natural gas pipeline project that Alaska officials have sought for decades as a way to provide gas to residents and overseas markets. The project has struggled to gain traction amid cost and other concerns, and even some state lawmakers remain skeptical it will come to fruition.",
      "Wright on Monday said the gas line could become the \u201cbig, beautiful twin\u201d to the oil pipeline. This followed comments by Burgum a day earlier that the gas project carries potential national security benefits if the U.S. can sell liquefied natural gas to allies in Asia.",
      "The Trump officials were joined Monday by a group that included U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan and Gov. Mike Dunleavy, both Republicans, who also took part in meetings Sunday in Anchorage and Utqiagvik. In that Arctic community, which this time of year experiences 24 hours of daylight, many Alaska Native leaders support Trump's push for more drilling in the petroleum reserve and to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil development. They lauded the visit after lamenting that they felt ignored by former President Joe Biden's administration.",
      "U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, an at-times vocal critic of Trump, joined for the Sunday meeting in Anchorage, where she said Alaska leaders \u201cwant to partner with you. We want to be that equal at the table instead of an afterthought.\u201d",
      "Alaska political leaders have long complained about perceived federal overreach by the U.S. government, which oversees about 60% of lands in Alaska. Sullivan, Murkowski and Dunleavy have complained that Biden's team was too heavy-handed and restrictive in its approach to many resource development issues.",
      "Environmentalists criticized Interior's planned rollback of restrictions in portions of the petroleum reserve designated as special for their wildlife, subsistence or other values. While Sullivan called the repeal a top priority, saying Congress intended to have development in the petroleum reserve, environmentalists maintain that the law balances allowances for oil drilling with a need to provide protections for sensitive areas.",
      "The Interior Department said it will accept public comment on the planned repeal.",
      "The visit by Trump officials also is slated to include addressing Dunleavy's annual energy conference Tuesday in Anchorage.",

      "A construction project on one of Newark Liberty International Airport's three main runways wrapped up nearly two weeks early, so the Federal Aviation Administration should be able to ease flight limits soon, but the shortage of air traffic controllers could still cause problems.",
      "Federal Transportation Department officials plan to join the CEO of United Airlines and airport officials in providing an update on operations at New Jersey\u2019s biggest airport Monday afternoon. The runway was scheduled to go back into service Monday, according to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.",
      "Crews worked day and night to complete the $121 million construction project ahead of schedule and ease some of the problems at the airport. But Newark has also been plagued by cancellations and delays this spring because of a shortage of air traffic controllers after the FAA had technical problems that twice briefly knocked out the radar and communications at a facility in Philadelphia that directs planes in and out of the airport.",
      "\u201cCompleting this major portion of the runway rehabilitation 13 days ahead of schedule is a testament to the extraordinary commitment and around-the-clock efforts of construction crews and our airport staff,\u201d said Port Authority Chairman Kevin O\u2019Toole.",

      "Five air traffic controllers went on 45-day trauma leaves after the first radar and communications outage at the Philadelphia facility on April 28, and another one is out on medical leave. That left the facility with only 16 certified controllers and five supervisors. Officials have said there are another 16 experienced controllers in training that should get certified sometime between now and October.",
      "The FAA limited the Newark airport to 28 arrivals and 28 departures an hour last month because of the construction and staff shortages. The agency has said that it expects to be able to bump up the number of flights daily in Newark to 34 arrivals and 34 departures once the runway construction is done. But it's not immediately clear if the FAA will have to wait until the controllers on trauma leave are scheduled to return around the middle of the month.",
      "Before the air traffic control problems this spring, 38 or 39 flights typically took off and landed hourly at the Newark airport.",
      "The FAA has said it will revisit the limits again in October because it hopes to have more controllers trained by then.",
      "The government also upgraded the software at the air traffic control facility after a second radar outage on May 9. That helped prevent a repeat problem on May 11 when there was another problem with the lines carrying the radar signal down from New York.",
      "Verizon has installed a new fiber optic line between Philadelphia and New York after the problems but that isn't expected to go into service until July after testing is completed.",

      "BARCELONA, Spain -- The European Union on Monday said it is preparing \u201ccountermeasures\u201d against the United States after the Trump administration's surprise tariffs on steel rattled global markets and complicated the ongoing wider tariff negotiations between Brussels and Washington.",
      "EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and U.S. President Donald Trump agreed last week to \u201caccelerate talks\u201d on a deal, but that if those trade negotiations fail \u201cthen we are also prepared to accelerate our work on the defensive side,\" European Commission spokesperson Olof Gill told a press conference in Brussels.",

About halfway through that grace period, Trump announced a 50% tariffs on steel imports.",
      "Trump\u2019s return to the White House has come with an unrivaled barrage of tariffs, with levies threatened, added and, often, taken away. Top officials at the EU\u2019s executive commission says they\u2019re pushing hard for a trade deal to avoid a 50% tariff on imported goods.",
      "The EU could possibly buy more liquefied natural gas and defense items from the U.S., as well as lower duties on cars, but it isn't likely to budge on calls to scrap the value added tax \u2014 which is akin to a sales tax \u2014 or open up the EU to American beef.",
      "The EU has offered the US a \u201czero for zero\u201d outcome in which tariffs would be removed on both sides industrial goods including autos. Trump has dismissed that but EU officials have said it\u2019s still on the table.",
      "The announcement Friday of a staggering 50% levy on steel imports stoked fear that big-ticket purchases from cars to washing machines to houses could see major price increases. But those metals are so ubiquitous in packaging, they\u2019re likely to pack a punch across consumer products from soup to nuts.",

      "Starmer said Britain \u201ccannot ignore the threat that Russia poses\u201d as he pledged to undertake the most sweeping changes to Britain's defenses since the collapse of the Soviet Union more than three decades ago.",
      "\u201cThe threat we face is more serious, more immediate and more unpredictable than at any time since the Cold War,\" Starmer told workers and journalists at a navy shipyard in Scotland.",
      "Like other NATO members, the U.K. has been reassessing its defense spending since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.",
      "The government announced military plans in response to a strategic defense review commissioned by Starmer and led by George Robertson, a former U.K. defense secretary and NATO secretary general. It's the first such review since 2021, and lands in a world shaken and transformed by Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, and by the re-election of President Donald Trump last year.",
      "Months after Britain's last major defense review was published in 2021, then-Prime Minister Boris Johnson said with confidence that the era of \u201cfighting big tank battles on European landmass\u201d are over. Three months later, Russian tanks rolled into Ukraine.",
      "Starmer's center-left Labour Party government says it will accept all 62 recommendations made in the review, aiming to help the U.K. confront growing threats on land, air sea and in cyberspace.",
      "The measures include increasing production of submarines and weapons and \u201clearning the lessons of Ukraine,\" which has rapidly developed its drone technology to counter Moscow's forces and even hit targets deep inside Russia.",
      "The government said the U.K, will also establish a cyber command to counter \u201cdaily\u201d Russia-linked attacks on Britain's defenses.",
      "Monday\u2019s announcements include building \u201cup to 12\u201d nuclear-powered, conventionally armed submarines under the AUKUS partnership with Australia and the United States. The government also says it will invest 15 billion pounds in Britain\u2019s nuclear arsenal, which consists of missiles carried on a handful of submarines. Details of those plans are likely to be kept secret.",
      "The government will also increase conventional Britain\u2019s weapons stockpiles with up to 7,000 U.K.-built long-range weapons.",
      "Starmer said rearming would create a \u201cdefense dividend\u201d of thousands of well-paid manufacturing jobs \u2014 a contrast to the post-Cold War \u201cpeace dividend\u201d that saw Western nations channel money away from defense into other areas.",
      "Defense Secretary John Healey said the changes would send \u201ca message to Moscow,\u201d and transform the country\u2019s military following decades of retrenchment, though he said he does not expect the number of soldiers \u2014 currently at a two-century low \u2014 to rise until the early 2030s.",
      "Healey said plans for defense spending to hit 2.5% of national income by 2027 a year are \u201con track\u201d and that there\u2019s \u201cno doubt\u201d it will hit 3% before 2034.",
      "Starmer said the 3% goal is an \u201cambition,\u201d rather than a firm promise, and it\u2019s unclear where the cash-strapped Treasury will find the money. The government has already, contentiously, cut international aid spending to reach the 2.5% target.",
      "Starmer said he wouldn\u2019t make a firm pledge until he knew \u201cprecisely where the money is coming from.\u201d",
      "Even 3% falls short of what some leaders in NATO think is needed to deter Russia from future attacks on its neighbors. NATO chief Mark Rutte says leaders of the 32 member countries will debate a commitment to spend at least 3.5% of GDP on defense when they meet in the Netherlands this month.",
      "It's also a message to Trump that Europe is heeding his demand for NATO members to spend more on their own defense.",
      "European countries, led by the U.K. and France, have scrambled to coordinate their defense posture as Trump transforms American foreign policy, seemingly sidelining Europe as he looks to end the war in Ukraine. Trump has long questioned the value of NATO and complained that the U.S. provides security to European countries that don\u2019t pull their weight.",

      "His win also reflects the appeal of right-wing nationalism across Europe, where concerns about migration, national sovereignty, and cultural identity have led to surging support for parties on the right \u2014 even the far right in recent times.",
      "Far-right candidates did very well in Poland's first round of voting two weeks earlier, underlining the appeal of the nationalist and conservative views. Nawrocki picked up many of those votes.",
      "As his supporters celebrate his win, those who voted for the defeated liberal candidate, Warsaw Mayor Rafa\u0142 Trzaskowski, worry that it will hasten the erosion of liberal democratic norms.",
      "Nawrocki\u2019s presidency presents a direct challenge to Prime Minister Donald Tusk, who returned to power in late 2023 pledging to mend relations with the EU and restore judicial independence which Brussels said was eroded by Law and Justice, the party that backed Nawrocki.",
      "But Tusk's coalition \u2014 a fragile alliance of centrists, leftists, and agrarian conservatives \u2014 has struggled to push through key promises including a civil union law for same-sex couples and a less restrictive abortion law.",
      "Nawrocki, who opposes such measures, will have the power to veto legislation, complicating Tusk\u2019s agenda and potentially triggering political gridlock.",
      "Nawrocki's election could signal a stronger relationship between Poland and the Trump administration.",
      "Poland and the U.S. are close allies, and there are 10,000 U.S. troops stationed in Poland, but Tusk and his partners in the past have been critical of Trump. Nawrocki, however, has a worldview closely aligned with Trump and his Make America Great Again ethos.",
      "Trump welcomed Nawrocki to the White House a month ago and his administration made clear in other ways that he was its preferred candidate.",
      "While Nawrocki has voiced support for Ukraine\u2019s defense against Russian aggression, he does not back Ukrainian membership in NATO and has questioned the long-term costs of aid \u2014 particularly support for refugees.",
      "His rhetoric has at times echoed that of Trump, for instance by accusing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of what he said was insufficient gratitude for Poland\u2019s assistance. With growing public fatigue over helping Ukrainian refugees, Nawrocki\u2019s approach could shift Poland\u2019s posture from strong ally to conditional partner if the war drags on much longer.",
      "The election result is a setback for the EU, which had welcomed Tusk\u2019s return in 2023 as a signal of renewed pro-European engagement.",
      "Nawrocki and the Law and Justice party have criticized what nationalists view as EU overreach into Poland's national affairs, especially regarding judicial reforms and migration policy.",
      "While the president does not control day-to-day diplomacy, Nawrocki\u2019s symbolic and veto powers could frustrate Brussels\u2019 efforts to bring Poland back into alignment with bloc standards, particularly on rule-of-law issues.",
      "Though an EU member, Poland has its own currency, the zloty, which weakened slightly on Monday morning, reflecting investor concerns over potential policy instability and renewed tensions with EU institutions.",
      "Billions of euros in EU funding has been linked to judicial reforms which Tusk's government will now be unlikely to enact without presidential cooperation.",

    "story": [
      "In Uganda, where more than 40% of the population live in extreme poverty, many families live in homes with dirt floors",
      "JINJA, Uganda -- Simon Tigawalana dreamed for years of doing something about the dirt floors in his small house, blaming them for making his family sick. But in a rural area in one of the world's poorest countries, making them over with concrete was simply out of reach.",
      "Then a company called EarthEnable approached him to offer an alternative: a clay-based earthen floor that could give him a durable, sealed floor for less than half the cost of concrete. Tigawalana now has the new floor in two rooms and hopes to add it soon in the last room.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m happy that we now have a decent home and can also comfortably host visitors,\" said Tigawalana, a 56-year-old father of 16. \"Ever since we got a clay floor my kids no longer get cough and flu that used to come from the dust raised while sweeping the dirt floors.\u201d",
      "EarthEnable, which seeks to upgrade housing across Africa, has been promoting and installing the clay-based floors in Uganda since 2017. Besides eliminating dust that can irritate breathing, they're credited with reducing infestations of jiggers \u2014 a parasitic flea that can burrow into the skin and lead to pain, itching and infection. Uganda's health ministry says poor hygiene due to dirt floors contributes to such infestations.",
      "\u201cOur floors help to prevent pathogens and other illnesses linked to dust floors, since most of these families can\u2019t afford hospital care,\u201d said Noeline Mutesi, a sales and marketing manager for EarthEnable.",
      "The first step in building the floor is digging and leveling the surface. Then murram \u2014 local red soil rich in iron and aluminum oxides \u2014 is mixed with sand and water and then compacted. After two weeks of drying time, masons use wooden floats to smooth and further compact the surface. Next is pasting: applying a fine clay screed to further smooth the surface and prepare it for a final sealant, a flaxseed-based varnish that hardens into a durable plastic-like resin.",
      "A typical floor costs around 240,000 Uganda shillings (about $65), which Earth Enable says is about 70% cheaper than concrete. Buyers can pay in installments. EarthEnable, a U.S.-based nonprofit, operates for-profit subsidiaries in Uganda, Rwanda and Kenya, and says any profits are invested into startup costs in new markets as well as research and development.",
      "EarthEnable said it's installed about 5,000 floors in Uganda, more than 39,000 in Rwanda and more than 100 in Kenya. The company also does wall plastering to help reduce dust, moisture and insect infestations common in mud homes.",
      "In Jinja, the company's program employs more than 100 masons from within the community. Many are disadvantaged boys who have dropped out of school because they can't afford fees, said Alex Wanda, a construction officer at the company.",
      "\u201cWe focus on employing these young village boys that we train in skills to build these earthen floors, thus creating for them employment opportunities,\u201d Wanda said in an interview.",
      "About 42% of Ugandans live in extreme poverty. Its Bureau of Statistics says the country has a housing deficit of 2.6 million units, and it's growing. The country needs to add 300,000 housing units per year to make up the deficit, mainly in rural areas, where many Ugandans live and where housing quality and availability remain pressing concerns.",
      "The company also touts the clay floors as a more sustainable alternative to concrete, which besides being more expensive generates major carbon emissions in production.",
      "The cement industry is one of Uganda's biggest contributors to carbon emissions, accounting for about 628,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide in 2023, its highest recorded level. More broadly, building and construction accounts for 37% of global emissions, according to the United Nations Environment Programme.",
      "Uganda, like much of the rest of the world, has seen a rise in extreme weather events made more likely by climate change, including flooding and prolonged drought.",
      "\u201cInitiatives like this are crucial in the global effort to decarbonize the construction sector,\u201d said Penina Atwine, a program officer at the Uganda-based organization Environmental Alert. \u201cSuch innovative local solutions that address both climate change and social needs like EarthEnable\u2019s model could inspire similar approaches across the globe.\"",
      "In the village of Budima, Rehema Namukose spent most of her family's savings to build a house. She couldn't afford a cleaner floor until she worked through EarthEnable to pay for a clay floor in installments. She lives there with her three children and credits the new floor for improving the health of a sickly daughter.",
      "\u201cThis is affordable for my family and will help us maintain hygiene,\u201d she says \u201cWe are now living a better life.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s doubling of tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum could hit Americans in an unexpected place: grocery aisles",
      "NEW YORK -- President Donald Trump\u2019s doubling of tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum could hit Americans in an unexpected place: grocery aisles.",
      "The announcement Friday of a staggering 50% levy on those imports stoked fear that big-ticket purchases from cars to washing machines to houses could see major price increases. But those metals are so ubiquitous in packaging, they\u2019re likely to pack a punch across consumer products from soup to nuts.",
      "\u201cRising grocery prices would be part of the ripple effects,\u201d says Usha Haley, an expert on trade and professor at Wichita State University, who added that the tariffs could raise costs across industries and further strain ties with allies \u201cwithout aiding a long-term U.S. manufacturing revival.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s return to the White House has come with an unrivaled barrage of tariffs, with levies threatened, added and, often, taken away, in such a whiplash-inducing frenzy it\u2019s hard to keep up. He insisted the latest tariff hike was necessary to \u201ceven further secure the steel industry in the U.S.\u201d",
      "That promise, though, could be at odds with his pledge to reduce food costs.",
      "Rising grocery prices, Trump has said, were among the biggest reasons voters swung his way. A look around a supermarket makes clear how many products could be impacted by new taxes on steel and aluminum, from beer and soda to dog food to can after can of beans, fruit, tomato paste and more.",
      "\u201cIt plays into the hands of China and other foreign canned food producers, which are more than happy to undercut American farmers and food producers,\u201d insists Can Manufacturers Institute president Robert Budway. \u201cDoubling the steel tariff will further increase the cost of canned goods at the grocery store.\u201d",
      "Budway says production by domestic tin mill steel producers, whose products are used in cans, have dramatically decreased in recent years, making manufacturers reliant on imported materials. When those prices go up, he says, \u201cthe cost is levied upon millions of American families.\u201d",
      "Food companies were already warily assessing the administration\u2019s tariffs before the latest hike, which Trump said would go into effect on Wednesday. The Campbell Co., whose soup cans are a staple for millions of Americans, has said it was working to mitigate the impact of tariffs but may be forced to raise prices. ConAgra Brands, which puts everything from cans of Reddi-Whip to cooking sprays like Pam on supermarket shelves, likewise has pointed to the impact steel and aluminum tariffs have.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t get all of our materials from the US because there\u2019s no supply,\u201d ConAgra CFO David Marberger said at a recent Goldman Sachs conference on global staples.",
      "Beyond the obvious products \u2014 canned foods like tuna, chicken broth and cranberry sauce \u2014 economists warn of a spillover effect that tariffs can have on a gamut of items. If the cost to build a store or buy a truck to haul food rise, the prices of products may follow.",
      "Most Americans will never buy a tractor, but Babak Hafezi, who runs a global consulting firm and teaches international business at American University, says a price spike in such a big-ticket item vital to food production will spill down to all sorts of other items.",
      "\u201cIf a John Deere tractor costs 25% more, consumers pay the price for that,\u201d Hafezi says. \u201cThis trickles down the economy and impacts every aspect of the economy. Some of the trickling is immediate and others are slower to manifest themselves. But yes, prices will increase and choices will decrease.\u201d",
      "Trump appeared before a crowd of cheering steelworkers to unveil the new tariffs at a rally outside Pittsburgh. In a statement, David McCall, president of the United Steelworkers International union, called tariffs \u201ca valuable tool in balancing the scales\u201d but \u201cwider reforms of our global trading system\" are needed.",
      "It may be harder to gauge the weight of tariffs on, say, a can of chickpeas versus that of a new car, but consumers are likely to see myriad indirect costs from the levies, says Andreas Waldkirch, an economics professor at Colby College who teaches a class on international trade.",
      "\u201cAnybody who\u2019s directly connected to the steel industry, they\u2019re going to benefit. It\u2019s just coming at a very high cost,\u201d Waldkirch says. \u201cYou may get a few more steel jobs. But all these indirect costs mean you then destroy jobs elsewhere. If you were to add that all in, you come up with a pretty large negative loss.\u201d",

      "Black women are starting to pay more for their hair care because of the Trump administration\u2019s tariffs on goods imported from China",
      "ATLANTA -- Before the oppressive summer heat descends on Atlanta, therapist Brittanee Sims usually gets her thick, curly hair braided at a salon to preserve her healthy mane.",
      "But it\u2019s more expensive this year. So she'll only pay for her teenage daughter and son to get their summer hairdos. Not having braided hair \u201ccreates more of a hassle for everything,\u201d said Sims, who counts herself among the tens of millions of women that regularly spend on the Black hair care industry.",
      "Now, she said, she has to \u201cgo home and figure out what I\u2019m gonna do to my hair in the morning, after I went to the gym and it\u2019s messed up with sweating and frizz.\u201d",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs are driving up prices for products many Black women consider essential, squeezing shoppers and stylists even more as they grapple with inflation and higher rents. Much of the synthetic braiding hair, human hair for extensions, wigs and weaves, styling tools, braiding gel and other products is imported from or has packaging from China, which was subject to a combined 145% tariff in April. India also is a major global source of human hair.",
      "Many Black women have hair types and workplace-favored styles that require careful attention, and they can spend hundreds of dollars at salons each month on extensions, weaves, wigs and braids. The Associated Press spoke with several Black hair industry experts, beauty supply store owners, and wholesale companies, as well as nearly two dozen Black stylists and braiders, some of whom may have to raise prices even as business has slowed.",
      "On Thursday, a federal appeals court reinstated most of Trump's tariffs on imported goods after they were blocked the day before by a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of International Trade.",
      "Earlier this month, the United States agreed to drop the 145% tax on goods imported from China to 30% while the two economic superpowers negotiate new trade agreements. Imports from most other countries face baseline tariff rates at 10%.",
      "Regardless, the next few months \u201care already shot\u201d for many items, said Marty Parker, a University of Georgia business professor and supply chain expert who worked in the hair care industry. The costs companies have been facing at ports are making their way down to consumers, supply shortages are getting worse, and it's unclear what will happen if negotiations break down.",
      "\u201cPrices go up very fast and come down very slow,\u201d Parker said.",
      "Some stylists said they're seeing fewer clients because prices are going up for virtually everything.",
      "Atlanta stylists are paying more for hair from China. Atlanta stylist Yana Ellis, who also sells products like wigs, paid an extra $245 in shipping for 52 bundles of hair in March compared to 40 bundles in December. AaNiyah Butler said her shipping costs for human hair more than doubled from February to May. And Dajiah Blackshear found in early May that a beauty supply store raised the cost of the kind of hair she\u2019s used for years by $100.",
      "The store owner said he may have to stop selling that brand of hair because it went up so much. Similarly, some wholesale hair stores have seen higher costs or are expecting them in the coming weeks. Even the typical $6 to $10 cost of a pack of synthetic hair has crept up.",
      "Blackshear doesn't want clients to bring hair because she likes to vet the quality. But if expenses continue to mount, she may have to raise her prices.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to be extremely difficult,\u201d she said, especially for clients who are \"having to make those hard decisions, between \u2018do I get my hair done or do I pay my bills?\u2019\u201d",
      "Janice Lowe, who runs 5 Starr Salon in a lower-income neighborhood southeast of Atlanta, has started asking clients to bring hair and is unable to purchase certain products.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m falling behind on my obligations,\u201d she said.",
      "Consultants vary on how much prices will rise, when they\u2019ll go up and for how long \u2014 and the full harm to stylists and consumers could be months away.",
      "The global Black hair care industry was worth about $3.2 billion in 2023, according to market.us, and Black women spend six times more on hair care than other ethnicities.",
      "Stylists often purchase some harder-to-get professional products from door-to-door distributors that buy from wholesale companies or larger distributors that purchase directly from other countries.",
      "Lowe has seen some of her distributors vanish altogether, making it harder to get professional lines such as Black-owned leading professional hair care brand Design Essentials, manufactured in Atlanta at McBride Research Laboratories.",
      "Design Essentials is trying to delay big price increases until 2026 or 2027, and may turn to layoffs or pause promotions to save money, said president Cornell McBride Jr. Most packaging plastics come from China, but ingredients can come from many places.",
      "\u201cNobody wants to put it to the consumer but the person who pays is the consumer in the end,\u201d McBride Jr. said.",
      "Hawa Keita and her mother usually charge customers between $160 and $250 for braiding at their shop, Eve\u2019s African Hair Braiding in College Park southwest of Atlanta. Keita is determined to take losses because their customers \u201ccan\u2019t afford the Atlanta prices,\u201d Keita said.",
      "The cost of a box of 100 packs of braiding hair from China went up for the first time in two years, from $250 to $300, Keita said. They order weekly, often multiple boxes. Some companies say they'll soon raise prices or run out of stock.",
      "Making customers happy is ultimately what will keep the business afloat, Keita said. She smiled as she recounted braiding a young woman\u2019s hair for her birthday with a style she suggested.",
      "\u201cWhen we finished, she gave me the biggest hug, and she was in here screaming and just yelling because she just really loved her hair,\u201d Keita said.",
      "For many Black Americans, especially women, affording their hair care also means confronting unfavorable beauty standards. Georgia State University law professor Tanya Washington said recent discoveries about dangerous chemicals in synthetic hair and hair straightening products have sparked conversations among Black women looking for hairstyles that don't require as much imported products.",
      "But embracing natural hairdos can be daunting for women like the soon-to-be lawyers and clerks Washington advises who face pressure to straighten their hair.",
      "\u201cThat puts everyone who does not have organically, naturally derived straight hair at a disadvantage in these spaces,\u201d she said. \u201cI think that a definition of professionalism that favors one phenotype \u2014 European phenotype \u2014 over all others, is inappropriate.\"",
      "Longstanding income disparities between Black and white American women can also make higher hair care prices untenable. According to the U.S. Census, as of 2023, the median household income in Atlanta is $131,319 for white households and $47,937 for Black households.",
      "It's an inequality issue that professional hairstylists are aware of nationwide.",
      "Stylist Mitzi Mitchell, owner of PIC ONE Beauty Services in Pennsylvania, said she has stocked up on certain products and tools for another year in anticipation of price increases.",
      "She wants to avoid \u201cbootleg\u201d products, which are made illegally and often aren\u2019t as safe, but became much more prevalent in the marketplace during economic downturns.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m really conscientious about my Black minority clients because we make a heck of a lot less than other nationalities,\u201d said Mitchell, who is Black. \u201cI try to keep prices low so we can continue to have the same services, but I know I will have to raise it.\u201d",

      "At least 16 people have been hospitalized after eating cucumbers produced by Florida-based Bedner Growers and distributed by Fresh Start Produce Sales, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported. The cucumbers were sold from April 29 through May 19.",

      "Democratic Gov. Jared Polis has vetoed a bill that would have made Colorado the first state to ban landlords from using rent-setting algorithms, which many advocates have blamed for driving up housing costs across the country.",
      "RealPage is the target of a federal lawsuit filed last year that accuses the real estate software company of facilitating an illegal scheme to help landlords coordinate to hike rental prices. Eight other states, including Colorado, have joined the Department of Justice's lawsuit, though RealPage has vehemently denied any claims of collusion and has fought to have the lawsuit dismissed.",
      "Critics say RealPage software combines confidential information from each real estate management company in ways that enable landlords to align prices and avoid competition that would otherwise push down rents. RealPage\u2019s clients include huge landlords who collectively oversee millions of units across the U.S.",
      "The Colorado bill, which recently passed the Democratic-led Legislature along party lines, would have prevented the use of such algorithms.",
      "In a veto letter Thursday, Polis said he understands the intent of the bill but that any collusion among landlords would already violate existing law.",
      "\u201cReducing market friction through legitimate means that do not entail collusion is good for both renters and landlords,\u201d Polis wrote. \u201cWe should not inadvertently take a tool off the table that could identify vacancies and provide consumers with meaningful data to help efficiently manage residential real estate to ensure people can access housing.\u201d",
      "In a statement, RealPage applauded Polis' veto, calling it an example of \u201ccourageous leadership.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is the right outcome for all of us who desire a healthy housing ecosystem that benefits Colorado renters and housing providers alike,\u201d said Jennifer Bowcock, a spokesperson for the Texas-based firm.",
      "But Polis' decision outraged local housing advocates and the American Economic Liberties Project, a consumer rights advocacy group that has helped lead the fight against RealPage and other companies that use rent-setting algorithms.",
      "\u201cThis veto sends the devastating message that corporate landlords can keep using secret price-fixing algorithms to take extra rent from people who have the least,\u201d said Sam Gilman, co-founder and president of the Community Economic Defense Project, a Colorado-based nonprofit.",
      "RealPage software provides daily recommendations to help landlords and their employees price their available apartments. The landlords do not have to follow the suggestions, but critics argue that because the software has access to a vast trove of confidential data, it helps RealPage's clients charge the highest possible rent.",
      "Although Colorado was the first state to pass a bill targeting rental algorithms, at least six cities have passed similar ordinances over the past year. They include Philadelphia; Minneapolis; San Francisco; Berkeley, California; Jersey City, New Jersey; and Providence, Rhode Island.",
      "RealPage has decried those measures and sued over Berkeley's ordinance, saying it violates the company\u2019s free speech rights and is the result of an \u201cintentional campaign of misinformation and often-repeated false claims\u201d about its products.",
      "RealPage argues that the real driver of high rents is a lack of housing supply. It also says that its pricing recommendations often encourage landlords to drop rents since landlords are incentivized to maximize revenue and maintain high occupancy.",
      "A clause recently added to Republicans\u2019 signature \u201c big, beautiful \u201d tax bill would ban states and localities from regulating artificial intelligence for a decade. On Tuesday, five Democratic senators sent a letter to RealPage asking if the company was involved in getting that clause inserted.",
      "In an email, Bowcock said RealPage was not involved in the AI moratorium language, but she said the company supports \u201ca thoughtful, well-grounded, and consistent regulatory approach to AI, rather than a patchwork of state and local legislation.\u201d",

      "PARIS -- The New York Mets are hiring the person who oversees the U.S. Open tennis tournament, Lew Sherr, as their new president of business operations.",
      "Sherr has been the CEO and executive director of the U.S. Tennis Association since 2022 and has worked there since 2010, including previously as chief revenue officer. His departure was announced by the USTA on Friday; he will remain there until the end of June, then start with the Mets in July.",
      "\u201cFor right now, my focus is the smoothest possible transition,\u201d Sherr said in an interview with The Associated Press at the French Open. \u201cBut I'm hugely excited about what's happening over there. (Mets owners) Steve and Alex Cohen have made a commitment to that team that is unrivaled in sports. You see it on the field, off the field. The energy around the team. The energy around what they\u2019re trying to do for the community with their foundation. The plans for the casino and the hotel and entertainment district.\u201d",
      "Steve Cohen is among the bidders for three casino licenses to be awarded by the New York State Gaming Commission and has been lobbying to have the state legislature reclassify the parking lots adjacent to Citi Field \u2014 also near the facility that hosts the U.S. Open \u2014 from parkland to commercial land for a gaming facility.",
      "The Mets announced Scott Havens' departure as their president of business operations on Tuesday; he was in that post since December 2023. Chief legal officer Katie Pothier, chief marketing officer Andy Goldberg, chief communications officer Nancy Elder and senior vice president of finance Peter Woll have left since November.",
      "The USTA said Brian Vahaly and Andrea Hirsch will be interim co-CEOs during a search for Sherr's replacement. Vahaly is chairman of the USTA Board; Hirsch is the USTA's chief operating officer and chief legal officer.",
      "In Sherr's time as CEO, the USTA has seen growth in tennis participation around the country, along with increases in U.S. Open attendance, sponsorships, and revenue from ticket sales and broadcasting rights.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve taken some big swings,\" Sherr said Friday, \u201cand thankfully, they\u2019re paying off.\u201d",
      "Just last week, he spoke at a news conference in New York to unveil an $800 million project to update Arthur Ashe Stadium and create a player performance center on the tournament grounds. He also made significant changes to this year's U.S. Open mixed doubles event in a bid to attract top singles players, making it a two-day, 16-team competition the week before the singles brackets begin.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s bittersweet, in that I really have loved being part of this organization for 15 years and the opportunities I've had to do just really interesting things \u2014 and not just on the commercial side, but in terms of helping us think about growing the sport,\u201d Sherr said. \"I\u2019m leaving sleeping well at night, knowing (the USTA) is going to be well looked-after.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has released a draft analysis of the environmental effects of building a protective tunnel around an aging Enbridge oil pipeline running beneath a channel connecting two Great Lakes",
      "Building an underground tunnel for an aging Enbridge oil pipeline that stretches across a Great Lakes channel could destroy wetlands and harm bat habitats but would eliminate the chances of a boat anchor rupturing the line and causing a catastrophic spill, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers said Friday in a long-awaited draft analysis of the proposed project's environmental impacts.",
      "The analysis moves the corps a step closer to approving the tunnel for Line 5 in the Straits of Mackinac. The tunnel was proposed in 2018 at a cost of $500 million but has been bogged down by legal challenges. The corps fast-tracked the project in April after President Donald Trump ordered federal agencies in January to identify energy projects for expedited emergency permitting.",
      "A final environmental assessment is expected by autumn, with a permitting decision to follow later this year. The agency initially planned to issue a permitting decision in early 2026.",
      "With that permit in hand, Enbridge would only need permission from the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy before it could begin constructing the tunnel. That's far from a given, though.",
      "Environmentalists have been pressuring the state to deny the permit. Meanwhile, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel and Gov. Gretchen Whitmer are trying to win court rulings that would force Enbridge to remove the existing pipeline from the straits for good.",
      "The analysis notes that the tunnel would eliminate the risk of a boat anchor rupturing the pipeline and causing a spill in the straits, a key concern for environmentalists. But the construction would have sweeping effects on everything from recreation to wildlife.",
      "Many of the impacts, such as noise, vistas marred by 400-foot (121-meter) cranes, construction lights degrading stargazing opportunities at Headlands International Dark Sky Park and vibrations that would disturb aquatic wildlife would end when the work is completed, the report found.",
      "Other impacts would last longer, including the loss of wetlands and vegetation on both sides of the strait that connects Lake Huron and Lake Michigan, and the loss of nearly 300 trees that the northern long-eared bat and tricolored bat use to roost. Grading and excavation also could disturb or destroy archaeological sites.",
      "The tunnel-boring machine could cause vibrations that could shift the area's geology. Soil in the construction area could become contaminated and nearly 200 truck trips daily during the six-year construction period would degrade area roads, the analysis found. Gas mixing with water seeping into the tunnel could result in an explosion, but the analysis notes that Enbridge plans to install fans to properly ventilate the tunnel during excavation.",
      "Enbridge has pledged to comply with all safety standards, replant vegetation where possible and contain erosion, the analysis noted. The company also has said it would try to limit the loudest work to daytime hours as much as possible, and offset harm to wetlands and protected species by buying credits through mitigation banks. That money can then be used to fund restoration in other areas.",
      "\u201cOur goal is to have the smallest possible environmental footprint,\u201d Enbridge officials said in a statement.",
      "The Sierra Club issued a statement Friday saying the tunnel remains \u201can existential threat.\u201d",
      "\u201cChances of an oil spill in the Great Lakes \u2014 our most valuable freshwater resource \u2014 skyrockets if this tunnel is built in the Straits,\u201d the group said. \u201cWe can't drink oil. We can't fish or swim in oil.\u201d",
      "Julie Goodwin, a senior attorney with Earthjustice, an environmental law group that opposes the project, said the corps failed to consider the impacts of a spill that could still happen on either side of the straits or stopping the flow of oil through the Great Lakes.",
      "\u201cMy key takeaways are the Army corps has put blinders are in service to Enbridge and President Trump's fossil fuel agenda,\" she said.",
      "Enbridge has been using the Line 5 pipeline to transport crude oil and natural gas liquids between Superior, Wisconsin, and Sarnia, Ontario, since 1953. Roughly 4 miles (6 kilometers) of the pipeline runs along the bottom of the Straits of Mackinac.",
      "Concerns about the aging pipeline rupturing and causing a potentially disastrous spill in the straits have been building over the last decade. Those fears intensified in 2018 when an anchor damaged the line.",
      "Enbridge contends that the line remains structurally sound, but it struck a deal with then-Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder's administration in 2018 that calls for the company to replace the straits portion of the line with a new section that would be encased in a protective underground tunnel.",
      "Environmentalists, Native American tribes and Democrats have been fighting in court for years to stop the tunnel and force Enbridge to remove the existing pipeline from the straits. They've had little success so far.",
      "A Michigan appellate court in February validated the state Public Service Commission's permits for the tunnel. Nessel sued in 2019 seeking to void the easement that allows Line 5 to run through the straits. That case is still pending. Whitmer revoked the easement in 2020, but Enbridge challenged that decision and a federal appellate court in April ruled that the case can proceed.",
      "About 12 miles (19 kilometers) of Line 5 runs across the Bad River Band of Lake Superior Chippewa\u2019s reservation in northern Wisconsin. That tribe sued in 2019 to force Enbridge to remove the line from the reservation, arguing it\u2019s prone to spilling and that easements allowing it to operate on the reservation expired in 2013.",
      "Enbridge has proposed a 41-mile (66-kilometer) reroute around the reservation. The tribe has filed a lawsuit seeking to void state construction permits for the project and has joined several other groups in challenging the permits through the state's contested case process.",

      "Snack food maker Mondelez International is suing the Aldi supermarket chain, alleging the packaging for Aldi's store-brand cookies and crackers \u201cblatantly copies\u201d Mondelez products like Chips Ahoy, Wheat Thins and Oreos.",
      "In a federal lawsuit filed Tuesday in Illinois, Chicago-based Mondelez said Aldi\u2019s packaging was \u201clikely to deceive and confuse customers\u201d and threatened to irreparably harm Mondelez and its brands. The company is seeking monetary damages and a court order that would stop Aldi from selling products that infringe on its trademarks.",
      "A message seeking comment was left Thursday with Aldi.",
      "In the lawsuit, Mondelez displayed side-by-side photos of multiple products. Aldi\u2019s Thin Wheat crackers, for example, come in a gold box very similar to Mondelez's Wheat Thins. Aldi\u2019s chocolate sandwich cookies and Oreos both have blue packaging. The supermarket's Golden Round crackers and Mondelez\u2019s Ritz crackers are packaged in red boxes.",
      "Aldi, a German discount chain with U.S. headquarters in Batavia, Illinois, keeps prices low by primarily selling products under its own labels.",
      "The chain has faced lawsuits over its packaging before. Last year, an Australian court found that Aldi infringed on the copyright of Baby Bellies snack puffs for young children. In that case, Aldi's packaging featured a cartoon owl and similar colors to the name-brand packaging.",
      "Earlier this year, a U.K. appeals court ruled in favor of Thatchers, a cider company, which sued Aldi over design similarities in the packaging of its lemon cider.",
      "Mondelez said in its lawsuit that the company had contacted Aldi on numerous occasions about \u201cconfusingly similar packaging.\u201d Mondelez said Aldi discontinued or changed the packaging on some items but continued to sell others.",
      "The lawsuit also alleges that Aldi infringed on Mondalez's trade dress rights for the packaging of Nutter Butter and Nilla Wafers cookies, and its Premium cracker brand.",

      "WASHINGTON -- A key U.S. inflation gauge slowed last month as President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs have yet to noticeably push up prices, while American incomes jumped.",
      "Friday\u2019s report from the Commerce Department showed that consumer prices rose just 2.1% in April compared with a year earlier, down from 2.3% in March and the lowest since September. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core prices rose 2.5% from a year earlier, below the March figure of 2.6%. Economists track core prices because they typically provide a better read on where inflation is headed.",
      "The figures show inflation is still declining from its post-pandemic spike, which reached the highest level in four decades in July 2022. Economists and some business executives have warned that prices will likely head higher as Trump\u2019s widespread tariffs take effect, though the timing and impact of those duties are now in doubt after they were struck down late Wednesday in court.",
      "The inflation-fighters at the Federal Reserve said at their most recent meeting May 6-7 that inflation is still elevated, compared to their target of 2%. Fed officials, who focus more on core prices, broadly support keeping their key interest rate steady while they evaluate the impact of the tariffs on inflation and jobs.",
      "The court ruling last Wednesday said that most of Trump\u2019s tariffs were unlawful, including his duties on imports from Canada, Mexico, and China, as well as those on more than 50 other countries. Tariffs on steel, aluminum, and cars were implemented under different laws and remain in place.",
      "But the duties were allowed to remain in effect while the Trump administration appeals the ruling against them. And administration officials say they will find other legal authorities, if needed, to implement the tariffs. As a result, what tariffs will end up in place and for how long remains highly uncertain.",

It's not clear, though, if the deal his administration helped broker has been finalized or how ownership would be structured.",

      "U.S. Steel has not publicly communicated any details of a revamped deal to investors. Nippon Steel issued a statement approving of the proposed \u201cpartnership\u201d but also has not disclosed terms of the arrangement.",
      "State and federal lawmakers who have been briefed on the matter describe a deal in which Nippon will buy U.S. Steel and spend billions on U.S. Steel facilities in Pennsylvania, Indiana, Alabama, Arkansas and Minnesota. The company would be overseen by an executive suite and board made up mostly of Americans and protected by the U.S. government\u2019s veto power in the form of a \u201cgolden share.\u201d",
      "In the absence of clear details or affirmation from the companies involved, the United Steelworkers union, which has long opposed the deal, this week questioned whether the new arrangement makes \u201cany meaningful change\u201d from the initial proposal.",
      "\u201cNippon has maintained consistently that it would only invest in U.S. Steel\u2019s facilities if it owned the company outright,\u201d the union said in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen nothing in the reporting over the past few days suggesting that Nippon has walked back from this position.\u201d",

      "No matter the terms, the issue has outsized importance for Trump, who last year repeatedly said he would block the deal and foreign ownership of U.S. Steel, as did former President Joe Biden.",
      "Trump promised during the campaign to make the revitalization of American manufacturing a priority of his second term in office. And the fate of U.S. Steel, once the world\u2019s largest corporation, could become a political liability in the midterm elections for his Republican Party in the swing state of Pennsylvania and other battleground states dependent on industrial manufacturing.",

      "Pennsylvania Republican Sen. David McCormick came out in favor of the plan, calling it \u201cgreat\u201d for the domestic steel industry, Pennsylvania, national security and U.S. Steel\u2019s employees. A bipartisan group of senators, joined by then-Senate candidate McCormick, had opposed Nippon Steel\u2019s initial proposed purchase of U.S. Steel for $14.9 billion after it was announced in late 2023.",
      "In recent days, Trump and other American officials began touting Nippon Steel\u2019s new commitment to invest $14 billion on top of its $14.9 billion bid, including building a new electric arc furnace steel mill somewhere in the U.S.",
      "Pennsylvania\u2019s other senator, Democrat John Fetterman \u2014 who lives across the street from U.S. Steel\u2019s Edgar Thomson Steel Works blast furnace \u2014 didn\u2019t explicitly endorse the new proposal. But he said he had helped jam up Nippon Steel\u2019s original bid until \u201cNippon coughed up an extra $14B.\u201d",
      "The planned \u201cgolden share\u201d for the U.S. amounts to three board members approved by the U.S. government, which will essentially ensure that U.S. Steel can only make decisions that\u2019ll be in the best interests of the United States, McCormick said Tuesday on Fox News.",
      "Gov. Josh Shapiro, a Democrat who is seen as a potential presidential candidate, had largely refrained from publicly endorsing a deal but said at a news conference this week that he was \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d about the arrangement.",

      "Boisson, ranked 361st, threw her head back and roared after beating American No. 3 Jessica Pegula 3-6, 6-4, 6-4 on Court Philippe-Chatrier in Monday's fourth-round play.",
      "She is by far the lowest-ranked woman to beat someone ranked in the top five at the French Open in 40 years. The lowest previously in that span was No. 179 Aniko Kapros, who eliminated No. 5 Justine Henin in the first round in 2002.",
      "Boisson also is the lowest-ranked woman to reach the quarterfinals at Roland-Garros since at least 1985.",
      "Quite some victory, considering also Pegula was the U.S. Open runner-up last year. Understandably, Boisson was nervous as she served for the match and saved three break points.",
      "After Pegula missed an easy-looking winner at the net and clutched her head in her hands, Boisson had her first match point, the biggest point of her career.",
      "Pegula returned a strong serve to the back of the court where Boisson unleashed a brilliant forehand winner down the line. She then raised her arms and realized the enormity of her win.",
      "\u201c\u2018Thank you to all of you,'\" Boisson told the crowd in her post-match interview. \u201cPlaying on this court with such an atmosphere was really incredible.\u201d",
      "Boisson made the notoriously hard-to-please crowd laugh when she added: \u201cI'm really happy on here. I can stay a long time if you like.\u201d",

      "She was in the news last month. British player Harriet Dart apologized to Boisson after asking the chair umpire to tell her to put some deodorant on. Now she's the only French player \u2014 male or female \u2014 left at Roland-Garros. But she feels comfortable on clay, having played on it regularly since taking up tennis when she was eight years old.",
      "Asked what her ambitions were for the rest of the tournament \u2014 she plays sixth-seeded Mirra Andreeva on Wednesday in the quarterfinals \u2014 she replied, \u201cI hope to win, right?\u201d",
      "That prompted more laughter from the crowd, which included tournament director Amelie Mauresmo, who has been criticized by some for the lack of women players in night sessions.",

She playfully threw her wristband at Andreeva when they came to the net and Andreeva joked she would keep it.",
      "No. 7 Madison Keys advanced on Court Suzanne-Lenglen after beating Hailey Baptiste 6-3, 7-5 in an all-American contest. There's another one coming for Keys against Gauff.",

      "LEBANON, Tenn. -- Bubba Wallace sees NASCAR having all the momentum possible right now with different media partners.",
      "Perfect timing then for NASCAR's \u201cIn-season Challenge\u201d to debut, right?",
      "Well, Wallace forgot that was about to debut.",
      "\u201cFor me to forget about it and remember how exciting it was when they announced, I think it\u2019s going to be big for the fans to tune in and and give them a little bit more ... you\u2019re just invested more,\" Wallace said.",
      "Kyle Larson just tried his latest attempt at \u201cthe Double\u201d of the Indianapolis 500 and the Coca-Cola 600. Count him among those who didn't realize NASCAR's new in-season competition had its field of 32 set after Sunday night's Cup Series race at the Nashville Superspeedway.",
      "\u201cI just really haven\u2019t seen anything promoted about it, so I think it\u2019s easy to forget about it,\" Larson said.",
      "NASCAR announced this new in-season competition in May 2024, so drivers can be forgiven for being focused on the second half of the season.",
      "The format is simple: 32 drivers race for seeding over the next three races starting at Michigan on Sunday and concluding at Pocono on June 22. Drivers are seeded by their best finish for the five-race competition starting at Atlanta.",
      "Then it goes to single elimination with the field cut to 16 at Chicago, eight at Sonoma, four at Dover and the final two at Indianapolis Motor Speedway. The winner gets $1 million, and that does get drivers' attention as part of the new media rights deal that includes TNT.",
      "\u201cIt's going to be something fun that you pay attention to, and there\u2019s good money on the line,\u201d said Larson, the 2021 Cup Series champ. \u201cSo, you've just got to be really consistent throughout.\u201d",
      "Chris Buescher of RFK Racing is among those who didn't realize this challenge is starting. He needs race victories after losing points for a penalty at Kansas in May. The prize is nice.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s real money,\" Buescher said. \"But I don\u2019t want that to change how we go to the race track. We need to figure out how to win races. There\u2019s a lot more than that on the line at the end of the year.\u201d",
      "Three-time Cup Series champ Joey Logano compared this event's prize to the money up for grabs in the All-Star Race and this new competition like a stage win.",
      "\u201cThis is a little longer thing, but it\u2019s a race within the race,\" Logano said. \u201cSo you\u2019re not willing to give up a lot to do that, right?\u201d",
      "Denny Hamlin was excited when the In-season Challenge was first announced. Then he saw the courses for this competition, and his enthusiasm dimmed with the number of road courses included.",
      "\u201cTruthfully, we\u2019re going to get pretty lucky or have such a good draw that just things kind of work out,\" Hamlin said. \"I wish it was more conventional ovals, but I think that\u2019s just the way the schedule works out. And it\u2019s unfortunately not probably my prime part of the season.\u201d",
      "Brad Keselowski and his No. 6 Ford for RFK Racing went into Nashville at 32 \u2014 right on the line to be included in that chase for seeding. He hadn't given the competition much thought focused on this season. But he thinks it will be fun once it starts.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s good for the sport, good for our fans and it\u2019s a competition,\u201d Keselowski said. \"If there\u2019s competition, we want to win it. But that said, I think our heads down on one week at a time, in some ways one day at a time. ... And it\u2019s hard to look further ahead than that.\u201d",
      "With Ryan Blaney's first victory of the season at Nashville Superspeedway, Team Penske now has its three drivers qualified for the NASCAR Cup playoffs even with Nashville the first race of the second half of this year.",
      "Blaney, who hadn't won since November, joined Austin Cindric, who won at Talladega, and three-time Cup Series champ Joey Logano, a winner at Texas. Josh Berry, whose Wood Brothers Racing team has a relationship with Team Penske, also won at Las Vegas.",
      "Michael Nelson, president of Team Penske's NASCAR operations, said it was nice to have that pressure off all the teams.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s obviously pretty awesome to have a little bit of that pressure off for the guys,\" Nelson said. \"And again ... it gives you a chance to go out and take some chances here and there and try to rack up a bunch of wins. So now we\u2019re grateful to be at this point with our cars this time of year.\u201d",
      "Carson Hocevar matched his career-best finish driving from 26th to second at Nashville. The 22-year-old driver in his second Cup Series season with Spire Motorsports ticked off Ricky Stenhouse Jr. with his aggressive style.",
      "Hocevar clipped Stenhouse on Lap 106 of 300, sending him into the wall and out of the race. Stenhouse said Hocevar was overly aggressive and will talk to the young driver. Just not after the race.",
      "\u201cNo,\" Stenhouse said, \"that costs too much money.\u201d",

      "Tyrese Haliburton and Myles Turner beamed as they carried the Indiana Pacers shiny, new Eastern Conference championship trophy into their postgame news conferences Saturday night",
      "INDIANAPOLIS -- The Pacers have finally ended the franchise's 25-year NBA Finals drought, achieving the unthinkable after starting 10-15 and looking like anything but a title contender.",
      "Now Indiana will try to exorcise the demons of its decades-long, snake-bitten history and actually win the title when the Pacers take on the Oklahoma City in the NBA Finals.",
      "\u201cIt is really a special thing that happened 25 years ago, I wasn\u2019t even six months old,\u201d Tyrese Haliburton said after Indiana's series-ending victory over New York. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of fans who have never seen success from this organization, especially people around my age. They weren\u2019t alive for it.",
      "\"So it\u2019s really special what we\u2019re doing, and we\u2019re just trying to keep making this a special place, a place where people want to come.\u201d",
      "The Pacers play in a state where basketball is treated like religion, championship teams become royals and players and coaches emerge as revered figures when they achieve the unexpected like these Pacers.",
      "But Indiana hasn't always been that dream destination for NBA players, instead being tabbed as snake-bitten franchise for most of its 48 seasons in the league.",
      "\u2014 After winning three ABA titles, it took a telethon to save the financially floundering NBA newbie in July 1977.",
      "\u2014 The Pacers made just one playoff appearance during their first decade in the NBA, losing both games to Philadelphia.",
      "\u2014 Fans booed resoundingly when the Pacers used a first-round draft pick on Reggie Miller in 1987 instead of home-state favorite Steve Alford.",
      "\u2014 And their pathway to championships in the 1990s seemed hopelessly blocked by Michael Jordan's Bulls or Patrick Ewing's the Knicks until the breakthrough run in 2000 only to lose to Shaquille O'Neal, the late Kobe Bryant and the Lakers.",
      "And though Miller was still playing at a high level, it has taken another quarter-century to make it back.",
      "The journey hasn't been an easy one.",
      "This Pacers team rallied to eliminate some other snake-bitten opponents. They knocked out the 2021 NBA champion Milwaukee Bucks, the top-seeded Cleveland Cavaliers and the rival Knicks. The second final chapter begins Thursday in Oklahoma City.",
      "The expectations were different 25 years ago.",
      "Donnie Walsh revamped Indiana's roster by surrounding Miller with younger players following the 1999-2000 season, and four seasons later the Pacers posted the league's best record in 2003-04. They wound up losing the conference final in six games to Detroit.",
      "Then came the franchise-changing Malice in the Palace brawl in November 2004.",
      "Several lengthy suspensions gutted the team, derailing Miller's last title run while sending the franchise into a downward spiral. Larry Bird fired coach Rick Carlisle, his friend and ex-teammate, two years later and his departure was followed by a rash of devastating injuries.",
      "Danny Granger's budding career was cut short by knee tendinitis. Paul George suffered a compound fracture in his right leg in 2014 and he was traded to Oklahoma City in 2017. Two years later, All-Star guard Victor Oladipo ruptured his right quadriceps tendon and was subsequently traded, too.",
      "Myles Turner experienced most of the ups and downs of that decade from the Pacers locker room, and it only made his opportunity to hug Miller and Nancy Leonard, the widow of former Pacers longtime coach and broadcaster Bobby \u201cSlick\u201d Leonard, so much sweeter after winning the conference crown.",
      "\u201cIt was just pure excitement, pure validation,\" Turner said. \u201cJust all the years, all the hate, all the love, everything in between. So, man, in that moment, it was just pure exuberance.\u201d",
      "Turner was a pivotal piece \u2014 not the central one \u2014 when president of basketball operations Kevin Pritchard embarked on another rebuild midway through the 2021-22 season to form the core of this year's squad.",
      "He started by dealing All-Star forward Domantas Sabonis to Sacramento for Haliburton. Five months later, Indiana acquired forward Aason Nesmith from Boston for Malcolm Brogdon. And when Pritchard sent Bruce Brown to Toronto for Pascal Siakam in January 2024, Pritchard figured the Pacers finally had their big three.",
      "Fans were skeptical, but the Pacers ushered in a new era of basketball, one that combined Indiana's favorite sport with its longtime auto racing tradition, creating a track-like pace brand of basketball.",
      "In some ways, these Pacers are a throwback to their ABA roots \u2014 fast, high scoring, flurries of 3-pointers and made-for-television entertainment right down to the dance team.",
      "\u201cThe pace, it just fits who I am as a person, like the way I play the game,\u201d said Siakam, who won a championship ring with Toronto. \u201cWe have a lot of people who look down on us as an underdog and that's my style. I like that because that's been me my whole life.\u201d",
      "The Pacers will open as the underdog against the Thunder, the team George landed with all those years ago. Two former ABA powers, San Antonio and Denver, have won NBA titles. But if the Pacers can capture the Larry O'Brien trophy, they would be the league's only team to be crowned ABA and NBA champions.",
      "\u201cThis is not the time to be popping champagne,\u201d said Carlisle, who led the Dallas Mavericks to the 2010-11 title. \u201cGetting to the NBA Finals is an accomplishment. But if you start looking at it that way, you'll go into it with the wrong mindset. When you get to this point of the season, its two teams, it's one goal so it becomes an all or nothing thing.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Northern lights may be visible in parts of the U.S. Monday night following weekend solar storms.",
      "The sun burped out a huge burst of energy called a coronal mass ejection last week, prompting space weather forecasters to issue a rare, severe solar storm alert on Sunday, though it wasn't as strong as last year's record. Another one headed toward Earth on Monday could produce more aurora sightings.",
      "Authorities are monitoring for possible disruptions, though the worst is already over. The weekend\u2019s storms may have caused brief disruptions to high-frequency radio, said Erica Grow Cei, a spokesperson with National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.",
      "Auroras could be visible \u2014 especially in darker, rural areas \u2014 in Alaska, Washington, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Michigan, Wisconsin, Maine and northern parts of Idaho, Wyoming, Iowa, New York, Vermont and New Hampshire.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about auroras and how to spot them.",
      "The sun is at the maximum phase of its 11-year activity cycle, making the light displays more common and widespread. Colorful northern lights have decorated night skies in unexpected places and space weather experts say there are more auroras still to come.",
      "Last spring, the strongest geomagnetic storm in two decades slammed Earth, producing light displays across the Northern Hemisphere. And last fall, a powerful solar storm dazzled skygazers far from the Arctic Circle when dancing lights appeared in unexpected places including Germany, the United Kingdom, New England and New York City.",
      "Aurora displays known as the northern and southern lights are commonly visible near the poles, where charged particles from the sun interact with Earth's atmosphere.",
      "Skygazers are spotting the lights deeper into the United States and Europe because the sun is going through a major facelift. Every 11 years, its poles swap places, causing magnetic twists and tangles along the way.",
      "Severe storms are capable of scrambling radio and GPS communications.",
      "The sun\u2019s active spurt is expected to last at least through the end of this year, though when solar activity will peak won\u2019t be known until months after the fact, according to NASA and NOAA.",
      "Solar storms can bring more than colorful lights to Earth.",
      "When fast-moving particles and plasma slam into Earth\u2019s magnetic field, they can temporarily disrupt the power grid. Space weather can also interfere with air traffic control radio and satellites in orbit.",
      "In 1859, a severe solar storm triggered auroras as far south as Hawaii and caught telegraph lines on fire in a rare event. And a 1972 solar storm may have detonated magnetic U.S. sea mines off the coast of Vietnam.",
      "Space weather experts aren\u2019t able to predict a solar storm months in advance. Instead, they alert relevant parties to prepare in the days before a solar outburst hits Earth.",
      "Northern lights forecasts can be found on NOAA\u2019s Space Weather Prediction Center website or an aurora forecasting app.",
      "Consider aurora-watching in a quiet, dark area away from city lights. Experts recommend skygazing from a local or national park. And check the weather forecast because clouds can cover up the spectacle entirely.",
      "Taking a picture with a smartphone camera may also reveal hints of the aurora that aren\u2019t visible to the naked eye.",

      "\u201cAs it stands, proclamations of the impending demise of our galaxy seem greatly exaggerated,\u201d the Finnish-led team wrote in a study appearing in Nature Astronomy.",
      "While good news for the Milky Way galaxy, the latest forecast may be moot for humanity.",
      "\u201cWe likely won\u2019t live to see the benefit,\" lead author Till Sawala of the University of Helsinki said in an email.",
      "Already more than 4.5 billion years old, the sun is on course to run out of energy and die in another 5 billion years or so, but not before becoming so big it will engulf Mercury, Venus and possibly Earth. Even if it doesn\u2019t swallow Earth, the home planet will be left a burnt ball, its oceans long since boiled away.",
      "Sawala\u2019s international team relied on the latest observations by NASA\u2019s Hubble Space Telescope and the European Space Agency\u2019s Gaia star-surveying spacecraft to simulate the possible scenarios facing the Milky Way and next-door neighbor Andromeda. Both already collided with other galaxies in their ancient past and, according to many, seemed destined for a head-on crash.",
      "Past theories put a collision between the two \u2014 resulting in a new elliptical galaxy dubbed Milkomeda \u2014 as probable if not inevitable. Some predictions had that happening within 5 billion years, if not sooner.",
      "For this new study, the scientists relied on updated galaxy measurements to factor in the gravitational pull on the Milky Way's movement through the universe. They found that the effects of the neighboring Triangulum galaxy increased the likelihood of a merger between the Milky Way and Andromeda, while the Large Magellanic Cloud decreased those chances.",
      "Despite lingering uncertainty over the position, motion and mass of all these galaxies, the scientists ended up with 50-50 odds of a collision within the next 10 billion years.",
      "\u201cThe fate of our Milky Way galaxy is a subject of broad interest \u2014 not just to astronomers,\u201d said Raja GuhaThakurta of the University of California, Santa Cruz, who was not involved in the study,",
      "A full-on collision, he noted, would transform our home galaxy from a disk of stars seen as a milky band of diffuse light across the sky into a milky blob. A harmless flyby of the two galaxies could leave this stellar disk largely undisturbed, thus preserving our galaxy's name.",
      "More work is needed before the Milky Way\u2019s fate can be predicted with accuracy, according to the researchers. Further insight should help scientists better understand what's happening among galaxies even deeper in the cosmos.",
      "While our galaxy\u2019s fate remains highly uncertain, the sun\u2019s future is \u201cpretty much sealed,\" according to Sawala. \u201cOf course, there is also a very significant chance that humanity will bring an end to itself still much before that, without any need for astrophysical help.\"",

      "The 19 people are all believed to have passed away from natural causes between 1871 and 1872 at Charity Hospital, which served people of all races and classes in New Orleans during the height of white supremacist oppression in the 1800s. The hospital shuttered following Hurricane Katrina in 2005.",

      "Two more of the state-of-the-art aircraft will be delivered, while the contract with Airbus allows for the purchase of additional helicopters, said Airbus Senior Vice President for the H145 program Daniela Dudek.",

      "Scientists say 4 billion people, about half the world\u2019s population, experienced at least one extra month of extreme heat because of human-caused climate change from May 2024 to May 2025.",
      "The extreme heat caused illness, death, crop losses, and strained energy and health care systems, according to the analysis from World Weather Attribution, Climate Central and the Red Cross.",
      "\u201cAlthough floods and cyclones often dominate headlines, heat is arguably the deadliest extreme event,\u201d the report said. Many heat-related deaths are unreported or are mislabeled by other conditions like heart disease or kidney failure.",
      "The scientists used peer-reviewed methods to study how much climate change boosted temperatures in an extreme heat event and calculated how much more likely its occurrence was because of climate change. In almost all countries in the world, the number of extreme heat days has at least doubled compared with a world without climate change.",
      "Caribbean islands were among the hardest hit by additional extreme heat days. Puerto Rico, a territory of the United States, endured 161 days of extreme heat. Without climate change, only 48 would have occurred.",
      "\u201cIt makes it feel impossible to be outside,\u201d said Charlotte Gossett Navarro, chief director for Puerto Rico at Hispanic Federation, a nonprofit focused on social and environmental issues in Latino communities, who lives in the San Juan area and was not involved in the report.",
      "\u201cEven something as simple as trying to have a day outdoors with family, we weren\u2019t able to do it because the heat was too high,\" she said, reporting feeling dizzy and sick last summer.",
      "When the power goes out, which happens frequently in Puerto Rico in part because of decades of neglected grid maintenance and damage from Hurricane Maria in 2017, Navarro said it is difficult to sleep. \u201cIf you are someone relatively healthy, that is uncomfortable, it\u2019s hard to sleep ... but if you are someone who has a health condition, now your life is at risk,\u201d Gossett Navarro said.",
      "Heat waves are silent killers, said Friederike Otto, associate professor of climate science at Imperial College London, one of the report\u2019s authors. \u201cPeople don\u2019t fall dead on the street in a heat wave ... people either die in hospitals or in poorly insulated homes and therefore are just not seen,\u201d he said.",
      "Low-income communities and vulnerable populations, such as older adults and people with medical conditions, suffer the most from extreme heat.",
      "The high temperatures recorded in the extreme heat events that occurred in Central Asia in March, South Sudan in February and in the Mediterranean last July would have not been possible without climate change, according to the report. At least 21 people died in Morocco after temperatures hit 118 degrees Fahrenheit (48 degrees Celsius) last July. People are noticing temperatures are getting hotter but don't always know it is being driven by climate change, said Roop Singh, head of urban and attribution at the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre, in a World Weather Attribution statement.",
      "\u201cWe need to quickly scale our responses to heat through better early warning systems, heat action plans, and long-term planning for heat in urban areas to meet the rising challenge,\u201d Singh said.",
      "City-led initiatives to tackle extreme heat are becoming popular in parts of South Asia, North America, Europe and Australia to coordinate resources across governments and other agencies. One example is a tree-planting initiative launched in Marseille, France, to create more shaded areas.",
      "The report says strategies to prepare for heat waves include monitoring and reporting systems for extreme temperatures, providing emergency health services, cooling shelters, updated building codes, enforcing heat safety rules at work, and designing cities to be more heat-resilient.",
      "But without phasing out fossil fuels, heat waves will continue becoming more severe and frequent and protective measures against the heat will lose their effectiveness, the scientists said.",

      "Google will return to federal court Friday to fend off the U.S. Justice Department's attempt to topple its internet empire at the same time it's navigating a pivotal shift to artificial intelligence that could undercut its power.",
      "The legal and technological threats facing Google are among the key issues that will be dissected during the closing arguments of a legal proceeding that will determine the changes imposed upon the company in the wake of its dominant search engine being declared as an illegal monopoly by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta last year.",
      "Brandishing evidence presented during a recent three-week stretch of hearings, Justice Department lawyers will attempt to persuade Mehta to order a radical shake-up that includes a ban on Google paying to lock its search engine in as the default on smart devices and an order requiring the company to sell its Chrome browser.",
      "Google lawyers are expected to assert only minor concessions are needed, especially as the upheaval triggered by advances in artificial intelligence already are reshaping the search landscape, as alternative, conversational search options are rolling out from AI startups that are hoping to use the Department of Justice's four-and-half-year-old case to gain the upper hand in the next technological frontier.",
      "\u201cOver weeks of testimony, we heard from a series of well-funded companies eager to gain access to Google\u2019s technology so they don\u2019t have to innovate themselves,\u201d Lee-Anne Mulholland, Google's vice president of regulatory affairs, wrote in a blog post earlier this month. \u201cWhat we didn\u2019t hear was how DOJ\u2019s extreme proposals would benefit consumers.\u201d",
      "After the day-long closing arguments, Mehta will spend much of the summer mulling a decision that he plans to issue before Labor Day. Google has already vowed to appeal the ruling that branded its search engine as a monopoly, a step it can't take until the judge orders a remedy.",
      "While both sides of this showdown agree that AI is an inflection point for the industry's future, they have disparate views on how the shift will affect Google.",
      "The Justice Department contends that AI technology by itself won't rein in Google's power, arguing additional legal restraints must be slapped on a search engine that's the main reason its parent company, Alphabet Inc., is valued at $2 trillion.",
      "Google has already been deploying AI to transform its search engine i nto an answer engine, an effort that has so far helped maintain its perch as the internet's main gateway despite inroads being made by alternatives from the likes of OpenAI and Perplexity.",
      "The Justice Department contends a divestiture of the Chrome browser that Google CEO Sundar Pichai helped build nearly 20 years ago would be among the most effective countermeasures against Google continuing to amass massive volumes of browser traffic and personal data that could be leveraged to retain its dominance in the AI era. Executives from both OpenAi and Perplexity testified last month that they would be eager bidders for the Chrome browser if Mehta orders its sale.",
      "The debate over Google's fate also has pulled in opinions from Apple, mobile app developers, legal scholars and startups.",
      "Apple, which collects more than $20 billion annually to make Google the default search engine on the iPhone and its other devices, filed briefs arguing against the Justice Department's proposed 10-year ban on such lucrative lock-in agreements. Apple told the judge that prohibiting the contracts would deprive the company of money that it funnels into its own research, and that the ban might even make Google even more powerful because the company would be able to hold onto its money while consumers would end up choosing its search engine anyway. The Cupertino, California, company also told the judge a ban wouldn't compel it to build its own search engine to compete against Google.",
      "In other filings, a group of legal scholars said the Justice Department's proposed divestiture of Chrome would be an improper penalty that would inject unwarranted government interference in a company's business. Meanwhile, former Federal Trade Commission officials James Cooper and Andrew Stivers warned that another proposal that would require Google to share its data with rival search engines \u201cdoes not account for the expectations users have developed over time regarding the privacy, security, and stewardship\u201d of their personal information.",
      "The App Association, a group that represents mostly small software developers, also advised Mehta not to adopt the Justice Department's proposed changes because of the ripple effects they would have across the tech industry.",
      "Hobbling Google in the way the Justice Department envisions would make it more difficult for startups to realize their goal of being acquired, the App Association wrote. \u201cDevelopers will be overcome by uncertainty\u201d if Google is torn apart, the group argues.",
      "Buy Y Combinator, an incubator that has helped create hundreds of startups collectively worth about $800 billion filed documents pushing for the dramatic overhaul of Google, whose immense power has discouraged venture capitalists from investing in areas that are considered to be part of the company's \u201ckill zone.\u201d",
      "Startups \u201calso need to be able to get their products into the hands of users, free from restrictive dealing and self-preferencing that locks up important distribution channels. As things stand, Google has locked up the most critical distribution channels, freezing the general search and search text advertising markets into static competition for more than a decade,\u201d Y Combinator told Mehta.",

Launched in 2000 by Brazilian and British scientists, Esecaflor \u2014 short for \u201cForest Drought Study Project\u201d in Portuguese\u2014 set out to simulate a future in which the changing climate could deplete the Amazon of rainfall. It is the longest-running project of its kind in the world, and has become a source for dozens of academic articles in fields ranging from meteorology to ecology and physiology.",
      "Understanding how drought can affect the Amazon, an area twice the size of India that crosses into several South American nations, has implications far beyond the region. The rainforest stores a massive amount of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas that is the main driver of climate change. According to one study, the Amazon stores the equivalent of two years of global carbon emissions, which mainly come from the burning of coal, oil and gasoline. When trees are cut, or wither and die from drought, they release into the atmosphere the carbon they were storing, which accelerates global warming.",
      "To mimic stress from drought, the project, located in the Caxiuana National Forest, assembled about 6,000 transparent plastic rectangular panels across one hectare (2.5 acres), diverting around 50% of the rainfall from the forest floor. They were set 1 meter above ground (3.3 ft) on the sides to 4 meters (13.1 ft) above ground in the center. The water was funneled into gutters and channeled through trenches dug around the plot\u2019s perimeter.",
      "Next to it, an identical plot was left untouched to serve as a control. In both areas, instruments were attached to trees, placed on the ground and buried to measure soil moisture, air temperature, tree growth, sap flow and root development, among other data. Two metal towers sit above each plot.",
      "In each tower, NASA radars measure how much water is in the plants, which helps researchers understand overall forest stress. The data is sent to the space agency's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California, where it is processed.",
      "\u201cThe forest initially appeared to be resistant to the drought,\" said Lucy Rowland, an ecology professor at the University of Exeter.",
      "That began to change about 8 years in, however. \"We saw a really big decline in biomass, big losses and mortality of the largest trees,\u201d said Rowland.",
      "This resulted in the loss of approximately 40% of the total weight of the vegetation and the carbon stored within it from the plot. The main findings were detailed in a study published in May in the journal Nature Ecology & Evolution. It shows that during the years of vegetation loss, the rainforest shifted from a carbon sink, that is, a storer of carbon dioxide, to a carbon emitter, before eventually stabilizing.",
      "There was one piece of good news: the decades-long drought didn\u2019t turn the rainforest into a savanna, or large grassy plain, as earlier model-based studies had predicted.",
      "In November, most of the 6,000 transparent plastic covers were removed, and now scientists are observing how the forest changes. There is currently no end date for the project.",
      "\u201cThe forest has already adapted. Now we want to understand what happens next,\u201d said meteorologist Jo\u00e3o de Athaydes, vice coordinator of Esecaflor, a professor at the Federal University of Para and coauthor of the Nature study. \u201cThe idea is to see whether the forest can regenerate and return to the baseline from when we started the project.\u201d",
      "During a visit in April, Athaydes guided Associated Press journalists through the site, which had many researchers. The area was so remote that most researchers had endured a full-day boat trip from the city of Belem, which will host the next annual U.N. climate talks later this year. During the days in the field, the scientists stayed at the Ferreira Penna Scientific Base of the Emilio Goeldi Museum, a few hundred yards (meters) from the plots.",
      "Four teams were at work. One collected soil samples to measure root growth in the top layer. Another gathered weather data and tracking soil temperature and moisture. A third was measured vegetation moisture and sap flow. The fourt focused on plant physiology.",
      "\"We know very little about how drought influences soil processes,\u201d said ecologist Rachel Selman, researcher at the University of Edinburgh and one of the co-authors of the Nature study, during a break.",
      "Esecaflor's drought simulation draws some parallels with the past two years, when much of the Amazon rainforest, under the influence of El Nino and the impact of climate change, endured its most severe dry spells on record. The devastating consequences ranged from the death of dozens of river dolphins due to warming and receding waters to vast wildfires in old-growth areas.",
      "Rowland explained that the recent El Nino brought short-term, intense impacts to the Amazon, not just through reduced rainfall but also with spikes in temperature and vapor pressure deficit, a measure of how dry the air is. In contrast, the Esecaflor experiment focused only on manipulating soil moisture to study the effects of long-term shifts in rainfall.",
      "\u201cBut in both cases, we\u2019re seeing a loss of the forest\u2019s ability to absorb carbon,\u201d she said. \u201cInstead, carbon is being released back into the atmosphere, along with the loss of forest cover.\u201d",

      "The typical compensation package for chief executives who run companies in the S&P 500 jumped nearly 10% in 2024 as the stock market enjoyed another banner year and corporate profits rose sharply",
      "NEW YORK -- The typical compensation package for chief executives who run companies in the S&P 500 jumped nearly 10% in 2024 as the stock market enjoyed another banner year and corporate profits rose sharply.",
      "Many companies have heeded calls from shareholders to tie CEO compensation more closely to performance. As a result, a large proportion of pay packages consist of stock awards, which the CEO often can\u2019t cash in for years, if at all, unless the company meets certain targets, typically a higher stock price or market value or improved operating profits.",
      "The Associated Press\u2019 CEO compensation survey, which uses data analyzed for The AP by Equilar, included pay data for 344 executives at S&P 500 companies who have served at least two full consecutive fiscal years at their companies, which filed proxy statements between Jan. 1 and April 30.",
      "Here are the key takeaways from the survey:",
      "The median pay package for CEOs rose to $17.1 million, up 9.7%. Meanwhile, the median employee at companies in the survey earned $85,419, reflecting a 1.7% increase year over year.",
      "CEOs had to navigate sticky inflation and relatively high interest rates last year, as well as declining consumer confidence. But the economy also provided some tail winds: Consumers kept spending despite their misgivings about the economy; inflation did subside somewhat; the Fed lowered interest rates; and the job market stayed strong.",
      "The stock market's main benchmark, the S&P 500, rose more than 23% last year. Profits for companies in the index rose more than 9%.",
      "\u201c2024 was expected to be a strong year, so the (nearly) 10% increases are commensurate with the timing of the pay decisions,\u201d said Dan Laddin, a partner at Compensation Advisory Partners.",
      "Sarah Anderson, who directs the Global Economy Project at the progressive Institute for Policy Studies, said there have been some recent \u201clong-overdue\u201d increases in worker pay, especially for those at the bottom of the wage scale. But she said too many workers in the world's richest countries still struggle to pay their bills.",
      "Rick Smith, the founder and CEO of Axon Enterprises, topped the survey with a pay package valued at $164.5 million. Axon, which makes Taser stun guns and body cameras, saw revenue grow more than 30% for three straight years and posted record annual net income of $377 million in 2024. Axon's shares more than doubled last year after rising more than 50% in 2023.",
      "Almost all of Smith's pay package consists of stock awards, which he can only receive if the company meets targets tied to its stock price and operations for the period from 2024 to 2030. Companies are required to assign a value to the stock awards when they are granted.",
      "Other top earners in the survey include Lawrence Culp, CEO of what is now GE Aerospac e ($87.4 million), Tim Cook at Apple ($74.6 million), David Gitlin at Carrier Global ($65.6 million) and Ted Sarandos at Netflix ($61.9 million). The bulk of those pay packages consisted of stock or options awards.",
      "The median stock award rose almost 15% last year compared to a 4% increase in base salaries, according to Equilar.",
      "\u201cFor CEOs, target long-term incentives consistently increase more each year than salaries or bonuses,\" said Melissa Burek, also a partner at Compensation Advisory Partners. \"Given the significant role that long-term incentives play in executive pay, this trend makes sense.\u201d",
      "Jackie Cook at Morningstar Sustainalytics said the benefit of tying CEO pay to performance is \u201cthat share-based pay appears to provide a clear market signal that most shareholders care about.\" But she notes that the greater use of share-based pay has led to a \u201cphenomenal rise\u201d in CEO compensation \u201ctracking recent years' market performance,\u201d which has \"widened the pay gap within workplaces.\"",
      "Some well-known billionaire CEOs are low in the AP survey. Warren Buffett's compensation was valued at $405,000, about five times what a worker at Berkshire Hathaway makes. According to Tesla\u2019s proxy, Elon Musk received no compensation for 2024, but in 2018 he was awarded a multiyear package that has been valued at $56 billion and is the subject of a court battle.",
      "Other notable CEOs didn't meet the criteria for inclusion the survey. Starbucks' Brian Niccol received a pay package valued at $95.8 million, but he only took over as CEO on Sept. 9. Nvidia's Jensen Huang saw his compensation grow to $49.9 million, but the company filed its proxy after April 30.",
      "At half the companies in AP\u2019s annual pay survey, it would take the worker at the middle of the company\u2019s pay scale 192 years to make what the CEO did in one. Companies have been required to disclose this so-called pay ratio since 2018.",
      "The pay ratio tends to be highest at companies in industries where wages are typically low. For instance, at cruise line company Carnival Corp., its CEO earned nearly 1,300 times the median pay of $16,900 for its workers. McDonald's CEO makes about 1,000 times what a worker making the company's median pay does. Both companies have operations that span numerous countries.",
      "Overall, wages and benefits netted by private-sector workers in the U.S. rose 3.6% through 2024, according to the Labor Department. The average worker in the U.S. makes $65,460 a year. That figure rises to $92,000 when benefits such as health care and other insurance are included.",
      "\u201cWith CEO pay continuing to climb, we still have an enormous problem with excessive pay gaps,\u201d Anderson said. \"These huge disparities are not only unfair to lower-level workers who are making significant contributions to company value \u2013 they also undercut enterprise effectiveness by lowering employee morale and boosting turnover rates.\u201d",
      "For the 27 women who made the AP survey \u2014 the highest number dating back to 2014 \u2014 median pay rose 10.7% to $20 million. That compares to a 9.7% increase to $16.8 million for their male counterparts.",
      "The highest earner among female CEOs was Judith Marks of Otis Worldwide, with a pay package valued at $42.1 million. The company, known for its elevators and escalators, has had operating profit above $2 billion for four straight years. About $35 million of Marks' compensations was in the form of stock awards.",
      "Other top earners among female CEOs were Jane Fraser of Citigroup ($31.1 million), Lisa Su of Advanced Micro Devices ($31 million), Mary Barra at General Motors ($29.5 million) and Laura Alber at Williams-Sonoma ($27.7 million).",
      "Christy Glass, a professor of sociology at Utah State University who studies equity, inclusion and leadership, said while there may be a few more women on the top paid CEO list, overall equity trends are stagnating, particularly as companies cut back on DEI programs.",
      "\u201cThere are maybe a couple more names on the list, but we\u2019re really not moving the needle significantly,\u201d she said.",
      "Equilar found that a larger number of companies are offering security perquisites as part of executive compensation packages, possibly in reaction to the December shooting of UnitedHealthCare CEO Brian Thompson.",
      "Equilar said an analysis of 208 companies in the S&P 500 that filed proxy statements by April 2 showed that the median spending on security rose to $94,276 last year from $69,180 in 2023.",
      "Among the companies that increased their security perks were Centene, which provides health care services to Medicare and Medicaid, and the chipmaker Intel.",

      "A push in Texas to ban children under 18 years old from social media platforms is fading at the state Capitol",
      "AUSTIN, Texas -- A push in Texas to ban social media accounts for children under 18 faded Thursday after lawmakers did not take a key vote on creating one of the nation's toughest restrictions aimed at keeping minors off platforms such as TikTok, Snapchat and Instagram.",
      "The bill, which already passed the GOP-controlled state House, aims to go further than a Florida social media ban for minors under 14. Australia banned social media accounts for anyone under 16.",
      "But earlier momentum behind the Texas measure slowed at the eleventh hour in the state Senate as lawmakers face a weekend deadline to send bills to Republican Gov. Greg Abbott. Abbott has not said publicly whether he supported the proposed ban, which was opposed by tech trade groups and critics who called it it an unconstitutional limit on free speech.",
      "\u201cThis bill was the best way to protect children in this state,\u201d state Rep. Jared Patterson, a Republican carrying the measure, said Wednesday.",
      "The legislative session ends Monday. That leaves a narrowing path for the proposal that, if passed, would set up another test of state efforts to set boundaries on how and when children can access social media.",
      "Many tech companies have established a presence in Texas, including X, which is owned by Elon Musk.",
      "Earlier this week, Abbott signed into law a separate measure requiring Apple and Google to verify the age of online app store users, as well as parental consent to download apps and make in-app purchases for users under 18. Utah passed a similar bill earlier this year.",
      "The proposed Texas ban aimed at minors is the latest move in a growing bipartisan push nationwide to address the impacts of social media on the well-being of children.

      "All, authorities allege, were victims tied to cryptocurrency-related crimes that have spilled out from behind computer screens and into the real world as the largely unregulated currency surges in value.",
      "While crypto thefts are not new, the use of physical violence is a far more recent trend, said John Griffin, a finance professor at the University of Texas in Austin who tracks financial crimes.",

Attorneys for both men declined to comment.",

      "Some are accused of hacking websites and servers to steal cryptocurrency databases and identify targets, but others are alleged to have broken into victims\u2019 homes to steal their \u201chardware wallets\u201d \u2014 devices that provide access to their crypto accounts.",
      "The case stemmed from an investigation that started after a couple in Connecticut last year were forced out of a Lamborghini SUV, assaulted and bound in the back of a van. Authorities allege the incident was a ransom plot targeting the couple\u2019s son \u2014 who they say helped steal more than $240 million worth of Bitcoin from a single victim. The son has not been charged, but is being detained on an unspecified \u201cfederal misdemeanor offense\u201d charge, according to online jail records.

      "As a group, cryptocurrency theft victims reported the most losses \u2014 more than $6.5 billion",
      "The agency and experts say the crypto crime underworld is likely being fueled by the large amounts of money at stake \u2013 combined with weak regulation of cryptocurrency that allows many transactions to be made without identity documents.",
      "Violence may be increasing for several reasons including that criminals believe they can get away with crypto theft because transactions are hard to trace and often cloaked by anonymity, according to the crypto tracing firm TRM Labs. And crypto holders are getting easier to identify because of the prevalence of personal information online and people flaunting their crypto wealth on social media, the firm says.",
      "Phil Ariss, TRM Labs\u2019 director of UK public sector relations, said crypto also may be attracting criminal groups that have long used violence.",
      "\u201cAs long as there\u2019s a viable route to launder or liquidate stolen assets, it makes little difference to the offender whether the target is a high-value watch or a crypto wallet,\u201d Ariss said in a statement. \u201cCryptocurrency is now firmly in the mainstream, and as a result, our traditional understanding of physical threat and robbery needs to evolve accordingly.\"",

      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Artificial intelligence technology bellwether Nvidia overcame a wave of tariff-driven turbulence to deliver another quarter of robust growth amid feverish demand for its high-powered chips that are making computers seem more human.",
      "The results announced Wednesday for the February-April period came against the backdrop of President Donald Trump\u2019s on-again, off-again trade war that has whipsawed Nvidia and other Big Tech companies riding AI mania to propel their revenue and stock prices upward.",
      "But Trump\u2019s tariffs \u2014 many of which have been reduced or temporarily suspended \u2013 hammered the market values of Nvidia and other tech powerhouses heading into the springtime earnings season as investors fretted about the trade turmoil dimming the industry\u2019s prospects.",
      "Those worries have eased during the past six weeks as most Big Tech companies lived up to or exceeded the analyst projections that steer investors, capped by Nvidia\u2019s report for its fiscal first quarter.",
      "Nvidia earned $18.8 billion, or 76 cents per share, for the period, a 26% increase from the same time last year. Revenue surged 69% from a year ago to $44.1 billion. If not for a $4.5 billion charge that Nvidia absorbed to account for the U.S. government\u2019s restrictions on its chip sales to China, Nvidia would have made 96 cents per share, far above the 73 cents per share envisioned by analysts.",
      "In another positive sign, Nvidia predicted its revenue for the May-July period would be about $45 billion, roughly the level that investors had been anticipating. The forecast includes an estimated $8 billion loss in sales to China due to the export controls during its fiscal second quarter, after the restrictions cost it about $2.5 billion in revenue during the first quarter.",
      "In a conference call with analysts, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang lamented that the U.S. government had effectively blocked off AI chip sales to China \u2014 a market that he estimated at $50 billion. Huang warned the export controls have spurred China to build more of its own chips in a shift that he predicted the U.S. will eventually regret.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. based its policy on the assumption that China cannot make AI chips. That assumption was always questionable, and now it\u2019s clearly wrong,\u201d Huang said.",
      "Despite Nvidia's lost opportunities in China, investors were heartened by the company's first-quarter performance. Nvidia's shares gained more than 4% in extended trading after the numbers came out. Nvidia\u2019s stock price ended Wednesday\u2019s regular trading session at $134.81, just slightly below where it stood before Trump\u2019s Jan. 20 inauguration. The price had plunged to as low as $86.62 last month during a nosedive that temporarily erased $1.2 trillion in shareholder wealth.",
      "The outlook began brightening for Nvidia last month after AI leaders such as Microsoft, Alphabet and Meta Platforms reaffirmed their plans to invest heavily in AI. That spending has been a boon for Nvidia because its chipsets provide the technology\u2019s brainpower, an advantage that has helped the company's annual revenue from $27 billion to $130 billion in just two years.",
      "Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives estimates Big Tech companies will spend about $325 billion on long-term investments primarily revolving around AI this year, with a substantial chunk of that money budgeted for Nvidia\u2019s chips \u201cThere is one chip in the world fueling the AI revolution and it's Nvidia. That narrative is clear from these results,\u201d Ives wrote in a research note.",
      "Trump\u2019s trade war has been raising doubts about Nvidia\u2019s ability to maintain its astounding momentum by threatening to close off other key markets besides China.",
      "In apparent attempt to curry favor with the president, Huang last month announced Nvidia will help boost U.S. manufacturing by building some of its AI chips and supercomputers in plants located in Arizona and Texas. Huang also accompanied Trump on a trip to Saudi Arabia earlier this month, signaling Nvidia\u2019s ambitions to sell more of its AI chips in the Middle East as that region attempts to lessen its economy dependence on oil.",
      "Trump also extended a helping hand to Nvidia of by rescinding the scheduled start export controls that had been drawn up under President Joe Biden\u2019s administration that would have broadened the restrictions on chips sales in foreign markets beyond the limits already in place on deals with China and Russia.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. will always be Nvidia\u2019s largest market and home to the largest installed base of our infrastructure,\u201d Huang said. \u201cEvery nation now sees AI as core to the next industrial revolution.\u201d",

      "Speaking at a bitcoin conference in Las Vegas, Vance urged the crypto executives and enthusiasts to keep pressure on Congress to pass pro-crypto legislation supported by the White House.",
      "\u201cWe have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to unleash innovation and use it to improve the lives of countless American citizens,\u201d Vance said in his address. \u201cBut if we fail to create regulatory clarity now, we risk chasing this $3 trillion industry offshore in search of a friendly jurisdiction.\u201d",
      "Vance\u2019s speech comes after Trump promised to make the U.S. the \u201ccrypto capital of the planet\u201d when he addressed the same bitcoin conference in Nashville last year in the middle of the presidential campaign. The crypto industry, which felt unfairly attacked by the Biden administration, spent heavily to help Trump and pro-crypto lawmakers win election.",
      "Vance praised how quickly the crypto industry was able to organize and influence U.S. politics during last year\u2019s election, giving special credit to Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, the billionaire founders of the crypto exchange Gemini.",
      "\u201cYou chose to speak up and you chose to get involved and I believe you changed the direct trajectory of our country because of it,\u201d Vance told the crowd gathered at the Venetian Hotel.",
      "Vance hailed crypto as a hedge that can help conservative populists protect themselves against bad politicians, overly aggressive regulators and unethical elites. He predicted its continued assimilation into the financial mainstream and said it was strategically important for the U.S. to be a world leader in the industry, noting that the Chinese government is hostile to crypto.",
      "Vance also touted the Trump administration\u2019s record at fulfilling the campaign promises made last year.",
      "As president, Trump has established a strategic bitcoin reserve for the federal government and pardoned Ross Ulbricht, the founder of Silk Road, a black market website that was key to the early growth of bitcoin. Trump has also staked his administration with outspoken crypto backers while his administration has undone or paused several enforcement actions taken against large crypto companies.",
      "Several other Trump officials are speakers at the bitcoin conference, as are his sons Don Jr. and Eric. The president and his family\u2019s use of crypto as a platform to make money for the Trump brand has drawn criticism from Democrats and even crypto enthusiasts as corrupt and unseemly.",
      "The Trump family holds about a 60% stake in World Liberty Financial, a crypto project that recently launched its own stablecoin, a fast-growing form of cryptocurrency whose values is often tied to the U.S. dollar. The U.S. Senate advanced legislation earlier this month that creates a federal framework to regulate stablecoins, a bill that Vance said the Trump administration wants passed into law quickly.",
      "Trump\u2019s media company announced Tuesday that it was raising $2.5 billion to buy bitcoin, the world\u2019s oldest and most popular cryptocurrency. The president and the first lady have also launched their own meme coins, with Trump recently attending a dinner for some of his coins\u2019 biggest investors.",

      "Scientists have identified a new pod of ancient people who lived near the land bridge between North America and South America",
      "NEW YORK -- Scientists have identified a new pod of ancient hunter-gatherers who lived near the land bridge between North America and South America about 6,000 years ago.",
      "Researchers are still charting how human populations spread across the Americas thousands of years ago, arriving first in North America before veering south. Groups that split off developed their own collection of genes that scientists can use to piece together the human family tree.",
      "Discovered through ancient DNA, the group lived in the high plateaus of present-day Bogot\u00e1, Colombia \u2014 close to where the Americas meet. Scientists aren't sure exactly where they fall in the family tree because they're not closely related to ancient Native Americans in North America and also not linked to ancient or present-day South Americans.",
      "The new study was published Wednesday in the journal Science Advances.",
      "\u201cUp to this point, we didn\u2019t believe there was any other lineage that would appear in South America,\" said archaeologist Andre Luiz Campelo dos Santos with Florida Atlantic University who was not involved with the new research. \u201cThis is unexpected.\u201d",
      "Just 4,000 years later, these ancient humans were gone and a genetically-different human clan inhabited the area. Scientists aren\u2019t sure exactly what happened to make them fade away \u2014 whether they mixed into a new, bigger group or were pushed out entirely.",
      "Analyzing more genes in South America will help confirm if this new group truly did disappear or if there could be evidence of their descendants elsewhere, said Campelo dos Santos.",

      "The headline-grabbing tale of an Italian man who said he was kidnapped and tortured for weeks inside an upscale Manhattan townhouse by captors seeking his bitcoin highlights a dark corner of the cryptocurrency world: the threat of violence by thieves seeking digital assets.",
      "The alleged attempted robbery is known as a \u201cwrench attack.\u201d It\u2019s a name popularized by an online comic that mocked how easily high-tech security can be undone by hitting someone with a wrench until they give up passwords.",
      "Wrench attacks are on the rise thanks in part to cryptocurrency\u2019s move into mainstream finance, Phil Ariss of the crypto tracing firm TRM Labs said in a recent blog post.",
      "\u201cCriminal groups already comfortable with using violence to achieve their goals were always likely to migrate to crypto,\u201d Ariss said.",
      "Some of the crypto\u2019s key characteristics help explain why wealthy individuals who hold a lot of digital assets can be ripe targets for such attacks.",
      "Cryptocurrencies like bitcoin offer traders full control of their funds without the need for a bank or permission from a government to buy, sell or hold it. The trade-off is that if funds are lost or stolen, there can be no way to get them back.",
      "Self-reliance is a key ethos of crypto. Securing and controlling one\u2019s private keys, which are like passwords used to access one\u2019s crypto holdings, is viewed as sacrosanct among many in the crypto community. A popular motto is \u201cnot your keys, not your coins.\u201d",
      "Transactions on the blockchain, the technology that powers cryptocurrencies, are permanent. And unlike cash, jewelry, gold or other items of value, thieves don\u2019t need to carry around stolen crypto. With a few clicks, huge amounts of wealth can be transferred from one address to another.",
      "In the case in New York, where two people have been charged, a lot of details have yet to come out, including the value of the bitcoin the victim possessed.",
      "Stealing cryptocurrency is almost as old as cryptocurrency itself, but it\u2019s usually done by hacking. North Korean state hackers alone are believed to have stolen billions of dollars\u2019 worth of crypto in recent years.",
      "In response to the threat of hacking, holders of a large amount of crypto often try and keep their private keys off the internet and stored in what are called \u201ccold wallets.\u201d Used properly, such wallets can defeat even the most sophisticated and determined hackers.",
      "But they can\u2019t defeat thieves who force a victim to give up their password to access their wallets and move money.",
      "The case in New York is the latest in a string of high-profile wrench attacks. Several have taken place in France, where thieves cut off a crypto executive\u2019s finger.",
      "Experts suggest several ways to mitigate the threats of wrench attacks, including using wallets that require multiple approvals before any transactions.",
      "Perhaps the most common way crypto-wealthy individuals try to prevent wrench attacks is by trying to stay anonymous. Using nicknames and cartoon avatars in social media accounts is common in the crypto community, even among top executives at popular companies.",

      "An international team reported Wednesday that this celestial object \u2014 perhaps a star, pair of stars or something else entirely \u2014 is emitting X-rays around the same time it\u2019s shooting out radio waves. What\u2019s more, the cycle repeats every 44 minutes, at least during periods of extreme activity.",
      "Located 15,000 light-years away in a region of the Milky Way brimming with stars, gas and dust, this object could be a highly magnetized dead star like a neutron or white dwarf, Curtin University\u2019s Ziteng Andy Wang said in an email from Australia.",
      "Or it could be \u201csomething exotic\u201d and unknown, said Wang, lead author of the study published in the journal Nature.",
      "NASA\u2019s Chandra X-ray Observatory spotted the X-ray emissions by chance last year while focusing on a supernova remnant, or the remains of an exploded star. Wang said it was the first time X-rays had been seen coming from a so-called long-period radio transient, a rare object that cycles through radio signals over tens of minutes.",
      "Given the uncertain distance, astronomers can't tell if the weird object is associated with the supernova remnant or not. A single light-year is 5.8 trillion miles.",
      "The hyperactive phase of this object \u2014 designated ASKAP J1832\u2212091 \u2014 appeared to last about a month. Outside of that period, the star did not emit any noticeable X-rays. That could mean more of these objects may be out there, scientists said.",

      "The justices rejected an appeal from gun rights advocates.",
      "The Supreme Court on Monday turned away an appeal by a group of gun-rights advocates seeking to overturn Maryland's ban on assault-style rifles and high-capacity magazines under the Second Amendment.",
      "The decision, a major win for gun-safety advocates, leaves in place a ruling by the Fourth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals which ruled that the state may constitutionally prohibit sale and possession of the weapons.",
      "The state legislation, enacted in 2013 after the Sandy Hook elementary school shooting, specifically targets the AR-15 -- the most popular rifle in America with 20-30 million in circulation. They are legal in 41 of the 50 states.",

      "Justice Brett Kavanaugh agreed with the court's decision to let the Maryland law stand, for now, but wrote separately to call the appeals court ruling \"questionable.\" Kavanaugh said that he expects the high court to weigh in formally on the legality of the AR-15 in the \"next term or two.\"",

      "Some Republican senators say they won\u2019t support bill that increases the deficit.",
      "As the Senate prepares to put its imprint on President Donald Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act this week, Republicans are grappling over the potential impact the megabill might have on the national debt, which has ballooned to nearly $37 trillion.",
      "With a 10-year budget bill, deficit hawks in the Senate like Rand Paul and Ron Johnson are drawing a red line -- pushing for deeper cuts than those in the bill the House sent to them.",
      "As lawmakers aim to send a bill to Trump by the Fourth of July, those demands could complicate the Senate's calculus for passage -- where Republicans can only afford three defections.",
      "On one hand, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act reduces outlays by more than $1.5 trillion against current baseline spending -- according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office's preliminary analysis, meeting reconciliation's target for between $1.5 to $2 trillion in spending reductions.",
      "On the other hand, the bill still adds about $3.1 trillion to the debt, according to the CBO -- though some Republicans like Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky predict it could add up to $20 trillion to the debt over the next decade.",
      "At odds with the White House",
      "Paul and Johnson are directly at odds with the White House, which points to an analysis from the White House Council of Economic Advisors that finds the legislation will save $1.6 trillion over 10 years.",
      "\"There's $1.6 trillion worth of savings in this bill,\" White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said during a May 19 press briefing. \"That's the largest savings for any legislation that has ever passed Capitol Hill in our nation's history.\"",
      "In a press briefing on Thursday, Leavitt attacked the CBO and other scorekeepers, saying they used \"shoddy assumptions and have historically been terrible at forecasting across Democrat and Republican administrations alike.\"",
      "The Senate is expected to alter the House-passed proposal and some of the Senate's fiscal hawks have conditioned their support on the implementation of even steeper cuts. But any cuts these members want implemented will have to be balanced by Senate leadership against the desires of moderates who wish to preserve key social safety net programs, creating major challenges for hopes of offsetting the cost of the package.",
      "Will the House and Senate see eye-to-eye?",
      "Another complication: any changes to the bill made by the Senate must be approved by the House, which narrowly sent the bill to the upper chamber by just one vote.",
      "Speaker Mike Johnson, who guided the bill through the House over the objections from both fiscal hard-liners and moderates in his conference, declared \"It's not going to add to the debt,\" when asked if Trump would take ownership of an increase of the deficit.",
      "And he said he and Trump has the same concerns as Johnson and Paul.",
      "\"He's also concerned as I am, as Ron Johnson is, as Rand Paul is, as all of us are about the nation's debt, and he and I talk about this frequently, and he is excited about changing that trajectory,\" he said on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\"",
      "The bill sent to the Senate would also hike the federal debt limit by $4 trillion dollars, another sticking point with fiscal hawks.",
      "\"There's nothing fiscally conservative about expanding the debt ceiling more than we've ever done it before,\" Paul said after the bill passed through the House two weeks ago. \"This will be the greatest increase in the debt ceiling ever, and the GOP owns this now.\"",
      "'Wimpy and anemic'",
      "At an event last week in Iowa, Paul repeated his disdain for the bill, calling the current cuts \"wimpy and anemic\" and suggesting that additional cutbacks could happen to entitlement programs like Medicaid and Social Security -- areas where a line has been drawn by Trump and fellow GOP senators like Josh Hawley of Missouri, who called building the bill on cutting health insurance for the working poor \"morally wrong and politically suicidal.\"",

    "summary": "Schiff again asks White House for disclosure of senior officials' financial transactions around Trump's sudden pause in April of his sweeping set of tariffs.",
    "story": [
      "Schiff asked first in April over \"insider trading\" concerns amid tariffs pause.",
      "Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff in a letter to White House chief of staff Susie Wiles sent Monday, repeated his calls for the White House to issue a full disclosure of financial transactions from senior officials.",
      "The new ask comes after the California senator -- along with 25 other Democratic members of Congress -- sent a separate letter to Wiles in April that outlined his concern surrounding potential ethics violations, asking for a commitment from all senior White House and executive branch employees to \"expeditiously\" transmit all reports related to their securities transactions since the start of Trump's term to the Office of Government Ethics, and that the reports be made public.",
      "That April letter was sent in the wake of President Donald Trump's sudden pause that month of his sweeping set of tariffs, which triggered widespread concern from Schiff and other Democrats that those close to the president might have engaged in insider trading as markets rose following the pause.",
      "In his Monday letter, addressed to Wiles like the first but also including White House Counsel David Warrington, Schiff notes that senior executive White House officials are \u201cnow beyond the maximum allowable filing period for individuals who began their service at the outset of the Administration\u201d under federal ethics laws, which mandate that they file public annual financial disclosure documents, including a new entrant report, within 30 days of assuming their duties.",
      "\u201cThe White House has yet to disclose any financial disclosure or transaction reports, even after widespread concern of potential insider trading following President Trump's sudden pause of sweeping tariffs in early April,\u201d Schiff writes in the letter, first shared first with ABC News.",
      "\u201cAccording to OGE\u2019s disclosure database to date, no new entrant reports for any senior White House officials have been made available for public disclosure, despite legal requirements under the Ethics in Government Act and the clear public interest in the financial disclosures of senior executive branch leaders, raising questions as to whether the required public reports have yet to be submitted to OGE for certification,\u201d he added.",
      "Asked by ABC News for comment on the letter, White House spokesman Kush Desai said on Monday, \u201cThe American people remain highly concerned about Nancy Pelosi\u2019s long, documented history of insider trading and eagerly await Adam Schiff refocusing his political stunt on serious issues, like Pelosi\u2019s portfolio.\u201d",
      "Pelosi has faced allegations of trading on inside information during her time in Congress but has denied any impropriety.",
      "Copied on Schiff's letter is also Jamieson Greer, the acting director of the U.S. Office of Government Ethics, and Scott Gast, the ethics attorney in the White House counsel's office.",
      "In their April letter, the Democrats requested a response from Wiles no later than May 9, 2025, and for a \"detailed plan\" for how the administration plans to address any officials and employees who might have failed to file required disclosures from the start of the administration.",
      "A spokesperson for Schiff said that they received from the White House an acknowledgement that they had received the letter, but provided no answers to their demands.",
      "In the newest letter, Schiff asked for Wiles and Warrington to send, no later than on June 10, a list of all White House officials required to file new entrant reports; an explanation for the failure to transmit any new entrant reports to OGE for second-level review and certification; the current status and anticipated timeline for the submission and public posting of all overdue disclosures; a list of any filing extensions requested and granted by designated White House ethics officials and the duration of those extensions; and whether any late filing fees have been imposed for delinquent filings, as required by law.",
      "\u201cTransparency and compliance with ethics laws are essential. The American public deserves to know that those serving at the highest levels of government are free from financial conflicts of interest and have complied with the laws designed to safeguard the integrity of public service. I look forward to reviewing your responses,\u201d the senator concluded.",
      "Trump's tariffs have faced a number of court challenges. An appeals court reinstated Trump's tariffs this week after a Wednesday court order blocked them. The appeals court decision stands for the time being.",
      "The block on the tariffs came after the Court of International Trade decided that the administration's evocation of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act does not give the president the right to set \"unlimited\" tariffs. The Trump administration argued that the court order may harm their progress in negotiations.",
      "Schiff has been a critic and target of Trump since his days in the House. Former President Joe Biden, during his last hours in office, issued a preemptive pardon for Schiff in connection with his work on the House's Jan. 6 select committee. Schiff has called that pardon \u201cunnecessary\u201d and \u201cunwise.\u201d",

      "Senators are escalating calls for a severe Russia sanctions bill to advance, with Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham claiming -- after talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy -- that the chamber will move ahead with legislation this week that would impose strict tariffs on Moscow.",
      "Graham took a trip to Kyiv over the weekend with Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal, who cosponsored the Senate sanctions measure that would slap 500% tariffs on any country that buys Moscow's energy products.",
      "\"I would expect next week that the Senate will start moving the sanctions bill,\" Graham said during a press conference in Ukraine on Friday. \"There are House members that are ready to move in the House and you will see congressional action.\"",
      "President Donald Trump has yet to endorse the sanctions bill. ABC News' Chief Global Affairs Correspondent Martha Raddatz asked Zelenskyy if he were satisfied with the administration's involvement in the conflict, and the Ukrainian leader called on Trump's support for the sanctions and a ceasefire.",
      "\"We are looking for very for strong steps on the part of President Trump to support the sanctions and to force President Putin to stop this war, or at least proceed with the first stage of putting an end to this war -- that is the ceasefire,\" Zelenskyy said.",
      "Graham and Blumenthal's visit came just before Ukrainian officials on Sunday claimed that their country's drones struck and damaged more than 40 warplanes in attacks on four military airports inside Russia.",
      "Graham, a Putin critic, applauded Ukraine's drone warfare tactics and urged action against Russia in a post on X following the reports.",
      "\"Russia indiscriminately kills men, women and children. It's time for the world to act decisively against Russia's aggression by holding China and others accountable for buying cheap Russian oil that props up Putin's war machine,\" Graham wrote.",
      "Blumenthal also responded on X, urging a crackdown on Russia through the sanctions.",
      "\"When I visited President Zelenskyy & his team only a few days ago with @LindseyGrahamSC these extraordinary qualities of courage & capability were clearly evident. Russians have spread misinformation that they're winning. Time to pass our sanctions bill.\"",
      "Graham wrote a letter last week in the Wall Street Journal, saying the Senate was \"prepared\" to place proposed sanctions on Russia depending on how the country responded to Trump's recent request for Putin to \"provide a term sheet outlining the requirements\" for a ceasefire.",
      "\"Depending on how Russia responds, we will know which course to take,\" Graham wrote in the letter.",
      "Graham said he has coordinated with the White House on the Russia sanctions bill -- the \"Sanctioning Russia Act of 2025\" -- which has around 80 co-sponsors and bipartisan support.",
      "\"The bill would put Russia on a trade island,\" Graham said. \"The consequences of its barbaric invasion must be made real to those that prop it up. If China or India stopped buying cheap oil, Mr. Putin's war machine would grind to a halt.\"",
      "Graham also highlighted recent comments from Majority Leader John Thune that also suggest the upper chamber would act against Russia if \"Putin continues to play games.\"",
      "\"As Thune said last week, if Mr. Putin continues to play games, the Senate will act. I'm hoping for the best, but when it comes to the thug in Moscow, we should all prepare for more of the same,\" Graham wrote.",
      "Thune, speaking to reporters at the Capitol on Monday, said that there's a \"high level\" of interest in the bill, and that the Senate might be able to work on it before the end of the month.",
      "\"We are in conversations with the White House, obviously, about that subject and that issue \u2026 there's a high level of interest here in the Senate, on both sides of the aisle and moving on it, and it's very well could be something that we would take up in this work period,\" Thune said. \"Obviously we're working with the White House to try and ensure that what we do and when we do it works well with the negotiations that they've got underway.\"",
      "Other Republican senators, too, are going on offense when it comes to sanctions on Moscow.",
      "Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley called for sanctions in a post on X last week -- advocating that they are strong enough so Putin knows it \"game over.\"",

      "\"Russia faces a stark choice: peace or crippling sanctions. President Trump has spoken forcefully of swift, severe consequences if Russia fails to honor a ceasefire. A bipartisan group of senators agrees,\" Barasso said.",
      "\"Energy is the cash cow of Putin's war machine. Cut it off, and Russia cannot continue to fight. Russia's biggest customer is Communist China. The next is India. They will be hit hard,\" Barasso continued.",

      "\"Russia continues to kill innocent civilians in Ukraine and so here we are -- and we have to sanction them and hold Russia accountable,\" Fetterman said.",
      "McCormick said he'd back the sanctions package because it continues to pressure Putin to engage in negotiations about ending the conflict.",
      "\"The only way to keep the pressure on is for things to happen like what happened today with Ukraine having a very successful military capability and operation, but in addition to that, the kinds of sanctions that are proposed in this legislation, and that is meant to help President Trump deliver on the vision and the deal he's talked about,\" McCormick said.",

      "The Department of Homeland Security reposted Elo-Rivera's message, saying that likening ICE to terrorists was \u201csickening.\u201d The councilman stuck by his comments on Monday.",
      "Other elected officials, such as Gloria and U.S. Rep. Scott Peters of San Diego, both Democrats, were more muted but also sharply critical of ICE and the Republican White House.",
      "\u201cFederal actions like these are billed as a public safety measure, but it had the complete opposite effect. What we saw undermines trust and creates fear in our community,\u201d Gloria said.",
      "ICE said Monday that the operation at Buona Forchetta, an anchor of San Diego's trendy South Park neighborhood, resulted in four arrests of people in the U.S. illegally. Authorities executed criminal search warrants for illegal hiring and making false statements when the crowd \u201cbecame unruly,\u201d prompting them to use flash-bang devices.",
      "\u201cWhen gatherings like these are formed, it not only places law enforcement in danger but also the demonstrators/onlookers attempting to impede law enforcement activity,\u201d ICE said in a statement.",
      "The owners said they were closing their restaurants in Southern California for two days.",
      "\u201cWe wish we could find stronger words, but the truth is we are heartbroken,\u201d the owners said in a statement. \u201cThe traumatic incident involving a federal enforcement operation at our original and beloved South Park location has left a mark on all of us. A wound that is still raw, still echoing in our kitchens, our dining rooms, and our hearts.\u201d",
      "Lyons said in an interview on Fox & Friends Sunday that ICE was averaging about 1,600 arrests a day, a sharp increase from previous data that showed 78,155 arrests between Jan. 20 and May 19 \u2014 a daily average of 656. He said ICE can and will do more.",
      "Stephen Miller, the key architect of Trump's immigration policy, last week set a goal of 3,000 arrests a day and said the number could go higher. That pace would be a huge challenge with current funding. ICE housed an average of more than 46,000 detainees during the first half of May, already above its budgeted capacity.",
      "Lyons said operations like the surge in Massachusetts wouldn\u2019t be necessary if \u201csanctuary cities would change their policy.\u201d There\u2019s no legal definition for sanctuary city policies, but they generally limit cooperation by local law enforcement with federal immigration officers. Homeland Security published a list of more than 500 sanctuary jurisdictions but removed it from its website after criticism that it contained inaccuracies, even from its allies.",

      "Three women are suing Baltimore\u2019s public school system, alleging they were sexually abused by a special education teacher decades ago",
      "BALTIMORE -- Three women are suing Baltimore\u2019s public school system, alleging they were sexually abused by a special education teacher decades ago while administrators failed to protect students from his predatory behavior.",
      "One of the plaintiffs was 14 when she alleges the teacher, whom the lawsuit names as Alvin Hunt, raped and impregnated her, according to the complaint.",
      "At a news conference Monday morning, attorneys for the women said school officials knew about the abuse and allowed it to continue. They said Hunt would lure students to his house under the pretense of after-school tutoring. The allegations contained in the lawsuits occurred in the late 1970s and early 1980s.",
      "Attempts to reach Hunt were unsuccessful. A message seeking comment was left for a spokesperson for Baltimore City Public Schools.",
      "The lawsuits add to a growing pile of child sexual abuse claims filed in Maryland since the state eliminated its statute of limitations for such cases. Lawmakers approved the Child Victims Act in 2023 with abuse findings against the Catholic Church in mind, but its impacts have extended well beyond religious institutions. The state\u2019s juvenile justice system in particular is facing widespread reckoning after thousands of victims came forward.",
      "Pamela Coleman said she gave birth to Hunt\u2019s daughter after he drugged and raped her. Hunt offered the teen a ride home from school and gave her a cigarette laced with an illicit substance that caused her to lose consciousness, her complaint says.",
      "\u201cMy childhood and teen years was just ripped from me,\u201d Coleman said at the news conference. She said her mother reported the abuse and administrators transferred her to another school after learning she was pregnant.",
      "The AP doesn\u2019t typically identify victims of abuse unless they want to be named.",
      "Attorneys said Hunt, who was also a sports coach, never faced prosecution or accountability for his actions. Instead, he retired from the school system after a long career. He is not named as a defendant in the lawsuits, which were filed against the Baltimore City Board of School Commissioners.",
      "\u201cThis abuse was not just known, it was normalized,\u201d said attorney Janai Woodhouse with the Baltimore law firm Murphy, Falcon & Murphy. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t hidden. It was tolerated.\u201d",
      "She said the Child Victims Act allows abuse survivors the time they need to come forward, often decades later. Before its passage, victims couldn\u2019t sue after they turned 38.",
      "The three plaintiffs were young and vulnerable when they were abused by someone they trusted, their attorneys said.",
      "\u201cYou can imagine the amount of psychological trauma that was inflicted here. So it took some time,\u201d Woodhouse said. \u201cBut they gathered the courage to come to us and they\u2019re ready to seek justice now.\u201d",
      "According to the lawsuit filed on behalf of Collette Lee, she went to Hunt\u2019s house for tutoring with another special education student. He cornered her and tried to assault her, but she says she managed to escape.",
      "\u201cI was able to run,\u201d she said during the news conference. \u201cI\u2019ve been running for a long time. I\u2019m tired. I want justice.\u201d",
      "The lawsuits were filed Friday in state court. The plaintiffs are seeking punitive damages.",

      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- The U.S. Department of Energy has ordered another power plant, this time an oil and gas plant in Pennsylvania, to keep its turbines running through the hottest summer months as a precaution against electricity shortfalls in the 13-state mid-Atlantic grid.",
      "The department's order to the grid operator, PJM Interconnection, regarding the Eddystone power plant just south of Philadelphia on the Delaware River, is the department's second use of federal power under President Donald Trump to require a power plant to keep operating on the mainland United States.",
      "Constellation Energy had planned to shut down Eddystone's units 3 and 4 on Saturday, but Trump's Department of Energy ordered the company to continue operating the units until at least Aug. 28. The units can produce a combined 760 megawatts.",
      "The department, in its order, cited PJM's growing concerns about power shortfalls amid the shutdown of aging power plants and rising electricity demand.",
      "PJM last year approved Constellation's request to shut down the units, but it welcomed the department's order to keep them operating, saying it's a \u201cprudent, term-limited step\u201d that allows PJM, the department and Constellation to study the longer-term need and viability of Eddystone's units.",
      "The department took a similar step last week, ordering Consumers Energy to keep the J.H. Campbell coal-fired power plant open in Michigan past its Saturday retirement.",
      "The grid operator there, the Midcontinent Independent System Operator, said the order was unnecessary, that there was no energy emergency there and that there should be enough energy in the region through the summer.",
      "An environmental advocacy group, the Delaware Riverkeeper Network, criticized the move to keep Eddystone operating as an \"environmental injustice.\" Shutting down the units would reduce hazardous pollution and carbon emissions from the decades-old facility and help the region meet federal clean air standards for smog, it said.",

      "WASHINGTON -- A split Supreme Court on Monday rejected a pair of gun rights cases, though one conservative justice predicted the court would soon consider whether assault weapons bans are constitutional.",
      "The majority did not explain its reasoning in turning down the cases over high-capacity magazines and state bans on guns like the AR-15, popular weapons that have also been used in mass shootings.",
      "But three conservative justices on the nine-member court publicly noted their disagreement, and a fourth said he is skeptical that assault-weapons bans are constitutional.",
      "Justices Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch said they would have taken a case challenging Maryland's ban, and Justice Clarence Thomas wrote separately to say the law likely runs afoul of the Second Amendment.",
      "\u201cI would not wait to decide whether the government can ban the most popular rifle in America,\u201d Thomas wrote. \u201cThat question is of critical importance to tens of millions of law-abiding AR\u201315 owners throughout the country.\u201d",
      "Justice Brett Kavanaugh agreed with the decision to pass on the case now but indicated that he is skeptical such bans are constitutional and that he expects the court will address the issue \u201cin the next term or two.\u201d",
      "The Maryland law was passed after the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut that killed 20 children and six adults. The shooter was armed with an AR-15, one of the firearms commonly referred to as an assault weapon.",
      "Several states have similar measures, and congressional Democrats have also supported the concept. The challengers had argued that people have a constitutional right to own the firearms like the AR-15, which most gun owners use legally.",
      "The case comes nearly three years after the high court handed down a landmark ruling that expanded Second Amendment rights and spawned challenges to firearm laws around the country.",
      "Ten states and the District of Columbia have similar laws, covering major cities like New York and Los Angeles. Congress allowed a national assault weapons ban to expire in 2004.",
      "The gun control group Everytown Law applauded the high court's action, saying the measures make communities safer. \u201cWe will fight to ensure the courts continue to uphold these life-saving laws,\u201d said Janet Carter, managing director of Second Amendment litigation.",
      "More than twice as many people died in mass shootings in which large-capacity magazines and assault weapons were used between 2015 and 2022, the group said.",
      "Attorneys for Maryland argued the guns aren\u2019t protected by the Constitution because they\u2019re similar to military-grade weapons. The law bans dozens of firearms \u2014 including the AR-15, the AK-47 and the Barrett .50-caliber sniper rifle \u2014 and puts a 10-round limit on gun magazines.",
      "The gun rights group Second Amendment Foundation said it has seven other cases challenging the bans and plans to continue to \u201caggressively litigate\u201d them. \u201cMillions of Americans continue to be disenfranchised from exercising their complete Second Amendment rights by virtue of these categorical bans,\u201d Executive Director Adam Kraut said.",
      "The high court also rebuffed a bid to overturn state bans on high-capacity gun magazines in a case out of Rhode Island. Thomas, Alito and Gorsuch said they would have heard the case. More than a dozen states have similar laws limiting the amount of ammunition a magazine can hold.",
      "Thomas and Kavanaugh have previously expressed skepticism about assault weapon bans.",
      "As an appeals court judge in 2011, Kavanaugh wrote a dissent saying that a similar measure in Washington, D.C., was unconstitutional. Thomas, meanwhile, dissented in 2015 when the Supreme Court declined to hear a challenge to a municipal ban on AR-15-style weapons, writing that the \u201coverwhelming majority\u201d of people who owned the weapons used them for lawful purposes like self-defense.",
      "The high court in 2022 handed down a ruling that expanded gun rights and told lower-court judges they should no longer consider factors like public safety in deciding whether firearm laws are constitutional. Instead, they should focus on whether a law fits into the nation\u2019s historic tradition of gun ownership, the court said.",
      "That led to a flurry of challenges to gun laws around the country, multiple restrictions struck down, and confusion among lower-court judges over what gun laws can stay on the books.",
      "Since then, the Supreme Court has overturned a ban on rapid-fire gun accessories called bump stocks but upheld a law barring people under domestic-violence restraining orders from having guns and regulations on nearly untraceable ghost guns.",

      "Among the administration's victories was an order allowing it to enforce the Republican president's ban of on transgender military service members. Among its losses was a prohibition on using an 18th century wartime law called the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelans alleged to be gang members to a notorious prison in El Salvador.",
      "The most recent emergency filing arrived May 27.",
      "The Trump administration's latest appeal asks the high court to halt an order by U.S. District Judge Brian Murphy in Boston.

      "Murphy has stalled efforts to carry out deportations of migrants who can\u2019t be returned to their home countries, Sauer wrote. Finding countries willing to take them is \u201ca delicate diplomatic endeavor\u201d and the court requirements are a major setback, he said.",

      "U.S. District Judge Christopher Cooper had found that its role is likely more than just advisory, especially in helping to shutter the U.S. Agency for International Development and cut billions of dollars in government contracts.",
      "The administration appealed Cooper's orders requiring documents be turned over and acting Administrator Amy Gleason to answer questions under oath.",
      "Last week, Chief Justice John Roberts agreed to temporarily pause the orders pending additional word from the Supreme Court.",
      "Social Security has personal data on nearly everyone in the country, including school records, bank details, salary information and medical and mental health records for disability recipients, according to court documents.",
      "The Trump administration says DOGE needs access to Social Security's systems as part of its mission to target waste in the federal government.",
      "But U.S. District Judge Ellen Hollander in Maryland restricted the team\u2019s access to Social Security under federal privacy laws, saying DOGE's efforts at the agency amounted to a \u201cfishing expedition\u201d based on \u201clittle more than suspicion\u201d of fraud.",
      "The judge is disrupting DOGE's work and interfering with decisions that belong to the executive branch, not courts, Sauer wrote in asking the high court to block Hollander's order in the suit filed by labor unions and retirees.",

      "Eight people calling for the release of Israeli hostages in Gaza were injured at an outdoor mall in Boulder, Colorado, by a man who used a makeshift flamethrower and hurled an incendiary device into the crowd",
      "BOULDER, Colo. -- Eight people calling for the release of Israeli hostages in Gaza were injured at an outdoor mall in Boulder, Colorado, by a man who police say used a makeshift flamethrower and hurled an incendiary device into a crowd. The FBI immediately described the violence as a \u201ctargeted terror attack.\u201d",
      "The suspect, identified by the FBI as 45-year-old Mohamed Sabry Soliman, yelled \u201cFree Palestine\u201d during the Sunday attack on the group of demonstrators, said Mark Michalek, the special agent in charge of the FBI\u2019s Denver field office.",
      "Soliman was arrested and taken to the hospital for treatment, but authorities didn\u2019t elaborate on his injuries.",
      "Here is what we know about the attack:",
      "Authorities said the attacker targeted demonstrators with a volunteer group called Run for Their Lives, which organizes run and walk events to call for the immediate release of the Israeli hostages who remain in Gaza since they were captured by militants during the incursion into southern Israel that started the Israel-Hamas war in 2023.",
      "The group had gathered at the Pearl Street pedestrian mall, a four-block area in downtown Boulder frequented by tourists and students.",
      "The Israel-Hamas war has inflamed global tensions and contributed to a spike in antisemitic violence in the United States. A week earlier, two Israeli Embassy staffers were shot to death in Washington by a man who yelled \u201cI did it for Palestine, I did it for Gaza\u201d as he was being led away by police.",
      "Police in Boulder evacuated multiple blocks of the pedestrian mall. The scene shortly after the attack was tense, as law enforcement agents with a police dog walked through the streets looking for threats and instructed the public to stay clear.",
      "The violence occurred four years after 10 people were killed a shooting rampage at a grocery store in Boulder, about 25 miles (40 kilometers) northwest of Denver. The gunman was sentenced to life in prison for murder after a jury rejected his attempt to avoid prison time by pleading not guilty by reason of insanity.",
      "The people injured in the Pearl Street attack range in age from 52 to 88.",
      "Photos from the scene showed a woman lying on the ground in the fetal position with her hair soaked, and a man helping her and getting water from someone with a water jug.",
      "The injuries authorities found were consistent with reports of people being set on fire, Boulder Police Chief Steve Redfearn said, adding that injuries ranged from serious to minor.",
      "Redfearn told reporters Sunday evening that it was too early to discuss a motive but that witnesses were being interviewed.",
      "\u201cIt would be irresponsible for me to speculate on motive this early on,\u201d he said.",
      "Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, was arrested at the scene. No charges were immediately announced, but officials said they expect to hold him \u201cfully accountable.\u201d",
      "Video from the scene showed him shirtless and wearing jeans and holding two clear bottles with a transparent liquid in them while shouting at onlookers.",
      "Another video shows a witness shouting, \u201cHe\u2019s right there. He\u2019s throwing Molotov cocktails,\u201d as a police officer with his gun drawn advanced on the suspect.",
      "FBI leaders in Washington said they were treating the Boulder attack as an act of terrorism, and the Justice Department \u2014 which leads investigations into acts of violence driven by religious, racial or ethnic motivations \u2014 decried the attack as a \u201cneedless act of violence, which follows recent attacks against Jewish Americans.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis act of terror is being investigated as an act of ideologically motivated violence based on the early information, the evidence, and witness accounts. We will speak clearly on these incidents when the facts warrant it,\u201d FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino said in a post on X.",

      "An attorney for Harvey Weinstein says he doesn't plan to testify in his New York sex crimes retrial",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Harvey Weinstein doesn't plan to testify at his New York sex crimes retrial, his lawyer said Sunday. That means jurors soon will get the case against the former movie studio boss who propelled the #MeToo movement against sexual misconduct.",
      "The trial will move on to closing arguments Tuesday without testimony from Weinstein, Arthur Aidala said Sunday night. The court handles other cases on Mondays.",
      "It's unclear whether jury deliberations would begin Tuesday afternoon or Wednesday.",
      "It was a fraught decision for Weinstein, who didn\u2019t testify at previous trials in New York and California and was convicted in both. He denies the allegations, and Aidala has said that Weinstein was carefully weighing whether to take the stand this time.",
      "While his California appeal winds on, Weinstein won a new trial in his New York rape and sexual assault case when the state\u2019s highest court overturned his 2020 conviction.",
      "He's charged in New York with raping Jessica Mann in 2013 and forcing oral sex on Miriam Haley and Kaja Sokola, separately, in 2006. Mann was an actor and hairstylist, Haley a production assistant and producer, and Sokola a model who aspired to an acting career.",
      "All three women testified for days at the retrial, giving emotional and graphic accounts of what they say they endured. They said Weinstein suggested he'd help them achieve their show-business dreams, but then maneuvered them into private settings and preyed on them.",
      "His attorneys have argued that anything that happened between him and his accusers was consensual.",
      "In the U.S., defendants in criminal cases aren't obligated to testify, and many decide not to, for various reasons. Among them: the prospect of being questioned by prosecutors.",
      "Weinstein has been watching the New York retrial intently from the defense table, sometimes shaking his head at accusers\u2019 testimony and often leaning over to one or another of his attorneys to convey his thoughts.",
      "Aidala said outside court Thursday that Weinstein thought a lot of holes had been poked in the accusers' accounts, but that he also was pondering whether jurors would feel they needed to hear from him.",
      "The jury has heard from a few other defense witnesses \u2014 one of them via a transcript read by court employees.",
      "That witness, Talita Maia, testified at the 2020 trial but was unavailable this time, so jurors instead got a reading Friday of her earlier testimony. One court stenographer voiced the 2020 attorneys' questions, while another stenographer sat in the witness box and rendered Maia's answers, at times with emphasis.",
      "Maia and Mann were roommates and friends in 2013 but later fell out. According to Maia, Mann never mentioned in those days that Weinstein had hurt her in any way. Both Maia and another witness, Thomas Richards, met up with Mann and Weinstein shortly after Mann has said she was raped.",
      "Both witnesses testified that they saw nothing amiss.",
      "Mann testified earlier this month that she never anyone at the time that Weinstein had sexually assaulted her because she didn't think she'd be believed, and she was scared about how he might react.",
      "Weinstein's defense also brought in former Sokola pal Helga Samuelsen, who has friendly ties to the former producer. Samuelsen testified Thursday that Weinstein visited Sokola once and spent about a half-hour in a bedroom with her in a New York apartment the women briefly shared in 2005; Sokola told jurors no such thing happened.",
      "The Associated Press generally does not name people who say they have been sexually assaulted, but Sokola, Mann and Haley have given their permission to be identified.",

      "A list of more than 500 \u201csanctuary jurisdictions\u201d no longer appears in the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s website after receiving criticism for including localities that have actively supported the Trump administration\u2019s hard-line immigration policies",
      "WASHINGTON -- A widely anticipated list of \u201c sanctuary jurisdictions\u201d no longer appears on the Department of Homeland Security's website after receiving widespread criticism for including localities that have actively supported the Trump administration's hard-line immigration policies.",
      "The department last week published the list of the jurisdictions. It said each one would receive formal notification the government deemed them uncooperative with federal immigration enforcement and whether they\u2019re believed to be in violation of any federal criminal statutes.",
      "The list was published Thursday on the department\u2019s website but on Sunday there was a \u201cPage Not Found\" error message in its place.",
      "The list was part of the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to target communities, states and jurisdictions that it says aren\u2019t doing enough to help its immigration enforcement agenda and the promises the president made to deport more than 11 million people living in the U.S. without legal authorization.",
      "The list is being constantly reviewed and can be changed at any time and will be updated regularly, a DHS senior official said.",
      "\u201cDesignation of a sanctuary jurisdiction is based on the evaluation of numerous factors, including self-identification as a Sanctuary Jurisdiction, noncompliance with Federal law enforcement in enforcing immigration laws, restrictions on information sharing, and legal protections for illegal aliens,\u201d the official said in a statement.",
      "Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said on Fox News\u2019 \u201cSunday Morning Futures\u201d that there had been anger from some officials about the list. However, she didn\u2019t address why it was removed.",
      "\u201cSome of the cities have pushed back,\u201d Noem said. \u201cThey think because they don\u2019t have one law or another on the books that they don\u2019t qualify, but they do qualify. They are giving sanctuary to criminals.\u201d",
      "The list, which was riddled with misspellings, received pushback from officials in communities spanning from urban to rural and blue to red who said the list doesn\u2019t appear to make sense.",
      "In California, the city of Huntington Beach made the list even though it had filed a lawsuit challenging the state\u2019s immigration sanctuary law and passed a resolution this year declaring the community a \u201cnon-sanctuary city.\u201d",
      "Jim Davel, administrator for Shawano County, Wisconsin, said the inclusion of his community must have been a clerical error. Davel voted for Trump as did 67% of Shawano County.",
      "Davel thinks the administration may have confused the county\u2019s vote in 2021 to become a \u201cSecond Amendment Sanctuary County\u201d that prohibits gun control measures with it being a safe haven for immigrants. He said the county has approved no immigration sanctuary policies.",

      "Tulsa\u2019s new mayor on Sunday proposed a $100 million private trust as part of a reparations plan to give descendants of the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre scholarships and housing help",
      "TULSA, Okla. -- Tulsa's new mayor on Sunday proposed a $100 million private trust as part of a reparations plan to give descendants of the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre scholarships and housing help in a city-backed bid to make amends for one of the worst racial attacks in U.S. history.",
      "The plan by Mayor Monroe Nichols, the first Black mayor of Oklahoma's second-largest city, would not provide direct cash payments to descendants or the last two centenarian survivors of the attack that killed as many as 300 Black people. He made the announcement at the Greenwood Cultural Center, located in the once-thriving district of North Tulsa that was destroyed by a white mob.",
      "Nichols said he does not use the term reparations, which he calls politically charged, characterizing his sweeping plan instead as a \u201croad to repair.\u201d",
      "\u201cFor 104 years, the Tulsa Race Massacre has been a stain on our city's history,\u201d Nichols said Sunday after receiving a standing ovation from several hundred people. \u201cThe massacre was hidden from history books, only to be followed by the intentional acts of redlining, a highway built to choke off economic vitality and the perpetual underinvestment of local, state and federal governments.",
      "\u201cNow it's time to take the next big steps to restore.\u201d",
      "Nichols said the proposal wouldn't require city council approval, although the council would need to authorize the transfer of any city property to the trust, something he said was highly likely.",
      "The private charitable trust would be created with a goal to secure $105 million in assets, with most of the funding either secured or committed by June 1, 2026. Although details would be developed over the next year by an executive director and a board of managers, the plan calls for the bulk of the funding, $60 million, to go toward improving buildings and revitalizing the city's north side.",
      "\u201cThe Greenwood District at its height was a center of commerce,\u201d Nichols said in a telephone interview. \u201cSo what was lost was not just something from North Tulsa or the Black community. It actually robbed Tulsa of an economic future that would have rivaled anywhere else in the world.\"",
      "Nichols' proposal follows an executive order he signed earlier this year recognizing June 1 as Tulsa Race Massacre Observance Day, an official city holiday. Events Sunday in the Greenwood District included a picnic for families, worship services and an evening candlelight vigil.",
      "Nichols also realizes the current national political climate, particularly President Trump's sweeping assault on diversity, equity and inclusion programs, poses challenging political crosswinds.",
      "\u201cThe fact that this lines up with a broader national conversation is a tough environment,\u201d Nichols admitted, \u201cbut it doesn't change the work we have to do.\u201d",
      "Jacqueline Weary, is a granddaughter of massacre survivor John R. Emerson, Sr., who owned a hotel and cab company in Greenwood that were destroyed. She acknowledged the political difficulty of giving cash payments to descendants. But at the same time, she wondered how much of her family's wealth was lost in the violence.",
      "\u201cIf Greenwood was still there, my grandfather would still have his hotel,\u201d said Weary, 65. \u201cIt rightfully was our inheritance, and it was literally taken away.\u201d",
      "Tulsa is not the first U.S. city to explore reparations. The Chicago suburb of Evanston, Illinois, was the first U.S. city to make reparations available to its Black residents for past discrimination, offering qualifying households $25,000 for home repairs, down payments on property, and interest or late penalties on property in the city. The funding for the program came from taxes on the sale of recreational marijuana.",
      "Other communities and organizations that have considered providing reparations range from the state of California to cities including Amherst, Massachusetts; Providence, Rhode Island; Asheville, North Carolina; and Iowa City, Iowa; religious denominations like the Episcopal Church; and prominent colleges like Georgetown University in Washington.",
      "In Tulsa, there are only two living survivors of the Race Massacre, both of whom are 110 years old: Leslie Benningfield Randle and Viola Fletcher. The women, both of whom were in attendance on Sunday, received direct financial compensation from both a Tulsa-based nonprofit and a New York-based philanthropic organization, but have not received any recompense from the city or state.",
      "Damario Solomon-Simmons, an attorney for the survivors and the founder of the Justice for Greenwood Foundation, said earlier this year that any reparations plan should include direct payments to Randle and Fletcher and a victims' compensation fund for outstanding claims.",
      "A lawsuit filed by Solomon-Simmons on behalf of the survivors was rejected by the Oklahoma Supreme Court last year, dampening racial justice advocates' hopes that the city would ever make financial amends.",

    "story": [
      "Two U.S. senators are warning that Russian President Vladimir Putin is stalling on peace while preparing a fresh military offensive against Ukraine",
      "PARIS -- Russian President Vladimir Putin is stalling at the peace table while preparing a new military offensive in Ukraine, two senior U.S. senators warned Sunday, arguing that the next two weeks could shape the future of a war that has already smashed cities, displaced millions and redrawn Europe\u2019s security map.",
      "Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham and Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal spoke to The Associated Press in Paris after meeting President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and touring neighborhoods shattered by what they called the worst Russian bombardments since the full-scale invasion began.",
      "In Paris for talks with French President Emmanuel Macron \u2014 who they say is \u201c100% aligned\u201d with them on the war \u2014 the senators warned the window to prevent a renewed assault is closing.",
      "A sweeping U.S. sanctions bill could be the West\u2019s last chance to choke off the Kremlin\u2019s war economy, they said \u2014 adding that they hope their firsthand findings will shift momentum in Washington and help bring a skeptical President Donald Trump on board.",
      "\"What I learned on this trip was he\u2019s preparing for more war,\u201d Graham said of Putin. Blumenthal called the sanctions proposed in legislation \u201cbone-crushing\u201d and said it would place Russia\u2019s economy \u201con a trade island.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt is crunch time for Putin and for the world because Russia is mounting a new offensive,\u201d he said.",
      "At the heart of their push is a bipartisan sanctions bill, backed by nearly the entire U.S. Senate but still facing uncertain odds in Washington. It would impose 500% tariffs on countries that continue buying Russian oil, gas, uranium and other exports \u2014 targeting nations like China and India that account for roughly 70% of Russia\u2019s energy trade and bankroll much of its war effort.",
      "Graham called it \u201cthe most draconian bill I\u2019ve ever seen in my life in the Senate.\"",
      "\u201cThe world has a lot of cards to play against Putin,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to hit China and India for propping up his war machine.\u201d",
      "With peace talks yielding little and Trump's approach to Ukraine highly uncertain, Graham and Blumenthal have stepped into the breach \u2014 blunt emissaries on a lonely mission. Political opposites moving in lockstep, they\u2019re crossing Europe, and the aisle, with the moral urgency of two men trying to forestall another Russian offensive before it\u2019s too late.",
      "Peace talks are scheduled to resume Monday in Istanbul. But Ukrainian officials say Moscow has yet to submit a serious proposal \u2014 a delay both senators described as deliberate and dangerous.",
      "\u201cPutin is playing President Trump,\" Blumenthal said. \u201cHe\u2019s taking him for a sucker.\u201d The senator said Putin \"is, in effect, stalling and stonewalling, prolonging the conversation so that he can mount this offensive and take control of more territory on the ground.\u201d",
      "Graham added: \u201cWe saw credible evidence of a summer or early fall invasion, a new offensive by Putin. ... He\u2019s preparing for more war.\u201d",
      "Trump has yet to endorse the sanctions bill, telling reporters Friday: \u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019ll have to see it.\u201d Graham said the legislation was drafted in consultation with Trump\u2019s advisers.",
      "Graham backed the president\u2019s diplomatic instincts but said, \"By trying to engage Putin \u2014 by being friendly and enticing \u2014 it\u2019s become painfully clear he\u2019s not interested in ending this war.\u201d",
      "Blumenthal hoped the bipartisan support for Ukraine at least in the Senate \u2014 and the personal testimonies they plan to bring home to Congress and the Oval Office\u2014 may help shift the conversation.",
      "\u201cHe needs to see and hear that message as well from us, from the American people,\u201d he said of Putin.",
      "In Kyiv, the senators said, the war\u2019s human toll was impossible to ignore. Graham pointed to what Ukrainian officials and Yale researchers estimate are nearly 20,000 children forcibly deported to Russia \u2014 calling their return a matter of justice, not diplomacy.",
      "Blumenthal described standing at mass grave sites in Bucha, where civilians were executed with shots to the head. The destruction, he said, and the stories of those who survived, made clear the stakes of delay. \u201cPutin is a thug. He\u2019s a murderer.\"",
      "Both said that failing to act now could pull the U.S. deeper into conflict later. If Putin isn\u2019t stopped in Ukraine, Blumenthal said, NATO treaty obligations could one day compel American troops into battle.",
      "After a one-hour meeting with Macron in Paris, both Graham, of South Carolina, and Blumenthal, of Connecticut, said they left convinced Europe was ready to toughen its stance.",
      "\u201cThis visit has been a breakthrough moment because President Macron has shown moral clarity in his conversations with us,\u201d Blumenthal said. \u201cToday, he is 100% aligned with that message that we are taking back to Washington.\u201d",
      "Blumenthal pointed to the rare bipartisan unity behind the sanctions bill. \u201cThere are very few causes that will take 41 Republicans and 41 Democrats and put them on record on a single piece of legislation,\u201d he said. \u201cThe cause of Ukraine is doing it.\u201d",
      "Ahead, Ukrainian military leaders are set to brief Congress and a sanctions vote could follow.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump said we\u2019ll know in two weeks whether he\u2019s being strung along,\u201d Graham said. \u201cThere will be more evidence of that from Russia on Monday.\u201d",

      "Authorities said at least 80 shots were fired in the shooting that began at about 12:45 a.m. People reported running, ducking for cover and scrambling to their cars for safety. Hours later Sunday, law enforcement had made no arrests and was seeking tips from the public in the case.",

      "They sing Gregorian chants in Latin, pray and receive Communion at a side chapel \u2014 inside the huge, nondenominational Princeton Chapel \u2014 that young, devoted Catholics see as a sacred refuge in a mostly liberal and secular Ivy League environment.",
      "\u201cI feel that people\u2019s faith is so strong here,\u201d student Logan Nelson said of the dedicated Catholic space where he attends daily Mass. \u201cIt feels like a home \u2014 even more so than my own house.\u201d",
      "The Gothic university chapel was built in 1928. At the time, Princeton says, its capacity to seat more than 2,000 people was second in size only to King\u2019s College Chapel at Cambridge University.",
      "Today, the chapel hosts interfaith services, concerts and weddings throughout the academic year and is known by the university as \u201cthe bridge between town and gown.\u201d",
      "On May 8, Catholic students were worshipping as usual at daily Mass in the side chapel when the service was interrupted by news alerts on their phones. In the Vatican, white smoke billowed from the Sistine Chapel, indicating that a new leader of their faith had been elected.",
      "The Rev. Zachary Swantek, Princeton\u2019s Catholic chaplain, told the group to gather at the Catholic Ministry office. Together, they watched on TV as the election of the first U.S.-born pope was announced.",
      "\u201cIt was electric,\u201d Nelson said, adding there was \u201cuproar\u201d in the room when Chicago-born Cardinal Robert Prevost \u202fbecame the 267th pontiff. \u201cIt was so cool to see an American pope.\u201d",
      "Like other members of the Catholic ministry, he is hopeful that Pope Leo XIV will help bring a revival for Catholicism in America.",
      "\u201cI feel that there\u2019s a resurgence of Catholicism today,\u201d said Nelson, who was religiously unaffiliated until last year when he converted to Catholicism. \u201cYou see people who are passionate about their faith. There\u2019s a new wave coming, and we\u2019re going to have more converts like me, who are coming from the 'nones.\u2019\u201d",
      "Across much of the world, the number of people who are nonbelievers or unaffiliated with any organized religion has dramatically increased over the years. The people known as \u201cnones\u201d \u2014 atheists, agnostics, or nothing in particular \u2014 comprise 30% or more of the adult population in the U.S., according to a survey by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.",
      "Princeton\u2019s Office of Religious Life says it supports members of the school community \u201cof any religious identity or of none.\u201d",
      "Being a devoted Catholic on a mostly secular campus can be challenging; Swantek says he\u2019s never felt \u201cmore needed as a priest.\u201d",
      "He is proud of the tight-knit, welcoming Catholic community that he leads, and how they\u2019ve helped recent converts come into the faith.",
      "News of the first U.S.-born pope was welcomed by Catholics across the ideological spectrum in\u202f Pope Leo XIV \u202f\u2019s homeland.",
      "\u201cSomething that did bring me a lot of hope is Pope Leo has a missionary background,\u201d said Ace Acuna, a Princeton alumni. He recently attended a Mass at the chapel before beginning a nearly five-week Catholic pilgrimage from Indianapolis to Los Angeles.",
      "\u201cIn a world where in some places it might look like faith is on the decline, a church that\u2019s willing to go out to the margins and evangelize and be on mission, that\u2019s going to be so important,\u201d Acuna said.",
      "When he was an undergrad at Princeton, Acuna said the chapel became crucial to his college life.",
      "On his way to class every morning, he\u2019d pass by the chapel for a silent prayer. He\u2019d return for the noon Mass and again at the end of the day for one last prayer.",
      "\u201cPrinceton is a very busy place and there\u2019s a lot of noise both externally but also internally because we\u2019re so busy and we\u2019re always worried about the next thing,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes you just want silence, and you just want a place where you can lay down your burdens.\u201d",
      "At the close of one recent Mass, David Kim and his girlfriend Savannah Nichols continued to pray near the altar, holding hands, kneeling or prostrating on the floor in a sign of reverence.",

      "\u201cIn a way it\u2019s either so secular or even post-secular that it\u2019s not threatened by the Christian presence on campus,\u201d he said. \"Religious students in our campus are not cloistered from campus. They\u2019re also in sports teams, clubs and the newspaper. They\u2019re integrated.\u201d",

      "President Donald Trump faces the challenge of convincing Republican senators, global investors, voters and even Elon Musk that he won\u2019t bury the federal government in debt with his multitrillion-dollar tax breaks package",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump faces the challenge of convincing Republican senators, global investors, voters and even Elon Musk that he won't bury the federal government in debt with his multitrillion-dollar tax breaks package.",
      "The response so far from financial markets has been skeptical as Trump seems unable to trim deficits as promised.",
      "\u201cAll of this rhetoric about cutting trillions of dollars of spending has come to nothing \u2014 and the tax bill codifies that,\u201d said Michael Strain, director of economic policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, a right-leaning think tank. \u201cThere is a level of concern about the competence of Congress and this administration and that makes adding a whole bunch of money to the deficit riskier.\u201d",
      "The White House has viciously lashed out at anyone who has voiced concern about the debt snowballing under Trump, even though it did exactly that in his first term after his 2017 tax cuts.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt opened her briefing Thursday by saying she wanted \u201cto debunk some false claims\" about his tax cuts.",
      "Leavitt said that the \"blatantly wrong claim that the \u2018One, Big, Beautiful Bill\u2019 increases the deficit is based on the Congressional Budget Office and other scorekeepers who use shoddy assumptions and have historically been terrible at forecasting across Democrat and Republican administrations alike.\u201d",
      "But Trump himself has suggested that the lack of sufficient spending cuts to offset his tax reductions came out of the need to hold the Republican congressional coalition together.",
      "\u201cWe have to get a lot of votes,\u201d Trump said last week. \u201cWe can\u2019t be cutting.\u201d",
      "That has left the administration betting on the hope that economic growth can do the trick, a belief that few outside of Trump's orbit think is viable.",
      "Tech billionaire Musk, who was until recently part of Trump's inner sanctum as the leader of the Department of Government Efficiency, told CBS News: \u201cI was disappointed to see the massive spending bill, frankly, which increases the budget deficit, not just decreases it, and undermines the work that the DOGE team is doing.\"",
      "The tax and spending cuts that passed the House last month would add more than $5 trillion to the national debt in the coming decade if all of them are allowed to continue, according to the Committee for a Responsible Financial Budget, a fiscal watchdog group.",
      "To make the bill's price tag appear lower, various parts of the legislation are set to expire. This same tactic was used with Trump's 2017 tax cuts and it set up this year's dilemma, in which many of the tax cuts in that earlier package will sunset next year unless Congress renews them.",
      "But the debt is a much bigger problem now than it was eight years ago. Investors are demanding the government pay a higher premium to keep borrowing as the total debt has crossed $36.1 trillion. The interest rate on a 10-year Treasury Note is around 4.5%, up dramatically from the roughly 2.5% rate being charged when the 2017 tax cuts became law.",
      "The White House Council of Economic Advisers argues that its policies will unleash so much rapid growth that the annual budget deficits will shrink in size relative to the overall economy, putting the U.S. government on a fiscally sustainable path.",
      "The council argues the economy would expand over the next four years at an annual average of about 3.2%, instead of the Congressional Budget Office's expected 1.9%, and as many as 7.4 million jobs would be created or saved.",
      "Council chair Stephen Miran told reporters that when that growth is coupled with expected revenues from tariffs, the expected budget deficits will fall. The tax cuts will increase the supply of money for investment, the supply of workers and the supply of domestically produced goods \u2014 all of which, by Miran\u2019s logic, would cause faster growth without creating new inflationary pressures.",
      "\u201cI do want to assure everyone that the deficit is a very significant concern for this administration,\u201d Miran told reporters recently.",
      "White House budget director Russell Vought told reporters the idea that the bill is \u201cin any way harmful to debt and deficits is fundamentally untrue.\u201d",
      "Most outside economists expect additional debt would keep interest rates higher and slow overall economic growth as the cost of borrowing for homes, cars, businesses and even college educations would increase.",
      "\u201cThis just adds to the problem future policymakers are going to face,\u201d said Brendan Duke, a former Biden administration aide now at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank. Duke said that with the tax cuts in the bill set to expire in 2028, lawmakers would be \u201cdealing with Social Security, Medicare and expiring tax cuts at the same time.\u201d",
      "Kent Smetters, faculty director of the Penn Wharton Budget Model, said the growth projections from Trump's economic team are \u201ca work of fiction.\u201d He said the bill would lead some workers to choose to work fewer hours in order to qualify for Medicaid.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know of any serious forecaster that has meaningfully raised their growth forecast because of this legislation,\u201d said Harvard University professor Jason Furman, who was the Council of Economic Advisers chair under the Obama administration. \u201cThese are mostly not growth- and competitiveness-oriented tax cuts. And, in fact, the higher long-term interest rates will go the other way and hurt growth.\u201d",
      "The White House's inability so far to calm deficit concerns is stirring up political blowback for Trump as the tax and spending cuts approved by the House now move to the Senate. Republican Sens. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Rand Paul of Kentucky have both expressed concerns about the likely deficit increases, with Johnson saying there are enough senators to stall the bill until deficits are addressed.",
      "\u201cI think we have enough to stop the process until the president gets serious about the spending reduction and reducing the deficit,\u201d Johnson said on CNN.",
      "The White House is also banking that tariff revenues will help cover the additional deficits, even though recent court rulings cast doubt on the legitimacy of Trump declaring an economic emergency to impose sweeping taxes on imports.",
      "When Trump announced his near-universal tariffs in April, he specifically said his policies would generate enough new revenues to start paying down the national debt. His comments dovetailed with remarks by aides, including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, that yearly budget deficits could be more than halved.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s our turn to prosper and in so doing, use trillions and trillions of dollars to reduce our taxes and pay down our national debt, and it\u2019ll all happen very quickly,\u201d Trump said two months ago as he talked up his import taxes and encouraged lawmakers to pass the separate tax and spending cuts.",
      "The Trump administration is correct that growth can help reduce deficit pressures, but it's not enough on its own to accomplish the task, according to new research by economists Douglas Elmendorf, Glenn Hubbard and Zachary Liscow.",
      "Ernie Tedeschi, director of economics at the Budget Lab at Yale University, said additional \u201cgrowth doesn't even get us close to where we need to be.\u201d",
      "The government would need $10 trillion of deficit reduction over the next 10 years just to stabilize the debt, Tedeschi said. And even though the White House says the tax cuts would add to growth, most of the cost goes to preserve existing tax breaks, so that's unlikely to boost the economy meaningfully.",
      "\u201cIt's treading water,\u201d Tedeschi said.",

      "The Trump administration is sending three Cabinet members to Alaska this week as it pursues oil drilling in the pristine Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and reinvigorating a natural gas project that\u2019s languished for years",
      "JUNEAU, Alaska -- The Trump administration is sending three Cabinet members to Alaska this week as it pursues oil drilling in the pristine Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and reinvigorating a natural gas project that\u2019s languished for years.",
      "The visit by Department of Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin comes after Trump signed an executive order earlier this year aimed at boosting oil and gas drilling, mining and logging in Alaska. It also comes amid tariff talks with Asian countries that are seen as possible leverage for the administration to secure investments in the proposed Alaska liquefied natural gas project.",
      "Their itinerary includes a meeting Sunday with resource development groups and U.S. Sens. Dan Sullivan and Lisa Murkowski in Anchorage before heading to Utqiagvik, an Arctic town on the petroleum-rich North Slope where many Alaska Native leaders see oil development as economically vital to the region.",
      "The federal officials also plan to visit the Prudhoe Bay oil field Monday \u2014 near the coast of the Arctic Ocean and more than 850 miles (1,368 kilometers) north of Anchorage \u2014 and speak at Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy's annual energy conference Tuesday in Anchorage.",
      "While it's not unusual for U.S. officials to visit Alaska during warmer weather months, Dunleavy's office said the officials' visit is significant. Dunleavy, a Trump ally, said he is thankful for an administration that \u201crecognizes Alaska's unique value.\u201d",
      "Government and industry representatives from a number of Asian countries, including Japan, are expected to participate in a portion of the trip, reflecting pressure from the U.S. to invest in the pipeline \u2014 despite skepticism and opposition from environmental groups.",
      "In Alaska, some environmentalists criticized the agenda for Dunleavy's conference. Highlighting fossil fuels alongside renewable or alternative energy make \u201cenergy sources of the past look more legitimate at a conference like this,\" said Andy Moderow, senior policy director with the Alaska Wilderness League.",
      "\u201cI think we should be looking at climate solutions that work for Alaskans, not trying to open up places that industry is taking a pass on, namely the Arctic refuge,\u201d he said.",
      "Trump has long taken credit for provisions of a 2017 tax law championed by Alaska's congressional delegation that called for two oil and gas lease sales in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge's coastal plain by late 2024. The first one remains the subject of ongoing litigation, with the main bidder a state corporation that saw its seven leases later canceled by then-President Joe Biden's administration. A judge in March ruled Biden's administration overstepped, and the Interior Department, in line with Trump's executive order, is working to reinstate the leases.",
      "There weren't any bids in the second sale, held under Biden and blasted by the state as overly restrictive.",
      "Debate over drilling in the refuge \u2014 home to polar bears, musk ox, birds and other wildlife \u2014 has long been a flashpoint. Indigenous Gwich\u2019in leaders consider the coastal plain sacred land, noting its importance to a caribou herd they rely upon.",
      "Many North Slope I\u00f1upiat leaders who support drilling in the refuge felt their voices were not heard during the Biden era. During the Trump officials' visit, they also hope to make a case for additional development in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska, which Trump has advocated, and for being included in planning decisions.",
      "Nagruk Harcharek, president of Voice of the Arctic I\u00f1upiat, an advocacy group whose members include leaders from the region, called the officials' visit \u201ca step in the right direction.\u201d",
      "For years, the state has sought to develop its stores of North Slope natural gas as a way to provide affordable energy to more residents and bolster revenues via exports. But cost concerns, shifts in direction, competition from other projects and questions about economic feasibility have stymied progress. Oil companies have long reinjected gas that occurs with oil deposits on the slope to produce more oil, which remains Alaska's economic lifeblood.",
      "The latest gas proposal calls for a roughly 810-mile (1,300-kilometer) pipeline that would carry gas from the North Slope to port and a facility that would process and export liquefied natural gas to Asian countries. In a March speech to Congress, Trump touted his ongoing support of the \u201cgigantic natural gas pipeline.\" He said countries like Japan and South Korea \u201cwant to be our partner, with investments of trillions of dollars each.\u201d No firm commitments from countries have been made.",
      "The company advancing the project \u2014 in partnership with a state corporation \u2014 is in a stage of refining cost estimates, previously pegged at around $44 billion for the pipeline and related infrastructure, before final decisions are made on whether to move forward with the project.",
      "While Dunleavy has likened Trump\u2019s friendly approach to energy development as \u201cChristmas every day,\u201d Alaska's fortunes remain tightly linked to the volatility of oil prices, which are down sharply from a year ago, squeezing state revenues.",
      "State lawmakers across party lines overwhelmingly passed a resolution urging Congress to provide Alaska with 90% of royalty revenues for oil and gas leases in the Arctic refuge, arguing the U.S. government reneged on past promises for such a share. The resolution also asked for that to be extended to the petroleum reserve.",
      "Alaska\u2019s tax structure allows companies like ConocoPhillips Alaska \u2014 which is pursuing a massive oil project known as Willow in the reserve \u2014 to write off a portion of their development costs against production taxes they incur elsewhere on the North Slope. While lawmakers widely support Willow, they also have argued a change in federal royalty share would address a hit to state revenues created by production in the reserve.",

    "story": [
      "Pride Month, a global celebration of LGBTQ+ people, is starting this weekend in many places",
      "Pride Month kicks off with events around the world starting this weekend.",
      "It's an annual series of parades and other gatherings to celebrate LGBTQ+ culture and rights.",
      "At its heart, Pride is both a party and a protest.",
      "In the U.S. this year, that means speaking out against a slew of policies that impose restrictions on transgender people and that try to end diversity, equity and inclusion programming in government, education and businesses.",
      "Here's a look at the event's roots and this year's events and themes.",
      "The monthlong global celebration began with Gay Pride Week in late June 1970, a year after the violent police raid at New York\u2019s Stonewall Inn, a gay bar.",
      "At a time when many LGBTQ+ people kept their identities private, the June 28, 1969, raid sparked a series of public protests and catalyzed the gay rights movement.",
      "The first pride week featured marches in Chicago, Los Angeles, New York and San Francisco, and it has since grown to other cities. On the calendar are events in Philadelphia this weekend; New Orleans on June 14; Chicago on June 21 and 22; and New York over the weekend of June 28 and 29. Many other events in big cities and small towns are also planned.",
      "There are pride celebrations around the world, including in Tokyo on June 8; Toronto on June 27-29; Sao Paolo on June 22; and Paris on June 28.",
      "Some events fall outside of June, too. World Pride, a biannual event held this year in Washington, D.C., began in May and goes through June 8. Pride in London is in July; a big celebration in Rio de Janeiro is in November and Atlanta's is in October.",
      "Former President Bill Clinton proclaimed June as Gay and Lesbian Pride Month in 1999, marking the first time a U.S. president did so.",
      "When President Donald Trump returned to office in January, he quickly attempted to roll back LGBTQ+ rights.",
      "He\u2019s especially targeted transgender people with policies that halted allowing people to change the sex listed on their passport, removed transgender military troops and sought to stop using federal insurance programs to pay for gender-affirming care for transgender people under age 19, and keep transgender athletes out of girls and women's sports competitions.",
      "All of those changes are being challenged in court.",
      "His actions follow years of policies in Republican-controlled states that bar gender-affirming care for transgender minors and dictate which sports transgender people can play and which school and other public bathrooms they are allowed to use. The U.S. Supreme Court is expected to rule this month on whether Tennessee's ban on medical treatment is constitutional.",
      "One of Trump\u2019s orders called for removing references to what he and some other conservatives call \u201cgender ideology\u201d from government publications and websites.",
      "A result of that: References to transgender people have been removed from government websites, including the one for the Stonewall National Monument, site of the event that inspired Pride.",
      "About half of U.S. adults approve of how Trump is handling transgender issues, an Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll found last month. About 4 in 10 voters approve of his job as president overall.",
      "But support for his individual policies on transgender people is not uniformly strong, with a clearer consensus against policies that affect youth.",
      "Organizers of Milwaukee's PrideFest are prepared for close to 50,000 people at the event scheduled for June 5-7.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re feeling that people will be showing up, and that\u2019s their protest,\u201d said Wes Shaver, the president and CEO of Milwaukee Pride, Inc.",
      "The event's theme is \u201cCelebrating the Power of Pride\u201d and for the first time, one of the entertainment stages one night will feature only transgender performers. Shaver said that's an intentional move in response to Trump's policies. Another night, the stage will feature only performers of color.",
      "Jeremy Williams, the executive producer of Philly Pride 365 in Philadelphia, said he didn't expect more protest than in the past there.",
      "\u201cEverybody's just there to be together,\u201d he said.",
      "One milestone that's likely to be celebrated: This month marks the 10th anniversary of the U.S. Supreme Court's Obergefell v. Hodges ruling, which recognized same-sex marriage nationwide. It was a watershed event in establishing rights for LGBTQ+ people across the country.",
      "About two-thirds of LGBTQ+ adults in the U.S. said the case made the nation more accepting of same-sex couples, according to a Pew Research Center poll released last week.",
      "The poll found that LGBTQ+ people don't always feel accepted, though. About 6 in 10 said they see \u201ca great deal\u201d or \u201ca fair amount\u201d of social acceptance for those who are lesbian, gay or bisexual. But only about 1 in 10 said the same is true for nonbinary and transgender people.",
      "Several big companies have pulled back on sponsorships for Pride events this year.",
      "Among them: Anheuser-Busch, the St. Louis-based brewer, declined to sponsor PrideFest in its home city after three decades of support, leaving organizers $150,000 short of last year's budget, they told The Associated Press.",
      "NYC Pride said about 20% of its corporate sponsors dropped or reduced support, including PepsiCo and Nissan. The carmaker said it was reviewing all its marketing costs.",
      "In other cities, such as Kansas City, Missouri, pride events lost about half their budgets.",
      "Several companies that have pulled back have not explained why to the AP. But some experts see the change as part of a broader retreat from brand activism.",
      "Still, the groups behind many Pride events say some companies have kept contributing but have asked not to be listed publicly as sponsors.",

      "That attempt to reach Gaza by sea, in early May, failed after another of the group's vessels, the \"Conscience,\" was attacked by two alleged drones while sailing in international waters off the coast of Malta.",
      "The group blamed Israel for the attack, which damaged the front section of the ship, in the latest confrontation over efforts to send assistance to the Palestinian territory devastated by nearly 19 months of war.",
      "The Israeli government says the blockade is an attempt to pressure Hamas to release hostages it took during the Oct. 7, 2023, attack that triggered the conflict. Hamas-led militants assaulted southern Israel that day, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting 251. Hamas is still holding 58 hostages, 23 of whom are believed to be alive.",
      "In response, Israel launched an offensive that has killed over 52,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and civilians. Israel's bombardment and ground operations have destroyed vast areas of the territory and left most of its population homeless.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bill-clinton-and-james-patterson-on-their-new-thriller-the-first-gentleman/",
    "published": "Sun, 01 Jun 2025 11:10:02 -0400",
    "summary": "Former President Bill Clinton and author James Patterson have teamed up for their third book, a thriller: \"The First Gentleman,\" in which the commander-in-chief is a woman \u2013 and her husband stands accused of murder.",
    "story": [
      "Seems that there is always a lot going on behind the walls of the White House where truth can often be stranger than fiction. But fiction can be pretty compelling, too. In the new novel \"The First Gentleman\" (to be published June 2 by Little, Brown & Co.), the commander in chief is a woman, and her husband is accused of murder. It's the third collaboration from best-selling author James Patterson and his co-writer, President Bill Clinton.",
      "Was there a scenario in the book that Patterson couldn't have written without Clinton's help? \"Oh, I couldn't have done any of it without him,\" Patterson said. \"I would have been lost. But the other thing, you know, look, I mean, he's the expert on the first gentleman. You know, he was almost a first gentleman!\"",
      "\"Yeah, I thought about it for years. And it's the only political job I ever wanted and I didn't get!\" Clinton smiled. \"'Cause I really thought Hillary should be president.\"",
      "Clinton would have been the very first first gentleman had his wife, Hillary, won the 2016 election. And he says back then he did a lot of thinking about what his role would be as a presidential spouse: \"How could I do this job in a way that I would be on-call to help if she needed me, but I wouldn't get in the way?\"",
      "\"That's the way I feel about this relationship: How can I help without getting in the way?\" Patterson said. \"I'm kind of the first gentleman of our [relationship]!\"",
      "\"If you believe that, I got some land in Arizona I want to show you!\" Clinton laughed.",
      "And sometimes, their made-up White House looks almost like real life. In the book, the president keeps working through an agonizing personal crisis. During his 1999 impeachment proceedings, President Clinton kept working, too, with some of the very people who were trying to kick him out of the White House. \"And they were amazed by it,\" he said. \"They'd come and do business with me, [and] as far as they knew, I couldn't remember what was going on. And we would try to hammer out deals.\" In the midst of impeachment? \"Because that's what I got hired to do,\" Clinton said. \"The American people don't pay you to have personal feelings. They pay you to deliver for them.\"",
      "Clinton and Patterson have been delivering since 2018, with their first book about a president gone missing, and in 2021 their second about the president's daughter getting kidnapped. Both were bestsellers. But for them, it's really not all about work.",
      "Asked how their relationship has evolved over their three books together, Clinton replied, \"We've played a lot more golf.\"",
      "Patterson said, \"He's been president more times, but I have more holes-in-one.\"",
      "\"Oh God. Well, I have one; he has nine,\" said Clinton. \"How many Americans have nine holes-in-one?\"",
      "\"I know. That's sick,\" Patterson said. \"Remember I'm a fiction writer.\"",
      "\"Makes the craziness stop for a little while\"",
      "I asked, \"There's so much political drama in the world today, real-life political drama. Do you think that there's an appetite for political thrillers, for fictional political thrillers?\"",
      "Patterson said, \"I think so, 100%. I mean, one of the nice things here is you escape, but you don't totally escape reality. It's like, 'Yeah, I love this. I can't put it down.' Or 'I keep reading,' or in some cases to me what's even better, which is you don't want it to end.",
      "\"I think it's useful, and 'cause so many people are wandering around, they go, 'Oh my God, oh my God, please make it stop'? This makes it stop for a little while, makes the craziness stop for a little while for people.\"",
      "Clinton said, \"One reason I hope there's an appetite is\u2026 I hope that people will still believe in our democratic system enough to stick with it and keep pushing to make it work.\"",
      "During the summer, Patterson lives at his home on the Hudson River; the president is about five miles away.",
      "Asked what they may have learned about each other during the writing process, Patterson offered, \"the notion \u2026 of not worrying about stuff that we can't do anything about. And if we can do something about it, try to do it.\"",
      "Their new book comes out tomorrow and they hope it's another bestseller. But if you spend any time at all with Patterson and Clinton, you get the sense that their partnership is about something money can't buy.",
      "I asked, \"Back when you wrote your first book together, The New York Times said that the two of you 'complete each other in the Jerry Maguire sense.'\"",
      "\"Well, we kinda do,\" Patterson said. \"This has been driving me for months now, which is: my time here is short. What can I do most beautifully? And in this case, doing another book with my friend is a beautiful thing to do.\"",

      "Prologue",
      "President Wright AdministrationYear Three: September",
      "1Brentwood, New Hampshire",
      "Cole Wright is sitting in the rear seat of a black up-armored Chevy Suburban, one of three in a convoy speeding its way down Route 125 in the Seacoast Region of New Hampshire.",
      "Two dark green state police cruisers, lights flashing, are leading this no-frills motorcade, scaled down for the occasion. The presidential limousine \u2014 the Beast \u2014 is back at the airport, along with the Secret Service counterassault team, support personnel, news media vans, and a fully equipped ambulance.",
      "Three years after the election, Cole still gets pumped from seeing traffic part like magic, even though he's well aware that it's for the convenience and safety of the woman sitting beside him \u2014 his wife, Madeline Parson Wright, the president of the United States.",
      "He's just the First Gentleman.",
      "A light drizzle spatters against the bulletproof windows. The agent accelerates to seventy along the two-lane highway.",
      "\"Two minutes out,\" says Burton Pearce, the president's chief of staff. Pearce perches in a rear-facing jump seat across from the First Couple. He's pale and serious, wearing one of his many identical gray suits. \"The Gray Ghost,\" staffers call him. The president nods without looking up.",
      "Cole glances over to see the CONFIDENTIAL stamps on the pages Maddy is reading as the convoy hums along. He knows those pages represent the biggest political gamble of her administration \u2014 of any administration. She should be in the Oval Office working the phones and twisting arms, but instead she's here with him. A powerful personal show of support.",
      "Maddy puts her briefing packet aside. Cole takes her hand and squeezes it.",
      "She squeezes back. \"Don't worry,\" she says. \"After all we've been through together, we can get through this too.\"",
      "The Suburban slows down to make a hard turn behind the police escort. Now the convoy is moving at just forty miles per hour. On both sides of the route, locals hold up crude hand-painted placards.",
      "WE BELIEVE IN YOU, COLE!",
      "STAY STRONG, COLE!",
      "KEEP MOVING, COLE!",
      "He looks out through the tinted side window. Almost game time. He can feel his muscles twitching, his focus narrowing, just like in his days as a tight end for New England \u2014 before the blown knee forced him out. He remembers how the tension in the Patriots locker room would build and build almost to the breaking point until the team ran out into the light, and when the cheers of the crowd washed over him, he'd think, Yeah, we're okay. We've got this.",
      "But today?",
      "Today he's not so sure.",
      "The redbrick facade of the Rockingham County courthouse comes into view. The road is lined with police barricades holding back hundreds \u2014 maybe thousands \u2014 of onlookers. Up here, some of the signs have a different tone.",
      "SCUM!",
      "MONSTER!",
      "JUSTICE FOR SUZANNE!",
      "\"Don't worry about these people,\" says Maddy. \"They don't know what they're talking about.\"",
      "\"I don't care about the people on the road,\" says Cole. \"I'm worried about the twelve people waiting for me inside.\"",
      "As the Suburban slows to a crawl, two women jump out in front and unspool a long banner.",
      "CONVICT COLE WRIGHT! SEND HIM STRAIGHT TO HELL!",
      "Thanks for the kind wishes, Cole thinks.",
      "2",
      "A thousand demonstrators, media people, and curious locals are crowded into the rain-slick parking lot. The convoy is passing through the tall evergreens flanking the pavement leading up to the courthouse when I realize I left my umbrella in my car. Too late.",
      "Rockingham County has never drawn security like this. Uniforms representing every law enforcement department in New Hampshire \u2014 from local cops to Fish and Game \u2014 are patrolling the courthouse steps. On the roof there's a detail of men and women in tactical gear and black baseball caps carrying sniper rifles. They're not even trying to hide. That's the job of their colleagues, posted in places nobody can see.",
      "I hear someone calling my name: \"Brea Cooke? That you?\"",
      "I look at the crowd. Mostly white. No surprise; the Granite State is around 89 percent Caucasian. It's a situation I got used to as a Black student at Dartmouth, about two hours north. Let's just say it's not unusual for me to stand out around here.",
      "I turn around. \"Ron Reynolds!\"",
      "Ron is a friendly face from the old days when he and my partner, Garrett Wilson, both reported for the Boston Globe. He's wearing his standard outfit \u2014 tan overcoat, khaki pants, and a tweed cap. His big press pass is dangling around his neck.",
      "I give him a quick hug. \"Guess we both forgot our umbrellas.\"",
      "A guy in a thick camo jacket jostles by us and flicks a finger at Ron's press pass. \"Fake news!\" the guy shouts. Ron ignores him.",
      "\"So why are you here?\" I ask. \"You could be in one of those gyms right now, dry and toasty. Probably getting a better view than this.\"",
      "\"I get paid to get wet,\" says Ron. \"Even if nothing happens.\"",
      "But something is happening. I've been waiting for this day a long time. I see flashing lights coming up the drive. Two state police cars and three big black SUVs.",
      "\"It's them!\"",
      "The lights are getting closer. I'm in the middle of the crowd, but suddenly I feel as alone as I've ever felt in my life.",
      "I close my eyes for a second. My mind whispers, Garrett.",
      "I blink hard. Not now! I need to focus. Capture this scene for my book. Our book. The one Garrett and I were working on together. Until he ...",
      "Ron points to the courthouse steps. \"See the podium and the camera stands up there?\"",
      "I nod. \"What about them?\"",
      "\"All for show. No way the Secret Service allows the president and First Gent to go through the front entrance.\"",
      "\"The crowd won't appreciate being tricked like that.\"",
      "\"You're right,\" says Ron. \"They came to witness history.\"",
      "So did I.",
      "The first time in history that a president's spouse is going on trial for murder.",
      "3",
      "The convoy crawls toward the entrance as cops push the crowds back. Inside the six-ton Suburban in the middle, Cole rubs his hands together nervously. Pearce leans forward in his jump seat and says, \"The county sheriffs, state troopers, and Secret Service have carved out a path so we can go around to the rear of the courthouse. By the time the crowd and the press catch on, we'll be inside and out of sight.\"",
      "Hidden away, Cole thinks. \"No,\" he says quietly. \"That's not going to happen.\"",
      "Pearce blinks. \"Excuse me?\"",
      "\"I said no. Going in through the rear of the courthouse signals that I'm guilty, that I have something to hide. Screw that. I'm going to run the ball straight through the line of scrimmage.\"",
      "The Suburban moves toward the driveway turnoff. Pearce is getting testy. \"Cole, plans have been in place for days. Best to arrive via the rear from both a safety and PR viewpoint.\"",
      "But Cole is firm. \"We go through the front door. That's final.\"",
      "He turns to his wife. \"Maddy, will you say a few words on the courthouse steps?\"",
      "It's a big ask. Maddy doesn't need to tell him the source of the tension in her eyes. The conflict between being his loving partner while serving as POTUS, leader of the free world, is etched on her face.",
      "Maddy looks at her chief of staff. \"Cole is right, Burton. We go through the front entrance, heads held high.\"",
      "\"But, ma'am, we're just about there. Arrangements have been made.\"",
      "Cole sees Maddy shift into commander-in-chief mode. Cool. Crisp. Decisive. \"You've got a phone,\" she says. \"Make new arrangements.\"",
      "4",
      "They're getting out!\" Ron grabs my sleeve.",
      "Sure enough, I hear the slamming of heavy car doors and see movement at the front of the courthouse steps. The Secret Service is scrambling to clear a path to the podium.",
      "\"That takes some brass ones!\" Ron calls to me above the rising noise.",
      "A ring of dark suits surrounds President Wright and her broad-shouldered husband.",
      "The president walks up the wide steps and pivots to the podium. The crowd surges forward. Cops push back. Secret Service agents watch the sea of faces. And hands. Especially the hands. Looking for weapons.",
      "President Wright squeezes her husband's arm just before she leans into the microphones. \"Ladies and gentlemen, my dear friends, I will make this short and to the point.\"",
      "I hear her voice echo across the parking lot. She pauses after each phrase to let the words sink in.",
      "\"I have full faith and confidence in my husband's innocence, and I trust that the good citizens of New Hampshire, who have stood by my side over the years, will also support my husband during this time of crisis.\"",
      "The president turns and kisses her husband's cheek, making sure the cameras have a good angle. Then, as if it's an after-thought, she steps up to the mics again and says, \"I believe in our legal system, and I'm confident justice will be done here.\"",
      "She takes her husband's hand. The Secret Service team surrounds them. As a unit, they walk up the steps to the courthouse doors.",
      "\"Quite a performance,\" says Reynolds.",
      "\"It was a performance all right. Pure theater. They're not a couple \u2014 they're a damn criminal enterprise.\"",
      "My outburst must surprise Ron. A second later, he heads off to gather quotes.",
      "Once again, I'm alone. I scan the masses. Almost every man, woman, and child is looking toward the courthouse, trying to get one last glimpse of the First Couple.",
      "On the far side of the parking lot, I spot the lone exceptions: a man and a woman, looking straight at me.",
      "I've seen these two before. My watchers.",
      "Damn. Not again.",
      "The crowd shifts, and they disappear.",
      "All around me, people are chattering and yelling, but their words are a blanket of white noise. Again my mind whispers, Garrett. I hold out my hand, half expecting to see him reaching for me.",
      "I fight back the tears as reality hits home.",
      "The love of my life, Garrett Wilson, is dead. And I believe the man inside that courthouse is responsible for his death.",
      "The First Gentleman.",
      "He might even have pulled the trigger.",

    "summary": "The writer-producer-voice artist behind the animated hit is also a crooner of the Great American Songbook. He is now releasing a new album, \"Lush Life: The Lost Sinatra Arrangements.\"",
    "story": [
      "Even if you're not a regular \"Family Guy\" viewer, you've probably heard the show's iconic theme song. The song is largely the creation of Seth MacFarlane, whose love of animation may only be rivaled by his love for big, jazzy tunes. In fact, he's even got a semi-regular gig at the Vibrato Grill Jazz Club in Bel Air, Calif., singing songs from the Great American Songbook.",
      "But one thing he doesn't seem to love, considering he's lived his life in the public eye, is a certain kind of attention. He says sometimes getting in front of a crowd (or even our \"Sunday Morning\" cameras) doesn't quite come naturally.",
      "He is, he admits, an introvert. \"Oh, hell yeah. Yeah. I don't even wanna be here!\" he said.",
      "In fact, he says he sometimes has to resort to liquid courage. \"I think I had like four scotches before I walked out on stage at the Oscars,\" he said, referring to his hosting gig in 2013. \"I do get, yeah, I definitely get nervous.\"",
      "You might know MacFarlane as the voice of Peter, Brian Griffin and Stewie on the show \"Family Guy\" that he created more than two decades ago. In 1999, MacFarlane became the youngest showrunner in Hollywood history. And less than a decade later, with three network shows on the air, he became Hollywood's highest-paid writer-producer.",
      "But back in college, MacFarlane's first love was singing. \"My sister, at the time, was going to the Boston Conservatory of Music for musical theater,\" he said. \"She has a beautiful singing voice. And I had got it into my head that I was going to maybe go to grad school for musical theater as well. So, I applied and got in. And I was all set to go to their grad program. And I got this offer from Hanna-Barbera to come do an animated short for a series that they were developing. And so, I just had to take it, moved out to California. But there was an instant there where I could have kind of diverged into a completely different career and never, you know, never even thought about something called 'Family Guy.'\"",
      "MacFarlane loved film scores as a college student and to this day he uses a live orchestra to score his TV shows.\u00a0 \"It's the one part that I don't really understand, even to this day,\" he said. \"There's still something mysterious about how a composer sits down to write, and then a couple weeks later walks in front of an orchestra, plops down these charts, and they all play it. And you hear this insane, magical sound. That still eludes me.\"",
      "Frank Sinatra Jr, and Stewie and Brian (Seth MacFarlane), perform \"At Frank Sinatra's Restaurant (Jr.)\" from \"Family Guy\":",
      "For his latest album, \"Lush Life: The Lost Sinatra Arrangements\" (out this week), MacFarlane and Joel McNeely, his composer and arranger for \"Family Guy,\" combed through the Sinatra Family archives for songs that had been arranged for Sinatra but never fully recorded. For McNeely, the process was almost like speaking to the ghosts of the greatest arrangers in popular music, the men who helped make Sinatra's voice shine.",
      "McNeely showed an arrangement by Nelson Riddle: \"This was the first one we read when we had a sight-reading session at Fox. We got an orchestra together just to see what was there, you know, because there was nothing to reference. But all this time later, these little black pencil dots on paper, there's his voice brought back to life. I mean, it was chilling.\"",
      "So, what exactly does an arranger do? \"Frank Sinatra, there's a recording of him saying that the arrangers could be in a sense a recording secretary, taking the vision of the artist and interpreting it into this,\" McNeely said.",
      "MacFarlane said, \"You take a song like 'Fly Me to the Moon,' for example, which I think was originally a ballad. [Here], it's the same song, but it's a completely different animal.\"",
      "McNeely says MacFarlane is preserving the essential legacy of the American Songbook through his recordings and the music of the TV show \"Family Guy.\" But what about the legacy of \"Family Guy\"? MacFarlane has some thoughts: \"When I started the show \u2013 this is the conversation that, like, tortures me at night! \u2013 when I started the show, my attitude was, it doesn't matter, none of it matters. It's like, It's funny? Let's do it.",
      "\"And the older I've gotten, I look back at shows that we've done, and I'm like, Gosh, I guess it's a little more complicated than that, isn't it? Comedy and jokes do have an impact. I have to figure out a way to maintain what the show is, and maintain the thing that people love. But at the same time, recognize that, like, all right, I am analyzing it now in a different way than I did when I was younger.\"",
      "If it's true that you're nobody 'till somebody loves you, then thanks to \"Family Guy\"'s legion of fans, Seth MacFarlane, it turns out, is a very big somebody indeed.",

      "California lost roughly 40,000 film and tv jobs that year alone, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.",
      "\"When that finally settled, we were like, OK, great, things will come back,\" Mangano said. \"And there has been no significant increase in job opportunities.\"",
      "Since its peak in 2021, television production in the greater Los Angeles area has decreased by 58%, according to the nonprofit group FilmLA, which handles film permitting for the city and county of Los Angeles. The number of shoot days for television fell from 18,560 in 2021 to 7,716 in 2024.",
      "And in the first quarter of 2025, on-location production in L.A. declined by 22.4% from the same period last year, per numbers from FilmLA.",
      "\"Right now, it's a triage situation. The patient is dying and you need to bring it back to life,\" Matthew Belloni, who covers show business for Puck News and hosts the popular podcast \"The Town,\" told CBS News.",
      "Belloni says Hollywood productions, and hence the jobs, have gone to other U.S. states and other countries who are willing to offer generous tax incentives.",
      "\"Some European countries that are offering up to 40% back on these productions,\" Belloni said. \"And that's incredibly influential.\"",
      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom wants to stop the bleeding by more than doubling the state's annual film and TV tax credits from $330 million to $750 million.",
      "\"Film and film making, pre and post-production, it's on life support,\" Newsom told reporters earlier this month. \"L.A. County and L.A. city are struggling.\"",
      "But is the proposal too little too late?",
      "\"The sad reality is that California has sat on this issue for 30 years,\" Belloni said.",
      "Belloni is unsure if California can provide enough tax credits to offset the high cost of working in the state.",
      "\"Other jurisdictions have done their own aggressive cuts to that bureaucracy,\" Belloni said. \"Is California willing to do that? Don't know.\"",
      "In the meantime, Mangano and thousands of others in Hollywood are looking for whatever work they can find.",
      "\"I applied for a job at Costco a couple months ago,\" said Mangano, who adds that he cannot hold out \"much longer.\"",
      "\"I have a little savings left,\" he adds. \"We're hoping that'll float us for a few more months. And then we have to start making some hard decisions\u2026Whether or not we can keep the house.\"",

      "A look back at the esteemed personalities who left us this year, who'd touched us with their innovation, creativity and humanity.",
      "By CBSNews.com senior producer David Morgan. The Associated Press contributed to this gallery.",
      "Emmy Award-winning actress Loretta Swit (Nov. 4, 1937-May 30, 2025) was best known for bringing Maj. Margaret \"Hot Lips\" Houlihan to full life on the long-running TV series \"M*A*S*H.\" The head nurse of a Mobile Army Surgical Hospital during the Korean War, Houlihan brought her by-the-book attitude for Army rules against the anti-authoritarian streak of Alan Alda's \"Hawkeye\" Pierce. The series was adapted from Robert Altman's Oscar-winning 1970 film, and while toned down for television, the CBS series, produced by Larry Gelbart and Gene Reynolds, aimed to maintain the movie's anti-establishment ethos during the turmoil of the Vietnam War.",
      "After small roles on \"Gunsmoke,\" \"Mannix\" and \"Hawaii Five-O,\" Swit was called in to meet the producers of \"M*A*S*H.\" Then her agent informed her that she'd received an offer to appear in a movie with Olivia de Havilland, which conflicted with shooting the pilot. But \"M*A*S*H\" producer Gene Reynold told the agent, \"Nope, don't give her away. She's ours,\" Swit recalled in a 2020 Edge Magazine interview.",
      "As the show progressed, Swit expanded her character beyond being the target of the doctors' pranks, and fought against her character being tied down by her affair with Maj. Frank Burns (played by Larry Linville). She suggested that Hot Lips break up with Frank, meet a dashing man in Tokyo, and get engaged, married \u2013 and divorced. \"We really worked together like a well-oiled machine \u2013 everybody on this show worked together with the writers,\" she told Edge. \"You had these creative people, throwing ideas back and forth in positive, wonderful, rich ways. It was a very exciting time to be around, to be an actor in that situation. You could not help but get better and grow and learn.\"",
      "She won two Emmys for playing Houlihan, and received eight more nominations. She was also nominated for four Golden Globes. Although some actors came and went, Swit lasted throughout the show's 11-season run, which concluded in 1983.",
      "A native of Passaic, N.J., Swit had to overcome her mother's aversion to her becoming an actress. She recalled to the Toronto Star in 2010 her mom's reaction after attending a play in a Greenwich Village theater, \"walking in as though it were the doorway to Hades. After the show, I came out and my mother said to my father, 'If you don't stop her now, she may wind up doing this for the rest of her life.' That was it. That gave me the courage I needed to keep at it until I succeeded.\"",
      "On stage she starred in \"Same Time, Next Year,\" \"Shirley Valentine,\" and \"The Mystery of Edwin Drood.\" Other screen appearances include \"Freebie and the Bean,\" \"S.O.B.,\" and \"Murder She Wrote.\" She also founded a charity, the SwitHeart Animal Alliance.",
      "Houlihan would inspire countless women to become nurses, in part because the show was closer to reality that other medical shows. \"Up until 'M*A*S*H,' the doctors on television didn't lose patients; they always pulled them through,\" she said. \"That's nice, but it's not honest. We used to say that 'M*A*S*H' is not a John Wayne movie about war. In our series, people died, patients died, people got wounded and hurt. And we never stop talking about the ugliness of it. The humor came out of our own madness and craziness to have to be there to do that. The only way to survive was by being crazy and funny and drunk. I think 'M*A*S*H' took on cult status because we told everybody the truth.\""

    "story": [
      "Patti LuPone\u00a0has issued an apology after hundreds of Broadway performers spoke out against the three-time Tony Awards winner over what they say is a pattern of \"inappropriate and unacceptable public comments,\" specifically against Broadway star Kecia Lewis, in an open letter.",
      "\"For as long as I have worked in the theatre, I have spoken my mind and never apologized. That is changing today.\" LuPone said in her apology posted Saturday on social media.",
      "Lupone issued the apology in response to a\u00a0letter, dated May 30\u00a0 and addressed to the American Theatre Wing, the national trade association for the Broadway theatre industry, calling on decision makers to \"hold people accountable for violent, disrespectful, or harmful behavior.\" More than 500 Broadway performers \u2014 including\u00a0James Monroe Iglehart, Kalen Allen and\u00a0Tatianna C\u00f3rdoba \u2014 signed the open letter, which was first published in\u00a0Playbill.",
      "It comes after the New Yorker published an interview last week with 76-year-old LuPone, a White performer, in which she said of Lewis, who is a Black actress said: \"Don't call yourself a vet, bitch,\" apparently referring to Lewis' November 2024 video\u00a0posted to her Instagram\u00a0in which she spoke about LuPone's behavior.",
      "\"This language is not only degrading and misogynistic-it is a blatant act of racialized disrespect. It constitutes bullying. It constitutes harassment. It is emblematic of the microaggressions and abuse that people in this industry have endured for far too long, too often without consequence,\" said the open letter.",
      "LuPone's issue with Lewis appeared to have began last fall when she starred in\u00a0\"The Roommate,\" a two-woman show with Mia Farrow\u00a0that was next door to\u00a0\"Hell's Kitchen,\"\u00a0a musical inspired by Alicia Key's life and music in which Lewis performed and won Tony for Best Featured Actress in a Musical.",
      "According to Lewis' video, LuPone had made complaints about the noise from the musical, which led to changes to the sound design that \"negatively impacted\" the show and its performers. Lewis also brought up a video of LuPone refusing to sign a fan's \"Hell's Kitchen\" playbill because the musical is \"too loud.\"",
      "\"I wanted to address this because, Ms. LuPone, these actions, in my opinion, are bullying,\" Lewis said in the video. \"They're offensive, they are racially microaggressive, they're rude, they're rooted in privilege. And these actions also lack a sense of community and leadership for someone as yourself, who has been in the business as long as you have.\"",
      "Lewis then asked LuPone, from one Broadway veteran to another, to apologize.",
      "When asked, LuPone addressed the situation in the New Yorker article, saying, \"This is not unusual on Broadway. This happens all the time when walls are shared.\"",
      "\"She calls herself a veteran? Let's find out how many Broadway shows Kecia Lewis has done, because she doesn't know what the f--- she's talking about,\" LuPone told the New Yorker.",
      "CBS News has reached out to LuPone and Lewis for comment.",
      "When the New Yorker asked about Audra McDonald, who appeared to support Lewis' video, LuPone said: \"That's typical of Audra. She's not a friend.\" She added that the two had issues in the past, but didn't go into details.",
      "In her apology on Saturday, LuPone said she regrets her \"flippant and emotional responses during this interview, which were inappropriate, and I am devastated that my behavior has offended others and has run counter to what we hold dear in this community.\"",
      "\"I hope to have the chance to speak to Audra and Kecia personally to offer my sincere apologies,\" LuPone added. \"I wholeheartedly agree with everything that was written in the open letter shared yesterday. From middle school drama clubs to professional stages, theatre has always been about lifting each other up and welcoming those who feel they don't belong anywhere else. I made a mistake, I take full responsibility for it, and I am committed to making this right. Our entire theatre community deserves better.\"",
      "McDonald, the most nominated and awarded performer in Tony Award history, told CBS News' Gayle King in an interview set to air Tuesday on\u00a0\"CBS Mornings\" that she had not seen LuPone in 11 years.",
      "\"If there's a rift between us, I don't know what it is. That's something you'd have to ask Patti about,\" McDonald said.",
      "Next week on June 8, the Tony Awards are set to broadcast on CBS and stream on Paramount+. McDonald could add snatch her seventh Tony win thanks to the revival of \"Gypsy.\"",

    "summary": "\"This is a setback of probably a decade for HIV vaccine research,\" one scientist said.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration has moved to end funding for a broad swath of HIV vaccine research, saying current approaches are enough to counter the virus, multiple scientists and federal health officials say.",
      "Notifications that the funding would not be extended were relayed Friday to researchers, who were told by National Institutes of Health officials that the Department of Health and Human Services had elected \"to go with currently available approaches to eliminate HIV\" instead.",
      "The cuts will shutter two major HIV vaccine research efforts that were first funded by the NIH in 2012 at the Duke Human Vaccine Institute and the Scripps Research Institute, multiple scientists said. A spokesperson for Moderna said the vaccine manufacturer's clinical trials through the NIH's HIV Vaccine Trials Network have also been put on pause.",
      "One senior NIH official said the HHS had also instructed the agency not to issue any more funding in the next fiscal year for HIV vaccine research, with only a small handful of exceptions.",
      "A budgetary rule change specifically targeted at HIV vaccine research is also expected to lead to another cut to the NIH's awards for studies initiated by scientists, an official said.",
      "The change, to be finalized shortly, inflates the accounting for the upfront cost of studies into HIV vaccines funded by the agency. Instead of the cost of a five-year grant being spread out over five years, the NIH plans to make HIV vaccine dollars from multi-year grants all count toward a single year, the official said, making it harder for them to get funded.",
      "A spokesperson for HHS told CBS News that \"complex and duplicative health programs have resulted in serious duplication of efforts,\" saying that \"27 separate programs that address HIV/AIDS\" had spent $7.5 billion.",
      "\"The Administration believes the United States should have the best medical research in the world. To that end, we are advancing policies to maximize the impact of every federal taxpayer dollar and ensure proper oversight of this funding,\" HHS spokesperson Emily Hilliard said.",
      "Hilliard claimed \"critical HIV/AIDS programs will continue\" under the new agency that Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has proposed creating, dubbed the Administration for a Healthy America.",
      "\"For HIV vaccine design and development, we've begun to see light at the end of the tunnel after many years of research. This is a terrible time to cut it off. We're beginning to get close. We're getting good results out of clinical trials,\" said Dennis Burton, an immunology professor at Scripps Research.",
      "Burton warned that their HIV vaccine research could not simply be turned back on, even if a future administration decided to change course on HIV funding. He said ongoing experiments would be shuttered, and researchers assembled to study the issue would be forced to refocus their careers on other topics.",
      "\"This is a decision with consequences that will linger. This is a setback of probably a decade for HIV vaccine research,\" Burton said.",
      "The cancellation of the funds comes weeks ahead of the Food and Drug Administration's June 19 deadline for deciding on approval of lenacapavir, a twice-yearly injectable drug to prevent HIV.",
      "The drug, which is being brought to the commercial market by drugmaker Gilead Sciences, builds on NIH-backed research into earlier HIV medications. The drug's availability could lead to a significant drop in HIV cases worldwide, since a study found it was 100% effective in preventing transmission.",
      "An NIH official, who was not authorized to speak publicly, rebuked the claim that the effectiveness of current HIV prevention strategies meant a vaccine was no longer needed. \"The only way of ending the HIV epidemic in the U.S. and AIDS pandemic worldwide\" is with a vaccine, they said.",
      "Developing an effective HIV vaccine has been an elusive target for researchers, though scientists have hailed recent breakthroughs in the field.",
      "\"HIV has established roadblocks to us fighting it off, which are unparalleled in vaccinology. We've had to learn what each of the roadblocks are and to devise ways to overcome it. This virus mutates so quickly,\" said Duke professor of medicine Dr. Barton Ford Haynes, who is part of the Duke Human Vaccine Institute.",
      "Haynes said their work was essentially combining multiple different vaccines as part of their approach to designing an effective HIV vaccine.",
      "He praised lenacapavir as a \"wonderful development for the field,\" but said there was still a need for a vaccine. Lenacapavir requires injections every six months to remain effective, a challenging proposition even before steep cuts to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's domestic HIV programs and U.S.-backed HIV/AIDS foreign aid programs.",
      "\"The hope was that adding an HIV vaccine to all the preventive measures that we have would finally allow us to end the pandemic,\" Haynes said.",

      "\"Studies including hundreds of thousands of people around the world show that COVID-19 vaccination before and during pregnancy is safe, effective, and beneficial to both the pregnant woman and the baby.

      "The CDC also deleted a statement previously on the childhood immunization schedule that the guidance had been recommended by the committee, approved by the CDC and backed by a number of outside medical groups.",
      "So far, the CDC's changes echo what the committee had already been considering voting on next month: narrowing COVID-19 vaccine recommendations to only older adults and younger ages with risk factors, but still allowing for permissive coverage of others getting vaccinated.",
      "The CDC has used \"shared clinical decision-making\" guidance in the past to allow for federal requirements guaranteeing insurance coverage and access to some vaccines, while stopping short of full-throated recommendations for everyone eligible to get a shot.",
      "At its last meeting in April, the committee had not signaled that they were planning to lift the recommendation for pregnant women to get vaccinated.",

      "\"Travelers can catch measles in many travel settings including travel hubs like airports and train stations, on public transportation like airplanes and trains, at tourist attractions, and at large, crowded events,\" the agency now says, in an update published Wednesday.",
      "Since the beginning of the year, the CDC has received at least 62 reports of travelers who were contagious with the highly transmissible virus while flying into the U.S. or within the country, a spokesperson for the health agency told CBS News in a statement.",
      "After investigating 50 of those travelers, the CDC was able to determine that measles spread during air travel in at least one of those situations, the spokesperson said. That is usually based on connecting confirmed cases of measles among airline passengers sitting near each other.",
      "There have also been numerous public alerts in recent months about the possible risk of exposure in airports, after travelers were found to be contagious. \"Exposures at the airport itself are more difficult to track, and state, local, and territorial health departments lead these investigations,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "In its Wednesday update, the CDC dropped its list of countries now facing \"high incidence\" of measles. Instead, the agency now warns only that the virus is \"an ongoing risk around the world, and more international travelers are getting infected.\"",
      "In addition to this year's record surge of the virus within the U.S., health authorities in neighboring Mexico and Canada have also reported large outbreaks of measles.",
      "The CDC also replaced a previous recommendation that Americans \"consider making alternative travel plans\" if they could not get vaccinated before departing, and now says travelers should \"consider postponing their trip.\"",
      "All travelers are recommended to be fully vaccinated for measles before going to any international destination. The CDC recently updated its guidance to doctors advising additional measles vaccines\u00a0for some domestic travelers as well.",

    "published": "Fri, 30 May 2025 05:00:00 -0400",
    "summary": "As state officials anticipate Medicaid funding cuts that could strip resources for those with disabilities and chronic health conditions, an army of unpaid caregivers waits in the wings: children.",
    "story": [
      "St. Paul, Minn. \u2014 High school senior Joshua Yang understands sacrifice. When he was midway through 10th grade, his mom survived a terrible car crash. But her body developed tremors, and she lost mobility. After countless appointments, doctors diagnosed her with Parkinson's disease, saying it was likely triggered by brain injuries sustained in the wreck.",
      "At 15, Yang, an aspiring baseball player and member of his school's debate team, took on a new role: his mother's caregiver.",
      "Researchers estimate that Yang, now 18, counted among at least 5.4 million U.S. children who provide care to an adult in their home. As state officials eye federal Medicaid funding cuts that could drastically reduce home care services for those who are disabled or have chronic health conditions, many predict that number will rise.",
      "That's bad news for kids: Studies show that when young people take on care for adults with medical conditions, their health and academic outcomes decline. At the same time, their loved ones receive untrained care.",
      "\"It all fell to me,\" said Yang, whose sisters were 9 and 10 at the time of their mom's accident, and whose stepdad worked nights. His grades fell and he quit after-school activities, he said, unable to spare the time.",
      "Early on, Yang found reprieve from a personal care nurse who gave them supplies, such as adult diapers, and advice on items to purchase, such as a chair for the shower. And for about a year, Yang was able to work for a personal care agency and earn $1,000 a month caring for his mom \u2014 money that went toward her medication and family needs.",
      "But at the beginning of 11th grade, a change to his mom's insurance ended her personal care benefit, sending him into a runaround with his county's Medicaid office in Minnesota. \"For a solid month I was on my phone, on hold, in the back of the class, waiting for the 'hello,'\" he said. \"I'd be in third period, saying, 'Mr. Stepan, can I step out?'\"",
      "A report published in May by the U.S. Government Accountability Office reminded states that National Family Caregiver Support Program grants can be used to assist caregivers under 18. However, the future of those grants remains unclear: They are funded through the Older Americans Act, which is awaiting reauthorization; and the Administration for Community Living, which oversees the grants, was nearly halved in April as part of the reorganization of the Department of Health and Human Services under President Trump.",
      "Additionally, if Congress approves proposed cuts to Medicaid, one of the first casualties likely will be states' home- and community-based service programs that provide critical financial relief to family caregivers, said Andrew Olenski, an economist at Lehigh University specializing in long-term health care.",
      "Such programs, which differ by state but are paid for with federal dollars, are designed to ensure that Medicaid-eligible people in need of long-term care can continue living at home by covering in-home personal and nursing care. In 2021, they served almost 5% of all Medicaid participants, costing about $158 billion.",
      "By law, Medicaid is required to cover necessary long-term care in a nursing home setting but not all home or community care programs. So, if states are forced to make cuts, those programs are vulnerable to being scaled back or eliminated.",
      "If an aide who makes daily home visits, for example, is no longer an option, family caregivers could step in, Olenski said. But he pointed out that not all patients have adult children to care for them, and not all adult children can afford to step away from the workforce. And that could put more pressure on any kids at home.",
      "\"These things tend to roll downhill,\" Olenski said.",
      "Some studies show benefits to young people who step into caregiving roles, such as more self-confidence and improved family relationships. Yang said he feels more on top of things than his peers: \"I have friends worrying about how to land a job interview, while I've already applied to seven or eight other jobs.\"",
      "But for many, the cost is steep. Young caregivers report more depression, anxiety, and stress than their peers. Their physical health tends to be worse, too, related to diet and lack of attention to their own care. And caregiving often becomes a significant drag on their education: A large study found that 15- to 18-year-old caregivers spent, on average, 42 fewer minutes per day on educational activities and 31 fewer minutes in class than their peers.",
      "Schools in several states are taking notice. In Colorado, a statewide survey recently included its first question about caregiving and found that more than 12% of high schoolers provide care for someone in their home who is chronically ill, elderly, or disabled.",
      "Rhode Island's education department now requires every middle and high school to craft a policy to support caregiving students after a study published in 2023 found 29% of middle and high school students report caring for a younger or older family member for part of the day, and 7% said the role takes up most of their day. Rates were higher for Hispanic, Asian, and Black students than their white peers.",
      "The results floored Lindsey Tavares, principal of Apprenticeship Exploration School, a charter high school in Cranston. Just under half her students identified as caregivers, she said. That awareness has changed conversations when students' grades slip or the kids stop showing up on time or at all.",
      "\"We know now that this is a question we should be asking directly,\" she said.",
      "Students have shared stories of staying home to care for an ill sibling when a parent needs to work, missing school to translate doctors' appointments, or working nights to pitch in financially, she said. Tavares and her team see it as their job to find an approach to help students persist. That might look like connecting the student to resources outside the school, offering mental health support, or working with a teacher to keep a student caught up.",
      "\"We can't always solve their problem,\" Tavares said. \"But we can be really realistic about how we can get that student to finish high school.\"",
      "Rhode Island officials believe their state is the first to officially support caregiving students \u2014 work they're doing in partnership with the Florida-based American Association for Caregiving Youth. In 2006, the association formed the Caregiving Youth Project, which works with schools to provide eligible students with peer group support, medical care training, overnight summer camp, and specialists tuned in to each student's specific needs. This school year, more than 700 middle and high school students took part.",
      "\"For kids, it's important for them to know they're not alone,\" said Julia Belkowitz, a pediatrician and an associate professor at the University of Miami who has studied student caregivers. \"And for the rest of us, it's important, as we consider policies, to know who's really doing this work.\"",
      "In St. Paul, Joshua Yang had hoped to study civil engineering at the University of Minnesota, but decided instead to attend community college in the fall, where his schedule will make it simpler to continue living at home and caring for his mom.",
      "But he sees some respite on the horizon as his sisters, now 12 and 13, prepare to take on a greater share of the caregiving. They're \"actual people\" now with personalities and a sense of responsibility, he said with a laugh.",
      "\"It's like, we all know that we're the most meaningful people in our mom's life, so let's all help out,\" he said.",

      "\"What China is doing is holding back products essential for industrial supply chains in India and Europe,\" Bessent said. \"That is not what a reliable partner does.\"",
      "Retailers, however, have sounded the alarm about the ripple effects of the ongoing U.S.-China trade standoff. Walmart, Best Buy, and Target have warned that high tariffs on imports from Asia could drive up prices for American consumers.",
      "Bessent addressed such warnings as speculative, highlighting companies who have opted not to raise prices.",
      "\"I know what Home Depot and Amazon are saying,\" he said. \"They're not raising prices. There's a wide aperture here. Different companies are doing different things. They are making decisions based on their customers, what they think they're able to pass along to their customers, what they want to do to keep their customers.\"",
      "Asked whether the administration has identified sectors where Americans will feel the impact most, Bessent pointed to easing food and energy prices, and insisted that overall inflation is falling. \"Egg prices have collapsed,\" he said, crediting the administration's economic council and trade policies. Although egg prices have come down from the highest levels earlier this year, the Consumer Price Index showed in May that egg prices are still 49% higher than they were in May 2024.",
      "Despite industry concerns, Bessent argued Sunday that companies often offer worst-case scenarios on earnings calls to shield themselves from legal risk.",
      "\"They have to give the worst case,\" he said. \"Because if they haven't, and something bad happens, then they'll be sued.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump announced Friday he'll double steel tariffs from 25% to 50% during a visit at a U.S. Steel mill in the Pittsburgh area.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump announced that he would be doubling tariffs on steel to 50% as he visited a U.S. Steel mill in the Pittsburgh suburbs Friday, a week after teasing a \"planned partnership\" between the company and its Japanese competitor Nippon Steel.",
      "\"We are going to be imposing a 25% increase. We're going to bring it from 25% to 50% the tariffs on steel into the United States of America, which will even further secure the steel industry in the United States,\" he said.",
      "Mr. Trump later noted\u00a0on his Truth Social platform that the increase would also be applied to aluminum, and would take effect on June 4.",
      "The Nippon deal will allow U.S. Steel's headquarters to remain in Pennsylvania, according to Mr. Trump, who characterized the agreement last Sunday as \"an investment\" and \"partial ownership\" that will be \"controlled\" by the United States. The administration, however, has released few details about the deal.",
      "\"We're here today to celebrate a blockbuster agreement that will ensure this storied American company stays an American company,\" Mr. Trump said Friday.",
      "Mr. Trump's announcement last week was the latest twist in Nippon's yearslong effort to acquire U.S. Steel. Its nearly $15 billion bid to buy U.S. Steel was blocked by former President Joe Biden in January on national security grounds.",
      "Mr. Trump, who opposed the acquisition during the 2024 campaign, has since warmed to a deal between the steel producers, touting a $14 billion investment that the president said would \"create and save over 100,000 American jobs.\"",
      "\"You're going to be very happy,\" Mr. Trump said Friday. \"There's a lot of money coming your way.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said the deal includes \"vital protections to ensure that all steel workers will keep their jobs and all facilities in the United States will remain open and thriving.\" He added that U.S. Steel would also keep all of its blast furnace facilities at full capacity for at least the next decade and vowed that there would be \"no layoffs and no outsourcing whatsoever.\" Every worker at U.S. Steel would soon be receiving a $5,000 bonus as well, he said.",
      "Mr. Trump said he approved a deal after the persistence of Nippon, whose offer kept getting \"better and better\" each time the company made another proposal.",
      "Later Friday night, after returning from his visit, Mr. Trump told reporters he has to approve the final deal with Nippon, and that \"we haven't seen that final deal yet.\"",
      "Sen. David McCormick, a Pennsylvania Republican, provided more details on the agreement in an interview with CNBC on Tuesday, saying that U.S. Steel would have an American CEO and a majority of its board members will be from the U.S., an arrangement that was also part of the deal rejected by Biden.",
      "McCormick did raise one potential difference in the latest iteration, stating that the U.S. would have a golden share.",
      "\"It's a national security agreement that will be signed with the U.S. government,\" McCormick said. \"There'll be a golden share, which will essentially require U.S. government approval of a number of the board members and that will allow the United States to ensure production levels aren't cut.\"",
      "McCormick said Nippon will have \"certainly members of the board, and this will be part of their overall corporate structure.\"",
      "\"They wanted an opportunity to get access to the U.S. market \u2014 this allowed them to do so and get the economic benefit of that,\" McCormick said of Nippon. \"They've negotiated it, it was their proposal.\"",
      "It is not yet clear whether the golden share provision involves any U.S. ownership of the merged companies.",
      "The United Steelworkers union has opposed a sale, arguing that the Japanese company is making \"flashy promises\" that put American jobs at risk.",
      "In a statement Friday, union president David McCall said the group was not included or consulted in the discussions \"so we cannot speculate about the meaning of the 'planned partnership' between USS and Nippon or the 'golden share' that some politicians have claimed will be issued to the federal government.\"",
      "\"There is a vast difference between public relations and putting commitments in writing, just as there is a vast difference between allowing shareholders and executives to cash-out and putting workers' interests first,\" he said. \"Any final deal that may emerge from discussions between the merger parties and the federal government must be viewed through that lens, and not the lens of wishful thinking that has been adopted by far too many politicians and others.\"",
      "But without an acquisition, U.S. Steel had warned last year that the company would \"largely pivot away\" from its blast furnace facilities, which would put thousands of jobs in jeopardy. The company said the future of its headquarters in Pittsburgh was also uncertain without an agreement.",

    "story": [
      "Las Vegas \u2014 The \"Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas\" sign is usually the first stop for millions of tourists. But the line to snap a photo is noticeably shorter this spring as inflation, which has brought on higher prices for visitors, has hit \"Sin City\" hard.",
      "\"We were here last year, almost exactly the same time,\" John Fischer, who is visiting from the United Kingdom, told CBS News. \"And it was probably 20% more [expensive] this year.\"",
      "U.K. tourist Stuart Woodfall said he was surprised to pay $9 for a coffee.",
      "\"In the U.K., we pay 4 pounds, 5 pounds for a coffee? So yeah, crazy,\" Woodfall said.",
      "Those higher prices haven't stopped convention traffic, but casual trips are down. The Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority said 3.39 million people visited in March, down 7.8% from the same time last year. April saw a 5.1% drop in visitors from April 2024.",
      "Hotel occupancy also slipped, as the average nightly rate on the Las Vegas Strip reached $203 in April, the LVCVA said, up from $194 at the same time last year. The hotel occupancy rate rate in April was 84.5%, down slightly from 85.5% in April of 2024.",
      "\"I think what's driving that largely now is just a drop in consumer confidence,\" Steve Hill, CEO and president of the LVCVA, told CBS News.",
      "Hill says big resorts can absorb a few empty rooms if the price is right.",
      "\"The philosophy in Las Vegas prior to the pandemic was, at any cost, fill a room,\" Hill said. \"Now, that has moderated somewhat. And so there is a balance point that they have found that is actually a little bit below the occupancy that we saw at a peak, which was about 88% in 2019. They're comfortable in that 85% range at a little higher price.\"",
      "Another sore spot is that Las Vegas is seeing fewer international visitors, Hill explains. They are the ones who generally tend to stay longer and spend more.",
      "\"It's an investment in a trip, and we're typically a bucket list,\" Hill said. \"They want to come here, spend more days, really enjoy the experiences that are here. And so when we lose them, we're losing a very valuable customer.\"",
      "Tourists who do roll the dice in Vegas are currently dealing with heavy vehicle traffic. Months of construction and road closures for special events can turn a 10-minute ride into a crawl on the Strip.",
      "\"We've had so many customers say, 'We're never coming back to this city, you can't get anywhere,'\" said Will Tryon, co-owner of Adventure Photo Tours, which he operates with his wife Donna Tryon. Their company does tours in the surrounding region, including the Grand Canyon, Area 51, Zion National Park and Death Valley.",
      "The couple said higher fuel and insurance costs leave little room to cut prices. Some tours priced at $75 before the COVID-19 pandemic are now $109.",
      "\"The economy, the money, they don't have the money to spend,\" Donna told CBS News. \"And the fact is that Las Vegas is no longer a bargain vacation.\"",
      "Even so, plenty of visitors are still shelling out for hot tickets like Dead & Company's residency at the Sphere this spring, and Beyonc\u00e9's Cowboy Carter Tour, which is coming to Allegiant Stadium in July.",
      "\"It's like, you can go for the fancy experience, but then you can find a place that's a pretty good price,\" said Marc Kutzin, who is visiting from New York.",
      "The summer calendar is full of concerts, festivals and sporting events, and Hill believes the city will be resilient.",

    "summary": "President Trump has a number of options at his disposal to implement tariffs, but none are as broad and aggressive as IEEPA.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration could pursue alternative pathways for imposing tariffs after a federal court this week struck down its use of emergency powers to enact broad levies on U.S. trading partners, according to experts.",
      "At risk is much of Mr. Trump's trade agenda, which relies on tariffs as a way to secure better terms of trade, boost the U.S. manufacturing sector and generate what he claims could be trillions in new federal revenue. For now, Mr. Trump's tariffs remain in place after a federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., on Thursday temporarily halted the decision,\u00a0reinstating the levies.",
      "If the trade court's ruling is ultimately upheld, Mr. Trump has other tools for pursuing his trade agenda, although they don't provide the broader authority of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), which he tapped to authorize trade duties on almost every foreign nation.",
      "\"He would have a couple other authorities. However, they are not nearly as broad and aggressive as the IEEPA tariffs,\" said Clark Packard, a research fellow in the Herbert A. Stiefel Center for Trade Policy Studies at the Cato Institute, a nonpartisan public policy institute. \"There are so many checks and administrative aspects to them that they are slower.\"",
      "Mr. Trump announced his tariffs on April 2 in an initiative he referred to as\u00a0\"Liberation Day.\" At the time, the president described trade deficits with other nations as \"a national emergency,\" which he said gave him the authority to impose tariffs under IEEPA.",
      "But a lawsuit filed by five U.S.-based companies and a group of 12 states challenged the president's use of the emergency powers law, and on Wednesday the Court of International Trade\u00a0blocked the tariffs.",
      "President will use \"tools at his disposal\"",
      "As the legal process plays out, Trump administration officials say the president is considering using other tools at his disposal to advance his trade policies.",
      "\"The Trump administration remains committed to addressing our country's national emergencies of drug trafficking and historic trade deficits with every legal authority conferred to the President in the Constitution and by Congress,\" White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement to CBS News on Thursday.",
      "Desai added, \"Regardless of the developments of this litigation, the President will continue to use all tools at his disposal to advance trade policy that works for all Americans.\"",
      "Here are the other options Mr. Trump could turn to, and how he could use them, according to policy experts.",
      "Section 232 tariffs of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962",
      "Experts say Mr. Trump could turn to Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which allows the U.S. president to restrict imports in the name of national security. Mr. Trump already has tariffs in place on steel, aluminum and auto imports based on this regulation.",
      "There's a catch, though. The statute requires the Department of Commerce, in consultation with the Department of Defense, to investigate and confirm that imports \"threaten to impair\" U.S. national security before the president can invoke Section 232. An investigation can take up to 270 days, which could slow down Mr. Trump's timeline for imposing tariffs.",
      "\"It has to withstand legal scrutiny, it can't just be done over the weekend,\" Packard said.",
      "Additionally, under Section 232, tariffs can only be applied to specific sectors if the trade around those imports threaten national security, rather than the broad approach that Mr. Trump used with IEEPA.",
      "\"Once the report is issued, the president has wide discretion, but he has to target individual sectors of product, like steel and aluminum,\" Packard said. \"They can't be blanket, across-the-board tariffs.\"",
      "Some experts think Mr. Trump is likely to turn to this statute to further his tariff agenda.",
      "\"In our view, the administration will prepare the groundwork for a more surgical increase in tariffs beginning this summer following Section 232 trade investigations into strategic industries like pharmaceuticals, critical minerals, lumber, copper and semiconductors,\" Kurt Reiman, head of fixed income Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, said in a research note.",
      "He added, \"These sectors were initially excluded from the 10% baseline tariff because President Trump had intended to levy separate tariffs to reduce the U.S.'s reliance on foreign producers of these products by encouraging domestic production.\"",
      "Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974",
      "Mr. Trump could also draw on the Trade Act of 1974 to impose new tariffs. Section 301 of that law allows the U.S. president to apply county-based tariffs at a rate of his choosing if the U.S. Trade Representative determines that another country is engaging in unfair foreign trade practices.",
      "There are limitations, however. The law can't be applied universally to all imports from foreign nations.",
      "\"There has to be justification for it, so President Trump can't unilaterally decide to impose broad-based tariffs on the entire world,\" Angela Santos, a partner and customs practice leader at law firm ArentFox Schiff told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974",
      "Additionally, Mr. Trump could use Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974, which is designed to address large trade deficits with other nations, to impose tariffs of up to 15% for a maximum of 150 days.",
      "\"I could see this being employed very easily,\" Santos said. \"It seems like the easiest way to impose tariffs, particularly because most trade partners have large deficits with the U.S.\"",
      "Applying tariffs under Section 122 wouldn't require an investigation, meaning Mr. Trump could quickly use it to assess a broad-based import duty.",
      "\"The administration could quickly replace the 10% across-the-board tariff with a similar tariff of up to 15% under Sec. 122,\" Goldman Sachs analysts wrote in a report this week.",

      "What we know about the bitcoin torture case",
      "The unidentified 28-year-old man managed to escape from his alleged captors on May 23 in the affluent SoHo neighborhood in Manhattan, according to the New York Police Department. Bloodied and not wearing shoes, the man then found an NYPD traffic agent, who alerted police, according to the Manhattan district attorney's office.",
      "Two cryptocurrency investors, 37-year-old John Woeltz and 33-year-old William Duplessie, have been charged with kidnapping, assault and unlawful imprisonment in the case. They're being held without bail. Attorneys for the suspects have declined to comment on the case.",
      "When investigators went through the SoHo town house where the man said he was held, they found a saw, crack cocaine, chicken wire, body armor, night-vision goggles, pictures of the man with a gun pointed to his head and ammunition, according to prosecutors.",
      "Woeltz, who is originally from Kentucky, was arrested when police went to the town house. Prosecutors said the large house has eight bedrooms and that Woeltz had the means to flee the jurisdiction if granted bail, with access to a private jet and a helicopter.",
      "Duplessie turned himself in to police on May 27, the NYPD said. His attorney said in court that Duplessie's involvement in the case is hotly disputed and he decided to turn himself in when he found out about Woeltz's arrest, CBS News New York reported.",
      "The Italian man arrived at the town house on May 6, according to prosecutors. The suspects are accused of previously threatening to have the man's family killed unless he paid them in bitcoin, and the suspects allegedly lured him to New York with an offer to return the bitcoin to him in person, prosecutors said.",
      "The suspects then allegedly held the man captive for over two weeks as they tried to get him to give up the password for his bitcoin wallet.",
      "During that time, the suspects are accused of shocking the man with electric wires, hitting him on the head with a gun and pointing a gun at his head several times, prosecutors said. An AirTag tracking device was tied around the man's neck, and the suspects allegedly told him they would find him if he left the house.",
      "Prosecutors also said the suspects allegedly hanged the man over the ledge of the building and threatened to kill him if he didn't give up his password. The suspects also allegedly threatened to have the man's family killed if he didn't give them what they wanted, prosecutors said.",
      "The man told authorities the suspects cut his leg with a saw, forced him to smoke crack cocaine and urinated on him during his captivity, according to prosecutors.",
      "\"To be tortured for 17 days in terms of a chain saw cutting your leg, in terms of putting your feet in water and electrocuting him, in terms of making the person ingest narcotics, horrible crime,\" NYPD Chief of Department John Chell, the police department's highest-ranking uniformed member, told CBS News New York.",
      "The man escaped after telling Woeltz he would give him the password, but it was on his laptop, prosecutors said. When Woeltz went to get the laptop, the man went downstairs and bolted from the house.",
      "Police sources told CBS News New York that two NYPD detectives did private security work for the suspects, but there isn't any indication that the detectives knew about the alleged kidnapping. One of the detectives picked up the Italian man at an airport and brought him to the SoHo town house, two sources told CBS News New York.",
      "The detectives were placed on desk duty May 28 and had their guns and badges taken from them pending an internal affairs investigation into the off-duty work, which the NYPD said wasn't authorized.",

      "\"Every city employee is expected to follow the law, including our officers, both on and off duty,\" Kayla Mamelak Altus, Adams' press secretary, said in a statement. \"We are disturbed by these allegations, and as soon as it came to our attention, the officers were placed on modified duty.\"",

    "story": [
      "A key U.S. inflation gauge slowed last month as President Donald Trump's tariffs have yet to noticeably push up prices. Spending by Americans slowed despite rising incomes, potentially an early reaction to higher prices on some imported goods.",
      "Friday's report from the Commerce Department showed that consumer prices rose just 2.1% in April compared with a year earlier, down from 2.3% in March and the lowest since September. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core prices rose 2.5% from a year earlier, below the March figure of 2.7%, and the lowest in more than four years. Economists track core prices because they typically provide a better read on where inflation is headed.",
      "The figures show inflation is still declining from its post-pandemic spike, which reached the highest level in four decades in July 2022. Economists and some business executives have warned that prices will likely head higher as Trump's widespread tariffs take effect, though the timing and impact of those duties are now in doubt after they were struck down late Wednesday in court, only to be temporarily reinstated by a federal appeals court in Washington, D.C.",
      "On a monthly basis, overall prices and core prices both increased just 0.1% from March to April. The cost of big-ticket manufactured goods rose a hefty 0.5%, though that increase was offset by a 0.1 decline in other goods, such as groceries. The cost of services rose just 0.1% from March to April.",
      "Americans cool off on spending",
      "The big increase in durable goods prices could reflect the early impact of tariffs. Americans also cut back their spending on longer-lasting factory goods in April, the report showed.",
      "Overall consumer spending \u2014 which includes spending on services \u2014 rose 0.2% in April from March, the report said, but that's down from a big 0.7% rise in March.",
      "The slowdown in spending could reflect some early caution on the part of consumers, economists said, in response to higher goods prices. It also suggests that some of the spending jump in March reflected consumers purchasing items like cars to get in front of the impact of tariffs.",
      "\" This is unsurprising, given the implementation of tariffs,\" Harry Chambers, assistant economist at Capital Economics said in a research note. \"While tariffs may have started to weigh on consumers, this is far from a disaster,\" he added.",
      "\"The pulling forward of consumer spending ahead of the tariff increases will continue to dampen household spending in the coming months, especially as they face higher prices and a softening labor market,\" Kathy Bostjancic, chief economist at Nationwide, said in an email. \"We anticipate that the improved inflation trend will reverse in the second half of the year as companies are forced to begin passing along a portion of the increased tariffs in order to protect profit margins.\"",
      "Walmart executives said earlier this month that the retail giant would increase prices for many products in May and June to account for the tariffs, while electronics chain Best Buy's CEO Corie Barry said Thursday the company is increasing some prices as well because of the duties, as a \"last resort.\"",
      "At the same time, incomes \u2014 before adjusting for inflation \u2014 rose a healthy 0.8% in April. Much of that gain reflected an increase in Social Security benefits as a result of the Social Security Fairness Act. The law signed in January by\u00a0former President Biden, granted retroactive benefits for some retired teachers, fire fighters, and federal workers whose incomes previously weren't fully counted toward Social Security benefits because they have pensions.",
      "The inflation-fighters at the Federal Reserve said at their most recent meeting May 6-7 that inflation is still elevated, compared with their target of 2%. Fed officials, who focus more on core prices, broadly support keeping their key interest rate steady while they evaluate the impact of the tariffs on inflation and jobs.",

      "But the duties were allowed to remain in effect while the Trump administration appeals the ruling against them. And administration officials say they will find other legal authorities, if needed, to implement the tariffs. As a result, what tariffs will end up in place and for how long remains highly uncertain.",

      "Mondelez International, the company behind Oreo, Wheat Thins and other name-brand products, says Aldi is copying its packaging in an effort to dupe customers into buying the supermarket chain's products.",
      "In a federal lawsuit filed Tuesday in Illinois, the snack company alleges that Aldi \"blatantly copies\" the distinctive packaging of its brands in order to mislead customers into thinking they are buying a Mondelez product when they are actually purchasing a store-brand version. The company is seeking monetary damages and a court order that would prevent Aldi from selling products Mondelez says infringe on its trademarks.",
      "Neither Aldi nor Mondelez immediately responded to CBS News' requests for comment.",
      "Mondelez names a number of Aldi products in its lawsuit that it alleges are look-alikes of its own popular snacks such as Oreo, Chips Ahoy, Wheat Thins, Nilla Wafers cookies and Nabisco Premium Saltine Crackers. The company claims the Aldi store-brand items have different names but bear similar packaging design elements \u2014 including font, colors, image placement and product names \u2014 to Mondelez products.",
      "Aldi's Peanut Butter Creme Filled Cookies, for example, come in a red box, similar to that of Mondelez's Nutter Butter cookies. The white script font and cookie image on the packaging also mimic the Nutter Butter packaging, the snack company claims.",
      "Aldi also sells a product called Thin Wheat, which in addition to the nearly synonymous name to Nabisco's Wheat Thins, has a similar design to the Mondelez product, including a yellow background, the word \"original\" and crackers pictured on the bottom half of the box, the lawsuit says.",

    "summary": "A rash of attacks on cryptocurrency owners is combining cybercrime with old-fashioned thuggery, experts say.",
    "story": [
      "The recent case of an Italian tourist who was kidnapped in New York City and tortured by people allegedly after his cryptocurrency is drawing attention to a rash of crimes dubbed \"wrench attacks,\" which combine cybertheft with old-fashioned thuggery.",
      "The term stems from an XKCD comic that depicts a \"crypto nerd's imagination\" of the tech know-how that would be required to break into their digital wallet. In reality, the comic notes, all it would take is a heavy $5 wrench to threaten the crypto owner until they revealed their account password.",
      "Such attacks have picked up in recent months, partly because stealing a digital wallet can be easier than stealing money from a traditional bank account, said Ari Redbord, global head of policy and government affairs at TRM Labs, a crypto tracing firm. On top of that, the value of bitcoin has surged in recent months, making people with crypto holdings potentially lucrative targets for criminals.",
      "\"Criminals go to where the money is, and we're seeing a huge rise in the price of bitcoin,\" Redbord said. \"Before, you needed sophisticated cyber capabilities to hack someone, but now you can be a violent criminal who can beat [the password] out of someone.\"",
      "He added, \"I don't think I've ever been as taken aback by this type of illicit activity in crypto.\"",
      "The crypto world also has a culture of flaunting wealth via social media posts or appearances at crypto conference, which allows criminals to easily identify potential targets.",
      "Bitcoin traded Friday at nearly $105,000 per token, according to CoinDesk \u2014 about 53% higher than a year ago. The digital currency has soared partly as people seek alternatives to put their money than traditional investments like stocks and bonds, and as the Trump administration takes steps to promote the use of cryptocurrencies, including establishing a \"strategic crypto reserve.\"",
      "How to crack a wallet",
      "Cryptocurrency thefts aren't new, but they've typically involved hacking, such as a massive 2022 hack at crypto exchange Binance\u00a0in which thieves initially stole $570 million, as well as multiple hacks by entities the United Nations found were linked to North Korea.",
      "In response to such threats, crypto owners often try and keep their private keys off the internet and stored in what are called \"cold wallets.\" When used properly, such wallets can defeat even the most sophisticated and determined hackers.",
      "But criminals have realized they don't need any technical skills to steal crypto assets, Redbord said. All it takes is gaining access to a person's crypto account password, because there's no third-party financial institution standing in the way of accessing funds held in a digital wallet, he explained.",
      "Transactions on the blockchain, the technology that powers cryptocurrencies, are permanent. And unlike cash, jewelry, gold or other items of value, thieves don't need to carry around stolen crypto. With a few clicks, huge amounts of wealth can be transferred from one address to another.",
      "NYC crypto kidnapping",
      "The case in New York City is somewhat unusual because it involves crypto investors allegedly trying to steal the assets of another investor, Redbord said.",
      "In that case, investors John Woeltz, 37, and William Duplessie, 33, face\u00a0charges of kidnapping, assault and unlawful imprisonment of the Italian tourist in an effort to steal his digital wallet containing bitcoin worth millions of dollars. Court papers allege that the pair held the unidentified 28-year-old victim for weeks in an apartment in New York City's fashionable Soho neighborhood.",
      "After the victim was abducted, he was shocked with electric wires, his leg was cut with a saw and he was forced to smoke crack cocaine, prosecutors allege. Items including a photo of a gun held to the Italian tourist's head were found in the apartment by investigators.",
      "Two New York City police detectives had been working security for the accused kidnappers, CBS News New York has reported. The detective have been placed on desk duty as police investigate.",
      "Such incidents have also occurred with increasing frequency in Europe and Asia. Several cases in France have mirrored the New York City attack, with French police arresting 20 people following several alleged kidnapping plots involving crypto investors and their families, the BBC reported earlier this week.",
      "In one case, a gang allegedly tried to kidnap the daughter and young grandson of a cryptocurrency company executive in Paris, while earlier this month the father of a crypto millionaire was rescued by police in Paris after he was kidnapped and held for ransom.",
      "Aside from keeping a lower profile, crypto investors can take other steps to make it tougher for criminals, Redbord said. One option is to require permissions from several people to access a wallet, for instance.",
      "In the meantime, criminals are taking note and may be pursuing similar crimes, he added. \"They are seeing successes and trying to replicate these successes,\" Redbord said.",

      "Counselors who work with foreign students eager to attend college in the U.S. are advising them to purge their social media accounts of posts that could attract the attention of U.S. State Department officials.",
      "\"Any new student who comes on board \u2014 especially an international student who doesn't have a U.S. passport \u2014 we would be going through their social media with them and talk to them about what they are saying on Snapchat, in group chats,\" said Kat Cohen, founder and CEO of IvyWise, an educational consultancy firm for college admissions. \"Because, if the information comes off as being radical or anti-American in some way, it is not going to help them.\"",
      "The focus on international students' online profiles follows a new push by the Trump administration to scrutinize social media accounts as part of the evaluation process for student visa applications. In a cable dated May 27 and obtained by CBS News, the State Department said it was preparing to expand social media screening and vetting. The agency did not specify exactly what type of content it would be looking for.",
      "\"President Trump will always put the safety of Americans first, and it is a privilege, not a right, to study in the United States,\" White House spokesperson Anna Kelly said in a statement. \"Enhanced social media vetting is a commonsense measure that will help ensure that guests in our country are not planning to harm Americans, which is a national security priority.\"",
      "The new vetting measures build upon an April\u00a0statement\u00a0from United States Citizenship and Immigration Services announcing that the agency will be taking into account \"antisemitic activity on social media\" as \"grounds for denying immigration benefit requests.\"",
      "No politics",
      "Advisers who cater to international students applying to U.S. schools told CBS Moneywatch they are reluctant to advise them to delete their social media accounts outright. But they are urging students to eliminate political-themed posts, especially if they relate to controversial topics such as the wars in Gaza and Ukraine. IvyWise also discourages foreign students from reposting any information they haven't verified themselves, given that it might be inaccurate.",
      "\"We don't think students should delete their social media accounts completely,\" Cohen said. \"But we do need to make sure we go through their social media accounts with them to make sure that they are presenting themselves in the best possible light.\"",
      "Mandee Heller Adler, founder of International College Counselors, also recommends that students weed out potentially controversial posts, including any opinions or content related to politics.",
      "\"I'm not saying that they have to get rid of the whole thing altogether, but certainly delete any political posts,\" Adler told CBS MoneyWatch. \"This is kind of an easy way for kids to protect themselves.\"",
      "Sasha Chada, who has led Texas-based college admissions counseling group Ivy Scholars for over a decade, said that asking students to delete their social media would be a \"tall order\" given how deeply ingrained the platforms are in their lives. People aged 18 to 24, for example, make up the largest share of Instagram users worldwide, at 32%, according to Sprout Social, a social media management platform.",
      "Chilling effect?",
      "Some critics think the State Department's scrutiny of international students' social accounts will inhibit their freedom of expression.",
      "\"While social media vetting of visa applicants isn't new, should the administration's 'expanded vetting' consider political viewpoints, it will certainly scare some would-be applicants into silencing themselves on any topic they feel might contradict the views of President Trump, or his successors,\" said Robert Shibley, special counsel at the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, which promotes free speech on college campuses.",
      "The State Department did not respond to CBS MoneyWatch's request for comment. \"We take very seriously the process of vetting who it is that comes into the country, and we're going to continue to do that,\" State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce told reporters this week, when asked about student visas.",
      "Mahsa Khanbabai, an immigration attorney based in Massachusetts whose firm assists with student visas, said she has spoken to dozens of foreign students \u2014 both overseas and in the U.S. \u2014 some of whom have decided to delete their social media accounts or change them from public to private for protection.",
      "Students, she said, are not just concerned about posts on political flashpoints like Gaza, but also their personal views on topics like climate change and reproductive rights advocacy. Recent consultations Khanbabai has had with foreign students have been focused, she said, on helping them determine how strongly they feel about publicizing their views, and giving them a sense of the potential trade-offs when deciding to post or not to post.",
      "\"I meet with students to ask them, 'Are you willing to pause engagement on social media to achieve longer-term goals like your career and education, knowing that in the short term you're ultimately kind of maybe sacrificing some of your ethical or moral values?'\" she said.",

      "The median sale price for a home in the first-quarter of 2025 was over $400,000,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Mortgage rates, meanwhile, continue to hover around 7% \u2014 up from a record low of 2.65% in January 2021. Moody's decision to downgrade the U.S.' credit rating briefly\u00a0pushed rates\u00a0above the 7% threshold earlier this month.",
      "While homebuyers cannot control median home prices and mortgage rates, their choice of city or town to buy in can play a defining role in how much they end up spending on a property. Certain locales will offer more affordable listings and a wider range of options to choose from \u2014 giving buyers something to think about as they decide where to make their next investment.",
      "A recent\u00a0study from SmartAsset ranks the best cities for first-time buyers \u2014 providing a cheat sheet of sorts for those on the hunt for a new home. The financial technology company looked at 180 U.S. cities and ranked their appeal for first-time buyers based on affordability, available housing inventory, demand and how much home prices are expected to shift in the area over the next year.",
      "Here is a breakdown of the cities that will give first-time homebuyers the best bang for their buck.",
      "Best place to buy overall",
      "McAllen, Texas, located on the state's southern tip, claimed the No. 1 spot on SmartAsset's list. A major selling point for the border city is that housing prices are forecast to change just 0.4% over the next year, meaning that buyers can rest assured the market won't fluctuate too wildly as they search for the right home.",
      "The median sale price for homes in McAllen \u2014 $204,499 \u2014 is about four times as much as the median local income, giving buyers more moderate wiggle room when it comes to affordability.",
      "Best in affordability",
      "When looking solely at affordability \u2014 the median sale price of a home relative to the median local income \u2014 Midwestern metro areas reign. Illinois cities Peoria and Decatur top the ranking in affordability, according to SmartAsset. Other locales house hunters may want to keep an eye on include Cedar Rapids, Iowa; Davenport, Iowa; Muncie, Indiana; Springfield, Illinois; and St. Joseph, Missouri, which are among the least expensive metro areas, according to the study.",
      "While Midwestern cities ranked higher in affordability than others, only Lawton, Oklahoma, where homes have a median sale price of $150,007, made it into SmartAsset's top 10 cities for first-time homebuyers overall.",
      "Best place for expanded inventory",
      "One of biggest issues plaguing the housing market is the limited supply of homes for sale While studies show\u00a0that the inventory of available properties is rising in many markets, some metro areas are still suffering from\u00a0shortages, which increases competition and prices for homebuyers.",
      "If you're looking for more robust inventory, you may want to consider heading south. Cape Coral, Florida, offers the greatest number of homes for sale per capita, according to SmartAsset, followed by Port St. Lucie, Florida.",

      "Summer begins with Americans' economy ratings continuing to get a bit brighter than they were this winter \u2014 though still not good \u2014 with their outlook more mixed. But feelings of financial concern and stress are more prevalent than feelings of being secure.",
      "With a big majority still saying their incomes don't keep pace with inflation, prices and finances of course play a big role in how Americans decide what their summer plans will be. And that, too, helps define two different outlooks heading into the season.",
      "Slightly more Americans say they'll take a vacation this summer than report taking one in 2024. Most likely to take a vacation are the just-over half who say they're at least doing OK financially and can keep up with expenses. (For the higher income earners among them especially, summer will also involve travel.)",
      "But for those who say their finances are not good, it continues to be largely because of prices and incomes not keeping up with inflation. They're largely forgoing any vacation or travel.",
      "In all, feelings about finances span a range and most report feeling things from stress and concern to security and optimism at least once in a while. But Americans describe feeling concern or stress even more often these days, rather than feeling secure or content. That's especially the case among those whose personal financial situation isn't good.",

      "In a different study consumer confidence was also reported to have rebounded lately.",
      "Those in comparably lower income levels report feeling stress about finances more often. Stress and concern go up with feeling less secure in a job (for those employed.) Concern about monthly ability to pay for food and groceries is strongly associated with more frequent feelings of stress. Conversely, feelings of being secure or optimistic financially are linked to confidence in being able to save, buy extras and pay for the basics.",
      "People for whom the stock market matters to their finances report less frequent feelings of stress. The market has had volatility over recent months, but those invested also have higher incomes, and report less concern about paying for day to day items to begin with.",

      "For the just over half of Americans who say their financial situation is good, most plan to take a vacation of some form this summer, and most of those will also involve travel.",
      "Large majorities, often even if their finances are ok, say their incomes are not keeping pace with inflation, and this generally hasn't changed over time.",
      "For the bulk of people who do travel, summer means a road trip. It's far and away the main way they'll travel. (Though on balance, people who say their financial situation is bad say they'll take fewer car trips than last summer.)",

      "Washington \u2014 A federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., on Thursday temporarily halted a federal trade court's decision blocking most of President Trump's sweeping tariffs, for now reinstating the levies imposed by the president under an emergency powers law.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit said in a brief order that it would grant the Trump administration's request for an immediate administrative stay \"to the extent that the judgments and the permanent injunctions entered by the Court of International Trade in these cases are temporarily stayed\" for now.",
      "A three-judge panel on the trade court unanimously ruled Wednesday that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977, which Mr. Trump invoked to impose the levies, did not give the president the authority to set unlimited tariffs on imports from nearly every foreign nation.",
      "The U.S. Court of International Trade permanently blocked Mr. Trump's 10% tariff assessed on virtually every U.S. trading partner, as well as the president's duties on imports from Mexico, Canada and China, which the president had imposed in response to what he said was the trafficking of drugs into the U.S. The judges had given the Trump administration 10 days to put their permanent injunction in effect.",
      "\"IEEPA does not authorize any of the Worldwide, Retaliatory, or Trafficking Tariff Orders,\" the trade court found. \"The Worldwide and Retaliatory Tariff Orders exceed any authority granted to the president by IEEPA to regulate importation by means of tariffs.\"",
      "The Justice Department asked the Federal Circuit to review the trade court's decision and also requested it halt that ruling while it considers the appeal. The administration warned in a filing Thursday that absent interim relief, it would turn to the Supreme Court \"to avoid the irreparable national-security and economic harms at stake.\"",
      "In a statement provided to CBS News, White House spokesperson Kush Desai called Thursday's ruling \"a positive development for America's industries and workers.\"",
      "\"The Trump administration remains committed to addressing our country's national emergencies of drug trafficking and historic trade deficits with every legal authority conferred to the President in the Constitution and by Congress,\" Desai said. \"Regardless of the developments of this litigation, the President will continue to use all tools at his disposal to advance trade policy that works for all Americans.\"",
      "In its brief order, the Federal Circuit gave the two sets of plaintiffs \u2014 five U.S.-based companies and a group of 12 states \u2014 until June 5 to response to the Trump administration's request for a stay. The appeals court has agreed to consider the pair of cases together.",
      "The decision from the U.S. Court of International Trade was a significant setback for Mr. Trump's economic agenda, a centerpiece of which are his tariffs. The president has argued that the duties are crucial to returning manufacturing jobs to the U.S. and will raise more than $1 trillion in revenue. Mr. Trump has also used the tariffs and the threat of higher rates as leverage to force trade partners into negotiations.",
      "The president rolled out his 10% tariffs, as well as a set of now-paused \"reciprocal\" tariffs, in April on what the White House dubbed \"Liberation Day.\"",
      "But the president's tariffs have shaken financial markets and sparked fears of an economic downturn. Mr. Trump has also halted some of the duties, including the \"reciprocal\" tariffs on 57 trading partners.",
      "Mr. Trump's use of IEEPA to impose tariffs led to more than half-a-dozen lawsuits from states and businesses impacted by the duties. The plaintiffs argued that the president did not have the authority to unilaterally slap the tariffs on trading partners under the IEEPA, which has never before been used in that way.",
      "The three judges on the U.S. Court of International Trade agreed, writing in their decision that it \"does not read IEEPA to confer such unbounded authority.\"",
      "In a separate dispute brought by two Illinois-based toy companies, U.S. District Judge Rudolph Contreras ruled that Mr. Trump's tariffs imposed under the emergency powers law are unlawful.",
      "Contreras\u00a0found that IEEPA\u00a0\"does not authorize the president to impose the tariffs set forth\" in his executive orders and barred the Trump administration from collecting any tariff deriving from them from the two companies. The judge paused his order for 14 days to give the Justice Department time to appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which the administration has said it will do.",
      "The case, Contreras wrote in a\u00a033-page decision, \"is about whether IEEPA enables the president to unilaterally impose, revoke, pause, reinstate, and adjust tariffs to reorder the global economy. The court agrees with plaintiffs that it does not.\"",

      "The findings come as many Americans are feeling more financially stressed, with a separate study from Primerica finding that about half of middle-class households expect to be worse off financially in 2026, almost double the share in December, due to worries about the cost of living and the economy. Taking small steps to build an emergency savings account could prove to help alleviate financial anxiety, noted Paulo Costa, a behavioral economist and certified financial planner at Vanguard who co-authored the research.",
      "\"What's so powerful about this research is that it's not about gathering a lot of money to have that peace of mind,\" Costa told CBS MoneyWatch. \"That initial $2,000 makes a big difference.\"",
      "While it may seem that having $1 million in assets should boost financial well-being more than $2,000 in a savings account, the results show the importance of being prepared for an unplanned expense, Costa added. (To be sure, most people in the study had $2,000 in emergency savings \u2014 about 8 in 10 \u2014 versus $1 million in assets, at about 3 in 10.)",
      "The median cost of an emergency is about $2,000, which means having that cash on hand gives people the confidence that they can handle a sudden money stressor, he said.",
      "\"When is $2,000 more than a million dollars? It's when it comes to emergency savings,\" Costa said. \"The point of emergency savings is to have that money readily available if you need it. A lot of people have money, for example, in retirement accounts that may have some requirements about when you can withdraw that money and may have some tax consequences and some penalties.\"",
      "Retirement assets are generally not readily available to cover unexpected expenses, with people younger than 59 1/2 incurring a 10% penalty for taking out money. But having $2,000 set aside in a bank account means that you've got the peace of mind that you'll be able to handle a surprise car repair or medical bill.",
      "And people with $2,000 in emergency savings typically spend about 2 hours less each week thinking about their finances versus those without any savings, the study found.",
      "How many people can handle emergency expenses?",
      "To be sure, obtaining $2,000 in savings could prove out of reach for many Americans, especially those who are low income, struggling with debt or who reside in an area with a high cost of living. Vanguard's survey includes only people who have investment accounts at the company, which signals they have access to 401(k)s and other types of investment accounts that many Americans lack.",
      "Almost 4 in 10 Americans say they don't have the cash on hand to pay for a $400 emergency expense, according to research from the Federal Reserve.",
      "Still, more Americans appear to be socking away money for a rainy day, with the Primerica study finding that 64% of those surveyed in March said they had an emergency fund of at least $1,000, up from 58% two years earlier.",
      "Even if saving $2,000 seems out of reach, you can start small by saving as little as $10 a week, Costa said. The best idea is to find a strategy that works for you, whether that's budgeting or automating savings by directing a certain amount into a dedicated account with each paycheck, he said.",
      "\"I love the idea of, 'out of sight, out of mind,' so when you get paid, you immediately send money to your savings account,\" he said. \"By saving $50 per week, you will build up to $2,000 in less than a year.\"",
      "He added, \"Saving something is better than saving nothing. So just getting started, that really makes a big difference.\"",

    "story": [
      "Republican Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa defended herself Monday after drawing attention for telling a town hall attendee worried about proposed changes to Medicaid that \"we all are going to die.\"",
      "\"I'm very compassionate, and you need to listen to the entire conversation,\" Ernst told CBS News on Monday.",
      "Ernst's now-viral musings on mortality came during a contentious town hall meeting Friday, as attendees grilled the senator about a GOP-backed domestic policy bill that passed the House last month. The legislation \u2014 titled the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, after President Trump referred to the measure that way \u2014 would impose work requirements on some Medicaid recipients, among other changes.",
      "At one point, as Ernst explained some of the legislation's changes to the low-income health insurance program, a person appeared to yell that people will die.",
      "\"People are not \u2014 well, we all are going to die, so for heaven's sakes,\" Ernst responded.",
      "Ernst went on to say that the legislation would \"focus on those that are most vulnerable\" and added, \"those that meet the eligibility requirements for Medicaid we will protect.\"",
      "The senator later dug in and posted a sarcastic apology video to Instagram.",
      "\"I made an incorrect assumption that everyone in the auditorium understood that, yes, we are all going to perish from this Earth. So, I apologize,\" Ernst said in the video. \"I'm really, really glad that I did not have to bring up the subject of the Tooth Fairy as well.\"",
      "The town hall comments drew criticism from some potential opponents of Ernst, who is up for reelection next year. Nathan Sage, who is running for the Democratic nomination for Senate, said Ernst is \"not even trying to hide her contempt for us.\" And Democratic state Rep. JD Scholten announced Monday he's entering the race, saying in an Instagram post he wasn't planning to launch his campaign now but \"can't sit on the sidelines\" after Ernst's town hall.",
      "The House-passed bill would add restrictions to Medicaid, including a work, volunteer or schooling requirement for non-disabled adults without children. The bill would also add more frequent eligibility checks, cut funding for states that use the Medicaid system to cover undocumented immigrants, freeze provider taxes and ban coverage for gender transition services.",
      "The bill's proposed changes to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, better known as food stamps, could save hundreds of billions of dollars, which would help pay for extending Mr. Trump's 2017 tax cuts and boosting border security.",
      "But before it reaches Mr. Trump's desk, the bill still needs to pass the Senate, where some Republicans are pushing to roll back some of the Medicaid cuts. In last week's town hall, Ernst said she agrees with parts of the legislation passed by the House, but \"the bill will be changing.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 02 Jun 2025 19:37:56 -0400",
    "summary": "Another judge has blocked the Trump administration from using the wartime Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan migrants, ruling the government hasn't promised adequate due process.",
    "story": [
      "A judge in California on Monday blocked the Trump administration from using the wartime Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan migrants in the Los Angeles area, ruling that the government hasn't promised adequate due process.",
      "The ruling by U.S. District Judge John Holcomb \u2014 who was nominated by President Trump in 2019 \u2014 is the latest to limit the administration's controversial practice of rapidly deporting people accused of being members of the gang Tren de Aragua under the 1798 law, which allows removals during an \"invasion\" or \"predatory incursion\" of the United States. Courts in three other states have also blocked Alien Enemies Act removals, though under different arguments.",
      "Holcomb's preliminary injunction applies to most migrants who are in custody in the Central District of California, which includes Los Angeles, Orange County and several bordering areas. The judge previously issued a temporary restraining order last month.",
      "The case reached Holcomb's desk after a Venezuelan man named Darwin Antonio Arevalo Millan petitioned for his release last month. Arevalo says he applied for asylum but was arrested at a scheduled Immigration and Customs Enforcement check-in and told he was detained in part due to his tattoos. The government told the court that he wasn't detained under the Alien Enemies Act, but Holcomb concluded that Arevalo still \"faces an imminent threat of removal\" under Mr. Trump's order invoking the law.",
      "Holcomb ruled that Arevalo is likely to succeed in showing the government hasn't provided adequate notice for him to challenge his deportation. The judge said that in a hearing the government \"refused to tell the Court how much notice it actually intends to provide.\"",
      "\"Arevalo seeks to avoid being deported as an alien enemy without being afforded the opportunity to challenge that designation\u2014not to avoid deportation altogether,\" Holcomb wrote.",
      "However, unlike some other federal judges, Holcomb said Arevalo was unlikely to show the Trump administration invoked the Alien Enemies Act illegally. He wrote that it's up to the president, not the court system, to decide whether an invasion or predatory incursion has occurred under the law.",
      "CBS News has reached out to the White House for comment.",
      "Monday's ruling adds to a complicated legal landscape for the Alien Enemies Act since March, when Mr. Trump first invoked the law against people accused of belonging to Tren de Aragua.",
      "Critics say the government has used the law to remove people without adequate due process. Hundreds of Venezuelan deportees have been sent to a Salvadoran supermax prison under the law \u2014 some of whom have no known criminal record. The Trump administration maintains that the deportations are lawful and necessary to crack down on gang violence.",
      "Courts in at least five states have weighed in on the law, reaching different conclusions. Judges in New York, Colorado and Texas have suggested Mr. Trump is using the Alien Enemies Act improperly because Tren de Aragua's actions don't constitute a foreign invasion or incursion. But a judge in Pennsylvania found that the president is allowed to use the law for alleged gang members, though she said the government hasn't provided deportees with enough notice.",
      "Meanwhile, the Supreme Court has not ruled on whether the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act is legal, but it has said the government needs to give people\u00a0a chance to challenge their deportation under the law. Last month, the high court blocked Alien Enemies Act removals in part of Texas on the argument that a group of migrants weren't given enough notice, but the justices did not specify how much notice deportees are owed.",
      "Last month, Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote that the Supreme Court will probably need to be the final word on the Alien Enemies Act \u2014 and argued the court should rule soon.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/gop-senators-change-in-trumps-house-passed-one-big-beautiful-bill/",
    "published": "Mon, 02 Jun 2025 19:34:37 -0400",
    "summary": "The bill containing Trump's tax cuts and border and defense spending is expected to face some hurdles in the Senate.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Senate this week is taking up the massive budget package containing President Trump's second-term agenda, a measure that squeaked through the House with a one-vote margin, solely with Republican votes. Its path through the Senate seems destined to be similarly narrow, with the package almost certain to be revised, since parts of it are opposed by a handful of GOP senators critical to its passage.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, recently ventured to the other side of the U.S. Capitol to remind Republican senators \"that we are one team\" and pleaded with them to keep the bill substantially intact.",
      "\"I encouraged them to make as few modifications as possible, remembering that I have a very delicate balance on our very diverse Republican caucus over in the House,\" Johnson said in an interview with \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, acknowledged that balance, but told reporters \"the Senate will have its imprint\" on the bill. He can afford three \"no\" votes from Republicans if all Democrats vote to block its passage in the Senate, and there are no absences.",
      "GOP Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky has already indicated he opposes the bill because it will \"explode the debt.\" Including interest, the House bill would increase the debt by $3.1 trillion, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. Similar to the House, in the Senate, there are Republicans who think there's not enough cost cutting, while others argue some provisions are too draconian.",
      "These are the key sticking points as the legislation moves to the Senate:",
      "Medicaid changes",
      "Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Josh Hawley of Missouri are among the Republicans who have expressed concern about some of the changes to Medicaid, a government program that provides health care to low-income Americans as well as those with disabilities. And the trio of senators supported an amendment to the budget resolution earlier this year that would have removed the language instructing the committee overseeing Medicaid to make $880 billion in cuts. That amendment failed.",
      "The House-passed legislation includes new work requirements that would apply to childless Medicaid recipients without disabilities between the ages of 19 and 64. It also requires states to conduct more frequent eligibility checks on Medicaid recipients to root out waste, fraud and abuse, and it would penalize states that provide state-funded health care to undocumented immigrants. The bill also seeks to lower federal costs by freezing states' provider taxes at current rates and prohibiting them from establishing new provider taxes, among other changes.",
      "While these Senate Republicans have generally been supportive of the work requirements, some have warned that they will not support the bill if it includes any cuts to Medicaid benefits.",
      "In a New York Times opinion piece published earlier this month, Hawley called \"slashing health insurance for the working poor\" both \"morally wrong and politically suicidal.\"",
      "A handful of senators have also warned of the impact of freezing provider taxes at current levels, since states use the taxes to help fund their share of Medicaid costs, although Murkowski has expressed support for this. Hawley said he's concerned about the impact on rural hospitals, while also voicing opposition to new copay requirements for beneficiaries.",
      "\"I'm concerned about the provider tax. That's not a direct benefit cut, but if it closes rural hospitals, then people can't get coverage,\" Hawley told reporters. \"And I'm concerned about the cost sharing, I guess we're calling it \u2014 the sick tax. That's kind of a tax on benefit. You can't get your benefit in terms of seeing the doctor until you pay money out of pocket.\"",
      "He added, \"If rural hospitals close, what's the difference between that and a benefit cut? That's pretty tough.\"",
      "Deeper spending cuts",
      "Meanwhile, a number of fiscal hawks have balked at the bill's spending cuts or even threatened to oppose the measure without securing deeper cuts, echoing the frustration expressed on the other side of the Capitol by members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus throughout negotiations on the package.",
      "Sen. Ron Johnson, a Wisconsin Republican, said the package's aim to cut $1.5 trillion \"isn't squat, quite honestly.\" And Sen. Rick Scott, a Florida Republican, has also rebuffed the cuts, saying the amount is \"not going to do it.\"",
      "\"Their bill would not pass in the Senate, and I think there's plenty of us that would vote against it,\" Scott told reporters earlier this month, adding that the upper chamber should go through every line in the budget to find savings.",
      "Sen. Roger Marshall, a Kansas Republican, said \"the job of the Senate is to try to increase the cuts in spending,\" calling the House cuts a \"great start\" while urging the Senate to hit $2 trillion. And Sen. Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican, told the network that he believes \"the Senate is going to cut spending more than the House.\"",
      "\"We're going to see the Senate be more fiscally conservative,\" Cruz added.",
      "Sen. John Kennedy, a Louisiana Republican, agreed that the Senate needs to consider steeper cuts.",
      "\"I've said repeatedly I'm for cutting until we run out of votes,\" Kennedy said.",
      "Rolling back IRA clean energy tax credits",
      "The House-passed bill would also roll back some of the clean energy tax credits under the Biden-era climate and health care law, including an earlier phasing out of a tax break for clean energy vehicles. But the provisions could face opposition in the upper chamber.",
      "Last month, Murkowksi, along with GOP Sens. John Curtis of Utah, Jerry Moran of Kansas and Thom Tillis of North Carolina, penned a letter to the Senate majority leader to \"emphasize the importance of maintaining a stable and predictable tax framework to promote domestic energy development.\"",
      "\"While we support fiscal responsibility and prudent efforts to streamline the tax code, we caution against the full-scale repeal of current credits, which could lead to significant disruptions for the American people and weaken our position as a global energy leader,\" the group wrote.",
      "Tillis told reporters after the House passed the bill that the Senate needs to \"look at the specifics\" of revising the clean energy tax credits, saying \"we've got to make sure the businesses who believe the government was setting this as a priority don't have a lot of stranded costs.\"",
      "At the same time, other Senate Republicans, like Johnson, have called for eliminating the clean energy tax credits, setting up a possible clash within the conference.",
      "State and local tax deduction",
      "Among the provisions that spurred extensive debate in the House was one allowing residents to deduct more in state and local taxes on their federal returns, known as SALT. Divisions over an increase to the SALT cap threatened to sink the package in the days leading up to its passage in the lower chamber as a handful of blue-state Republicans fought for a higher cap, ultimately settling for $40,000, an increase from $10,000.",
      "In the Senate, the deduction is not an issue, since none of the blue states have Republican senators. Accordingly, a number of Senate Republicans have indicated that they oppose its inclusion in the bill.",
      "\"Eliminate it,\" Johnson, the Wisconsin senator, told reporters of the SALT cap increase.",
      "Republican Sen. Kevin Cramer of North Dakota told The Hill that the cap could potentially be cut in half once the Senate makes its changes.",
      "But the House speaker said he warned senators that changing the provision would not only risk getting it through the lower chamber again, but also the Republican majority.",
      "\"In the House, we do have a number of members who are elected in places like New York and California and New Jersey, and they have to provide some relief to their constituents,\" the Louisiana Republican told \"Face the Nation.\" \"Those are what we call our majority makers. Those are the people who are elected in the toughest districts and help us have the numbers to keep the majority in the House, and so, this is political reality.\"",
      "Debt ceiling",
      "Fiscal hawks are also unhappy with the inclusion of a provision raising the debt ceiling by trillions of dollars. The House-passed bill includes a $4 trillion debt ceiling hike, while the Senate's budget blueprint contained a $5 trillion increase. The debate comes as Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told congressional leaders earlier this month that the federal government could be unable to pay its bills as soon as August if Congress doesn't act.",
      "Paul has been the most vocal in opposing an increase to the debt limit. The Kentucky Republican has said \"there's nothing fiscally conservative about expanding the debt ceiling more than we've ever done it before.\" Paul said he could be convinced to support the package if the debt ceiling provision is removed and voted on separately.",
      "Instead, Paul has proposed a short-term increase of $500 billion, raising the debt ceiling for a matter of months, which he said would allow conservatives to verify that spending cuts have actually been implemented before approving a further hike.",
      "\"If I vote for the $5 trillion debt, who's left in Washington that cares about the debt?\" Paul said\u00a0Sunday on \"Face the Nation.\" \"The GOP will own the debt once they vote for this.\"",
      "Paul's Senate colleague, Johnson, also backs splitting the package into multiple parts, as well as a smaller, short-term extension.",
      "Food stamps",
      "The package also cuts billions in federal dollars from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as SNAP or food stamps. The change will require states to cover a share of the costs to provide benefits that help low-income individuals and families pay for groceries. Currently, the program is fully funded by the federal government, although states take on some of the cost to administer it. Beginning in 2028, states will have to chip in for the program as well.",
      "\"That's something that I heard some members voice concern about,\" Sen. John Boozman, an Arkansas Republican, said before Memorial Day. \"So, we'll need to address that.\"",
      "Alan  He, \n                                                  \n                                  Emily  Hung and \n                                                  \n                                  Cristina  Corujo\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

      "Rosen handled a range of criminal cases during his tenure at the U.S. Attorney's Office of the District of Columbia, one of the largest and most powerful of the federal prosecutors' offices in the nation. In addition to drug and gun crimes, Rosen took on responsibility for the section handling Jan. 6 cases. He was a lead prosecutor in the case of Leo Kelly, an Iowa man who was convicted at trial in May 2023.",
      "He took note of the Justice Department's remarkable success rate in Jan. 6 trials, securing partial or full convictions in 100% of jury trials. Rosen blasted criticism from Trump supporters who allege the juries were biased or the prosecutions were politicized.",
      "\"The reason those juries convicted \u2014 and the reason those judges convicted individuals \u2014 was not because of some bug in the due process,\" Rosen said. \"It was because the evidence was overwhelming. It was the most videotaped crime in American history.\"",
      "Soon after Mr. Trump's Inauguration-Day pardons of the Jan. 6 defendants, Justice Department officials demoted or fired some of the prosecutors who handled the Jan. 6 prosecutions and disbanded the Capitol Siege Section. Critics have accused the administration of seeking vengeance or revenge, targeting attorneys with solid track records.",
      "\"To see those talented prosecutors be marginalized or removed from office is an affront to the independence of the department,\" Rosen said.",
      "The Justice Department and the D.C. U.S. Attorney's Office did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "Rosen will soon be starting his new job as attorney at the Rogers, Joseph O'Donnell law firm in Washington, D.C.\u00a0He told CBS News, \"I felt like it was time for a change \u2014 and a time to take what I've been doing and what I've learned over the course of 15 years in state and federal practice \u2014 and bring it to the private sector, where I can benefit clients who are being scrutinized by the government.\"",

    "story": [
      "The State Department has told U.S. embassies and consulates to expand vetting for all visa applicants who wish to come to Harvard University, including visitors as well as students, according to an email obtained by CBS News.",
      "In an internal email dated May 29 and sent by Secretary of State Marco Rubio's office to all U.S. diplomatic and consular posts, consular officers were told that this \"additional vetting\" applies to anyone wanting a visa to come to Harvard for \"any purpose.\" That includes current or prospective students, faculty, employees, contractors, guest speakers and even tourists, per the email.",
      "The email told consular officers to \"conduct a complete screening of the online presence of any nonimmigrant visa applicant seeking to travel to Harvard University for any purpose.\" Officers should also \"consider whether the lack of any online presence, or having social media accounts restricted to \"private\" or with limited visibility, may be reflective of evasiveness and call into question the applicant's credibility.\"",
      "The email said consular officers can also request applicants to set their social media accounts to \"public\" for vetting purposes.",
      "Notably, the email states that the new vetting procedure for Harvard will also serve as a \"pilot for expanded screening and vetting\" of visa applicants \"generally,\" including for student visas. The State Department \"may announce similar measures for other groups of visa applicants as appropriate, and in accordance with U.S. law\".",
      "A State Department spokesperson confirmed to CBS News on Monday the Trump administration has ordered \"additional vetting of any visa applicant traveling to Harvard University,\" with a goal of identifying applicants \"with histories of anti-Semitic harassment and violence.\" The spokesperson added the measures \"may also be expanded to other groups of applicants, as appropriate.\"",
      "A source familiar with the email who was granted anonymity to speak freely told CBS news that it will likely be difficult to implement the vetting instructions uniformly across all US consular sections around the world, and for all universities assuming this pilot process gets expanded to foreign applicants for other U.S. colleges.",
      "Earlier this week, the State Department told embassies it was preparing for \"expanded social media vetting\" of student visa applicants, according to a cable obtained by CBS News. The department ordered a halt to new student visa appointments in the interim.",
      "\"We take very seriously the process of vetting who it is that comes into the country, and we're going to continue to do that,\" State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said in response to the visa appointment freeze earlier this week.",
      "The stricter vetting procedure now targeting America's leading global university is the result of two executive orders signed by President Trump: One that directed more vetting for visas, and one calling for a crackdown on antisemitism, per the email. The State Department spokesperson said the school has \"failed to maintain a campus environment free from violence and anti-Semitism.\"",
      "The Trump administration has taken aim at Harvard in recent weeks, accusing it of failing to respond to what it views as rampant antisemitic activity on campus.",
      "Last week, the administration sought to take away Harvard's ability to enroll foreign students \u2014 a significant threat for a school where just over one in four students are international. The order was blocked by a judge following a lawsuit from Harvard. The Trump administration has also frozen federal funding to the Ivy League school.",
      "Meanwhile, the Trump administration tried to revoke the student visa status of thousands of international students, many of whom appeared to draw the government's attention due to minor legal infractions. That policy was halted by a judge.",
      "Rubio said Wednesday the State Department will \"aggressively revoke\" visas for some Chinese international students, including those studying in \"critical fields\" and people with links to the Chinese Communist Party. China's embassy in the U.S. called the move \"politically motivated and discriminatory.\"",
      "And some international students who participated in pro-Palestinian protests have faced detention, under a law allowing the government to revoke visas for anyone deemed to pose \"adverse foreign policy consequences.\"",
      "When asked by reporters Friday whether he supports international students studying in the U.S., Mr. Trump said he does: \"We want to have great students here, we just don't want students that are causing trouble.\"",
      "\"I don't think Harvard's been acting very nicely,\" Mr. Trump said, reiterating his call to redirect funds from Harvard to trade schools. \"Harvard's trying to be a big shot.\"",

    "summary": "The Trump administration asked the Supreme Court on Monday to allow it to move forward with its plans to lay off thousands of federal workers.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump's administration asked the Supreme Court on Monday to allow it to move forward with its plans to lay off thousands of federal workers at nearly two dozen agencies while a legal battle over the president's plans to drastically cut the size of the government moves forward.",
      "The Justice Department's request for emergency relief is the second in which it has asked the Supreme Court to intervene in the ongoing dispute over its efforts to execute reductions-in-force, or layoffs, across the executive branch. The administration initially asked the Supreme Court to halt a two-week temporary restraining order issued by U.S. District Judge Susan Illston, but withdrew its request after she granted longer relief last month.",
      "That preliminary injunction issued by Illston prevented the Trump administration from implementing planned reductions-in-force, placing employees on administrative leave and proceeding with job cuts that are already in motion.",
      "The Justice Department's latest request for the Supreme Court's intervention comes after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit declined last week to halt Illston's order, which would have allowed the administration to resume its efforts to sharply scale down the size of the federal workforce.",
      "Solicitor General D. John Sauer said in a filing that the district court's order is \"flawed\" and rests on an \"indefensible premise,\" namely that the president needs authorization from Congress to oversee personnel decisions within the executive branch.",
      "\"It interferes with the Executive Branch's internal operations and unquestioned legal authority to plan and carry out RIFs, and does so on a government-wide scale,\" he wrote. \"More concretely, the injunction has brought to a halt numerous in-progress RIFs at more than a dozen federal agencies, sowing confusion about what RIF-related steps agencies may take and compelling the government to retain \u2014 at taxpayer expense \u2014 thousands of employees whose continuance in federal service the agencies deem not to be in the government and public interest.\"",
      "Mr. Trump began taking steps to shrink the government shortly after he returned to the White House. The president created DOGE, a cost-cutting task force that was led by Elon Musk, and his administration began working to dismantle agencies like the U.S. Agency for International Development and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, though they have been met with court challenges.",
      "Musk's time working in the government ended last Friday, with his status as a special government employee limiting him to working 130 days in a 365-day period. But Mr. Trump said the billionaire is \"really not leaving, he's going to be back and forth.\"",
      "In February, Mr. Trump issued an executive order directing agencies to make plans to initiate \"large-scale\" reductions-in-force. On the heels of the president's directive, the Office of Personnel Management and Office of Management of Budget issued a memo directing agencies to submit plans for two phases of job cuts.",
      "Several department heads began executing their workforce cuts earlier this year, with thousands of federal employees losing their jobs. Other federal entities are planning to make significant reductions in the coming weeks and months.",
      "The reductions-in-force are separate from the mass terminations of probationary workers, who generally were in their positions for one or two years. But those firings, which took place in February, have also been the focus of lawsuits.",
      "In response to Mr. Trump's executive order, labor unions, nonprofit groups and local governments sued nearly every federal agency to block the layoffs, arguing that the executive order exceeded the president's authority and violated the separation of powers.",
      "A federal district judge in San Francisco agreed to issue a temporary restraining order, and she extended that relief with a preliminary injunction. Illston's order covers 21 federal agencies and DOGE, and prevents them proceeding with the sweeping reorganization of the federal government.",
      "The judge also barred agencies from implementing any orders by DOGE to cut programs or staff in connection with Mr. Trump's February executive order. She clarified that the injunction does not limit agencies from proposing their own reorganization plans to Congress or engaging in their own planning activities without the involvement of OMB, OPM or DOGE. The agencies affected include the Departments of Health and Human Services and Veterans Affairs, as well as\u00a0AmeriCorps\u00a0and the Social Security Administration, among others.",
      "In a 51-page ruling, Illston wrote that presidents do have the authority to seek changes to federal agencies, and nine presidents have over the last century sought to reorganize the executive branch \u2014 but only after obtaining approval from Congress.",
      "\"Presidents may set policy priorities for the executive branch, and agency heads may implement them. This much is undisputed,\" the judge said. \"But Congress creates federal agencies, funds them, and gives them duties that \u2014 by statute \u2014 they must carry out. Agencies may not conduct large-scale reorganizations and reductions in force in blatant disregard of Congress's mandates, and a president may not initiate large-scale executive branch reorganization without partnering with Congress.\"",
      "The Justice Department asked the 9th Circuit to lift Illston's injunction, and in a divided 2-1 decision, it refused to do so.",
      "\"The Executive Order at issue here far exceeds the president's supervisory powers under the Constitution,\" the appeals court wrote. \"The president enjoys significant removal power with respect to the appointed officers of federal agencies.\"",

      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court said Monday that it will consider whether to revive a Republican congressman's challenge to an Illinois law that allows mail-in ballots to be received and counted up to 14 days after Election Day.",
      "The dispute involving GOP Rep. Michael Bost will be heard by the Supreme Court in its next term, which begins in October, with a decision expected by the end of June 2026. The question in the case is a procedural one: Whether Bost and two Republican presidential electors have the legal right to challenge state regulations concerning the time, place and manner of federal elections.",
      "If the high court finds that the plaintiffs do have the legal standing to sue, their lawsuit could proceed.",
      "The case concerns an Illinois law that dictates when vote-by-mail ballots have to be postmarked and received in order for them to be counted. Changes in state law in 2005 effectively allow a mail-in ballot received up to 14 days after Election Day to be counted as long as it is cast by mail on or before the day of the election. At least 17 states also allow ballots that arrive after Election Day to be counted.",
      "Bost, who was first elected to Congress in 2014, and two Republican presidential electors sued Illinois election officials over the deadline for counting mail ballots in 2022. They argued in part that the receipt and counting of late-arriving ballots dilutes the value of their votes, infringing on their rights under the First and 14th Amendments, and contended that the ballot-receipt deadline is preempted by two federal statutes that set a uniform day for federal elections.",
      "A federal district court dismissed the case in 2023, finding that Bost and the two electors failed to allege that they have the legal right to sue, a concept known as standing. A divided three-judge panel on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit upheld the district court's decision last year, agreeing that the plaintiffs did not allege standing to bring their lawsuit because they did not plausibly allege they had been injured by the law involving late-arriving mail ballots.",
      "Bost and the electors appealed the decision to the Supreme Court, arguing that in recent years, the ability of candidates and parties to sue over state laws that affect their campaigns has been restricted by the federal courts.",
      "\"The court's guidance is needed to correct the unwarranted narrowing of candidates' ability to challenge electoral regulations,\" they wrote in a filing with the Supreme Court, adding that it is \"vitally important\" for the Supreme Court to clarify whether candidates can challenge state election laws in federal court.",
      "\"It is important that courts hear and resolve well-pleaded challenges by federal candidates to state time, place, and manner regulations affecting their elections,\" the Republicans wrote. \"Aside from the interests of the litigants, it is important that the public conclude that elections are run in an orderly, not arbitrary, fashion.\"",
      "But Illinois election officials urged the Supreme Court to turn away the appeal, arguing that the plaintiffs disagree with their decision to count mail-in ballots that are cast on or before Election Day, but arrive after.",
      "\"They do not claim that Illinois's ballot receipt deadline affected their likelihood of prevailing in any race in which they have ever competed or are likely to compete in the future,\" the state officials said in a filing with the high court. \"Rather, petitioners contend that they are entitled to challenge the deadline simply by virtue of their status as candidates, on the theory that a political candidate can always challenge a state's regulation of the time, place, and manner of conducting an election.\"",

      "U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said the U.S. agreed to drop the 145% tax Mr. Trump had imposed on China to 30%. China agreed to lower its tariff rate on U.S. goods to 10% from 125%.",
      "On Monday, the Commerce Ministry said China held up its end of the deal, canceling or suspending tariffs and nontariff measures taken against the U.S. \"reciprocal tariffs\" following the agreement. But it alleged that the Trump administration has \"unilaterally provoked new economic and trade frictions and exacerbated the uncertainty and instability\" in trade relations between the two nations, citing curbs on exports of AI chips and chip design software to China.",
      "The statement also singled out the Trump administration's threat of stripping visas away from Chinese students studying at U.S. universities as undermining the trade agreement between the nations.",
      "The Trump administration stepped up the clash with China last week, announcing that it would start\u00a0revoking visas for Chinese students\u00a0in the U.S. American campuses host more than 275,000 students from China.",
      "The turmoil between the U.S. and China raises economic risks, given the links between the two nations and their importance in global trade, experts added.",
      "\"If the United States and China were to disengage completely in another blitz of escalating tariffs, it would be a really big deal for the global economy,\" Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics, told investors in a client note. \"Demand for industrial commodities would plummet.

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/supreme-court-maryland-assault-weapon-ban/",
    "published": "Mon, 02 Jun 2025 10:15:00 -0400",
    "summary": "In declining to take up the case, the Supreme Court leaves intact a lower court decision upholding Maryland's ban on certain semiautomatic rifles.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Monday turned away a challenge to Maryland's ban on so-called assault weapons, leaving intact a lower court ruling that upheld the law.",
      "In declining to review the decision from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit, the high court skirts for now a fight over whether the Second Amendment allows states to regulate the rifles that have been used in a wave of mass shootings. Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch disagreed with the Supreme Court's decision to turn away the case.",
      "The Supreme Court had already turned away the legal battle over Maryland's law last year because a federal appeals court had yet to rule. But the 4th Circuit upheld the measure last August, finding that weapons like the AR-15 could be banned in part because they are outside the scope of the Second Amendment.",
      "But the question of whether AR-15s are protected by the Second Amendment is likely to be soon decided by the Supreme Court. In a separate statement, Justice Brett Kavanaugh said that the issue is currently being considered by other federal appeals courts, and rulings from them \"should assist this court's ultimate decisionmaking.\" He predicted appeals to the Supreme Court will be before the court \"shortly,\" and said the justices \"should and presumably will address the AR-15 issue soon, in the next term or two.\"",
      "In addition to rejecting the appeal of Maryland's prohibition, the Supreme Court declined to consider a challenge to Rhode Island's ban on large-capacity magazines, keeping the law in place. The court's decision to turn away the appeal from four gun owners and a firearms dealer leaves intact a lower court ruling that declined to block enforcement of Rhode Island's ban and found the challengers failed to show they were likely to succeed on the merits of their claims.",
      "The two disputes are among several to land before the Supreme Court following its June 2022 ruling that expanded the right to bear arms and laid out a new framework for determining when restrictions on firearms adhere to the Constitution.",
      "Under its new standard, the government must show that a measure is consistent with the nation's historical tradition of firearms regulation and is therefore allowed under the Second Amendment. The high court provided some clarification about its so-called historical tradition test in its last term when it upheld a federal law that bars alleged domestic abusers from temporarily having firearms, but courts have still struggled to apply the framework, leading to conflicting decisions on the constitutionality of longstanding gun laws.",
      "Maryland's assault-weapons ban",
      "Maryland's prohibition on certain semiautomatic rifles was enacted in the wake of the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. Under the law, it is a crime to possess, sell, transfer or purchase an \"assault long gun\" or a \"copycat weapon,\" which encompasses 45 specific guns or their analogues. A variety of semiautomatic handguns and rifles are still allowed, according to the Maryland State Police.",
      "In addition to Maryland, eight other states and the District of Columbia have enacted laws restricting semiautomatic weapons.",
      "A group of Maryland residents who want to buy rifles covered by the ban, a licensed gun dealer in the state and several pro-Second Amendment groups challenged the law in 2020, arguing that they have a Second Amendment right to own common assault rifles.",
      "The federal district court and U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit upheld the law, likening the banned firearms to the M-16 rifle, which the Supreme Court has said is outside the scope of Second Amendment protection.",
      "The Maryland challengers asked the Supreme Court to review that decision, and the high court put consideration on hold while it decided another gun case involving concealed carry rules in New York. In that ruling issued in June 2022, the Supreme Court laid out the new framework under which gun laws must be consistent with the nation's historical tradition of firearms regulation.",
      "Following its decision in that landmark gun case, the Supreme Court sent the challenge to Maryland's assault weapons back to the appeals court to reconsider the case.",
      "After applying that new framework to Maryland's ban, the 4th Circuit concluded last year that the assault weapons ban is constitutional. Focusing on the AR-15 in particular, the appeals court found that it is most useful in military service and can be banned consistent with the Second Amendment.",
      "It also rejected the challengers' contention that because the guns covered by Maryland's ban are commonly used, they are protected by the Constitution. Instead, the 4th Circuit said adopting this argument would mean that any dangerous weapon \"could gain constitutional protection merely because it becomes popular before the government can sufficiently regulate it.\"",
      "The appeals court also said that the ban is consistent with the nation's historical tradition of firearms regulation, as it \"is one of many in a storied tradition of legislatures perceiving threats posed by excessively dangerous weapons and regulating commensurately.\"",
      "The challengers again sought the Supreme Court's review, arguing in a filing that the justices should \"ensure that the Second Amendment itself is not truncated into a limited right to own certain state-approved means of personal self-defense.\"",
      "They argued the AR-15 is the most popular rifle in the U.S. and said the 4th Circuit's ruling \"turns a firearm possessed for lawful purposes by millions of Americans into an item with not even presumptive constitutional protection.\"",
      "But Maryland officials urged the court to leave the 4th Circuit's ruling intact, in part because they said it's too soon for the Supreme Court to intervene.",
      "In his statement, Kavanaugh called the appeals court's decision \"questionable.\"",
      "\"Given that millions of Americans own AR-15s and that a significant majority of the states allow possession of those rifles, petitioners have a strong argument that AR-15s are in 'common use' by law-abiding citizens and therefore are protected by the Second Amendment,\" he wrote. \"If so, then the Fourth Circuit would have erred by holding that Maryland's ban on AR\u201315s complies with the Second Amendment.\"",
      "Thomas, in a solo dissent, said the Supreme Court should not wait to decide the constitutionality of laws outlawing AR-15s and lamented that the justices have put off addressing it for a decade.",
      "\"[F]urther percolation is of little value when lower courts in the jurisdictions that ban AR-15s appear bent on distorting this court's Second Amendment precedents,\" he wrote. \"I doubt we would sit idly by if lower courts were to so subvert our precedents involving any other constitutional right. Until we are vigilant in enforcing it, the right to bear arms will remain 'a second-class right.'\"",
      "Rhode Island's ban on large-capacity magazines",
      "Rhode Island's ban on large-capacity magazines was enacted by its General Assembly in June 2022 in response to mass shootings that have upended communities nationwide in recent years. The law prohibits possession of magazines that hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition.",
      "People who had these magazines had six months to either modify them to accept no more than 10 rounds, sell them to a firearms dealer, take them out of state or turn them into law enforcement. Possession of large-capacity magazines is now considered a felony.",
      "The group of gun owners challenged the state's ban shortly before it was set to take effect, arguing it violated the Second Amendment. A federal district court judge denied the challengers' request to block the law, finding that keeping large-capacity magazines isn't conduct that is protected by the Second Amendment.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 1st Circuit then upheld the district court's decision, finding that the ban \"imposes no meaningful burden on the ability of Rhode Island residents to defend themselves.\" The three-judge appeals court panel also said that semiautomatic weapons outfitted with large-capacity magazines \"much more closely resemble\" the M-16 rifle, which is banned for civilian use, than traditional handguns.",
      "\"The burden on self-defense imposed by [Rhode Island's law] is no greater than the burdens of longstanding, permissible arms regulations, and its justification compares favorably with the justification for prior bans on other arms found to pose growing threats to public safety,\" the court said. It added that, when applying the Supreme Court's framework, \"our analogical reasoning very likely places LCMs well within the realm of devices that have historically been prohibited once their danger became manifest.\"",
      "The gun owners appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that lower courts have \"rubber-stamped\" firearms restrictions even in the wake of the high court's more recent decisions.",
      "\"The same law-abiding citizens who were unconstitutionally deprived of their right to carry arms outside the home before Bruen continue to be deprived of their right to keep arms that are common in the rest of the country,\" they wrote in their petition to the Supreme Court, citing the court's Jun 2022 decision. \"The result is a nation that remains split, with the Second Amendment alive and well in (most of) the vast middle, but routinely disregarded near the coasts.\"",
      "Rhode Island officials urged the Supreme Court to reject the case, saying it is not worthy of the court's attention \"at this time.\" They noted in a filing that the case arrived at the high court while proceedings are still in preliminary stages.",

    "published": "Mon, 02 Jun 2025 06:00:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The House passed President Trump's \"one, big, beautiful bill,\" which includes continuing the 2017 tax cuts, but several GOP senators have voiced concerns.",
    "story": [
      "A leading GOP friendly group supporting President Trump's \"one, big, beautiful bill\"\u00a0 is readying a $4 million advertising buy aimed at helping steer the effort through the Senate after a number of Republicans voiced concerns about the legislation as it stands.",
      "The plans from Americans for Prosperity, first reported on by CBS News, come as the GOP-controlled Senate is expected to focus on the sprawling bill key to Mr. Trump's agenda after it narrowly passed the Republican led-House last month.",
      "The messaging from AFP includes \"video and digital ads that will air on cable, connected TV, and other digital platforms,\" according to the organization. Television advertisements from the group will initially air in North Carolina, Louisiana, Maine, Idaho and the District of Columbia but could expand further.",
      "\"The sooner the Senate advances the bill, the sooner Americans start seeing relief where they need it most,\" said Brent Gardner, the organization's chief government affairs officer in a statement. The statement also noted the group is well aware that as the process being used to fast track the bill progressed \"the hill to climb was only going to get steeper.\"",
      "Crucial to the GOP bill is its continuation of key parts of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was a legislative trademark of Mr. Trump's first term in office. But the expansive bill that passed the House also includes Medicaid work requirements, a raise of the debt ceiling and a bevy of other major measures that could prove politically difficult to pass even with the relatively strong GOP majority in the Senate.",
      "\"Look, I want to vote for it. I'm for the tax cuts. I voted for the tax cuts before. I want the tax cuts to be permanent, but at the same time, I don't want to raise the debt ceiling $5 trillion,\" Kentucky GOP Sen. Rand Paul said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "The new advertising move from AFP include testimonials that show not only the impact of the 2017 tax cuts but also what could happen if Congress does not act soon to extend those earlier changes along with \"ads encouraging fiscal hawks in the Senate to find spending offsets by further eliminating wasteful Biden-era spending programs,\" according to details set to be released by AFP.",
      "Democrats in Congress have so far strongly resisted the Trump agenda legislation. While most legislation in the Senate typically requires bipartisan support because of the chamber's filibuster threshold, Republican leaders are using a procedural route that would allow them to pass the bill on the strength of their partisan majority alone. Already a messaging standoff has emerged around the bill that could play a major role in the 2026 midterms.",
      "\"Senate Republicans are doing everything in their power to rip away health care and spike costs for hardworking families, all to give billionaires a massive tax handout,\" Maeve Coyle, a spokesperson for the Senate Democrats campaign arm said in a recent statement. \"Under the leadership of Senate Republicans, millions of people are at risk of losing their health insurance \u2013 and voters will hold them accountable for it at the ballot box in 2026.\"",
      "The Republican Party doesn't need every one of its Senators to vote for the bill in order for it to pass due to the party's successful 2024 election that saw the right take back the majority in the chamber and finish with a total of 53 seats. But losing the support of just four GOP senators could doom the push.",
      "\"The Senate will have their differences, but focusing on where Republicans are unified is what will drive this bill forward \u2013 permanent tax cuts, energy abundance, secure borders, and the elimination of waste, fraud, and abuse,\" Gardner, with Americans for Prosperity, said in a statement.",

    "story": [
      "Window Rock, Ariz. \u2014 Navajo Nation leaders took turns talking with the U.S. government's top health official as they hiked along a sandstone ridge overlooking their rural, high-desert town before the morning sun grew too hot.",
      "Buu Nygren, president of the Navajo Nation, paused at the edge with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Below them, tribal government buildings, homes, and juniper trees dotted the tan and deep-red landscape.",
      "Nygren said he wanted Kennedy to look at the capital for the nation of about 400,000 enrolled members. The tribal president pointed toward an antiquated health center that he hoped federal funding would help replace and described life for the thousands of locals without running water due to delayed government projects.",
      "Nygren said Kennedy had already done a lot, primarily saving the Indian Health Service from a round of staffing cuts rippling through the federal government.",
      "\"When we started hearing about the layoffs and the freezes, you were the first one to stand up for Indian Country,\" he told Kennedy, of his move to spare the federal agency charged with providing health care to Native Americans and Alaska Natives.",
      "But Nygren and other Navajo leaders said cuts to federal health programs outside the Indian Health Service are hurting Native Americans.",
      "\"You're disrupting real lives,\" Cherilyn Yazzie, a Navajo council delegate, told KFF Health News as she described recent changes.",
      "Kennedy has repeatedly promised to prioritize Native Americans' health care. But Native Americans and health officials across tribal nations say those overtures are overshadowed by the collateral harm from massive cuts to federal health programs.",
      "The sweeping reductions have resulted in cuts to funding directed toward or disproportionately relied on by Native Americans. Staffing cuts, tribal health leaders say, have led to missing data and poor communication.",
      "The Indian Health Service provides free health care at its hospitals and clinics to Native Americans, who, as a group, face higher rates of chronic diseases and die younger than other populations. Those inequities are attributable to centuries of systemic discrimination. But many tribal members don't live near an agency clinic or hospital. And those who do may face limited services, chronic underfunding, and staffing shortages. To work around those gaps, health organizations lean on other federally funded programs.",
      "\"There may be a misconception among some of the administration that Indian Country is only impacted by changes to the Indian Health Service,\" said Liz Malerba, a tribal policy expert and citizen of the Mohegan Tribe. \"That's simply not true.\"",
      "Tribes have lost more than $6 million in grants from other HHS agencies, the National Indian Health Board wrote in a May letter to Kennedy.",
      "Janet Alkire, chairperson of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe in the Dakotas, said at a May 14 Senate committee hearing that those grants paid for community health workers, vaccinations, data modernization, and other public health efforts.",
      "The government also canceled funding for programs it said violated President Trump's ban on \"diversity, equity, and inclusion,\" including one aimed at Native American youth interested in science and medicine and another that helps several tribes increase access to healthy food \u2014 something Kennedy has said he wants to prioritize.",
      "Tribal health officials say slashed federal staffing has made it harder to get technical support and money for federally funded health projects they run.",
      "The firings have cut or eliminated staff at programs related to preventing overdoses in tribal communities, using traditional food and medicine to fight chronic disease, and helping low-income people afford to heat and cool their homes through the Low Income Home Energy Program.",
      "The Oglala Sioux Tribe is in South Dakota, where Native Americans who struggle to heat their homes have died of hypothermia. Through mid-May the tribe hadn't been able to access its latest funding installment from the energy program, said John Long, the tribe's chief of staff.",
      "Abigail Echo-Hawk, director of the Urban Indian Health Institute at the Seattle Indian Health Board, said the government has sent her organization incomplete health data. That includes statistics about Native Americans at risk for suicide and substance use disorders, which the center uses to shape public health policy and programs.",
      "\"People are going to die because we don't have access to the data,\" Echo-Hawk said.",
      "Her organization is also having trouble administering a $2.2 million federal grant, she said, because the agency handling the money fired staffers she worked with. The grant pays for public health initiatives such as smoking cessation and vaccinations.",
      "\"It is very confusing to say chronic disease prevention is the No. 1 priority and then to eradicate the support needed to address chronic disease prevention in Indian Country,\" Echo-Hawk said.",
      "HHS spokesperson Emily Hilliard said Kennedy aims to combat chronic diseases and improve well-being among Native Americans \"through culturally relevant, community-driven solutions.\"",
      "Hilliard did not respond to questions about Kennedy's specific plans for Native American health or concerns about existing and proposed funding and staffing changes.",
      "As Kennedy hiked alongside Navajo Nation leaders, KFF Health News asked how he would improve and protect access to care for tribal communities amid rollbacks within his department.",
      "\"That's exactly what I'm doing,\" Kennedy responded. \"Making sure that all the cuts do not affect these communities.\"",
      "Kennedy has said his focus on Native American health stems from personal and family experience, something he repeated to Navajo leadership. As an attorney, he worked with tribes on environmental health lawsuits. He also served as an editor at ICT, a major Native American news outlet.",
      "The secretary said he was also influenced by his uncle, President John F. Kennedy, and his father, U.S. Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, who were both assassinated when Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was a child.",
      "\"They thought that America would never live up to its moral authority and its role as an exemplary nation around the world if we didn't first look back and remediate or mitigate the original sin of the American experience \u2014 the genocide of the Native people,\" Kennedy said during his visit.",
      "Some tribal leaders say the recent cuts, and the way the administration made them, violate treaties in which the U.S. promised to provide for the health and welfare of tribes in return for taking their land.",
      "\"We have not been consulted with meaningfully on any of these actions,\" said Malerba, director of policy and legislative affairs for the United South and Eastern Tribes Sovereignty Protection Fund, which advocates for tribes from Texas to Maine.",
      "Alkire said at the congressional hearing that many Native American health organizations sent letters to the health department asking for consultations but none has received a response.",
      "Tribal consultation is legally required when federal agencies pursue changes that would have a significant impact on tribal nations.",
      "\"This is not just a moral question of what we owe Native people,\" Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) said at the hearing. \"It is also a question of the law.\"",
      "Tribal leaders are worried about additional proposed changes, including funding cuts to the Indian Health Service and a reorganization of the federal health department.",
      "Esther Lucero, president and CEO of the Seattle Indian Health Board, said the maneuvers remind her of the level of daily uncertainty she felt working through the COVID-19 pandemic \u2014 only with fewer resources.",
      "\"Our ability to serve those who are desperately in need feels at risk,\" Lucero said.",
      "Among the most pressing concerns are congressional Republicans' proposed cuts to Medicaid, the primary government health insurance program for people with low incomes or disabilities.",
      "About 30% of Native American and Alaska Native people younger than 65 are enrolled in Medicaid, and the program helps keep Indian Health Service and other tribal health facilities afloat.",
      "Native American adults would be exempt from Medicaid work requirements approved by House Republicans on May 21.",
      "After Kennedy summited Window Rock with Navajo Nation leaders, the tribe held a prayer ceremony in which they blessed him in Din\u00e9 Bizaad, the Navajo language. President Nygren stressed how meaningful it was for the country's health secretary to walk alongside them. He also reminded Kennedy of the list of priorities they'd discussed. That included maintaining the federal low-income energy assistance program.",
      "\"We look forward to reestablishing and protecting some of the services that your department provides,\" Nygren said.",

      "\"The CIF values all of our student-athletes and we will continue to uphold our mission of providing students with the opportunity to belong, connect, and compete while complying with California law,\" the statement said.",
      "Related:\u00a0Nationwide debate over Jurupa Valley transgender athlete's eligibility in CIF finals continues",

      "Their rule change was announced less than a day after Mr. Trump took to Truth Social to comment on the matter, threatening to pull federal funding from the state if Hernandez competed.",
      "Some high school coaches who had student-athletes participating in the finals offered their support for Hernandez, including Santa Margarita High School's Bryn Williams.",
      "\"This is still a high schooler,\" Williams said. \"She is learning, she is navigating the world just like we are every single day and that I know I would want grace if I was put in a situation where I had a bunch of light on me and what I was doing. So I encourage people to remember that. We are all human and at the end of the day we are all trying to navigate this world.\"",
      "The finals began Friday at Buchanan High School in Clovis, which is located in Fresno County.

      "Pamela Hemphill is one of the more than 1,500 people whom Mr. Trump pardoned earlier this year for their roles in the U.S. Capitol Insurrection. She has invoked help from her Republican senator to formally refuse and block the pardon Mr. Trump issued her on Jan. 20, his\u00a0first day back in the White House.",
      "Though Hemphill was a defendant of the largest criminal prosecution in American history, she is seemingly standing alone now as the only Jan. 6 defendant to refuse the clemency Mr. Trump offered.",
      "Speaking with CBS News from her home in Idaho, Hemphill said, \"The pardons just contribute to their narrative, which is all lies, propaganda. We were guilty, period.\"",
      "\"We all know that they're gaslighting us. They are using January 6 to just continue Trump's narrative that the Justice Department was weaponized,\" she said. \"They were not. When the FBI came to my home, oh my God, they were very professional. They treated me very good.\"",
      "Hemphill pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge for her role in the crowd on Jan. 6, 2021.",
      "Prosecutors argued Hemphill \"was in the front of the crowd that confronted U.S. Capitol Police and other law enforcement officers attempting to keep the rioters behind the metal bike-rack barriers.\"",
      "They alleged Hemphill galvanized others to descend on Washington for the certification of the electoral vote after the 2020 election, according to court filings.",
      "\"On December 28, 2020, Hemphill posted encouragement to go to Washington, D.C. for January 6, saying 'its a WAR!' On January 1, 2021, she posted a message 'on my way to Washington DC January 6th,'\" the prosecution said.",
      "Hemphill also pleaded guilty in January 2022 to a count of unlawful parading and was sentenced later that year to a term that included three years of probation.",
      "Her case mirrors many other misdemeanor cases from the U.S. Capitol siege, in which members of the crowd were not accused of making physical contact with police or damaging any property \u2014 though prosecutors emphasized how each member of the mob contributed to the breakdown of police lines, the injuries and the damage to American democracy.",
      "Hemphill told CBS News the pardons for her and fellow members of the crowd were inappropriate and damaging Americans' views of the federal government.",
      "\"How could you sleep at night taking a pardon when you know you were guilty? You know that everybody there was guilty. I couldn't live with myself. I have to be right with me. And with God,\" Hemphill said.",
      "Former Pardon Attorney Liz Oyer, who was fired by the Trump administration in March after a disagreement over a case, told CBS News that Hemphill's protest is a sharp contrast from the conduct of other Capitol riot defendants who championed their own pardons.",
      "\"Some Jan. 6 defendants blew up our phones seeking a copy of their pardons. They wanted the copies quickly,\" Oyer said. \"They wanted it framed and signed.\"",
      "Court filings reviewed by CBS News show other Jan. 6 defendants have utilized their pardon certificates to make arguments in court about their cases, restitution payments or other legal matters.",
      "In contrast, senate records obtained by CBS News show Hemphill sought assistance from Sen. James Risch to secure a formal acknowledgement from the Department of Justice that she will not accept her pardon.",
      "In an April 2 correspondence from the Office of the Pardon Attorney to Sen. Risch, the pardon attorney's office wrote, \"Ms. Hemphill's non-acceptance is noted.\" The letter said the Justice Department would not issue Hemphill a formal certificate to chronicle her pardon.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, a spokesperson for Risch said, \"The Office of U.S. Senator Jim Risch regularly assists constituents with matters pertaining to federal agencies or programs. Due to privacy concerns, we cannot disclose details about individual cases.\"",
      "Hemphill has sparred on social media and in podcasts with other Jan. 6 defendants over her arguments about what she says is the whitewashing of the Capitol riot. In one segment on a podcast earlier this spring, Hemphill debated Enrique Tarrio, a former Proud Boys leader who was convicted at trial and received the longest prison sentence of any Jan. 6 defendant. Tarrio's sentence was commuted by Mr. Trump.",
      "Hemphill told CBS News she expects her protest will garner the attention of the president.",
      "\"Trump will probably say that ungrateful lady, I'm going to make sure she gets back on probation and give her the worst you can give her. I won't be surprised,\" she said.",

      "\"We've never seen anything like this before in my lifetime \u2013 somebody that says, 'Whatever I want should be the law of the land. It's my way or the highway.' And most Americans don't agree with that,\" Clinton said in an interview with \"CBS Sunday Morning.\" \"But I like to think that he's paid a price for this, you know, name-calling and throwing his weight around \u2026 I think it's made him less popular.\"",
      "He said opposition to Mr. Trump would be bolstered if Democrats win governors' races at play this year, and win back the House in 2026.",
      "\"Look, only elections are going to change this,\" he said. \"But I do think the courts are getting their dander up. I think that him shutting law firms out of representing their clients before federal agencies and in federal buildings, because he doesn't agree with their position \u2013 that ain't America. We've never done that. The whole purpose of having a legal system is to have both sides be heard.\"",
      "Clinton said that, so far, the courts are stopping the president, \"including a lot of judges he appointed. And you know, he is looking for ways to basically defy all these court orders. But I think he'll have a hard time doing that. And if he does, I think it will hurt him in America.\"",
      "Democratic opposition",
      "Asked if he thought the only thing the Democratic Party could agree on was its antipathy towards Trump, Clinton replied, \"If I thought that were true, I would. But I don't think it's true.

We need to preserve that and find a way to work together, and not humiliate other people just so we can win.' We gotta just calm down and try to pull people together again. That's what I think.\"",
      "Elder statesmen",
      "Last November, Clinton released his book, \"Citizen: My Life After the White House,\" and talked with \"Sunday Morning\" about the importance of citizens to \"stand up for what we think is right.\"",
      "The following month, Clinton, then 78, had a health scare that landed him in the hospital. \"It turned out to be no big deal,\" he said. \"I basically kind of lost my balance, and I knew I was sick, and I went to the hospital and checked in and they said I was severely dehydrated. And I got great care, and I left the next day.\"",
      "As for his health today, he said, \"Far as I know, it's great. But when you're older, you have to be more careful to stay hydrated.\"",
      "Asked about a recent book on President Joe Biden which suggested people around him had seen signs of cognitive and physical decline, Clinton said he never saw any cognitive decline, and did not feel that Biden was unfit to run for President. \"I thought he was a good president. The only concern I thought he had to deal with was, could anybody do that job until they were 86?\" Clinton said. \"And we'd had several long talks. I had never seen him and walked away thinking, He can't do this anymore. He was always on top of his briefs.",
      "\"I haven't read the book. And I saw President Biden not very long ago, and I thought he was in good shape. But the book didn't register with me 'cause I never saw him that way.\"",
      "Asked why he hasn't read the book, Clinton replied, \"I didn't want to. 'Cause he's not president anymore, and I think he did a good job.

    "summary": "\"This is a setback of probably a decade for HIV vaccine research,\" one scientist said.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration has moved to end funding for a broad swath of HIV vaccine research, saying current approaches are enough to counter the virus, multiple scientists and federal health officials say.",
      "Notifications that the funding would not be extended were relayed Friday to researchers, who were told by National Institutes of Health officials that the Department of Health and Human Services had elected \"to go with currently available approaches to eliminate HIV\" instead.",
      "The cuts will shutter two major HIV vaccine research efforts that were first funded by the NIH in 2012 at the Duke Human Vaccine Institute and the Scripps Research Institute, multiple scientists said. A spokesperson for Moderna said the vaccine manufacturer's clinical trials through the NIH's HIV Vaccine Trials Network have also been put on pause.",
      "One senior NIH official said the HHS had also instructed the agency not to issue any more funding in the next fiscal year for HIV vaccine research, with only a small handful of exceptions.",
      "A budgetary rule change specifically targeted at HIV vaccine research is also expected to lead to another cut to the NIH's awards for studies initiated by scientists, an official said.",
      "The change, to be finalized shortly, inflates the accounting for the upfront cost of studies into HIV vaccines funded by the agency. Instead of the cost of a five-year grant being spread out over five years, the NIH plans to make HIV vaccine dollars from multi-year grants all count toward a single year, the official said, making it harder for them to get funded.",
      "A spokesperson for HHS told CBS News that \"complex and duplicative health programs have resulted in serious duplication of efforts,\" saying that \"27 separate programs that address HIV/AIDS\" had spent $7.5 billion.",
      "\"The Administration believes the United States should have the best medical research in the world. To that end, we are advancing policies to maximize the impact of every federal taxpayer dollar and ensure proper oversight of this funding,\" HHS spokesperson Emily Hilliard said.",
      "Hilliard claimed \"critical HIV/AIDS programs will continue\" under the new agency that Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has proposed creating, dubbed the Administration for a Healthy America.",
      "\"For HIV vaccine design and development, we've begun to see light at the end of the tunnel after many years of research. This is a terrible time to cut it off. We're beginning to get close. We're getting good results out of clinical trials,\" said Dennis Burton, an immunology professor at Scripps Research.",
      "Burton warned that their HIV vaccine research could not simply be turned back on, even if a future administration decided to change course on HIV funding. He said ongoing experiments would be shuttered, and researchers assembled to study the issue would be forced to refocus their careers on other topics.",
      "\"This is a decision with consequences that will linger. This is a setback of probably a decade for HIV vaccine research,\" Burton said.",
      "The cancellation of the funds comes weeks ahead of the Food and Drug Administration's June 19 deadline for deciding on approval of lenacapavir, a twice-yearly injectable drug to prevent HIV.",
      "The drug, which is being brought to the commercial market by drugmaker Gilead Sciences, builds on NIH-backed research into earlier HIV medications. The drug's availability could lead to a significant drop in HIV cases worldwide, since a study found it was 100% effective in preventing transmission.",
      "An NIH official, who was not authorized to speak publicly, rebuked the claim that the effectiveness of current HIV prevention strategies meant a vaccine was no longer needed. \"The only way of ending the HIV epidemic in the U.S. and AIDS pandemic worldwide\" is with a vaccine, they said.",
      "Developing an effective HIV vaccine has been an elusive target for researchers, though scientists have hailed recent breakthroughs in the field.",
      "\"HIV has established roadblocks to us fighting it off, which are unparalleled in vaccinology. We've had to learn what each of the roadblocks are and to devise ways to overcome it. This virus mutates so quickly,\" said Duke professor of medicine Dr. Barton Ford Haynes, who is part of the Duke Human Vaccine Institute.",
      "Haynes said their work was essentially combining multiple different vaccines as part of their approach to designing an effective HIV vaccine.",
      "He praised lenacapavir as a \"wonderful development for the field,\" but said there was still a need for a vaccine. Lenacapavir requires injections every six months to remain effective, a challenging proposition even before steep cuts to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's domestic HIV programs and U.S.-backed HIV/AIDS foreign aid programs.",
      "\"The hope was that adding an HIV vaccine to all the preventive measures that we have would finally allow us to end the pandemic,\" Haynes said.",

      "A key U.S. inflation gauge slowed last month as President Donald Trump's tariffs have yet to noticeably push up prices. Spending by Americans slowed despite rising incomes, potentially an early reaction to higher prices on some imported goods.",
      "Friday's report from the Commerce Department showed that consumer prices rose just 2.1% in April compared with a year earlier, down from 2.3% in March and the lowest since September. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core prices rose 2.5% from a year earlier, below the March figure of 2.7%, and the lowest in more than four years. Economists track core prices because they typically provide a better read on where inflation is headed.",
      "The figures show inflation is still declining from its post-pandemic spike, which reached the highest level in four decades in July 2022. Economists and some business executives have warned that prices will likely head higher as Trump's widespread tariffs take effect, though the timing and impact of those duties are now in doubt after they were struck down late Wednesday in court, only to be temporarily reinstated by a federal appeals court in Washington, D.C.",
      "On a monthly basis, overall prices and core prices both increased just 0.1% from March to April. The cost of big-ticket manufactured goods rose a hefty 0.5%, though that increase was offset by a 0.1 decline in other goods, such as groceries. The cost of services rose just 0.1% from March to April.",
      "Americans cool off on spending",
      "The big increase in durable goods prices could reflect the early impact of tariffs. Americans also cut back their spending on longer-lasting factory goods in April, the report showed.",
      "Overall consumer spending \u2014 which includes spending on services \u2014 rose 0.2% in April from March, the report said, but that's down from a big 0.7% rise in March.",
      "The slowdown in spending could reflect some early caution on the part of consumers, economists said, in response to higher goods prices. It also suggests that some of the spending jump in March reflected consumers purchasing items like cars to get in front of the impact of tariffs.",
      "\" This is unsurprising, given the implementation of tariffs,\" Harry Chambers, assistant economist at Capital Economics said in a research note. \"While tariffs may have started to weigh on consumers, this is far from a disaster,\" he added.",
      "\"The pulling forward of consumer spending ahead of the tariff increases will continue to dampen household spending in the coming months, especially as they face higher prices and a softening labor market,\" Kathy Bostjancic, chief economist at Nationwide, said in an email. \"We anticipate that the improved inflation trend will reverse in the second half of the year as companies are forced to begin passing along a portion of the increased tariffs in order to protect profit margins.\"",
      "Walmart executives said earlier this month that the retail giant would increase prices for many products in May and June to account for the tariffs, while electronics chain Best Buy's CEO Corie Barry said Thursday the company is increasing some prices as well because of the duties, as a \"last resort.\"",
      "At the same time, incomes \u2014 before adjusting for inflation \u2014 rose a healthy 0.8% in April. Much of that gain reflected an increase in Social Security benefits as a result of the Social Security Fairness Act. The law signed in January by\u00a0former President Biden, granted retroactive benefits for some retired teachers, fire fighters, and federal workers whose incomes previously weren't fully counted toward Social Security benefits because they have pensions.",
      "The inflation-fighters at the Federal Reserve said at their most recent meeting May 6-7 that inflation is still elevated, compared with their target of 2%. Fed officials, who focus more on core prices, broadly support keeping their key interest rate steady while they evaluate the impact of the tariffs on inflation and jobs.",

      "But the duties were allowed to remain in effect while the Trump administration appeals the ruling against them. And administration officials say they will find other legal authorities, if needed, to implement the tariffs.

Its extremely elongated orbit swings out more than 1,600 times the distance between the Earth and the Sun, taking it into the ring of icy rocks around the solar system called the Oort cloud. It goes so far out, it could have passed by stars other than our sun in the past, Cheng said.",

      "The discovery suggests \"there are many hundreds of similar things on similar orbits\" in the Kuiper Belt beyond Neptune, Cheng said.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Get ready for several years of even more record-breaking heat that pushes Earth to more deadly, fiery and uncomfortable extremes, two of the world's top weather agencies forecast.",
      "There's an 80% chance the world will break another annual temperature record in the next five years, and it's even more probable that the world will again exceed the international temperature threshold set 10 years ago, according to a five-year forecast released Wednesday by the World Meteorological Organization and the U.K. Meteorological Office.",
      "Last year's record was just the latest in a decade of record-breaking\u00a0heat, with every year since 2015 ranking among the 10 hottest ever recorded.",
      "\"Higher global mean temperatures may sound abstract, but it translates in real life to a higher chance of extreme weather: stronger hurricanes, stronger precipitation, droughts,\" said Cornell University climate scientist Natalie Mahowald, who wasn't part of the calculations but said they made sense. \"So higher global mean temperatures translates to more lives lost.\"",
      "With every tenth of a degree the world warms from human-caused climate change \"we will experience higher frequency and more extreme events (particularly heat waves but also droughts, floods, fires and human-reinforced hurricanes/typhoons),\" emailed Johan Rockstrom, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany. He was not part of the research.",
      "And for the first time there's a chance - albeit slight - that before the end of the decade, the world's annual temperature will shoot past the Paris climate accord goal of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) and hit a more alarming 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) of heating since the mid-1800s, the two agencies said.",
      "There's an 86% chance that one of the next five years will pass 1.5 degrees and a 70% chance that the five years as a whole will average more than that global milestone, they figured.",
      "The projections come from more than 200 forecasts using computer simulations run by 10 global centers of scientists.",
      "\"We have just experienced the ten warmest years on record. Unfortunately, this WMO report provides no sign of respite over the coming years, and this means that there will be a growing negative impact on our economies, our daily lives, our ecosystems and our planet,\" said WMO Deputy Secretary-General Ko Barrett.",
      "\"Continued climate monitoring and prediction is essential to provide decision-makers with science-based tools and information to help us adapt,\" she said.",
      "Fears of repeats",
      "Ten years ago, the same teams figured there was a similar remote chance - about 1% - that one of the upcoming years would exceed that critical 1.5 degree threshold and then it happened last year. This year, a 2-degree Celsius above pre-industrial year enters the equation in a similar manner, something UK Met Office longer term predictions chief Adam Scaife and science scientist Leon Hermanson called \"shocking.\"",
      "\"It's not something anyone wants to see, but that's what the science is telling us,\" Hermanson said. Two degrees of warming is the secondary threshold, the one considered less likely to break, set by the 2015 Paris agreement.",
      "Technically, even though 2024 was 1.5 degrees Celsius warmer than pre-industrial times, the Paris climate agreement's threshold is for a 20-year time period, so it has not been exceeded. Factoring in the past 10 years and forecasting the next 10 years, the world is now probably about 1.4 degrees Celsius (2.5 degrees Fahrenheit) hotter since the mid 1800s, World Meteorological Organization climate services director Chris Hewitt estimated.",
      "\"With the next five years forecast to be more than 1.5C warmer than preindustrial levels on average, this will put more people than ever at risk of severe heat waves, bringing more deaths and severe health impacts unless people can be better protected from the effects of heat. Also we can expect more severe wildfires as the hotter atmosphere dries out the landscape,\" said Richard Betts, head of climate impacts research at the UK Met Office and a professor at the University of Exeter.",
      "Ice in the Arctic - which will continue to warm 3.5 times faster than the rest of the world - will melt and seas will rise faster, Hewitt said.",
      "What tends to happen is that global temperatures rise like riding on an escalator, with temporary and natural El Nino weather cycles acting like jumps up or down on that escalator, scientists said. But lately, after each jump from an El Nino, which adds warming to the globe, the planet doesn't go back down much, if at all.",
      "\"Record temperatures immediately become the new normal,\" said Stanford University climate scientist Rob Jackson.",

      "After spectacular back-to-back upper stage failures in January and March, SpaceX launched another Super Heavy-Starship rocket Tuesday on the program's ninth test flight, but ran into fresh problems that resulted in the loss of both stages before they could carry out controlled descents to splashdown.",
      "The Super Heavy first stage, following a deliberately steeper, more stressful descent trajectory toward splashdown near the Texas Gulf Coast, suffered a catastrophic failure at the moment its engines reignited for what would have been a relatively gentle splashdown.",
      "SpaceX confirmed the stage had been lost, but given the extreme nature of the testing, the loss was not an out-of-the-blue surprise. The Starship upper stage, meanwhile, managed to make it into its planned suborbital trajectory after an apparently flawless performance from its six engines.",
      "But a few minutes later, a door on the side of the rocket failed to open, preventing the planned release of simulated Starlink satellites in a test of the rocket's Pez-like deployment system.",
      "With that test deferred to a future flight, SpaceX engineers hoped to reignite a single Raptor engine to test its start-up capability in space. But an apparent propellant leak put the spacecraft into a slow spin that ruled out the restart and a controlled reentry and splashdown.",
      "The Starship has to enter at the right angle and in a precise orientation to survive reentry heating and aerodynamic \"loads.\" Entering in a spin doomed the Starship to a catastrophic breakup.",
      "\"Starship made it to the scheduled ship engine cutoff, so big improvement over last flight!\" SpaceX founder and CEO Elon Musk wrote on X. \"Also, no significant loss of heat shield tiles during ascent. Leaks caused loss of main tank pressure during the coast and re-entry phase. Lot of good data to review.\"",
      "He added that the Super Heavy launch cadence for the next three flights will be faster, at approximately one per month or less, assuming, of course, engineers reviewing telemetry can quickly pin down what went wrong and implement fixes to correct the problems.",
      "The huge rocket's launching, known as Integrated Flight Test 9, got underway with a ground-shaking liftoff at 7:37 p.m. EDT from SpaceX's sprawling Boca Chica, Texas, manufacturing and flight facility \u2014 Starbase \u2014 on the Texas coast.",
      "The mission featured the first use of a previously flown Super Heavy first stage, which flew itself back to capture by giant mechanical arms on the launch tower during the program's seventh test flight in January.",
      "For the program's latest launch, the Super Heavy, powered by 33 methane-fueled Raptor engines generating up to 16 million pounds of thrust, followed the same ascent flight plan as previous missions, propelling the Starship upper stage out of the thick lower atmosphere on an easterly trajectory toward the Straits of Florida.",
      "Equipped with six Raptors of its own, the 160-foot-long Starship separated from its booster about two and a half minutes after liftoff, heading for a suborbital trajectory carrying it toward a planned vertical splashdown in the southern Indian Ocean.",
      "The Super Heavy, meanwhile, used a different method for flipping around for the trip back to the launch site in a bid to save propellants. It was also programmed to fly a much steeper descent than usual to learn more about the thermal and aerodynamic stresses it can safely endure.",
      "\"The booster will attempt to fly at a higher angle of attack during its descent,\" SpaceX said on its website. \"By increasing the amount of atmospheric drag on the vehicle, a higher angle of attack can result in a lower descent speed which in turn requires less propellant for the initial landing burn.\"",
      "\"Getting real-world data on how the booster is able to control its flight at this higher angle of attack will contribute to improved performance on future vehicles, including the next generation of Super Heavy,\" SpaceX said.",
      "As a result of the high-stress tests, SpaceX targeted a splashdown in the Gulf instead of attempting a launch pad capture where critical infrastructure could be damaged in a landing mishap.",
      "As it turned out, that was a good decision.",
      "Launch attempt follows two Starship breakups",
      "Tuesday's launch came on the heels of back-to-back Starship upper stage breakups during the two previous test flights that generated spectacular showers of flaming debris along the flight paths.",
      "Since then, SpaceX engineers have carried out extensive testing and implemented multiple upgrades and improvements to minimize the chances for similar failures. The Federal Aviation Administration, which oversaw both failure investigations, gave SpaceX permission to proceed with IFT-9 last week after wrapping up the IFT-8 review.",
      "\"The FAA conducted a comprehensive safety review of the SpaceX Starship Flight 8 mishap and determined that the company has satisfactorily addressed the causes of the mishap, and therefore, the Starship vehicle can return to flight,\" the agency said in a statement. \"The FAA will verify SpaceX implements all corrective actions.\"",
      "In both of the previous failures, commercial airline traffic in and around the Straits of Florida was held up pending confirmation falling debris was no longer a threat. For the ninth flight, the length of the Aircraft Hazard Area was expanded from about 1,000 statute miles to around 1,840 miles and SpaceX was required to launch the rocket during non-peak air travel periods.",
      "Plans for the moon and Mars",
      "The Super Heavy-Starship rocket is critical to NASA's plans to land astronauts on the moon in the next few years and to Musk's plans to eventually send humans to Mars.",
      "NASA plans to use a variant of the Starship upper stage as a lunar lander in the agency's Artemis program. NASA wants to use its own rocket and crew capsule to ferry astronauts to lunar orbit where the SpaceX lander will be waiting to carry them down to the surface.",
      "The Trump administration wants to cancel NASA's Space Launch System rocket and Orion crew capsule, leaving the future of the Artemis program, as it's currently envisioned, in doubt. For his part, Musk has argued the United States should pass up moon missions, which he called a \"distraction,\" and instead head directly to Mars.",
      "In any case, the Super Heavy-Starship rocket is expected to play a major role in future deep space exploration, regardless of the target. But multiple successful test flights will be needed to demonstrate the safety and reliability needed for astronauts and passengers heading to the moon, Mars or beyond.",
      "In an interview for \"CBS Sunday Morning,\" taped shortly before Tuesday's launch, Musk told correspondent David Pogue, \"If we're lucky, we've probably got about a 50% chance of sending ... ships from Earth to Mars at the end of next year. So November, December next year, in about 18 months.\"",
      "Asked if that timeline was realistic, Musk replied, \"Well, I try to give the 50th percentile. ... So you should expect half the time I'm wrong.\" [See more of the exclusive interview with Musk on \"CBS Sunday Morning,\" Sunday, June 1.]",
      "SpaceX made changes after two catastrophic explosions",
      "The last two Starships, launched Jan. 16 and March 6, both ended with unrelated catastrophic explosions as they neared their planned sub-orbital trajectories.",
      "During the January flight, a propellant leak in an unpressurized \"attic\" above the Raptor engines led to sustained fires that eventually triggered shutdown of all but one of the spacecraft's engines. Telemetry was lost eight minutes and 20 seconds after launch and moments later, the vehicle broke apart.",
      "\"The most probable root cause for the loss of ship was identified as a harmonic response several times stronger in flight than had been seen during testing, which led to increased stress on hardware in the propulsion system,\" SpaceX said on its website. \"The subsequent propellant leaks exceeded the venting capability of the ship's attic area and resulted in sustained fires.\"",
      "After extensive ground tests, SpaceX made changes to propellant feedlines, and thrust levels and installed additional vents and a new nitrogen purge system in the attic to reduce the potential for fire.",
      "Those fixes appeared to work as expected during the Starship's eighth test flight in March, but the upper stage again suffered a catastrophic failure. This time around, the Starship suffered a \"hardware failure in one of the upper stage Raptor engines that resulted in inadvertent propellant mixing and ignition,\" SpaceX said on its website.",
      "To fix the problem, upper stage Raptors now feature a new nitrogen purge system, improvements to the propellant drain system and tighter joints in key areas. SpaceX is also developing an improved Raptor engine that will eliminate several failure modes.",

    "story": [
      "Republican Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa defended herself Monday after drawing attention for telling a town hall attendee worried about proposed changes to Medicaid that \"we all are going to die.\"",
      "\"I'm very compassionate, and you need to listen to the entire conversation,\" Ernst told CBS News on Monday.",
      "Ernst's now-viral musings on mortality came during a contentious town hall meeting Friday, as attendees grilled the senator about a GOP-backed domestic policy bill that passed the House last month. The legislation \u2014 titled the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, after President Trump referred to the measure that way \u2014 would impose work requirements on some Medicaid recipients, among other changes.",
      "At one point, as Ernst explained some of the legislation's changes to the low-income health insurance program, a person appeared to yell that people will die.",
      "\"People are not \u2014 well, we all are going to die, so for heaven's sakes,\" Ernst responded.",
      "Ernst went on to say that the legislation would \"focus on those that are most vulnerable\" and added, \"those that meet the eligibility requirements for Medicaid we will protect.\"",
      "The senator later dug in and posted a sarcastic apology video to Instagram.",
      "\"I made an incorrect assumption that everyone in the auditorium understood that, yes, we are all going to perish from this Earth. So, I apologize,\" Ernst said in the video. \"I'm really, really glad that I did not have to bring up the subject of the Tooth Fairy as well.\"",
      "The town hall comments drew criticism from some potential opponents of Ernst, who is up for reelection next year. Nathan Sage, who is running for the Democratic nomination for Senate, said Ernst is \"not even trying to hide her contempt for us.\" And Democratic state Rep. JD Scholten announced Monday he's entering the race, saying in an Instagram post he wasn't planning to launch his campaign now but \"can't sit on the sidelines\" after Ernst's town hall.",
      "The House-passed bill would add restrictions to Medicaid, including a work, volunteer or schooling requirement for non-disabled adults without children. The bill would also add more frequent eligibility checks, cut funding for states that use the Medicaid system to cover undocumented immigrants, freeze provider taxes and ban coverage for gender transition services.",
      "The bill's proposed changes to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, better known as food stamps, could save hundreds of billions of dollars, which would help pay for extending Mr. Trump's 2017 tax cuts and boosting border security.",
      "But before it reaches Mr. Trump's desk, the bill still needs to pass the Senate, where some Republicans are pushing to roll back some of the Medicaid cuts. In last week's town hall, Ernst said she agrees with parts of the legislation passed by the House, but \"the bill will be changing.\"",

    "summary": "The bill containing Trump's tax cuts and border and defense spending is expected to face some hurdles in the Senate.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Senate this week is taking up the massive budget package containing President Trump's second-term agenda, a measure that squeaked through the House with a one-vote margin, solely with Republican votes. Its path through the Senate seems destined to be similarly narrow, with the package almost certain to be revised, since parts of it are opposed by a handful of GOP senators critical to its passage.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, recently ventured to the other side of the U.S. Capitol to remind Republican senators \"that we are one team\" and pleaded with them to keep the bill substantially intact.",
      "\"I encouraged them to make as few modifications as possible, remembering that I have a very delicate balance on our very diverse Republican caucus over in the House,\" Johnson said in an interview with \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a South Dakota Republican, acknowledged that balance, but told reporters \"the Senate will have its imprint\" on the bill. He can afford three \"no\" votes from Republicans if all Democrats vote to block its passage in the Senate, and there are no absences.",
      "GOP Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky has already indicated he opposes the bill because it will \"explode the debt.\" Including interest, the House bill would increase the debt by $3.1 trillion, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. Similar to the House, in the Senate, there are Republicans who think there's not enough cost cutting, while others argue some provisions are too draconian.",
      "These are the key sticking points as the legislation moves to the Senate:",
      "Medicaid changes",
      "Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Josh Hawley of Missouri are among the Republicans who have expressed concern about some of the changes to Medicaid, a government program that provides health care to low-income Americans as well as those with disabilities. And the trio of senators supported an amendment to the budget resolution earlier this year that would have removed the language instructing the committee overseeing Medicaid to make $880 billion in cuts. That amendment failed.",
      "The House-passed legislation includes new work requirements that would apply to childless Medicaid recipients without disabilities between the ages of 19 and 64. It also requires states to conduct more frequent eligibility checks on Medicaid recipients to root out waste, fraud and abuse, and it would penalize states that provide state-funded health care to undocumented immigrants. The bill also seeks to lower federal costs by freezing states' provider taxes at current rates and prohibiting them from establishing new provider taxes, among other changes.",
      "While these Senate Republicans have generally been supportive of the work requirements, some have warned that they will not support the bill if it includes any cuts to Medicaid benefits.",
      "In a New York Times opinion piece published earlier this month, Hawley called \"slashing health insurance for the working poor\" both \"morally wrong and politically suicidal.\"",
      "A handful of senators have also warned of the impact of freezing provider taxes at current levels, since states use the taxes to help fund their share of Medicaid costs, although Murkowski has expressed support for this. Hawley said he's concerned about the impact on rural hospitals, while also voicing opposition to new copay requirements for beneficiaries.",
      "\"I'm concerned about the provider tax. That's not a direct benefit cut, but if it closes rural hospitals, then people can't get coverage,\" Hawley told reporters. \"And I'm concerned about the cost sharing, I guess we're calling it \u2014 the sick tax. That's kind of a tax on benefit. You can't get your benefit in terms of seeing the doctor until you pay money out of pocket.\"",
      "He added, \"If rural hospitals close, what's the difference between that and a benefit cut? That's pretty tough.\"",
      "Deeper spending cuts",
      "Meanwhile, a number of fiscal hawks have balked at the bill's spending cuts or even threatened to oppose the measure without securing deeper cuts, echoing the frustration expressed on the other side of the Capitol by members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus throughout negotiations on the package.",
      "Sen. Ron Johnson, a Wisconsin Republican, said the package's aim to cut $1.5 trillion \"isn't squat, quite honestly.\" And Sen. Rick Scott, a Florida Republican, has also rebuffed the cuts, saying the amount is \"not going to do it.\"",
      "\"Their bill would not pass in the Senate, and I think there's plenty of us that would vote against it,\" Scott told reporters earlier this month, adding that the upper chamber should go through every line in the budget to find savings.",
      "Sen. Roger Marshall, a Kansas Republican, said \"the job of the Senate is to try to increase the cuts in spending,\" calling the House cuts a \"great start\" while urging the Senate to hit $2 trillion. And Sen. Ted Cruz, a Texas Republican, told the network that he believes \"the Senate is going to cut spending more than the House.\"",
      "\"We're going to see the Senate be more fiscally conservative,\" Cruz added.",
      "Sen. John Kennedy, a Louisiana Republican, agreed that the Senate needs to consider steeper cuts.",
      "\"I've said repeatedly I'm for cutting until we run out of votes,\" Kennedy said.",
      "Rolling back IRA clean energy tax credits",
      "The House-passed bill would also roll back some of the clean energy tax credits under the Biden-era climate and health care law, including an earlier phasing out of a tax break for clean energy vehicles. But the provisions could face opposition in the upper chamber.",
      "Last month, Murkowksi, along with GOP Sens. John Curtis of Utah, Jerry Moran of Kansas and Thom Tillis of North Carolina, penned a letter to the Senate majority leader to \"emphasize the importance of maintaining a stable and predictable tax framework to promote domestic energy development.\"",
      "\"While we support fiscal responsibility and prudent efforts to streamline the tax code, we caution against the full-scale repeal of current credits, which could lead to significant disruptions for the American people and weaken our position as a global energy leader,\" the group wrote.",
      "Tillis told reporters after the House passed the bill that the Senate needs to \"look at the specifics\" of revising the clean energy tax credits, saying \"we've got to make sure the businesses who believe the government was setting this as a priority don't have a lot of stranded costs.\"",
      "At the same time, other Senate Republicans, like Johnson, have called for eliminating the clean energy tax credits, setting up a possible clash within the conference.",
      "State and local tax deduction",
      "Among the provisions that spurred extensive debate in the House was one allowing residents to deduct more in state and local taxes on their federal returns, known as SALT. Divisions over an increase to the SALT cap threatened to sink the package in the days leading up to its passage in the lower chamber as a handful of blue-state Republicans fought for a higher cap, ultimately settling for $40,000, an increase from $10,000.",
      "In the Senate, the deduction is not an issue, since none of the blue states have Republican senators. Accordingly, a number of Senate Republicans have indicated that they oppose its inclusion in the bill.",
      "\"Eliminate it,\" Johnson, the Wisconsin senator, told reporters of the SALT cap increase.",
      "Republican Sen. Kevin Cramer of North Dakota told The Hill that the cap could potentially be cut in half once the Senate makes its changes.",
      "But the House speaker said he warned senators that changing the provision would not only risk getting it through the lower chamber again, but also the Republican majority.",
      "\"In the House, we do have a number of members who are elected in places like New York and California and New Jersey, and they have to provide some relief to their constituents,\" the Louisiana Republican told \"Face the Nation.\" \"Those are what we call our majority makers. Those are the people who are elected in the toughest districts and help us have the numbers to keep the majority in the House, and so, this is political reality.\"",
      "Debt ceiling",
      "Fiscal hawks are also unhappy with the inclusion of a provision raising the debt ceiling by trillions of dollars. The House-passed bill includes a $4 trillion debt ceiling hike, while the Senate's budget blueprint contained a $5 trillion increase. The debate comes as Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told congressional leaders earlier this month that the federal government could be unable to pay its bills as soon as August if Congress doesn't act.",
      "Paul has been the most vocal in opposing an increase to the debt limit. The Kentucky Republican has said \"there's nothing fiscally conservative about expanding the debt ceiling more than we've ever done it before.\" Paul said he could be convinced to support the package if the debt ceiling provision is removed and voted on separately.",
      "Instead, Paul has proposed a short-term increase of $500 billion, raising the debt ceiling for a matter of months, which he said would allow conservatives to verify that spending cuts have actually been implemented before approving a further hike.",
      "\"If I vote for the $5 trillion debt, who's left in Washington that cares about the debt?\" Paul said\u00a0Sunday on \"Face the Nation.\" \"The GOP will own the debt once they vote for this.\"",
      "Paul's Senate colleague, Johnson, also backs splitting the package into multiple parts, as well as a smaller, short-term extension.",
      "Food stamps",
      "The package also cuts billions in federal dollars from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as SNAP or food stamps. The change will require states to cover a share of the costs to provide benefits that help low-income individuals and families pay for groceries. Currently, the program is fully funded by the federal government, although states take on some of the cost to administer it. Beginning in 2028, states will have to chip in for the program as well.",
      "\"That's something that I heard some members voice concern about,\" Sen. John Boozman, an Arkansas Republican, said before Memorial Day. \"So, we'll need to address that.\"",
      "Alan  He, \n                                                  \n                                  Emily  Hung and \n                                                  \n                                  Cristina  Corujo\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "summary": "Former DOJ attorney Greg Rosen said Trump's decision to pardon all Jan. 6 defendants sent \"a terrible message to the American people.\"",
    "story": [
      "The federal prosecutor who helped lead the largest federal criminal case in American history has resigned his position in the Justice Department.",
      "Longtime Assistant U.S. Attorney Greg Rosen, the chief of the Justice Department's Capitol Siege Section, has departed for a post with a private law firm.",
      "In an interview with CBS News, Rosen said President Trump's pardons of the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol rioters continue to shock and alarm the federal investigators who handled the cases.",
      "\"The message that [the pardons] send is that political violence towards a political goal is acceptable in a modern democratic society,\" Rosen said. \"That, from my perspective, is anathema to a constitutional republic.\"",
      "Rosen helped oversee a team of Justice Department attorneys as the agency grappled with an historically large onslaught of criminal cases after the Capitol riot, which injured dozens of police officers and caused millions of dollars in damage to the Capitol complex.",
      "He said the president's decision to pardon all \u2014 not just some \u2014 of the Capitol riot defendants was a stunning decision that has caused damage.",
      "\"It sends a terrible message to the American people,\" Rosen said. \"Individuals who were duly \u2014 and appropriately \u2014 convicted of federal crimes ranging in culpability are immediately let loose without any supervision, without any remorse, without any rehabilitation to civil society.\"",
      "Rosen handled a range of criminal cases during his tenure at the U.S. Attorney's Office of the District of Columbia, one of the largest and most powerful of the federal prosecutors' offices in the nation. In addition to drug and gun crimes, Rosen took on responsibility for the section handling Jan. 6 cases. He was a lead prosecutor in the case of Leo Kelly, an Iowa man who was convicted at trial in May 2023.",
      "He took note of the Justice Department's remarkable success rate in Jan. 6 trials, securing partial or full convictions in 100% of jury trials. Rosen blasted criticism from Trump supporters who allege the juries were biased or the prosecutions were politicized.",
      "\"The reason those juries convicted \u2014 and the reason those judges convicted individuals \u2014 was not because of some bug in the due process,\" Rosen said. \"It was because the evidence was overwhelming. It was the most videotaped crime in American history.\"",
      "Soon after Mr. Trump's Inauguration-Day pardons of the Jan. 6 defendants, Justice Department officials demoted or fired some of the prosecutors who handled the Jan. 6 prosecutions and disbanded the Capitol Siege Section. Critics have accused the administration of seeking vengeance or revenge, targeting attorneys with solid track records.",
      "\"To see those talented prosecutors be marginalized or removed from office is an affront to the independence of the department,\" Rosen said.",
      "The Justice Department and the D.C. U.S. Attorney's Office did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "Rosen will soon be starting his new job as attorney at the Rogers, Joseph O'Donnell law firm in Washington, D.C.\u00a0He told CBS News, \"I felt like it was time for a change \u2014 and a time to take what I've been doing and what I've learned over the course of 15 years in state and federal practice \u2014 and bring it to the private sector, where I can benefit clients who are being scrutinized by the government.\"",

      "The northern lights may be visible in parts of the U.S. tonight following weekend solar storms, forecasters said.",
      "The sun burped out a huge burst of energy called a coronal mass ejection last week, prompting space weather forecasters to issue a rare, severe solar storm alert on Sunday. Another one headed toward Earth on Monday could produce more aurora sightings.",

    "summary": "A man is facing multiple charges after allegedly attacking people with Molotov cocktails at a march in Boulder to support Israeli hostages still being held in Gaza.",
    "story": [
      "Officials in Boulder, Colorado, have released new information about the attack Sunday on a group of peaceful demonstrators who were marching to support Israeli hostages in Gaza. They now say 12 people were injured, up from eight reported earlier, when the suspect hurled Molotov cocktails at the crowd.",
      "The incident is being investigated as an act of terrorism, according to the FBI, which described it as targeted. The suspect, 45-year-old Mohamed Sabry Soliman, was taken into custody at the scene. He is facing multiple felony charges as well as a federal hate crime charge.",
      "Soliman is being charged in state court with 16 counts of attempted first-degree murder, eight \"with intent and deliberation\" and the other eight \"with extreme indifference,\" Boulder District Attorney Michael Dougherty said Monday. Officials said additional charges could be added. He's also being charged with two counts of use of an incendiary device and 16 counts of attempted use of an incendiary device.",
      "Here is what we know so far.",
      "What happened in Boulder?",
      "The attack occurred around 1:30 p.m. Sunday at the outdoor Pearl Street Mall in Boulder, near the historic County Courthouse in the city's downtown. It was the site of a march held to advocate for the hostages who were taken from southern Israel by Hamas militants on Oct. 7, 2023, and have yet to be released.",
      "Witnesses said the suspect had a \"makeshift flamethrower\" and yelled \"Free Palestine!\" as he threw Molotov cocktails at demonstrators, leaving multiple people with burns, according to the FBI. Those who suffered injuries had been standing outside the courthouse. In the aftermath, a burn scar was visible in front of the courthouse building.",
      "Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, who is Jewish, condemned the attack, calling it a \"heinous and targeted act on the Jewish community.\"",
      "The suspect had another 16 unused Molotov cocktails \"within arms reach\" at the time of his arrest, investigators said during a news conference Monday afternoon.",
      "The FBI's Colorado office said those who attended the march were participating in a scheduled, weekly event. Organized by the group Run for Their Lives, local branches hold community walks and runs in different cities within Colorado, around the country and internationally.",
      "\"We are a local chapter of the global initiative Run For Their Lives,\" reads the description of the Boulder chapter's Facebook page. \"We do an 18 minute weekly walk to show international solidarity with the hostages taken from Israel during the 10/7 massacre, and still being held in Gaza. We will walk until they are all released.\"",
      "Rachel Amaru, an organizer at Run for Their Lives in Boulder, called the attack \"blatantly antisemitic\" in comments to CBS Colorado. It took place less than two weeks after two Israeli Embassy employees were killed in a shooting outside the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C., which is also being investigated as a hate crime.",
      "Omer Shachar, a co-leader of Run for Their Lives Denver, told CBS News the group contacted Boulder police several times about security concerns around the event prior to Sunday. CBS News has reached out to Boulder police for comment.",
      "Who was injured in the Boulder attack?",
      "Police initially said the victims of the Boulder attack included four women and four men, whose ages range from 52 to 88. One of them was seriously injured, according to Boulder Police Chief Stephan Redfearn, who said the person had been hospitalized in critical condition.",
      "The 88-year-old is a Holocaust refugee who fled Europe, according to Rabbi Israel Wilhelm, the Chabad director at the University of Colorado Boulder. Wilhelm described her as a \"very loving person.\"",
      "Another victim is a professor at the university, the rabbi said.",
      "Two of the injured were flown by helicopter to the burn unit at UCHealth, and four others were taken to Boulder Community Health, according to police and the hospitals. The injured patients who were taken to Boulder Community Health had either been discharged or transferred elsewhere later Sunday night, the hospital said, although it did not specify how many were discharged versus transferred.",
      "Officials said Monday that four more people came forward later with less severe injuries.",
      "Who is the Boulder attack suspect?",
      "The suspect was identified as Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, FBI Special Agent in Charge Mike Michalek said Sunday. He is facing multiple felony charges and a federal hate crimes charge.",
      "Witnesses heard Soliman yell \"Free Palestine\" during the attack, according to Michalek, who said it was \"clear this is a targeted act of violence.\" Two sources told CBS News that witnesses who spoke to investigators also alleged the suspect shouted \"End Zionist\" during the attack.",
      "The suspect told investigators he \"researched on YouTube how to make Molotov Cocktails, purchased the ingredients to do so, and constructed them,\" an affidavit filed by the Department of Justice reads.",
      "He also allegedly \"stated that he wanted to kill all Zionist people and wished they were all dead,\" and that he had been planning the attack for a year, the affidavit says.",
      "The suspect had tried to purchase a firearm but couldn't because he was not a U.S. citizen, so he resorted to Molotov cocktails instead, the acting U.S. attorney for Colorado, J. Bishop Grewell, said during a news conference Monday.",
      "Soliman is an Egyptian national, government officials confirmed to CBS Colorado. Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said he first arrived in the United States in August 2022, originally on a non-immigrant visa that expired in February 2023. She said he filed for asylum a month after arriving in the U.S., in September 2022, but did not provide details about the outcome of that immigration case or whether it was resolved.",
      "Soliman had recently been living in Colorado Springs, about 100 miles south of Boulder.",
      "He made his first court appearance on Monday and could be seen with a bandage over the right side of his face. He responded \"yes\" when asked whether he understood a judge's question on a protection order against him that keeps him from contacting the victims of his alleged crimes. His next court hearing is Thursday for an official filing of charges.",
      "After the attack on Sunday, authorities evacuated three blocks of Pearl Street for the rest of the day as they probed a vehicle of interest in the area, which an FBI official later said belonged to the suspect. On Sunday night, the FBI said it was \"conducting court-authorized law enforcement activity related to the attack\" in El Paso County, which includes Colorado Springs.",
      "FBI Director Kash Patel, FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino and National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard have referred to the incident as a terrorist attack.",
      "\"The @ODNIgov's National Counterterrorism Center is working with the FBI and local law enforcement on the ground investigating the targeted terror attack against a weekly meeting of Jewish community members who had just gathered in Boulder, CO to raise awareness of the hostages kidnapped during Hamas' attack on Israel on Oct. 7,\" Gabbard wrote in a social media post.",
      "Soliman's former employer, an independently owned medical clinic in Centennial, Colorado, called Veros Health, told CBS News he had a valid work visa while employed there from May 2023 to August 2023.",
      "\"We can confirm that Mohamed Soliman worked with Veros from May 2023 to August 2023. He was hired in our accounting department,\" Roni Mushovic, the CFO at Veros, said in a statement, noting that Soliman underwent the hiring process through ADP, which handles human resources for the clinic.",
      "\"At the time of hire, he was confirmed to have a valid work Visa, which was noted to expire on March 2025,\" Mushovic said.",
      "Prior to Sunday's attack, Soliman was driving for Uber, which required him to have a valid Social Security number, CBS News has learned. According to an Uber spokesperson, he passed a background check and provided a photo ID and Social Security number when the company hired him in the spring of 2023, and passed another background check \"about nine months ago.\"",

    "summary": "The State Department says all visa applicants who are seeking to travel to Harvard \u2014 visitors as well as students \u2014 should face additional vetting, according to an email obtained by CBS News.",
    "story": [
      "The State Department has told U.S. embassies and consulates to expand vetting for all visa applicants who wish to come to Harvard University, including visitors as well as students, according to an email obtained by CBS News.",
      "In an internal email dated May 29 and sent by Secretary of State Marco Rubio's office to all U.S. diplomatic and consular posts, consular officers were told that this \"additional vetting\" applies to anyone wanting a visa to come to Harvard for \"any purpose.\" That includes current or prospective students, faculty, employees, contractors, guest speakers and even tourists, per the email.",
      "The email told consular officers to \"conduct a complete screening of the online presence of any nonimmigrant visa applicant seeking to travel to Harvard University for any purpose.\" Officers should also \"consider whether the lack of any online presence, or having social media accounts restricted to \"private\" or with limited visibility, may be reflective of evasiveness and call into question the applicant's credibility.\"",
      "The email said consular officers can also request applicants to set their social media accounts to \"public\" for vetting purposes.",
      "Notably, the email states that the new vetting procedure for Harvard will also serve as a \"pilot for expanded screening and vetting\" of visa applicants \"generally,\" including for student visas. The State Department \"may announce similar measures for other groups of visa applicants as appropriate, and in accordance with U.S. law\".",
      "A State Department spokesperson confirmed to CBS News on Monday the Trump administration has ordered \"additional vetting of any visa applicant traveling to Harvard University,\" with a goal of identifying applicants \"with histories of anti-Semitic harassment and violence.\" The spokesperson added the measures \"may also be expanded to other groups of applicants, as appropriate.\"",
      "A source familiar with the email who was granted anonymity to speak freely told CBS news that it will likely be difficult to implement the vetting instructions uniformly across all US consular sections around the world, and for all universities assuming this pilot process gets expanded to foreign applicants for other U.S. colleges.",
      "Earlier this week, the State Department told embassies it was preparing for \"expanded social media vetting\" of student visa applicants, according to a cable obtained by CBS News. The department ordered a halt to new student visa appointments in the interim.",
      "\"We take very seriously the process of vetting who it is that comes into the country, and we're going to continue to do that,\" State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce said in response to the visa appointment freeze earlier this week.",
      "The stricter vetting procedure now targeting America's leading global university is the result of two executive orders signed by President Trump: One that directed more vetting for visas, and one calling for a crackdown on antisemitism, per the email. The State Department spokesperson said the school has \"failed to maintain a campus environment free from violence and anti-Semitism.\"",
      "The Trump administration has taken aim at Harvard in recent weeks, accusing it of failing to respond to what it views as rampant antisemitic activity on campus.",
      "Last week, the administration sought to take away Harvard's ability to enroll foreign students \u2014 a significant threat for a school where just over one in four students are international. The order was blocked by a judge following a lawsuit from Harvard. The Trump administration has also frozen federal funding to the Ivy League school.",
      "Meanwhile, the Trump administration tried to revoke the student visa status of thousands of international students, many of whom appeared to draw the government's attention due to minor legal infractions. That policy was halted by a judge.",
      "Rubio said Wednesday the State Department will \"aggressively revoke\" visas for some Chinese international students, including those studying in \"critical fields\" and people with links to the Chinese Communist Party. China's embassy in the U.S. called the move \"politically motivated and discriminatory.\"",
      "And some international students who participated in pro-Palestinian protests have faced detention, under a law allowing the government to revoke visas for anyone deemed to pose \"adverse foreign policy consequences.\"",
      "When asked by reporters Friday whether he supports international students studying in the U.S., Mr. Trump said he does: \"We want to have great students here, we just don't want students that are causing trouble.\"",
      "\"I don't think Harvard's been acting very nicely,\" Mr. Trump said, reiterating his call to redirect funds from Harvard to trade schools. \"Harvard's trying to be a big shot.\"",

    "summary": "In 2023, the Supreme Court ruled against race-conscious college admissions. Now, data on the first class of students to enter since then gives a peek into what the future of college enrollment holds.",
    "story": [
      "The full impact of the Supreme Court's June 2023 ruling that colleges can't consider race in admissions may not be known for years. But a CBS News analysis of enrollment records shows the first class of freshmen since the high court's order is a little less diverse than the class before it.",
      "College admissions experts say there are signs campuses will trend toward less diversity at the same time some universities are facing intensifying pressure from the Trump administration to eliminate diversity programs and remove international students.",
      "CBS News gathered first-year enrollment data from 116 colleges and universities, 76 of which considered race in admissions before the Supreme Court ruling. The data showed the share of underrepresented minority students among those schools decreased by about 2 percentage points from fall 2023 to fall 2024.",
      "Underrepresented minority students include Hispanic, Black, Indigenous or Pacific Islander students. These are groups that have historically had disproportionately lower rates of college admissions.",
      "Among the 35 schools that did not previously consider race in admissions, the share of underrepresented minority students remained roughly the same, suggesting the ruling may have influenced diversity on campus.",
      "Five schools did not report whether or not they considered race in admissions.",
      "CBS News found the drop in diversity was even sharper at the most elite colleges and universities. At 17 schools that accept less than 10% of applicants, the share of minority students fell nearly 5 percentage points. This includes schools like Dartmouth, Princeton, Cornell, Brown and Tufts.",
      "Despite this, the most selective schools still had a slightly higher share of underrepresented minority students than other institutions we collected data from.",
      "While the one-year drop itself seems small, the fall 2024 semester was the first time the percentage of underrepresented minority students had decreased since at least 2015.",
      "Black students experienced perhaps the most significant one-year shift. At the 76 schools that previously considered race in admission but no longer do, the average share of Black students dropped from 6.4% in fall 2023 to 5.3% in fall 2024, the lowest level in the data collected since at least 2015.",
      "Early data \"sends up a warning flag\"",
      "Dominique Baker, an associate professor of education and public policy at the University of Delaware, said it's still too early to draw any concrete conclusions from this data.",
      "\"We like to look at trends over a longer period of time, because in any given year, we could see a blip that goes up, a blip that goes down,\" Baker said.",
      "But if the trend continues over four years \u2014 by the time these students are seniors \u2014 it could mean the campuses they attend will be significantly less diverse.",
      "For Baker, this \"sends up a warning flag.\"",
      "\"We're now starting to see ... early indicators that we might be seeing a negative trend developing in the share of students of color who are attending, particularly the underrepresented minority students that you all are talking about attending more selective institutions,\" she said.",
      "She pointed to research out of California, one of the nine states that had banned affirmative action prior to the Supreme Court ruling.",
      "A 2020 study found that enrollment among Black and Latino students at UCLA and UC Berkeley, the more selective campuses in the University of California system, fell by 40 percentage points after voters outlawed race conscious admissions (the state ban passed in 1996 and went into effect in 1998). It concluded that California's ban on affirmative action exacerbated socioeconomic inequities among Black and Brown students.",
      "Desmond Kuhn, an 18-year-old sociology and urban studies major at Columbia University who identifies as African American, said the Supreme Court ruling happened as he was starting to apply for college.",
      "\"It's very discouraging and also makes it harder to reach a lot of these, especially private elite universities, because a lot of generally Black and Hispanic communities don't have the same resources as, say, White and Asian communities,\" Kuhn said.",
      "He said he saw the difference in resources between his predominantly Black high school in the suburbs of Detroit and the predominantly White private boarding school where he retook his SAT.",
      "Columbia University published first-year enrollment numbers for fall 2024, but in a different format than the federal data collection, which we used in our analysis. In Columbia's reporting, the percentage of students who self-identified as Black or African American dropped from 20% for the class of 2027, to 12% for the class of 2028. (In this reporting method, students can identify with more than one race, whereas in the federal data, students could only pick one.)",
      "Columbia declined to provide CBS News data in the same format used for the analysis of other schools, so the university is not included in our overall findings.",
      "Other factors at play",
      "Across all schools, the share of students who did not report their race in enrollment records (and were classified as \"unknown\") grew significantly \u2014 the largest spike since at least 2015.",
      "While the data suggests the start of a downward trend in the share of underrepresented minority students at colleges and universities, the jump in the \"unknown\" category means the racial makeup of the class of 2028 could be different than what is being reported.",
      "If many of the students who did not report their race were White, then the share of White students would be higher than the reported data might suggest, lowering the share of underrepresented minority students. But if the students who did not report their race were Black or Hispanic, then the share of Black or Hispanic students may be higher than what is reported.",
      "\"That's part of the really, really big challenge of ... charting and thinking through who is currently enrolling at colleges and universities after the Supreme Court decision,\" Baker said.",
      "Tom Delahunt, the vice president for strategic recruitment and enrollment at Southwestern University in Texas, said the drop in underrepresented minority students could also be because of problems with the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA, that were at play while the future fall 2024 freshman class would have been making decisions about if and where to go to college.",
      "Typically, students can apply for the FAFSA on Oct. 1 each year. But in 2023, the form wasn't available until Dec. 30. As a result, schools couldn't offer financial aid on time because they did not have the FAFSA information, forcing students to wait for delayed offers.",
      "\"Delays, glitches, and other issues led to a 9% decline in submitted FAFSA applications among first-time applicants, and an overall decline of about 432,000 applications as of the end of August,\" said a report from the Government Accountability Office.",
      "Delahunt said that many of the students who had delayed FAFSAs would likely only make decisions about schools if their families had the money to go ahead without knowing how much they were going to have to pay. But many underrepresented minority students may come from poorer families that could not afford to guess how much college would cost.",
      "Impact of diversity on campus",
      "Experts said studies have found diversity of all kinds, not just racial diversity, is essential to students' education.",
      "\"These studies don't say that students of color benefit from diverse learning environments. White students also benefit. Every student benefits from a diverse learning environment,\" Baker, from the University of Delaware, said.",
      "Jennifer Levine, a first-year student at Stanford University who is half Asian and half Jewish, agreed. She participates in a residential humanities program, where she lives with the same students she takes classes with, a group she described as predominantly White. The uniformity, she said, makes for \"a worse learning space.\"",
      "\"I think that all academic environments are made better with more opinions, more experiences, people who have different sets of knowledge,\" she told CBS News. \"For me as someone who's not Black reading Toni Morrison, I can't offer my perspective on that in the sense of race.\"",
      "Stanford's first-year class has roughly half as many Black students this year compared to last year. Austin Shaw, one of those Black freshmen, said he can see the difference. He lives in a dorm that is themed around the Black diaspora, so many Black students choose to live there.",
      "\"All of us are very tight because we're literally like half of the Black freshman population,\" he said of his dormmates. \"But when you go out into class, it's a completely different vibe.\"",
      "Shaw said that about half of the students in his high school in Los Angeles were Black. One of the reasons he chose Stanford over other California schools was that it had a higher proportion of Black students.",
      "\"You become an expert on the subject of being Black, or you feel like you have to represent, or you feel like you have to talk for your community,\" he said. \"When I was in high school, where half of the class would be Black, you wouldn't have that expectation.\"",
      "Other ways to ensure a diverse student body",
      "Delahunt, of Southwestern University, said this ruling, along with other restrictions on diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, have made his job harder. He said his goal is to try to ensure that the student body reflects the community around it in Georgetown, Texas, just north of Austin.",
      "This is so \"when they leave ... they are ready for the next step of entering into society as a contributing member of society, that they understand how to work together. That we're going to have differences, and that's OK. How to work through those differences, how to work together to solve problems,\" Delahunt said.",
      "Now, without being able to see race and ethnicity on admissions forms, he must rely heavily on recruiting from high schools where he knows the population of the school is reflective of the mix of students he wants to come to Southwestern.",
      "\"Our job hasn't changed. Maybe the way we do it has to change a little bit. But our goals are the same,\" Delahunt said.",
      "Richard Kahlenberg, director of the American Identity Project at the Progressive Policy Institute, said that if schools were to consider socioeconomic status instead of race, they could still increase diversity on campus. Kahlenberg testified on behalf of Students for Fair Admissions in support of the ruling ending affirmative action.",
      "With data obtained through the legal process, he and an economist ran dozens of admissions simulations and found that considering socioeconomic status and ending preferential admissions for legacy students could increase diversity at Harvard and the University of North Carolina while maintaining academic caliber.",
      "\"If there were some universities that did not see declines in racial diversity, as we know there were some, then it's incumbent upon those institutions that saw larger drops to learn what happened,\" Kahlenberg said.",
      "He added that universities and colleges have argued that this method would be far more expensive, as it would increase the amount of financial aid the schools have to provide.",
      "\"It's not that race-neutral alternatives are ineffective, it's that they cost more money,\" he said.",
      "Some schools have increased socioeconomic diversity. UNC increased the number of students with federal Pell Grants to nearly a quarter of the class. Both Yale and Dartmouth's first-year classes had the highest-ever share of first-generation and low-income students, all while increasing their share of underrepresented minority students.",
      "All diversity, equity and inclusion efforts are at risk",
      "As universities adapt admissions processes to maintain diversity, they risk butting heads with an administration that is seeking to end all diversity, equity and inclusion efforts.",
      "The Department of Justice announced at the end of March that it is investigating four California universities to assess their compliance with the Supreme Court's ruling.",
      "University of California schools, which have not been allowed to use race as a factor in admissions directly since voters passed Proposition 209 in 1996, recently moved from using test scores and GPA for admissions to a \"comprehensive review\" process.",
      "That process looks \"at multiple factors beyond courses and grades to evaluate applicants' academic achievements in light of the opportunities available to them and the capacity each student demonstrates to contribute to the intellectual life of the campus,\" according to the University of California's admissions website.",
      "UC admissions for underrepresented minority students has increased since the initial drop following Prop 209, with the nine universities admitting the largest share of underrepresented minority students in its history in 2021. But the schools' student bodies are still less diverse than the California population or the cohort of high school graduates who meet UC admissions requirements.",
      "Underrepresented minorities make up about 32% of the UC fall 2024 freshman class. But they make up 46% of Californians and more than half of the state's high school graduates who meet the minimum academic requirements to get into UC schools.",
      "However schools choose to adapt, ignoring race in wholistic admissions entirely is unrealistic, said Levine, the mixed-race Stanford freshman.",
      "\"Parts of your identity can't be separated from your field of study, from your interests, from what you do,\" she said. \"My identity is tied to the kinds of things I'm interested in, what I wrote my essays about to get into college. Taking out my race from that is not going to take away the fact that that is part of who I am.\"",

    "summary": "The Trump administration asked the Supreme Court on Monday to allow it to move forward with its plans to lay off thousands of federal workers.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump's administration asked the Supreme Court on Monday to allow it to move forward with its plans to lay off thousands of federal workers at nearly two dozen agencies while a legal battle over the president's plans to drastically cut the size of the government moves forward.",
      "The Justice Department's request for emergency relief is the second in which it has asked the Supreme Court to intervene in the ongoing dispute over its efforts to execute reductions-in-force, or layoffs, across the executive branch. The administration initially asked the Supreme Court to halt a two-week temporary restraining order issued by U.S. District Judge Susan Illston, but withdrew its request after she granted longer relief last month.",
      "That preliminary injunction issued by Illston prevented the Trump administration from implementing planned reductions-in-force, placing employees on administrative leave and proceeding with job cuts that are already in motion.",
      "The Justice Department's latest request for the Supreme Court's intervention comes after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit declined last week to halt Illston's order, which would have allowed the administration to resume its efforts to sharply scale down the size of the federal workforce.",
      "Solicitor General D. John Sauer said in a filing that the district court's order is \"flawed\" and rests on an \"indefensible premise,\" namely that the president needs authorization from Congress to oversee personnel decisions within the executive branch.",
      "\"It interferes with the Executive Branch's internal operations and unquestioned legal authority to plan and carry out RIFs, and does so on a government-wide scale,\" he wrote. \"More concretely, the injunction has brought to a halt numerous in-progress RIFs at more than a dozen federal agencies, sowing confusion about what RIF-related steps agencies may take and compelling the government to retain \u2014 at taxpayer expense \u2014 thousands of employees whose continuance in federal service the agencies deem not to be in the government and public interest.\"",
      "Mr. Trump began taking steps to shrink the government shortly after he returned to the White House. The president created DOGE, a cost-cutting task force that was led by Elon Musk, and his administration began working to dismantle agencies like the U.S. Agency for International Development and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, though they have been met with court challenges.",
      "Musk's time working in the government ended last Friday, with his status as a special government employee limiting him to working 130 days in a 365-day period. But Mr. Trump said the billionaire is \"really not leaving, he's going to be back and forth.\"",
      "In February, Mr. Trump issued an executive order directing agencies to make plans to initiate \"large-scale\" reductions-in-force. On the heels of the president's directive, the Office of Personnel Management and Office of Management of Budget issued a memo directing agencies to submit plans for two phases of job cuts.",
      "Several department heads began executing their workforce cuts earlier this year, with thousands of federal employees losing their jobs. Other federal entities are planning to make significant reductions in the coming weeks and months.",
      "The reductions-in-force are separate from the mass terminations of probationary workers, who generally were in their positions for one or two years. But those firings, which took place in February, have also been the focus of lawsuits.",
      "In response to Mr. Trump's executive order, labor unions, nonprofit groups and local governments sued nearly every federal agency to block the layoffs, arguing that the executive order exceeded the president's authority and violated the separation of powers.",
      "A federal district judge in San Francisco agreed to issue a temporary restraining order, and she extended that relief with a preliminary injunction. Illston's order covers 21 federal agencies and DOGE, and prevents them proceeding with the sweeping reorganization of the federal government.",
      "The judge also barred agencies from implementing any orders by DOGE to cut programs or staff in connection with Mr. Trump's February executive order. She clarified that the injunction does not limit agencies from proposing their own reorganization plans to Congress or engaging in their own planning activities without the involvement of OMB, OPM or DOGE. The agencies affected include the Departments of Health and Human Services and Veterans Affairs, as well as\u00a0AmeriCorps\u00a0and the Social Security Administration, among others.",
      "In a 51-page ruling, Illston wrote that presidents do have the authority to seek changes to federal agencies, and nine presidents have over the last century sought to reorganize the executive branch \u2014 but only after obtaining approval from Congress.",
      "\"Presidents may set policy priorities for the executive branch, and agency heads may implement them. This much is undisputed,\" the judge said. \"But Congress creates federal agencies, funds them, and gives them duties that \u2014 by statute \u2014 they must carry out. Agencies may not conduct large-scale reorganizations and reductions in force in blatant disregard of Congress's mandates, and a president may not initiate large-scale executive branch reorganization without partnering with Congress.\"",
      "The Justice Department asked the 9th Circuit to lift Illston's injunction, and in a divided 2-1 decision, it refused to do so.",
      "\"The Executive Order at issue here far exceeds the president's supervisory powers under the Constitution,\" the appeals court wrote. \"The president enjoys significant removal power with respect to the appointed officers of federal agencies.\"",

The escalation of rhetoric heightens concerns that the two largest global economies may encounter further stumbling blocks as they pursue trade negotiations, experts say.",
      "\"Fresh hostilities between the U.S. and China show that the many questions left hanging after the Geneva ceasefire in mid-May still have no satisfactory answers,\" Arthur Kroeber, a China analyst at Gavekal Research, said in a report. \"It is not clear whether U.S. trade policy is being run by President Donald Trump, his trade negotiators or his national security team.\"",
      "He added, \"The overall objectives of the trade aggression, other than the display of raw power, are as muddled as ever.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Sunday said he's \"confident\" a U.S.-China trade dispute \"will be ironed out\" when Mr. Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping have a conversation. \"I believe we'll see something very soon,\"\u00a0Bessent said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Wall Street was lower on Monday amid renewed concerns of a brewing trade war between the nations. The S&P 500 slipped 10 points, or 0.2%, to 5,901, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.4% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite shed 0.1%.",
      "May 12 tariff pause",
      "The May 12 deal lasts 90 days, creating time for U.S. and Chinese negotiators to reach a more substantive agreement. But the pause still leaves tariffs higher than before Mr. Trump\u00a0started ramping them up\u00a0last month. Businesses and investors must also contend with uncertainty about whether the truce will last.",
      "U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said the U.S. agreed to drop the 145% tax Mr. Trump had imposed on China to 30%. China agreed to lower its tariff rate on U.S. goods to 10% from 125%.",
      "On Monday, the Commerce Ministry said China held up its end of the deal, canceling or suspending tariffs and nontariff measures taken against the U.S. \"reciprocal tariffs\" following the agreement. But it alleged that the Trump administration has \"unilaterally provoked new economic and trade frictions and exacerbated the uncertainty and instability\" in trade relations between the two nations, citing curbs on exports of AI chips and chip design software to China.",
      "The statement also singled out the Trump administration's threat of stripping visas away from Chinese students studying at U.S. universities as undermining the trade agreement between the nations.",
      "The Trump administration stepped up the clash with China last week, announcing that it would start\u00a0revoking visas for Chinese students\u00a0in the U.S. American campuses host more than 275,000 students from China.",
      "The turmoil between the U.S. and China raises economic risks, given the links between the two nations and their importance in global trade, experts added.",

    "summary": "In declining to take up the case, the Supreme Court leaves intact a lower court decision upholding Maryland's ban on certain semiautomatic rifles.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Monday turned away a challenge to Maryland's ban on so-called assault weapons, leaving intact a lower court ruling that upheld the law.",
      "In declining to review the decision from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit, the high court skirts for now a fight over whether the Second Amendment allows states to regulate the rifles that have been used in a wave of mass shootings. Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch disagreed with the Supreme Court's decision to turn away the case.",
      "The Supreme Court had already turned away the legal battle over Maryland's law last year because a federal appeals court had yet to rule. But the 4th Circuit upheld the measure last August, finding that weapons like the AR-15 could be banned in part because they are outside the scope of the Second Amendment.",
      "But the question of whether AR-15s are protected by the Second Amendment is likely to be soon decided by the Supreme Court. In a separate statement, Justice Brett Kavanaugh said that the issue is currently being considered by other federal appeals courts, and rulings from them \"should assist this court's ultimate decisionmaking.\" He predicted appeals to the Supreme Court will be before the court \"shortly,\" and said the justices \"should and presumably will address the AR-15 issue soon, in the next term or two.\"",
      "In addition to rejecting the appeal of Maryland's prohibition, the Supreme Court declined to consider a challenge to Rhode Island's ban on large-capacity magazines, keeping the law in place. The court's decision to turn away the appeal from four gun owners and a firearms dealer leaves intact a lower court ruling that declined to block enforcement of Rhode Island's ban and found the challengers failed to show they were likely to succeed on the merits of their claims.",
      "The two disputes are among several to land before the Supreme Court following its June 2022 ruling that expanded the right to bear arms and laid out a new framework for determining when restrictions on firearms adhere to the Constitution.",
      "Under its new standard, the government must show that a measure is consistent with the nation's historical tradition of firearms regulation and is therefore allowed under the Second Amendment. The high court provided some clarification about its so-called historical tradition test in its last term when it upheld a federal law that bars alleged domestic abusers from temporarily having firearms, but courts have still struggled to apply the framework, leading to conflicting decisions on the constitutionality of longstanding gun laws.",
      "Maryland's assault-weapons ban",
      "Maryland's prohibition on certain semiautomatic rifles was enacted in the wake of the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. Under the law, it is a crime to possess, sell, transfer or purchase an \"assault long gun\" or a \"copycat weapon,\" which encompasses 45 specific guns or their analogues. A variety of semiautomatic handguns and rifles are still allowed, according to the Maryland State Police.",
      "In addition to Maryland, eight other states and the District of Columbia have enacted laws restricting semiautomatic weapons.",
      "A group of Maryland residents who want to buy rifles covered by the ban, a licensed gun dealer in the state and several pro-Second Amendment groups challenged the law in 2020, arguing that they have a Second Amendment right to own common assault rifles.",
      "The federal district court and U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit upheld the law, likening the banned firearms to the M-16 rifle, which the Supreme Court has said is outside the scope of Second Amendment protection.",
      "The Maryland challengers asked the Supreme Court to review that decision, and the high court put consideration on hold while it decided another gun case involving concealed carry rules in New York. In that ruling issued in June 2022, the Supreme Court laid out the new framework under which gun laws must be consistent with the nation's historical tradition of firearms regulation.",
      "Following its decision in that landmark gun case, the Supreme Court sent the challenge to Maryland's assault weapons back to the appeals court to reconsider the case.",
      "After applying that new framework to Maryland's ban, the 4th Circuit concluded last year that the assault weapons ban is constitutional. Focusing on the AR-15 in particular, the appeals court found that it is most useful in military service and can be banned consistent with the Second Amendment.",
      "It also rejected the challengers' contention that because the guns covered by Maryland's ban are commonly used, they are protected by the Constitution. Instead, the 4th Circuit said adopting this argument would mean that any dangerous weapon \"could gain constitutional protection merely because it becomes popular before the government can sufficiently regulate it.\"",
      "The appeals court also said that the ban is consistent with the nation's historical tradition of firearms regulation, as it \"is one of many in a storied tradition of legislatures perceiving threats posed by excessively dangerous weapons and regulating commensurately.\"",
      "The challengers again sought the Supreme Court's review, arguing in a filing that the justices should \"ensure that the Second Amendment itself is not truncated into a limited right to own certain state-approved means of personal self-defense.\"",
      "They argued the AR-15 is the most popular rifle in the U.S. and said the 4th Circuit's ruling \"turns a firearm possessed for lawful purposes by millions of Americans into an item with not even presumptive constitutional protection.\"",
      "But Maryland officials urged the court to leave the 4th Circuit's ruling intact, in part because they said it's too soon for the Supreme Court to intervene.",
      "In his statement, Kavanaugh called the appeals court's decision \"questionable.\"",
      "\"Given that millions of Americans own AR-15s and that a significant majority of the states allow possession of those rifles, petitioners have a strong argument that AR-15s are in 'common use' by law-abiding citizens and therefore are protected by the Second Amendment,\" he wrote. \"If so, then the Fourth Circuit would have erred by holding that Maryland's ban on AR\u201315s complies with the Second Amendment.\"",
      "Thomas, in a solo dissent, said the Supreme Court should not wait to decide the constitutionality of laws outlawing AR-15s and lamented that the justices have put off addressing it for a decade.",
      "\"[F]urther percolation is of little value when lower courts in the jurisdictions that ban AR-15s appear bent on distorting this court's Second Amendment precedents,\" he wrote. \"I doubt we would sit idly by if lower courts were to so subvert our precedents involving any other constitutional right. Until we are vigilant in enforcing it, the right to bear arms will remain 'a second-class right.'\"",
      "Rhode Island's ban on large-capacity magazines",
      "Rhode Island's ban on large-capacity magazines was enacted by its General Assembly in June 2022 in response to mass shootings that have upended communities nationwide in recent years. The law prohibits possession of magazines that hold more than 10 rounds of ammunition.",
      "People who had these magazines had six months to either modify them to accept no more than 10 rounds, sell them to a firearms dealer, take them out of state or turn them into law enforcement. Possession of large-capacity magazines is now considered a felony.",
      "The group of gun owners challenged the state's ban shortly before it was set to take effect, arguing it violated the Second Amendment. A federal district court judge denied the challengers' request to block the law, finding that keeping large-capacity magazines isn't conduct that is protected by the Second Amendment.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 1st Circuit then upheld the district court's decision, finding that the ban \"imposes no meaningful burden on the ability of Rhode Island residents to defend themselves.\" The three-judge appeals court panel also said that semiautomatic weapons outfitted with large-capacity magazines \"much more closely resemble\" the M-16 rifle, which is banned for civilian use, than traditional handguns.",
      "\"The burden on self-defense imposed by [Rhode Island's law] is no greater than the burdens of longstanding, permissible arms regulations, and its justification compares favorably with the justification for prior bans on other arms found to pose growing threats to public safety,\" the court said. It added that, when applying the Supreme Court's framework, \"our analogical reasoning very likely places LCMs well within the realm of devices that have historically been prohibited once their danger became manifest.\"",
      "The gun owners appealed to the Supreme Court, arguing that lower courts have \"rubber-stamped\" firearms restrictions even in the wake of the high court's more recent decisions.",
      "\"The same law-abiding citizens who were unconstitutionally deprived of their right to carry arms outside the home before Bruen continue to be deprived of their right to keep arms that are common in the rest of the country,\" they wrote in their petition to the Supreme Court, citing the court's Jun 2022 decision. \"The result is a nation that remains split, with the Second Amendment alive and well in (most of) the vast middle, but routinely disregarded near the coasts.\"",
      "Rhode Island officials urged the Supreme Court to reject the case, saying it is not worthy of the court's attention \"at this time.\" They noted in a filing that the case arrived at the high court while proceedings are still in preliminary stages.",

    "published": "Mon, 02 Jun 2025 06:00:00 -0400",
    "summary": "WorldPride is in D.C. this year, leaving the LGBTQ community conflicted about showing up to the nation's capital amid an administration that has targeted them.",
    "story": [
      "This year, WorldPride is coming to Washington, D.C. A series of events, organized by the nonprofit InterPride, aims to bring visibility and awareness of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer issues to an international stage. This year's location is leaving the community conflicted about showing up to the nation's capital amid an administration that has targeted them.",
      "Zoe Stoller, a licensed social worker based in Philadelphia, said they're excited to be among the queer and trans community at WorldPride, but told CBS News the Trump administration has \"definitely been on my mind.\"",
      "\"D.C. is not necessarily a place that many people would think of as super safe and comfortable right now, given the current administration and their attacks on the LGBTQ community, especially trans people, especially trans youth,\" they said.",
      "Meg Ten Eyck, founder and CEO of travel platform\u00a0EveryQueer and vice chairman of the board of directors for the International LGBTQ Travel Association, has been to dozens of Pride events across the world, from the miles-long parade at New York City's WorldPride to a Pride in Kyiv, Ukraine, in 2015 that was targeted with Molotov cocktails amid protests.",
      "\"What is happening socially and politically changes the feeling of the Pride that you are attending,\" she said, adding she anticipates WorldPride this year is going to bring \"an astronomical amount of fear and sadness from people\" as well as some potential violence.",
      "\"I think the community is terrified, and I think our instinct as humans is to want structure and to want answers,\" she said. \"There will be a lot of people who are drawn to this particular pride as a giant 'F*** you' to the administration, and there will be a lot of people who are incentivized into negative behaviors that may not necessarily be characteristic of who they are because of that fear and misinformation and general dissatisfaction with human rights violations that are happening in a lot of different ways.\"",
      "Comments across social media have also highlighted the mixed emotions.",
      "In a video about WorldPride\u00a0posted to TikTok\u00a0earlier this month, a top comment with more than 2,000 likes says: \"Being real... I'm not going this year. I'm scared.\" Another reads: \"Couldn't pay me enough to attend a mass gathering like this in this political climate.\"",
      "But others had a different take, including this commenter who wrote: \"Don't let them make us scared we deserve happiness too.\"",
      "While some may choose to skip this year's events due to safety concerns, Stoller predicts their absence will be filled with others eager to take a stand.",
      "\"Folks who may not have attended in the past, might not have felt motivated to show up, to protest, to be in this current political climate and make their voices heard \u2014 those folks might come out of the woodworks,\" they said.",
      "For those with layered identities, navigating Pride this year is even more complex.",
      "David D. Marshall, founder and CEO of Journey to Josiah Inc., a Baltimore-based adoption nonprofit, said the feeling of a \"robust need to fight\" is met with the reality that, for people of color, showing up is a \"a whole different experience\" to White LGBTQ people.",
      "\"There is a fear in general when it comes to Black people, because there is a direct target put on our backs when it comes to any sort of protest,\" he said, adding \"it's a time for people of different privilege, or allies, to show up.\"",
      "And for others, more pressing matters are taking precedence over the problems posed by Pride.",
      "\"When we're thinking about the grand scheme of things, (Pride) just hasn't been on the list,\" Marshall admitted, adding his own organization is grappling with federal funding cuts and those in his circles are \"fighting to maintain our own livelihoods\" amid the dismantling of DEI \u2014 diversity, equity and inclusion \u2014 roles.",
      "\"The option to fold is not there, because the work still needs to be done. The need has not gone anywhere but there are now some additional barriers,\" he said.",
      "Why is WorldPride in D.C.?",
      "While the Trump administration has rolled back several protections for LGBTQ people, especially for trans individuals, WorldPride locations are bid on years in advance, meaning the nation's capital was decided before President Trump was re-elected.",
      "\"No one could have anticipated what was going to happen,\" Ten Eyck said, adding there are fears around what the administration may do if there are protests on federal land, since it would be their jurisdiction. \"(For some people), federal charges result in you losing your career and your income and your stability.\"",
      "But there's an important distinction between who's in office and who makes up the city, she added.",
      "\"Yeah, Trump has the White House and sort of lives in D.C., but the District of Columbia goes deeply democratic in every single election, regardless of who's in the federal administration. So, having and hosting a large global pride celebration is aligned with the citizens of D.C.'s politic and will, but it is not aligned with the federal government stance.\"",
      "Stoller, who has more than 50,000 Instagram followers, has seen this contrast causing discussions among their online community as well, with many questioning whether it's safe or appropriate to attend.",
      "\"D.C. still can be a very safe, open, accepting place. But of course, the people who are in charge, who now are living in D.C. definitely affect the vibes and feelings of that,\" they said.",
      "The Trump administration has already made itself known ahead of the celebration. Last month, several Pride events at the Kennedy Center were canceled or relocated as the institution pivots under President Trump's leadership.",
      "June Crenshaw, deputy director of nonprofit organization Capital Pride Alliance that is helping host to WorldPride, said the organization is finding other paths for the celebration, but added, \"the fact we have to maneuver in this way is disappointing.\"",
      "According to the WorldPride website, \"top-to-bottom safety protocol\" is in place, assuring the same level of preparation as high-security events like inaugurations.",
      "\"Efforts include pre-event web-related surveillance, on-site security/police, advanced life support stations, roving medic teams, aerial surveillance and anti-scaling systems and barricades where applicable,\" the site notes. \"The 2-day street festival will be fenced with a secure entrance. Capital Pride is augmenting DC's efforts with additional private security.\"",
      "How to celebrate Pride outside of Washington, D.C.",
      "If unsure about attending WorldPride this year, Stroller encourages people to prioritize their emotional and physical safety above all else.",
      "\"If you are feeling worried for your safety, for your emotions, for your well-being, listen to your gut,\" they said.",
      "Black LGBTQ people are also having to figure out another approach \"that may not necessarily be showing up in these very public spaces,\" Marshall added.",
      "\"Does that mean that one group has decided not to fight? No, it's a matter of how. What is going to be the thing that is not going to cost us our lives?\" he said.",
      "Ten Eyck adds there are plenty of ways to \"show up\" for the community without being in Washington physically, including supporting your local Pride party or LGBT center as well as \"putting your money where your morals are.\"",
      "\"If you're a federal employee who can fight from the inside, if you're a teacher who can fight from the inside, if you're a public health professional who can fight from the inside, we need you more in those roles than we need you on the National Mall,\" she said.",

    "story": [
      "Amid the wave of pardons and commutations President Trump has doled out to some of his supporters and surrogates, one former MAGA loyalist in Idaho is fighting to return her pardon.",
      "Pamela Hemphill is one of the more than 1,500 people whom Mr. Trump pardoned earlier this year for their roles in the U.S. Capitol Insurrection. She has invoked help from her Republican senator to formally refuse and block the pardon Mr. Trump issued her on Jan. 20, his\u00a0first day back in the White House.",
      "Though Hemphill was a defendant of the largest criminal prosecution in American history, she is seemingly standing alone now as the only Jan. 6 defendant to refuse the clemency Mr. Trump offered.",
      "Speaking with CBS News from her home in Idaho, Hemphill said, \"The pardons just contribute to their narrative, which is all lies, propaganda. We were guilty, period.\"",
      "\"We all know that they're gaslighting us. They are using January 6 to just continue Trump's narrative that the Justice Department was weaponized,\" she said. \"They were not. When the FBI came to my home, oh my God, they were very professional. They treated me very good.\"",
      "Hemphill pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge for her role in the crowd on Jan. 6, 2021.",
      "Prosecutors argued Hemphill \"was in the front of the crowd that confronted U.S. Capitol Police and other law enforcement officers attempting to keep the rioters behind the metal bike-rack barriers.\"",
      "They alleged Hemphill galvanized others to descend on Washington for the certification of the electoral vote after the 2020 election, according to court filings.",
      "\"On December 28, 2020, Hemphill posted encouragement to go to Washington, D.C. for January 6, saying 'its a WAR!' On January 1, 2021, she posted a message 'on my way to Washington DC January 6th,'\" the prosecution said.",
      "Hemphill also pleaded guilty in January 2022 to a count of unlawful parading and was sentenced later that year to a term that included three years of probation.",
      "Her case mirrors many other misdemeanor cases from the U.S. Capitol siege, in which members of the crowd were not accused of making physical contact with police or damaging any property \u2014 though prosecutors emphasized how each member of the mob contributed to the breakdown of police lines, the injuries and the damage to American democracy.",
      "Hemphill told CBS News the pardons for her and fellow members of the crowd were inappropriate and damaging Americans' views of the federal government.",
      "\"How could you sleep at night taking a pardon when you know you were guilty? You know that everybody there was guilty. I couldn't live with myself. I have to be right with me. And with God,\" Hemphill said.",
      "Former Pardon Attorney Liz Oyer, who was fired by the Trump administration in March after a disagreement over a case, told CBS News that Hemphill's protest is a sharp contrast from the conduct of other Capitol riot defendants who championed their own pardons.",
      "\"Some Jan. 6 defendants blew up our phones seeking a copy of their pardons. They wanted the copies quickly,\" Oyer said. \"They wanted it framed and signed.\"",
      "Court filings reviewed by CBS News show other Jan. 6 defendants have utilized their pardon certificates to make arguments in court about their cases, restitution payments or other legal matters.",
      "In contrast, senate records obtained by CBS News show Hemphill sought assistance from Sen. James Risch to secure a formal acknowledgement from the Department of Justice that she will not accept her pardon.",
      "In an April 2 correspondence from the Office of the Pardon Attorney to Sen. Risch, the pardon attorney's office wrote, \"Ms. Hemphill's non-acceptance is noted.\" The letter said the Justice Department would not issue Hemphill a formal certificate to chronicle her pardon.",
      "In a statement to CBS News, a spokesperson for Risch said, \"The Office of U.S. Senator Jim Risch regularly assists constituents with matters pertaining to federal agencies or programs. Due to privacy concerns, we cannot disclose details about individual cases.\"",
      "Hemphill has sparred on social media and in podcasts with other Jan. 6 defendants over her arguments about what she says is the whitewashing of the Capitol riot. In one segment on a podcast earlier this spring, Hemphill debated Enrique Tarrio, a former Proud Boys leader who was convicted at trial and received the longest prison sentence of any Jan. 6 defendant. Tarrio's sentence was commuted by Mr. Trump.",
      "Hemphill told CBS News she expects her protest will garner the attention of the president.",
      "\"Trump will probably say that ungrateful lady, I'm going to make sure she gets back on probation and give her the worst you can give her. I won't be surprised,\" she said.",

    "summary": "\"This is a setback of probably a decade for HIV vaccine research,\" one scientist said.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration has moved to end funding for a broad swath of HIV vaccine research, saying current approaches are enough to counter the virus, multiple scientists and federal health officials say.",
      "Notifications that the funding would not be extended were relayed Friday to researchers, who were told by National Institutes of Health officials that the Department of Health and Human Services had elected \"to go with currently available approaches to eliminate HIV\" instead.",
      "The cuts will shutter two major HIV vaccine research efforts that were first funded by the NIH in 2012 at the Duke Human Vaccine Institute and the Scripps Research Institute, multiple scientists said. A spokesperson for Moderna said the vaccine manufacturer's clinical trials through the NIH's HIV Vaccine Trials Network have also been put on pause.",
      "One senior NIH official said the HHS had also instructed the agency not to issue any more funding in the next fiscal year for HIV vaccine research, with only a small handful of exceptions.",
      "A budgetary rule change specifically targeted at HIV vaccine research is also expected to lead to another cut to the NIH's awards for studies initiated by scientists, an official said.",
      "The change, to be finalized shortly, inflates the accounting for the upfront cost of studies into HIV vaccines funded by the agency. Instead of the cost of a five-year grant being spread out over five years, the NIH plans to make HIV vaccine dollars from multi-year grants all count toward a single year, the official said, making it harder for them to get funded.",
      "A spokesperson for HHS told CBS News that \"complex and duplicative health programs have resulted in serious duplication of efforts,\" saying that \"27 separate programs that address HIV/AIDS\" had spent $7.5 billion.",
      "\"The Administration believes the United States should have the best medical research in the world. To that end, we are advancing policies to maximize the impact of every federal taxpayer dollar and ensure proper oversight of this funding,\" HHS spokesperson Emily Hilliard said.",
      "Hilliard claimed \"critical HIV/AIDS programs will continue\" under the new agency that Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has proposed creating, dubbed the Administration for a Healthy America.",
      "\"For HIV vaccine design and development, we've begun to see light at the end of the tunnel after many years of research. This is a terrible time to cut it off. We're beginning to get close. We're getting good results out of clinical trials,\" said Dennis Burton, an immunology professor at Scripps Research.",
      "Burton warned that their HIV vaccine research could not simply be turned back on, even if a future administration decided to change course on HIV funding. He said ongoing experiments would be shuttered, and researchers assembled to study the issue would be forced to refocus their careers on other topics.",
      "\"This is a decision with consequences that will linger. This is a setback of probably a decade for HIV vaccine research,\" Burton said.",
      "The cancellation of the funds comes weeks ahead of the Food and Drug Administration's June 19 deadline for deciding on approval of lenacapavir, a twice-yearly injectable drug to prevent HIV.",
      "The drug, which is being brought to the commercial market by drugmaker Gilead Sciences, builds on NIH-backed research into earlier HIV medications. The drug's availability could lead to a significant drop in HIV cases worldwide, since a study found it was 100% effective in preventing transmission.",
      "An NIH official, who was not authorized to speak publicly, rebuked the claim that the effectiveness of current HIV prevention strategies meant a vaccine was no longer needed. \"The only way of ending the HIV epidemic in the U.S. and AIDS pandemic worldwide\" is with a vaccine, they said.",
      "Developing an effective HIV vaccine has been an elusive target for researchers, though scientists have hailed recent breakthroughs in the field.",
      "\"HIV has established roadblocks to us fighting it off, which are unparalleled in vaccinology. We've had to learn what each of the roadblocks are and to devise ways to overcome it. This virus mutates so quickly,\" said Duke professor of medicine Dr. Barton Ford Haynes, who is part of the Duke Human Vaccine Institute.",
      "Haynes said their work was essentially combining multiple different vaccines as part of their approach to designing an effective HIV vaccine.",
      "He praised lenacapavir as a \"wonderful development for the field,\" but said there was still a need for a vaccine. Lenacapavir requires injections every six months to remain effective, a challenging proposition even before steep cuts to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's domestic HIV programs and U.S.-backed HIV/AIDS foreign aid programs.",
      "\"The hope was that adding an HIV vaccine to all the preventive measures that we have would finally allow us to end the pandemic,\" Haynes said.",

There were no reports of any risk to the local population, which is accustomed to Etna's frequent eruptions, or to air travel.",

    "summary": "An Australian woman testified she felt ostracized from her husband's family in the months before she allegedly murdered three of his relatives with toxic mushrooms.",
    "story": [
      "The woman accused of murdering three members of her ex-husband's family by serving them poisonous mushrooms has taken the stand at an Australian court on Monday as the highly publicized triple murder trial nears its conclusion.",
      "Erin Patterson, 50, is accused of killing her former parents-in-law, Don and Gail Patterson, both 70, and Gail Patterson's sister, Heather Wilkinson, 66, and also of attempting to murder Wilkinson's husband, Ian, 68, after the four consumed a meal at Patterson's home in Victoria state in July 2023.",
      "She could face up to 25 years in prison for the attempted murder charge, while murder in the state of Victoria carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.",
      "Her lawyer, Colin Mandy, previously told the Victorian state Supreme Court during the six-week trial the poisoning was accidental.",
      "Patterson's appearance as a defense witness Monday marked the first time the 50-year-old has spoken since pleading not guilty to all charges in May last year.",
      "She served meals of beef Wellington, mashed potato and green beans at her home in the rural town of Leongartha on July 29, 2023. All four guests were hospitalized the next day with poisoning from death cap mushrooms, also known as amanita phalloides, that were added to the beef and pastry dish. Ian Wilkinson survived after a liver transplant.",
      "Under questioning from Mandy, Patterson revealed personal battles with low self-esteem, shifting spirituality, the complicated birth of her son and growing distance from her estranged husband's family in recent years.",
      "\"I had felt for some months that my relationship with the wider Patterson family, and particularly Don and Gail, perhaps had a bit more distance or space put between us,\" Patterson said. \"We saw each other less.\"",
      "She described how husband Simon \u2014 the pair were estranged but still legally married \u2014 seemed to be pushing her out of the family in the lead up to the fatal meal.",
      "\"I'd become concerned that Simon was not wanting me to be involved too much in the family anymore,\" she said. \"I wasn't being invited to so many things.\"",
      "Patterson is due back on the witness stand Tuesday as the trial continues.",
      "The prosecution completed the presentation of its evidence to a jury of 14 people earlier on Monday afternoon.",
      "\"They can be scared and alive or dead\"",
      "Last month, Ian Wilkinson told the courtroom that he and his wife had been \"very happy to be invited\" to the lunch,\u00a0the BBC reported.",
      "Wilkinson told the court that Patterson had plated \"all of the food,\" according to the BBC.",
      "\"Each person had an individual serve, it was very much like a pasty,\" he said. \"It was a pastry case and when we cut into it, there was steak and mushrooms.\"",
      "The court also heard that lunch host Erin Patterson's estranged husband, Simon, had been invited to the meal but declined, saying he was uncomfortable with the prospect.",
      "Erin Patterson went to hospital two days after the lunch, but left five minutes later against medical advice, the doctor said.",
      "\"I was surprised,\" he told the court.",
      "Patterson later returned and told Webster her children had also consumed the beef Wellington \u2014 but not the mushrooms or pastry.",
      "She was hesitant to tell them about the poisoning in case they became \"frightened,\" the doctor said. \"I said: 'They can be scared and alive or dead.'\"",
      "The court also heard from another of Don and Gail Patterson's sons, Matthew, who said he had called the lunch host to ask where the mushrooms came from.",
      "Death caps are responsible for 90% of lethal mushroom poisoning globally, the BBC reported.",
      "In 2022, doctors in Massachusetts were able to save a mother and son who\u00a0nearly died\u00a0from death cap mushroom poisoning. In 2020, a spate of poisonings in Victoria, Australia, killed one person and hospitalized seven others.",

      "Bill Gates is revealing his plans for the $200 billion he intends to give away through his foundation over the next 20 years, vowing that much of the money will go to Africa.",
      "Gates, who earlier this month told \"CBS Mornings\" about his plans to donate the bulk of his fortune, disclosed his intentions to focus on Africa on Monday while speaking at Nelson Mandela Hall at the African Union in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Gates had previously said his goal was to fund causes that would help save and improve lives around the globe.",

    "summary": "A British military spending boost, including new attack subs and long-range weapons, will make the U.K. \"a battle-ready, armor-clad nation,\" Prime Minister Keir Starmer says.",
    "story": [
      "London\u00a0\u2014 The United Kingdom will build as many as a dozen new nuclear-powered attack submarines, get its army ready to fight a war in Europe and become \"a battle-ready, armor-clad nation,\" Prime Minister Keir Starmer vowed on Monday. The promise is part of a planned military spending boost \u2014\u00a0echoed recently by other close U.S. allies in Europe\u00a0\u2014 designed to send a message to both Moscow, and to President Trump in Washington.",
      "Starmer said Britain \"cannot ignore the threat that Russia poses\" as he pledged to undertake the most sweeping changes to Britain's defenses since the collapse of the Soviet Union more than three decades ago.",
      "\"The threat we face is more serious, more immediate and more unpredictable than at any time since the Cold War,\" Starmer told workers and journalists at a navy shipyard in Scotland.",
      "Like other NATO members, the U.K. has been reassessing its defense spending since Russia launched its ongoing, full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.",
      "The government announced its plans for the military in response to a strategic defense review commissioned by Starmer and led by George Robertson, a former U.K. defense secretary and NATO secretary general. It was the first such review since 2021, and it landed in a world shaken and transformed by Russia's invasion of Ukraine \u2014 and by the reelection of Mr. Trump last year.",
      "Months after Britain's last major defense review was published in 2021, then-Prime Minister Boris Johnson declared that the era of \"fighting big tank battles on European landmass\" was over. Three months later, Russian tanks rolled into Ukraine.",
      "Starmer's center-left Labour Party government has said it will accept all 62 recommendations made in the review, aiming to help the U.K. confront growing threats on land, air, sea and cyberspace.",
      "The measures include increasing production of submarines and weapons and \"learning the lessons of Ukraine,\" which has rapidly developed its drone technology to counter Moscow's forces and even hit targets deep inside Russia. Starmer made his announcement a day after Ukraine launched a drone attack of unprecedented scale against Russian air bases, claiming to have damaged or destroyed 41 Russian bombers.",
      "The government said the U.K. will also establish a cyber command to counter \"daily\" Russia-linked attacks on Britain's defenses.",
      "Monday's announcements include building \"up to 12\" nuclear-powered, conventionally armed submarines under the AUKUS partnership with Australia and the United States. The government also says it will invest 15 billion pounds (about $20.3 billion) in Britain's nuclear arsenal, which consists of missiles carried on a handful of submarines. Details of those plans are likely to be kept secret.",
      "The government will also increase conventional Britain's weapons stockpiles with up to 7,000 U.K.-built long-range weapons.",
      "Starmer said rearming would create a \"defense dividend\" of thousands of well-paid manufacturing jobs \u2014 a contrast to the post-Cold War \"peace dividend\" that saw Western nations channel money away from defense into other areas.",
      "Defense Secretary John Healey said the changes would send \"a message to Moscow,\" and transform the country's military following decades of retrenchment, though he said he does not expect the number of soldiers \u2014 currently at a two-century low \u2014 to rise until the early 2030s.",
      "Healey said plans for defense spending to hit 2.5% of national income by 2027 a year are \"on track\" and that there's \"no doubt\" it will hit 3% before 2034.",
      "Starmer said the 3% goal is an \"ambition,\" rather than a firm promise, and it's unclear where the cash-strapped Treasury will find the money. The government has already, contentiously, cut international aid spending to reach the 2.5% target.",
      "Starmer said he wouldn't make a firm pledge until he knew \"precisely where the money is coming from.\"",
      "Even 3% falls short of what some leaders in NATO think is needed to deter Russia from future attacks on its neighbors. NATO chief Mark Rutte says leaders of the 32 member countries will debate a commitment to spend at least 3.5% of GDP on defense when they meet in the Netherlands this month.",
      "It's also a message to Mr. Trump that Europe is heeding his demand for NATO members to spend more on their own defense.",
      "European countries, led by the U.K. and France, have scrambled to coordinate their defense posture as Mr. Trump transforms American foreign policy, seemingly sidelining Europe as he looks to end the war in Ukraine. Mr. Trump has long questioned the value of NATO and complained that the U.S. provides security to European countries that don't pull their weight.",
      "Starmer said his government would make \"Britain's biggest contribution to NATO since its creation.\"",
      "\"We will never fight alone,\" he said. \"Our defense policy will always be NATO-first.\"",
      "James Cartlidge, defense spokesman for the main British opposition Conservative Party, welcomed more money for defense but was skeptical of the government's 3% pledge.",
      "\"All of Labour's strategic defense review promises will be taken with a pinch of salt unless they can show there will actually be enough money to pay for them,\" he said.",

      "While Ukraine has launched drones at Russia, including the capital Moscow, for months, as well as staging other covert operations on Russian soil, the attack on Sunday was notable for its scope and scale. Ukraine claimed it had damaged or destroyed 41 Russian bomber aircraft at bases across the vast country. Ukrainian officials said the attack did not endanger any Russian civilians.",

      "SBU chief Vasyl Maliuk claimed in the statement that Ukraine had hit aircraft at four Russian bases, inflicting more than $7 billion worth of damage on Russia's bomber fleet.",
      "The Ministry of Defense in Moscow said Monday that Russia's air defenses had intercepted a total of 316 Ukrainian drones in 24 hours, which encompasses the time of Ukraine's attack. The Russian ministry said 205 of those drones were hit outside the \"special operation zone,\" a term the Kremlin uses to refer to land it has seized since launching its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.",
      "Ukrainian authorities said that, before dawn on Monday, Russia launched two ballistic missiles and a series of drones at the northeast city of Kharkiv, just miles from the Russian border, wounding at least six people, including a child.",

      "Ukraine's representatives, led by Defense Minister Rustem Umerov, were expected to present a plan demanding a \"full and unconditional ceasefire in the sky, on land and at sea as a necessary background and prerequisite for peace negotiations,\" the Reuters news agency said, citing a text of the Ukrainian proposal it had viewed. The proposed truce would last a minimum of 30 days, in line with calls made by the Trump administration previously.",
      "Ukraine was also expected to demand the unconditional return of all Ukrainian children and civilian hostages taken during the war, and that territorial gains made by Russia since February 2014, when Russia first invaded and illegally annexed the Crimean Peninsula, not be recognized by the international community.",
      "In return, Ukraine is open to the lifting of \"some sanctions\" imposed against Russia by the U.S. and its allies, \"but in stages and only gradually, with a mechanism for resuming sanctions if necessary.\"",
      "The Ukrainians also want Russian sovereign assets frozen by Western nations to be used for reconstruction, or to remain frozen until reparations are paid.",

      "President Vladimir Putin's government has insisted for months that the only way to end the war is to address what it vaguely calls the conflict's \"root causes.\" Russia insists the war, which Putin calls only a \"special military operation,\" was caused by NATO's ambitions for further eastward expansion, and by Moscow's desire to defend Russian-speaking Ukrainians in the eastern part of the neighboring nation.",
      "Putin and his senior aides routinely dismiss pro-Europe, pro-NATO Zelenskyy as an illegitimate leader of Ukraine. The Russian president has refused to accept his Ukrainian counterpart's challenge to hold direct personal talks, face-to-face.",
      "Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said Monday as the talks got underway that discussions over such a Putin-Zelenskyy meeting \"will be considered.\"",
      "But there was no confirmation from either Ukraine or Russia that such a high-level dialogue was imminent. Instead, reports from Turkey suggested the second round of talks had concluded in just over an hour. Zelenskyy, who did not attend the negotiations, told reporters during a visit Monday to Lithuania, however, that a new prisoner swap between the warring sides was being organized.",
      "He did not say how far the planning for a swap had gone, but a significant exchange late last month of about 1,000 captured civilians and prisoners of war was the only tangible result of the first round of talks between Russia and Ukraine.",
      "President Trump has voiced frustration with both Zelenskyy and Putin for failing to agree to a truce. During last year's election campaign, Mr. Trump vowed repeatedly to broker an end of the war within hours of taking office. The U.S. president recently issued rare sharp criticism of Putin, calling him \"absolutely crazy\" for continuing to hammer Ukrainian cities with missiles as the U.S. and its partners push for a peace agreement.",
      "Mr. Trump wondered in a social media post during the last prisoner swap whether it, \"could lead to something big?\"",
      "Russian officials were quoted by the country's state-run media as saying the two sides agreed on Monday to hold a third round of talks, but no date was set. The officials acknowledged that future prisoner swaps had been a key point of discussion, but Ukrainian officials said Russia had rejected the call for a broader 30-day ceasefire.",
      "There was no immediate reaction from the White House to the second round of negotiations in Turkey on Monday, but the Trump administration did make it clear that Ukraine had given no advance warning of the Sunday drone attack ahead of those talks.",

Those groups say Israeli restrictions, the breakdown of law and order, and widespread looting make it extremely difficult to deliver aid to Gaza's roughly 2 million Palestinians.",
      "Experts have warned that the territory is at risk of famine if more aid is not brought in.",
      "Ceasefire talks falter",
      "Sunday's incident happened as Israel and Hamas traded blame for the faltering mediation bid to secure a temporary ceasefire and the release of Israeli hostages held in Gaza, in exchange for Palestinian prisoners.",
      "Hamas said Saturday it was seeking amendments to a U.S.-backed ceasefire proposal, but President Trump's special envoy to the Middle East rejected the group's response as \"totally unacceptable.\"",
      "\"Hamas should accept the framework proposal we put forward as the basis for proximity talks, which we can begin immediately this coming week,\" the office of Steve Witkoff said in a statement.",
      "Basem Naim, a member of Hamas' political bureau, said in a statement that Hamas did not reject Witkoff's proposal.",
      "\"Nevertheless, we now responded positively and responsibly in a manner that fulfilled the minimum of demands and aspirations of our people,\" Naim said in a statement. \"Why, each time, is the Israeli response considered the only response for negotiation? This violates the integrity and fairness of mediation and constitutes a complete bias towards the other side.\"",
      "The Israeli government has agreed to the proposal outlined by the U.S.",
      "The war began when Hamas-led terrorists stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting 251. They are still holding 58 hostages, around a third of them believed to be alive, after most of the rest were released in ceasefire agreements or other deals.",
      "Israel's military campaign has killed over 54,000 people, mostly women and children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not say how many of the dead were civilians or combatants. The offensive has destroyed vast areas of the territory, displaced around 90% of its population and left people almost completely reliant on international aid.",

    "summary": "China's allegations come after President Trump on Friday accused the Chinese of violating a May 12 trade pact.",
    "story": [
      "China on Monday said the Trump administration is undermining the temporary\u00a0May 12 trade agreement between the two nations by issuing AI chip export control guidelines, stopping the sale of chip design software to China and by planning to revoke Chinese student visas.",
      "The Trump administration's actions \"seriously undermine the existing consensus reached at the Geneva economic and trade talks, and seriously damage China's legitimate rights and interests,\" China's Commerce Ministry said in the June 2 statement.",
      "China's claims come after President Trump on Friday said that Beijing is violating a trade agreement with the U.S., just weeks after the two countries announced on May 12 a\u00a0temporary but significant easing\u00a0of tariffs imposed on each other's imports earlier in the year. The escalation of rhetoric heightens concerns that the two largest global economies may encounter further stumbling blocks as they pursue trade negotiations, experts say.",
      "\"Fresh hostilities between the U.S. and China show that the many questions left hanging after the Geneva ceasefire in mid-May still have no satisfactory answers,\" Arthur Kroeber, a China analyst at Gavekal Research, said in a report. \"It is not clear whether U.S. trade policy is being run by President Donald Trump, his trade negotiators or his national security team.\"",
      "He added, \"The overall objectives of the trade aggression, other than the display of raw power, are as muddled as ever.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Sunday said he's \"confident\" a U.S.-China trade dispute \"will be ironed out\" when Mr. Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping have a conversation. \"I believe we'll see something very soon,\"\u00a0Bessent said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Wall Street was lower on Monday amid renewed concerns of a brewing trade war between the nations. The S&P 500 slipped 10 points, or 0.2%, to 5,901, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.4% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite shed 0.1%.",
      "May 12 tariff pause",
      "The May 12 deal lasts 90 days, creating time for U.S. and Chinese negotiators to reach a more substantive agreement. But the pause still leaves tariffs higher than before Mr. Trump\u00a0started ramping them up\u00a0last month. Businesses and investors must also contend with uncertainty about whether the truce will last.",
      "U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said the U.S. agreed to drop the 145% tax Mr. Trump had imposed on China to 30%. China agreed to lower its tariff rate on U.S. goods to 10% from 125%.",
      "On Monday, the Commerce Ministry said China held up its end of the deal, canceling or suspending tariffs and nontariff measures taken against the U.S. \"reciprocal tariffs\" following the agreement. But it alleged that the Trump administration has \"unilaterally provoked new economic and trade frictions and exacerbated the uncertainty and instability\" in trade relations between the two nations, citing curbs on exports of AI chips and chip design software to China.",
      "The statement also singled out the Trump administration's threat of stripping visas away from Chinese students studying at U.S. universities as undermining the trade agreement between the nations.",
      "The Trump administration stepped up the clash with China last week, announcing that it would start\u00a0revoking visas for Chinese students\u00a0in the U.S. American campuses host more than 275,000 students from China.",
      "The turmoil between the U.S. and China raises economic risks, given the links between the two nations and their importance in global trade, experts added.",
      "\"If the United States and China were to disengage completely in another blitz of escalating tariffs, it would be a really big deal for the global economy,\" Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics, told investors in a client note. \"Demand for industrial commodities would plummet. Supply chains spanning multiple borders would shut down.\"",

      "Warsaw, Poland \u2014 Conservative Karol Nawrocki won Poland's weekend presidential runoff election, according to the final vote count on Monday. Nawrocki won 50.89% of votes in a very tight race against liberal Warsaw Mayor Rafa\u0142 Trzaskowski, who received 49.11%.",
      "The race had Poland on edge since a first round of voting two weeks earlier, revealing deep divisions in the country along the eastern flank of NATO and the European Union.",
      "An early exit poll released Sunday evening suggested Trzaskowski was headed to victory before updated polling began to reverse the picture a couple of hours later.",
      "The outcome suggests Poland can be expected to take a more populist and nationalist path under its new leader, who was backed by President Trump.",
      "Hungarian Prime Minister Victor Orban lauded Nawrocki's win, according to French news agency AFP.",
      "EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen congratulated Nawrocki. In a post on X, she said she's \"confident that the EU will continue its very good cooperation with Poland.\"",
      "Most day-to-day power in the Polish political system rests with a prime minister, who is chosen by the parliament. However, the president's role is not merely ceremonial. The office holds the power to influence foreign policy and veto legislation.",
      "Nawrocki will succeed Andrzej Duda, a conservative whose second and final term ends on Aug. 6.",
      "Under the Polish constitution, the president serves a five-year term and may be re-elected once.",
      "Prime Minister Donald Tusk came to power in late 2023 with a coalition government that spans a broad ideological divide \u2014 so broad that it hasn't been able to fulfill certain of Tusk's electoral promises, such as loosening the restrictive abortion law or passing a civil partnership law for same-sex couples.",
      "But Duda's veto power has been another obstacle. It has prevented Tusk from fulfilling promises to reverse laws that politicized the court system in a way that the European Union declared undemocratic.",
      "Now it appears Tusk will have no way to fulfill those promises, which he made both to voters and the EU.",
      "Some observers in Poland have said the unfulfilled promises could make it more difficult for Tusk to continue his term until the next parliamentary election scheduled for late 2027, particularly if Law and Justice dangles the prospect of future cooperation with conservatives in his coalition.",
      "Incoming president's background",
      "Nawrocki, a 42-year-old amateur boxer and historian, was tapped by the Law and Justice party as part of its push for a fresh start.",
      "The party governed Poland from 2015 to 2023, when it lost power to a centrist coalition led by Tusk. Some political observers predicted the party would never make a comeback, and Nawrocki was chosen as a new face who wouldn't be burned by the scandals of the party's eight years of rule.",
      "The strategy clearly worked.",
      "Nawrocki has most recently been the head of the Institute of National Remembrance, which embraces nationalist historical narratives. He led efforts to topple monuments to the Soviet Red Army in Poland, and Russia responded by putting him on a wanted list, according to Polish media reports.",
      "Nawrocki's supporters describe him as the embodiment of traditional, patriotic values. Those who oppose secular trends, including LGBTQ+ visibility, have embraced him, viewing him as a reflection of the values they grew up with.",
      "Nawrocki's candidacy was clouded by allegations of past connections to criminal figures and his participation in a violent street brawl. He denies the criminal links but was unapologetic about the street fight, saying he had taken part in \"noble\" fights in his life. The revelations didn't seem to hurt his support among right-wing voters, many of whom see the allegations as politically motivated.",
      "Nawrocki endorsed by Trump",
      "Mr. Trump made it clear he wanted Nawrocki as Poland's president.",
      "He welcomed Nawrocki to the White House a month ago. And last week, the conservative group CPAC held its first meeting in Poland to give Nawrocki a boost. Kristi Noem, the U.S. Homeland Security secretary and a prominent Trump ally, strongly praised Nawrocki and urged Poles to vote for him.",
      "The U.S. has about 10,000 troops stationed in Poland and Noem suggested that military ties could deepen with Nawrocki as president.",
      "A common refrain from Nawrocki's supporters is that he will restore \"normality,\" as they believe Mr. Trump has done. U.S. flags often appeared at Nawrocki's rallies, and his supporters believed he offered a better chance for good ties with the Trump administration.",
      "Nawrocki has also echoed some of Mr. Trump's language on Ukraine. He promises to continue Poland's support for Ukraine but has been critical of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, accusing him of taking advantage of allies. He has accused Ukrainian refugees of taking advantage of Polish generosity, vowing to prioritize Poles for social services such as health care and schooling.",
      "For his part, Zelenskyy said Monday he wants to work with Nawrocki, AFP reported. \"I look forward to continued fruitful cooperation with Poland and with President Nawrocki personally,\" Zelensky said in social media post.",
      "NATO chief Mark Rutte congratulated Nawrocki on Monday, vowing to work together to boost the alliance in the face of the threat from Russia, according to AFP.",

    "summary": "Dozens of wildfires remained active Sunday and diminished air quality in parts of Canada and the U.S., according to officials.",
    "story": [
      "More than 25,000 residents in three provinces have been evacuated as dozens of\u00a0wildfires\u00a0remained active Sunday and diminished air quality in parts of Canada and the U.S., according to officials.",
      "Roughly 17,000 residents in the Canadian province of Manitoba have been evacuated because of nearly two dozen active wildfires, officials said. More than 5,000 of those are from Flin Flon, where there is no rain in the immediate forecast.",
      "There have been no structure fires in the city located nearly 400 miles northwest of the provincial capital of Winnipeg as of Sunday, but officials worry that a change in wind direction could bring the fire into town.",
      "Ongoing hot, dry weather is allowing some fires to grow and threaten communities, and resources to fight the fires and support the evacuees are stretched thin, Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe said. Smoke was also worsening air quality and reducing visibility in Canada and into some U.S. states along the border.",
      "\"Air quality and visibility due to wildfire smoke can fluctuate over short distances and can vary considerably from hour to hour,\" Saskatchewan's Public Safety Agency warned Sunday. \"As smoke levels increase, health risks increase.\"",
      "Manitoba declared a state of emergency on Wednesday as the fires burning from the northwest to the southeast forced evacuations in several communities in the province directly north of the U.S. states of Minnesota and North Dakota.",
      "Thousands have also been affected by wildfires in Saskatchewan and Alberta, with 1,300 people in the community of Swan Hills northwest of Edmonton forced from their homes.",
      "Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe told a news conference Saturday that ongoing hot, dry weather is allowing some fires to grow and threaten communities, and that the current figure of 8,000 fire evacuees could climb to 10,000.",
      "\"The next four to seven days are absolutely critical until we can find our way to changing weather patterns, and ultimately a soaking rain throughout the north,\" Moe said.",
      "As of Sunday afternoon, more than 170 active fires were burning across Canada, according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre. Of those, 89 were considering to be burning \"out of control.\"",
      "Smoke from the wildfires was expected to drift down into the U.S., with air quality alerts issued for portions of the Upper Midwest.",
      "\"Smoke from Canadian wildfires continue to spread across the skies across much of the Upper Midwest and Great Lakes,\" the National Weather Service wrote. \"\u2026The smoke will also create air quality issues at times, mainly for sensitive groups.\"",
      "Canada's wildfire season runs from May through September. Its worst-ever wildfire season was in 2023. It choked much of North America with dangerous smoke for months.",
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Forest Service said Saturday it has deployed an air tanker to Alberta, and the U.S. is sending 150 firefighters and equipment like sprinkler kits, pumps and hoses to Canada.",
      "\"We are here to help our neighbors during their time of need, and our Forest Service Wildland Firefighters are the best in the business. I am thankful for the men and women who are bravely stepping up to serve,\" U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke L. Rollins said in a statement.",
      "In northern Manitoba, fire knocked out power to the community of Cranberry Portage, forcing a mandatory evacuation order Saturday for about 600 residents. People living in smaller nearby communities were told to prepare to evacuate after a fire jumped a highway.",
      "\"Please start getting ready and making plans to stay with family and friends as accommodations are extremely limited,\" Lori Forbes, the emergency coordinator for the Rural Municipality of Kelsey, posted on social media.",
      "Evacuation centers have opened across the province for those fleeing the fires, including one as far south as Winkler, Manitoba, 12 miles from the U.S. border.",
      "Evacuations that started earlier in the week for Pimicikamak Cree Nation ramped up Saturday, when five flights were expected to take residents to Winnipeg. \"The wildfire has crossed the main road, and the area remains filled with smoke and ash,\" Chief David Monias wrote on social media.",
      "Winnipeg has opened up public buildings for evacuees as it deals with hotels already crammed with other fire refugees, vacationers, business people and convention-goers.",
      "Manitoba's Indigenous leaders, including Monias, told a news conference on Saturday that hotel rooms in the cities where evacuees are arriving are full, and they called on the government to direct hotel owners to give evacuees priority.",
      "Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs Grand Chief Kyra Wilson said it was one of the largest evacuations in the province since the 1990s.",
      "\"It's really sad to see our children having to sleep on floors. People are sitting, waiting in hallways, waiting outside, and right now we just need people to come together. People are tired,\" Wilson said at the news conference.",
      "\"We need to make sure that we have space for our people.\"",
      "The fire menacing Flin Flon began Monday near Creighton, Saskatchewan, and quickly jumped the boundary into Manitoba. Crews have struggled to contain it. Water bombers have been intermittently grounded due to heavy smoke and a drone incursion.",
      "The 1,200 or so residents of Creighton have also been ordered out, many of whom have gone to nearby Nipawin, Saskatchewan. In total, more than 8,000 people have fled wildfires in Saskatchewan.",

      "Climate campaigner Greta Thunberg and 11 other activists set sail for the Gaza Strip on Sunday afternoon, aboard a ship carrying aid. The mission is aimed at \"breaking Israel's siege\" of the devastated territory, organizers said.",
      "\"Game of Thrones\" actor Liam Cunningham and Rima Hassan, a French member of the European Parliament who is of Palestinian descent, are also among the crew. Hassan has been barred from entering Israel due to her active opposition to the Israeli assault on Gaza.",
      "The sailing boat Madleen \u2014 operated by activist group Freedom Flotilla Coalition \u2014 departed from the Sicilian port of Catania, in southern Italy.",
      "\"'Madleen' sails to Gaza today with twelve humanitarians and as much life-saving aid as she can carry, including baby formula, medical supplies, and more. She departs from European territorial waters, sailing entirely through international waters into Palestinian waters off Gaza,\" the coalition wrote\u00a0in a social media post Sunday. \"Unarmed and nonviolent, 'Madleen' poses no threat. She sails in full accordance with international law. Any attack or interference will be a deliberate, unlawful assault on civilians.\"",
      "As the crew tries to reach the shores of Gaza, they hope their trip will raise \"international awareness\" over the ongoing humanitarian crisis, the activists said at a press conference on Sunday, ahead of departure.",
      "\"We are doing this because, no matter what odds we are against, we have to keep trying,\" Thunberg said, bursting into tears during her speech.",
      "\"Because the moment we stop trying is when we lose our humanity. And no matter how dangerous this mission is, it's not even near as dangerous as the silence of the entire world in the face of the live-streamed genocide,\" she added.",
      "Israel, which was founded in the aftermath of the Holocaust, has adamantly rejected genocide allegations against it as an antisemitic \"blood libel.\"",
      "In mid-May, Israel slightly eased its blockade of Gaza after nearly three months, allowing a limited amount of humanitarian aid into the territory.",
      "Experts have warned that Gaza is at risk of famine if more aid is not brought in.",
      "U.N. agencies and major aid groups say Israeli restrictions, the breakdown of law and order, and widespread looting make it extremely difficult to deliver aid to Gaza's roughly 2 million Palestinians.",
      "The activists expect to take seven days to get to their destination, if they are not stopped.",
      "Thunberg, who became an internationally famous climate activist after organizing massive teen protests in her native Sweden, had been due to board a previous Freedom Flotilla ship last month.",
      "That attempt to reach Gaza by sea, in early May, failed after another of the group's vessels, the \"Conscience,\" was attacked by two alleged drones while sailing in international waters off the coast of Malta.",
      "The group blamed Israel for the attack, which damaged the front section of the ship, in the latest confrontation over efforts to send assistance to the Palestinian territory devastated by nearly 19 months of war.",
      "The Israeli government says the blockade is an attempt to pressure Hamas to release hostages it took during the Oct. 7, 2023, attack that triggered the conflict. Hamas-led militants assaulted southern Israel that day, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting 251. Hamas is still holding 58 hostages, 23 of whom are believed to be alive.",
      "In response, Israel launched an offensive that has killed over 52,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and civilians. Israel's bombardment and ground operations have destroyed vast areas of the territory and left most of its population homeless.",
      "The Flotilla group was only the latest among a growing number of critics to accuse Israel of genocidal acts in its war in Gaza. Israel vehemently denies the allegations, saying its war is directed at Hamas militants, not Gaza's civilians.",
      "\"We are breaking the siege of Gaza by sea, but that's part of a broader strategy of mobilizations that will also attempt to break the siege by land,\" said activist Thiago Avila.",
      "Avila cited the upcoming Global March to Gaza \u2014 an international initiative also open to doctors, lawyers and media \u2014 which is set to leave Egypt and reach the Rafah crossing in mid-June to stage a protest there, asking Israel to stop the Gaza offensive and reopen the border.",

    "story": [
      "Two fans died and a police officer was placed under an induced coma after celebrations around France, to mark Paris Saint-Germain's historic Champions League victory, turned violent Saturday night, French authorities said Sunday. The Champions League is Europe's biggest soccer prize.",
      "In addition, at least 559 people were arrested nationwide during the mass celebrations, including at least 491 in the capital, the French interior ministry said, according to AFP.",
      "The fatalities marred what started as a night of exuberance after PSG clinched its first \u2014 and long-awaited \u2014 Champions League title, in a 5-0 win over Inter Milan. The Eiffel Tower glowed in team colors, and fans partied through the night in celebrations that were largely peaceful but degenerated into violence in some areas.",
      "A 17-year-old boy was stabbed to death in the western city of Dax during a PSG street party after Saturday night's final in Munich, the national police service said. A man in his 20s was killed in Paris when his scooter was hit by a car during PSG celebrations, the interior minister's office said. The circumstances of both are being investigated.",
      "A police officer was hit accidentally by fireworks at a PSG gathering in Coutances in northwest France and placed in an artificial coma because of grave eye injuries, the national police service said. A total of 192 people were injured around the capital, four of them seriously, the Paris police chief said.",
      "The officer hit by fireworks was among \"many\" police officers and firefighters around France who sustained injuries while intervening to restore order in Champions League celebrations gone awry, said the French National Police.",
      "The team is expected to return to a big victory parade on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es on Sunday afternoon, with up to 110,000 people allowed along the iconic, tree-lined avenue to see the victorious players.",
      "Later, the team will join fans packed into PSG's home stadium, the Parc des Princes,\u00a0on the city's western edge, for a concert and light show and official presentation of the Champions League trophy.",
      "A wide swath of central Paris was closed to traffic for the exceptional day. The security measures are also impacting the French Open unfolding nearby.",
      "Thousands of police are being deployed to keep order, and will employ similar tactics as they did Saturday night, Paris police chief Laurent Nunez told reporters. AP reporters saw tear gas used near the stadium and water cannons used near the Arc de Triomphe to disperse rowdy crowds.",
      "In addition to the injuries and arrests, Nunez said four stores were looted overnight. Firefighters were so busy extinguishing garbage can fires in the middle of celebrations and dealing with other emergencies that the fire hotline was saturated.",
      "By 2 a.m. on Sunday, a total of 294 arrests had been made, including 30 people who broke into a shoe shop on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es. Two cars were set alight close to Parc des Princes, police added.",
      "At the Place de la Bastille, there were joyous scenes as fans climbed onto the base of the famous column, singing, dancing and letting off flares, while those around joined in.",
      "At one point, motorbikes loudly revved their engines and the crowd cheered as they did laps around the column. There were no police nearby and, by 1 a.m., the atmosphere was upbeat with no tensions and plenty of singing.",
      "Nunez blamed the scattered troubles on \u2033thousands of people who came to commit acts of violence\u2033 instead of watching the match. He noted similar unrest on the sidelines of prior celebrations in the capital, such as after France's World Cup win in 2018.",

    "summary": "At 37 she became the world's youngest female head of government. Now a fellow at Harvard University, Jacinda Ardern talks about the importance of exhibiting kindness and empathy in politics.",
    "story": [
      "These days, at her local coffee shop near Boston, Jacinda Ardern can be just another customer. \"I don't put my name on the order; it's too complicated!\" she laughed.",
      "I asked, \"When you order coffee here, do people start talking politics with you?\"",
      "\"No. Not at all,\" Ardern replied. \"In fact, the guy behind the counter said to me, 'Ah, you are really familiar. Oh, I know: Toni Collette!'\"",
      "That's a moment that would never happen in New Zealand, where Ardern became the world's youngest female head of government when she was just 37 years old. Now 44, former Prime Minister Ardern has been living in the U.S. since she left office two years ago. She is serving as a fellow at Harvard University, and has written a new book, \"A Different Kind of Power\" (to be published June 3 by Crown).",
      "Of the title, she says, \"I think, you know, there are different ways to lead. But I hope you also see that some of those character traits that we perhaps bring to it that we might believe to be weaknesses \u2013 imposter syndrome, or even empathy \u2013 actually are incredible strengths.\"",
      "Ardern says her story is about finding her voice in New Zealand, a small nation of about five million people. \"I never, ever saw myself becoming prime minister, ever,\" she said.",
      "In fact, her father told Ardern that she was too \"thin-skinned\" for politics.",
      "Was he right? \"He was absolutely right!\" she laughed. \"But I guess where I corrected him is, your sensitivity is your empathy. And goodness, don't we need a bit more of that?\"",
      "In New Zealand, the answer was yes. Ahead of the 2017 election, Ardern suddenly became the leader of her country's left-leaning Labour Party. Weeks after winning, she made an announcement: she was pregnant. Her journey, alongside her then-partner, now-husband, Clarke, soon won her global attention.",
      "Was she comfortable with the symbolism of her role? Ardern said, \"I realized the importance of it when I first received a letter from someone on their way to work to tell their boss that they were having a baby, and they felt nervous about their boss' view of whether they could do their job When she heard that I was pregnant, and that gave her a level of confidence, you know, I felt like I also needed to show I could do the job and be a mother.\"",
      "But those joyful early days were followed by challenges. In 2019, mass shootings targeting Muslims in Christchurch left more than 50 dead \u2013 a crucible for New Zealand, and a call to action for its leader: a ban on semi-automatic weapons.",
      "I asked, \"Why do you believe you and your colleagues in New Zealand were able to achieve gun control reform in the wake of a horrific mass shooting, but so often here in the United States such legislative changes have been hard to get?\"",
      "\"I can't speak to the U.S. experience,\" Ardern replied, \"but if we really wanted to say, 'We don't ever want this to happen again,' we needed to demonstrate what we were doing to make that a reality.\"",
      "But even after she won another election, things weren't easy. As the pandemic wore on, tensions flared over her government's COVID policies. In 2023, when she stunned many by deciding to resign, she wore her heart on her sleeve, telling Parliament: \"You can be a nerd, a cryer, a hugger, you can be all of these things, and not only can you be here, you can lead, just like me.\"",
      "Though she has left office, she has not stopped keeping a close eye on our turbulent ties. Asked what she makes of President Trump and his decisions on trade and foreign policy, Ardern said, \"You know, we are seeing people experience deep financial insecurity, and that has to be addressed by political leaders. But I continue to hold that ideas of isolation or protectionism or closing ourselves off to remedy the issue actually doesn't remedy it in the long term, and has a long-term negative impact for some of the collective issues we need to address as a global community.\"",
      "For now, Ardern is not angling to jump back into politics, but she is settling into her new normal \u2013 that is, \"Being just a normal family.\"",
      "And when she is asked for advice \u2013 in a Harvard classroom, or from a world leader \u2013 Jacinda Ardern tells them to be kind: \"That principle of kindness, it's something we teach our kids. Why shouldn't we role model that in the way that we conduct ourselves in politics? And secondly, if you're putting people at the center of what you're doing, it's a reminder that, actually, the act of being in politics is an act of public service as well. And I think voters need to see more of that.\"",

      "Rep. Byron Donalds, who has been endorsed by Trump to replace term-limited Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, introduced the \"Strengthening American Nuclear Energy Act\" in an effort to codify four of the president's executive actions related to boosting nuclear energy production and use in the United States. Trump signed the orders late last-month.",

      "One of those orders, the \"Deploying Advanced Nuclear Reactor Technologies for National Security,\" directs the Army to build a nuclear reactor \"at a domestic military base or installation\" by September 30, 2028. The order also directs the Secretary of Energy to establish artificial intelligence data centers that run on nuclear energy at Department of Energy facilities across the 48 contiguous States and the District of Columbia, with the goal of having the first one completed within the next 30-months. Finally, in addition to these measures and others, the wide-ranging executive order directs the country to pursue at least 20 new international nuclear cooperation agreements.",
      "Meanwhile, another one of the orders that Donalds' legislation seeks to codify compels the Secretaries of Defense, Transportation and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget to prepare a comprehensive report within 240 days of when the order was signed. The report is supposed to include a national strategy to support the management of spent nuclear fuel and other \"high-level waste,\" an evaluation of the current reprocessing and recycling efforts related to spent nuclear fuel and recommendations on how to improve it, and a program to develop methods and techniques for transporting used and unused nuclear fuel.",

It also imposes timelines for the government to update its nuclear energy policies to spur production, and says that at least 10 large nuclear reactors must be under construction no later than 2030.",
      "The final two orders from Trump, which Donalds is seeking to codify, are largely aimed at reducing regulatory burdens surrounding nuclear energy production.",
      "The first of the two seeks to reform the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) in order to help accelerate domestic nuclear energy production. The order aims to do away with what it describes as the NRC's excessive caution that has hindered the growth of nuclear energy in the United States.",

      "The second regulatory-focused nuclear energy directive from Trump is aimed at reforming the Department of Energy's nuclear reactor testing, in an effort to speed up the development of nuclear power plants. For instance, the order requires officials at the Energy Department to revise internal procedures to ensure that new reactors can become operational within two years of when builders apply to construct it.",

Cybercriminals are aware of this, and they have evolved their tactics by shifting to more complex and convincing schemes designed to bypass skepticism and lure victims.",
      "Their goal remains the same: to trick you into handing over sensitive information, especially credit card data. One of the latest examples is the rise in subscription scam campaigns.

Facebook is being used as the primary platform to promote these new and sophisticated scams.",

These sites, often promoted through Facebook ads, sell everything from clothes and electronics to beauty products, but the real goal is to trick users into signing up for recurring payments, often without realizing it.",
      "One of the most common lures is the \"mystery box\" scam, where you are promised a surprise package at a bargain price. These offers are made to look fun and harmless, but behind the scenes you are giving away personal and credit card information while unknowingly agreeing to hidden subscription terms, often written in tiny fine print.",
      "The scam doesn\u2019t stop there. Once you\u2019re convinced and reach the checkout page, scammers often layer in a second scam, like loyalty cards or VIP memberships that further lock you into payments.

To avoid automatic detection, they employ several tactics. These include running multiple versions of an ad, with only one of which is actually malicious while the others display harmless product images, uploading ad images from platforms like Google Drive so they can be swapped out later and cropping visuals to alter recognizable patterns.",

      "Even as scammers become more sophisticated, there are practical steps you can take right now to protect your personal and financial information from subscription fraud and other online threats. Here are ten proactive measures to help keep your data safe:",
      "1) Always read the fine print: One of the simplest yet most effective ways to protect yourself from subscription scams is to slow down and read the fine print, especially on checkout pages. Scammers often hide recurring payment terms in small or lightly colored text that\u2019s easy to miss. What seems like a one-time purchase could actually sign you up for a biweekly or monthly charge. Taking just a moment to scan for hidden terms before hitting \"Pay\" can help you avoid weeks of silent billing.",
      "2) Avoid mystery box or VIP-style deals:\u00a0These offers often prey on curiosity and the promise of surprise or luxury for a low fee. In reality, the \"mystery\" is the trap: you might receive nothing or a low-quality item while being unknowingly enrolled in a recurring subscription. Scammers use the illusion of exclusivity or urgency to pressure quick decisions.",
      "3) Don\u2019t trust ads blindly on social media:\u00a0Facebook, Instagram and other platforms are a hotbed for these scams, with criminals running paid ads that mimic well-known brands or influencers. These ads often link to professional-looking but fake storefronts. If you\u2019re interested in a deal you see online, don\u2019t click through immediately. Instead, look up the brand or offer in a separate tab and check if it exists outside social media.",
      "4) Investigate before you buy:\u00a0Before purchasing from any unfamiliar site, take a few quick steps to verify its legitimacy. Search the brand's name alongside words like \"scam\" or \"reviews\" to see what others have experienced. Look up the company's physical address and check if it actually exists using tools like Google Maps. Make sure the website uses HTTPS, review the site's contact information and cross-check reviews on trusted third-party sites like the Better Business Bureau or Consumer Reports.",
      "5) Use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Adding a strong antivirus program to your devices can provide an extra layer of defense against fraudulent websites and phishing attempts. Strong antivirus software warns you about suspicious links, blocks malicious ads and scans downloads for malware. Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "6) Invest in personal data removal services:\u00a0Scammers often rely on leaked or publicly available personal information to target victims with convincing subscription scams. Investing in a personal data removal service can help minimize your digital footprint by removing your information from data broker databases and reducing the chances of being targeted in future campaigns. Regularly monitoring and cleaning up your online presence makes it harder for fraudsters to exploit your data for financial gain.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Get a\u00a0free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web.",
      "7) Be cautious with payment methods: Use secure payment options like credit cards, which often offer better fraud protection than wire transfers, gift cards or cryptocurrency.",
      "8) Limit personal information shared on social media: Scammers often gather details from public profiles to craft convincing scams. Review your privacy settings and only share necessary information.",
      "9) Use strong, unique passwords and enable multifactor authentication:\u00a0Create strong, unique passwords for each of your online accounts, especially those tied to your finances or shopping. Enable multifactor authentication wherever possible, as this adds an extra layer of security and makes it harder for scammers to access your accounts, even if your password is compromised. Also, consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords.\u00a0Get more details about my best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "10) Keep your devices and software updated:\u00a0Regularly\u00a0update your operating system, browsers and apps. Security updates often patch vulnerabilities that scammers exploit to gain access to your information or install malicious software.",
      "MALWARE EXPOSES 3.9 BILLION PASSWORDS IN HUGE CYBERSECURITY THREAT",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "While the rise of subscription scams and deceptive ads is concerning, it\u2019s especially troubling that platforms like Facebook continue to allow these fraudulent ads to run unchecked. Facebook has repeatedly failed to adequately vet or prevent these malicious campaigns from reaching vulnerable individuals. The platform\u2019s ad approval system should be more proactive in spotting and blocking ads promoting scams, particularly those that impersonate well-known brands or content creators.",

      "A chilling video circulating on social media has reignited old anxieties about robots turning against their creators. The footage shows a Unitree H1 humanoid robot, a machine about the size of an adult human, suddenly flailing its arms and legs with alarming force during a test, coming dangerously close to two technicians.",
      "The scene has sparked heated debate about the safety of advanced robotics and artificial intelligence. But is this truly the beginning of something out of our worst fears, or is there just a straightforward technical explanation for what happened?",

      "What the video shows",
      "In the viral clip first posted on\u00a0Reddit, the\u00a0Unitree H1 is seen suspended from a crane at a Chinese factory, surrounded by two handlers. Without warning, the robot loses control, thrashing its limbs, knocking over equipment and forcing the technicians to scramble out of harm's way. The chaos is palpable, and the images quickly drew comparisons to movies like \"The Terminator\" and \"I, Robot,\" with many viewers wondering if the age of rogue machines had finally arrived.",

      "The robot behind the incident",
      "The Unitree H1 is not a prototype but a commercially available, general-purpose humanoid robot. Standing 5.9 feet tall and weighing 104 pounds, it's designed to walk, run and even perform dynamic movements like backflips and dancing. Its joints are powerful and capable of generating 365 pound-feet of torque, enough to lift heavy objects or, in the wrong circumstances, cause serious harm.",

      "What went wrong?",
      "Despite the frightening visuals, the reality is far less sinister. According to engineers and robotics experts, the root cause of the malfunction was a combination of software and design oversight. During the test, the H1 was tethered by its head for safety, a common practice during public demonstrations. However, this physical restraint was not accounted for in the robot's balance algorithm.",
      "The robot's sensors interpreted the resistance from the tether as if it were constantly falling. In response, the H1's stabilization software tried to correct its position, but the tether prevented normal movement. This created a feedback loop: the robot made increasingly aggressive corrections, resulting in the violent flailing seen in the video. Investigators concluded that this was not a case of emergent AI behavior but rather a known failure mode triggered by an unanticipated physical constraint and software flaw.",

      "Although no one was seriously injured, the incident set off a wave of panic online. Many viewers saw the video without any technical context, fueling fears of a robot uprising. The imagery alone was enough to make people question whether advanced robots are safe to have around humans.",
      "Experts, however, were quick to clarify that the malfunction was not evidence of a conscious or rebellious machine. Instead, it highlighted the importance of thorough safety protocols and testing, especially when deploying powerful machines in environments shared with people.",

      "Second, transparency from manufacturers plays a crucial role. When companies provide quick and clear explanations, they can help prevent panic and stop misinformation from spreading.",
      "Finally, it is important to remember that artificial intelligence is not sentient, at least not yet. The Unitree H1's behavior was caused by programming and sensor misinterpretation, not by any independent thought or intent.",

      "The viral Unitree H1 video is a reminder that technology, especially when it's powerful and autonomous, demands respect and caution. While the footage is unsettling, the true story is one of technical error, not a robot rebellion. As robots become more common in our workplaces and public spaces, incidents like this will serve as important lessons for engineers, regulators and the public alike. For now, the machines are not plotting against us, but they do need careful supervision and thoughtful design to keep everyone safe.",

      "6 ways you can protect yourself from infostealer malware",
      "To protect yourself from the evolving threat of infostealer malware, which continues to target users through sophisticated social engineering tactics, consider taking these six essential security measures:",
      "1. Be skeptical of CAPTCHA prompts: Legitimate CAPTCHA tests never require you to press Windows + R, copy commands or paste anything into PowerShell. If a website instructs you to do this, it\u2019s likely a scam. Close the page immediately and avoid interacting with it.",
      "2. Don\u2019t click links from unverified emails and use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Many infostealer attacks start with phishing emails that impersonate trusted services. Always verify the sender before clicking on links. If an email seems urgent or unexpected, go directly to the company\u2019s official website instead of clicking any links inside the email.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe. Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "3. Enable two-factor authentication:\u00a0Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) whenever possible. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as a code sent to your phone, in addition to your password.",
      "4. Keep devices updated: Regularly\u00a0updating your operating system, browser and security software ensures you have the latest patches against known vulnerabilities. Cybercriminals exploit outdated systems, so enabling automatic updates is a simple but effective way to stay protected.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "5. Monitor your accounts for suspicious activity and change your passwords:\u00a0If you\u2019ve interacted with a suspicious website, phishing email or fake login page, check your online accounts for any unusual activity. Look for unexpected login attempts, unauthorized password resets or financial transactions that you don\u2019t recognize. If anything seems off, change your passwords immediately and report the activity to the relevant service provider. Also, consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",
      "6. Invest in a personal data removal service: Consider using a service that monitors your personal information and alerts you to potential breaches or unauthorized use of your data. These services can provide early warning signs of identity theft or other malicious activities resulting from infostealer malware or similar attacks. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0\u200bCheck out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "6 ways to protect yourself after a data breach",
      "1. Change your password on every platform: If your login credentials have been exposed, it\u2019s not enough to change the password on just one account. Cybercriminals often try the same combinations across multiple platforms, hoping to gain access through reused credentials. Start by updating your most critical accounts, email, banking, cloud storage and social media, then move on to others. Use a new, unique password for each platform and avoid variations of old passwords, as they can still be predictable. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords.",
      "Our\u00a0top-rated password manager delivers powerful protection to help keep your accounts secure. It features\u00a0real-time data breach monitoring to alert you if your login details have been exposed, plus a built-in\u00a0data breach scanner\u00a0that checks your saved emails, passwords and credit card information against known leak databases. A password health checker also highlights weak, reused or compromised passwords so you can strengthen your online defenses with just a few clicks. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",
      "2. Enable two-factor authentication: Two-factor authentication, or 2FA, is a critical security feature that drastically reduces the risk of unauthorized access. Even if someone has your password, they won\u2019t be able to log in without the second verification step, usually a one-time code sent to your phone or an authenticator app. Enable 2FA on all services that support it, especially your email, financial accounts and any service that stores sensitive personal data.",
      "3. Watch for unusual account activity: After a breach, it\u2019s common for compromised accounts to be used for spam, scams, or identity theft. Pay close attention to signs such as login attempts from unfamiliar locations, password reset requests you didn\u2019t initiate or unexpected messages sent from your accounts. Most platforms allow you to review login history and connected devices. If you see something off, take action immediately by changing your password and revoking suspicious sessions.",
      "4. Invest in personal data removal services:\u00a0You should also consider a data removal service. Given the scale and frequency of breaches like the one described above, relying on personal caution alone is no longer enough. Automated data removal services can provide an essential extra layer of defense by continuously scanning for and helping eliminate your exposed information from data broker sites and other online sources. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Get a\u00a0free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web.",
      "5. Avoid clicking on suspicious links and use strong antivirus software: One of the most common post-breach threats is phishing. Cybercriminals often use information from leaked databases to craft convincing emails that urge you to verify your account or reset your password. Never click on links or download attachments from unknown or suspicious sources. Instead, visit websites by typing the URL directly into your browser.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping\u00a0your personal information and digital assets safe. Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "6. Keep your software and devices up to date: Many cyberattacks exploit known vulnerabilities in outdated software. Operating systems, browsers, antivirus programs and even apps\u00a0need to be updated regularly to patch security flaws. Turn on automatic updates wherever possible so you\u2019re protected as soon as fixes are released. Staying current with your software is one of the easiest and most effective ways to block malware, ransomware and spyware from infiltrating your system.",
      "HACKERS USING MALWARE TO STEAL DATA FROM USB FLASH DRIVES",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Security is not only the responsibility of companies and hosting providers. Users need to adopt better practices, including unique passwords, multifactor authentication and regular reviews of their digital footprint. The careless exposure of over 184 million credentials is not just a mistake. It is an example of how fragile our systems remain when even basic protection is absent. In an era where artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and global connectivity are reshaping technology, it is unacceptable that plain text files containing financial and governmental credentials are still left sitting online.",

      "Life before Neuralink",
      "Before receiving the\u00a0Neuralink implant, Smith relied on eye-tracking technology to communicate. While impressive, it came with major limitations.\u00a0\"It is a miracle of technology, but it is frustrating. It works best in dark rooms, so I was basically Batman. I was stuck in a dark room,\"\u00a0Smith shared in a\u00a0recent post on X. Bright environments would disrupt the system, making communication slow and sometimes impossible.

      "How the Neuralink brain implant works",
      "Smith is the first non-verbal person and only the third individual worldwide to receive the Neuralink Brain-Computer Interface (BCI). The device, about as thick as five stacked coins, sits in his skull and connects to the motor cortex-the part of the brain that controls movement.",
      "Tiny wires, thinner than human hair, extend into Smith's brain. These pick up signals from his neurons and transmit them wirelessly to his MacBook Pro. The computer then decodes these signals, allowing Smith to move a cursor on the screen with his thoughts alone.",
      "As Smith explains, \"The Neuralink implant embedded in my brain contains 1024 electrodes that capture neuron firings every 15 milliseconds generating a vast amount of data. Artificial intelligence processes this data on a connected MacBook Pro to decode my intended movements in real time to move the cursor on my screen. Neuralink does not read my deepest thoughts or words I think about. It just reads how I wanna move and moves the cursor where I want.\"",

      "Learning to use the system took some trial and error. At first, the team tried mapping Smith's hand movements to the cursor, but it didn't work well. After more research, they discovered that signals related to his tongue were the most effective for cursor movement, and clenching his jaw worked best for clicking.\u00a0\"I am not actively thinking about my tongue, just like you don't think about your wrist when you move a mouse. I have done a lot of cursor movements in my life. I think my brain has switched over to subconscious control quickly so I just think about moving the cursor,\"\u00a0Smith said.",

The system includes a virtual keyboard and shortcuts for common actions, making tasks like copying, pasting and navigating web pages much easier.",
      "Smith also worked with Neuralink engineers to develop a \"parking spot\" feature for the cursor.\u00a0\"Sometimes you just wanna park the cursor and watch a video. When it is in the parking spot, I can watch a show or take a nap without worrying about the cursor,\" he explained.",

It uses Grok 3 and an AI clone of my old voice to generate options for me to say. It is not perfect, but it keeps me in the conversation and it comes up with some great ideas,\" Smith shared.

Despite the challenges of ALS, Smith finds meaning and hope in his faith.\u00a0\"I have not always understood why God afflicted me with ALS but with time I am learning to trust his plan for me. I'm a better man because of ALS. I'm a better disciple of Jesus Christ because of ALS. I'm closer to my amazing wife, literally and figuratively, because of ALS,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "Tech expert Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson says a tech support scam used a fake Windows Defender pop-up, tricking the victim to call and download software.",
      "All modern Windows PCs come with Microsoft Defender built in. For the unaware, this tool is Windows\u2019 native antivirus.",
      "Over time, it has matured into a reliable security tool capable of blocking a wide range of threats. However, a tool called Defendnot can shut down Microsoft Defender completely, without exploiting a bug or using malware. It simply convinces Windows that another antivirus is already running.",
      "The implications are serious. This tool does not break into the system or use advanced code injection. It uses Windows features the way they were designed to be used. And that makes the problem harder to detect and harder to fix.",
      "Join the FREE \"CyberGuy Report\": Get my expert tech tips, critical security alerts and exclusive deals, plus instant access to my\u00a0free \"Ultimate Scam Survival Guide\" when you sign up!",
      "Windows software on a PC (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "The tool works by pretending to be an antivirus",
      "Windows is built to avoid running multiple antivirus products at once. When a third-party antivirus registers itself, Windows disables Microsoft Defender to prevent conflicts. Defendnot\u00a0exploits this system using an undocumented API that security software uses to communicate with the Windows Security Center.",
      "The tool registers a fake antivirus that appears legitimate to the system. It uses a dummy DLL and injects it into Task Manager, a trusted Windows process. By operating inside this signed process, Defendnot avoids signature checks and permission blocks. Once the fake antivirus is registered, Windows disables Microsoft Defender without warning or confirmation.",
      "WINDOWS 10 SECURITY FLAWS LEAVE MILLIONS VULNERABLE",
      "No security alert is shown to the user. No visible changes are made to indicate that the system is unprotected. Unless someone checks manually, the machine remains open to attacks with no real-time protection running.",
      "The tool also includes options to set a custom antivirus name, enable logging and configure automatic startup. It achieves persistence by creating a scheduled task that runs whenever the user logs in.",

      "WINDOWS DEFENDER VS ANTIVIRUS SOFTWARE: FREE PROTECTION FALLS SHORT",
      "From GitHub takedown to a fresh build",
      "Defendnot is based on an earlier project called No-Defender. That project used code from an actual antivirus product to fake registration. It gained attention quickly and was removed after a copyright complaint from the vendor whose code had been reused. The developer took the project down and walked away from it.",
      "With Defendnot, the creator rebuilt the core features using original code. This version avoids copyright issues and uses a new method to achieve the same effect. It does not rely on another antivirus or third-party binaries. It was written from scratch to demonstrate how simple it is to manipulate Windows security from inside the system.",
      "Microsoft Defender currently flags the tool as a threat. It detects and quarantines it under the name Win32/Sabsik.FL.!ml. However, the fact that it works at all points to a weakness in how Windows handles antivirus registration and trust.",

      "While Defendnot is a research project, there\u2019s a chance that similar tools are already out there and could be used to compromise your PC. Here are a few tips to help you stay safe:",
      "1. Use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Even with regular updates, Windows systems can be left exposed by tools like Defendnot that silently disable built-in defenses. A strong third-party antivirus with real-time protection and frequent updates provides essential backup security. Look for solutions with real-time protection and frequent updates to tackle emerging threats.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2. Limit exposure:\u00a0Many exploits rely on user interaction, such as clicking a shady link, downloading a compromised file or mounting an untrusted virtual disk. Stick to reputable websites, avoid opening unsolicited email attachments and use a browser with built-in security features (like Microsoft Edge or Chrome with Safe Browsing enabled).",
      "3. Avoid running unexpected commands: Never paste or run commands (like PowerShell scripts) you don\u2019t understand or that were copied from random websites. Attackers often trick users into unknowingly running malware this way.",
      "4. Keep your software updated: Regularly\u00a0update your operating system, browsers and all software applications. Updates often include patches for security vulnerabilities that malware can exploit.",
      "5. Use two-factor authentication (2FA): Enable\u00a02FA on all your accounts. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, making it harder for attackers to gain access even if they have your password.",
      "6. Invest in personal data removal services: Even with strong device security, your personal information may still be exposed online through data brokers and people-finder sites. These services collect and publish details like your name, address and phone number, making you an easier target for identity theft or phishing. Automated data removal services track down these sites and submit removal requests on your behalf, helping to reduce your digital footprint and increase your online anonymity. While they can't erase every trace of your information, they make it significantly harder for attackers to find and exploit your personal data, which saves you time and reduces unwanted spam in the process.",
      "While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Defendnot points to a bigger issue with how Windows handles security. It takes a feature meant to prevent software conflicts and turns it into a way to completely disable protection. The system assumes any registered antivirus is legitimate, so if attackers can fake that, they get in without much resistance.",
      "We often think of security as blocking the bad and trusting the good. But this case shows what happens when that trust is misplaced. Defendnot doesn\u2019t sneak past Windows defenses. It walks right in using valid credentials. The solution isn\u2019t just more patches or stronger malware signatures. What we need is a smarter way for systems to tell what is actually safe.",

      "How these tools work and why that matters",
      "If you haven't tried an LLM like ChatGPT before, here's the gist: They're advanced language processors that chat with you through text. No special commands or coding needed, just type what you want to know or do, and they respond. For example, asking \"Why is the conclave kept secret?\" will get you a detailed explanation in seconds.",
      "This simplicity is what makes LLMs so useful, but it also opens the door to risks. Instead of harmless questions, someone could ask for a detailed profile on a person, and the model might generate a surprisingly thorough report. While these tools have safeguards and often refuse certain requests, clever phrasing can sometimes bypass those limits.",
      "Unfortunately, it doesn't take much effort for someone to use ChatGPT to gather personal information about you. But don't worry, there are ways to protect yourself from this kind of digital snooping.",
      "A person using ChatGPT on their phone (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "WHAT HACKERS CAN LEARN ABOUT YOU FROM A DATA BROKER FILE",
      "How to stop it",
      "These AI tools don\u2019t just pull information out of thin air. They need to access real online sources to work.\u00a0In other words, your data is already out there on the internet; AI tools just make it easier to find.\u00a0And if you look at the sources, most of the information you wouldn\u2019t want shared online, like your address, relatives and so on, is made public by people-search sites. Other sources include social media, like LinkedIn and Facebook, as well as public databases. But none of them are as invasive as people-search sites.",
      "Let\u2019s see what you can do to limit how much of your information is exposed online.",
      "A woman using ChatGPT on her laptop (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "THINK YOU CAN DELETE YOUR OWN DATA? WHY IT'S HARDER THAN YOU THINK",
      "Essential steps and precautions to protect your privacy",
      "To effectively safeguard your personal information from being exposed or misused, it's important to follow these steps and adopt key precautions.",
      "Although not all people-search sites are required to offer it, most of them do provide an option to request an opt-out. But that comes with a few challenges.",
      "Where to start: Identifying people-search sites that expose your personal information",
      "There are hundreds of people-search sites registered in the U.S. Going through each and every one is, realistically speaking, impossible. You\u2019ll need to narrow your search somehow.",
      "Using AI tools: How to find and list data broker sites with your personal data",
      "Use AI tools and ask them to run a deep search on yourself. It\u2019s not a perfect or complete solution; LLMs tend to shorten their responses to save resources. But it will give you a good starting point, and if you keep asking for more results, you should be able to put together a decent list of people-search sites that might have your profile.",
      "Submitting opt-out requests: How to remove your information from people-search sites",
      "Now, you\u2019ll have to go through each of these people-search sites and submit opt-out requests. These usually aren\u2019t complicated, but they're definitely time-consuming. The opt-out forms are typically located at the bottom of each site, in the footer. The naming can vary from \"Do Not Sell My Info\" to \"Opt-Out\" or something similar. Each people-search site is a little different. Opting out of every people-search site that exposes your personal information is a mammoth task. I\u2019ve discussed it in more detail\u00a0here. Alternatively, you can automate this process.",
      "A woman using ChatGPT on her laptop (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "DATA REMOVAL DOES WHAT VPNS DON'T: HERE'S WHY YOU NEED BOTH",
      "Data removal services are real-time and energy savers when it comes to protecting your personal information online. The way these services work is simple. They send hundreds of data removal requests on your behalf to people-search sites you might not even know exist but are still exposing your data. And with some services, the process goes even further than that.",
      "People-search sites aren\u2019t the only places exposing your personal information without your knowledge. In fact, they\u2019re just a small part of the larger\u00a0data broker industry.",
      "There are marketing, health, financial, risk and many other types of data brokers trading your information. Your data is a commodity they use to make a profit, often without you even realizing it.",
      "Data removal services have taken on the challenge of fighting this threat to your privacy. They continuously scour the web, looking for your profiles. This way, you can just sign up and let them handle the work in the background. And here\u2019s the best part: They take about 10 minutes to set up, roughly the same time it takes to opt out of a single people-search site.",
      "Go to a data removal service that fits your needsChoose a subscription planProvide the minimal information needed for them to effectively locate your profiles on people-search sites",
      "Go to a data removal service that fits your needs",
      "Choose a subscription plan",
      "Provide the minimal information needed for them to effectively locate your profiles on people-search sites",
      "And that\u2019s it. The removal process is entirely automated and requires little to no effort on your part. With this small initial effort, you may save yourself from privacy-related risks, including scams and even\u00a0identity theft. But what if your data is exposed on a people-search site not covered by any data removal service?",
      "Every removal service out there has limitations on the number of data brokers it supports. It\u2019s not about a lack of effort; it\u2019s mostly because brokers are generally unwilling to cooperate, to put it mildly. But there\u2019s a way to address this issue without going back to manual opt-outs. The top names in the data removal industry now offer custom removals. In simple terms, this means you can ask them to remove your personal information from websites not currently covered by their standard plans.",
      "The catch is that you\u2019ll need to do the research yourself and point out which sites are exposing your data. It\u2019s not as convenient as having everything done automatically, but it\u2019s a relatively minor inconvenience for the sake of your online privacy.",
      "Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Being mindful of the information you provide to AI tools is the first and most crucial step in protecting your privacy. Don't share sensitive details such as your full name, home address, financial information, passwords or any other personal data that could be used to identify or harm you or others.",
      "Protecting your AI accounts from unauthorized access helps keep your interactions and data safe. Always use strong, unique passwords and consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store those complex passwords. Enable multifactor authentication whenever possible to add an extra layer of security. Regularly review your account permissions and remove access for any devices or applications you no longer use. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "Adjusting your social media privacy settings can greatly reduce the amount of personal information available to data brokers. Make your profiles private, limit who can see your posts and be selective about accepting friend or follower requests. Periodically audit your privacy settings and remove any unnecessary third-party app connections to further minimize your exposure.",

      "Using a dedicated email address for opt-outs and online sign-ups helps reduce spam and protects your primary email.

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Large language models like ChatGPT are transforming how we work, create and solve problems, but they also introduce new privacy and security risks that can't be ignored. As these tools become more powerful and accessible, it's up to each of us to take proactive steps to safeguard our personal information and understand where our data might be exposed.

      "Kurt Knutsson reports World ID's iris scanning tech launches in six U.S. cities to verify identity, fight AI bots.",
      "OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, known for creating ChatGPT, has launched World, a project that uses an eye scan to prove you are a real person online. The idea is to help people stand out from bots and AI by creating a digital ID with a quick scan from a device called the Orb.",
      "While Altman says this technology keeps humans central as AI advances, it also raises serious concerns about privacy and the security of sensitive biometric data, with critics and regulators questioning how this information will be used and protected.",

      "A woman looking into an Orb (World) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How World ID works",
      "World ID relies on a device called the Orb, a spherical scanner that captures a person's iris pattern to generate a unique IrisCode. It stores the code on a blockchain-based platform, ensuring that users can verify their identity without revealing personal details.",
      "Once scanned, individuals receive their World ID, which can be used for authentication across various platforms where the World ID protocol has been integrated, including Reddit, Telegram and Shopify.",
      "Additionally, those who sign up are rewarded with WLD cryptocurrency as an incentive. They get the equivalent of $40 worth of tokens, which they can spend, exchange or share with other World ID holders.",

      "Aggressive US rollout targets 180M users",
      "World ID is currently available in Austin, Texas, Atlanta, Los Angeles, Nashville, Tennessee, Miami and San Francisco, with plans to expand further. The company aims to deploy 7,500 Orb devices across the U.S. by the end of the year, targeting 180 million users. While the technology promises enhanced security, the debate over its privacy implications continues to grow.",

      "THINK YOU'RE SAFE? IDENTITY THEFT COULD WIPE OUT YOUR ENTIRE LIFE'S SAVINGS",
      "Privacy concerns halt World ID from being widely adopted",
      "World ID has ambitious goals, but despite this, the project has faced significant backlash. Many people worry that storing eye scan data in a worldwide database could put their personal information at risk. Adding to the controversy, critics point out the irony of Sam Altman, whose company, OpenAI, contributes to the very AI challenges World ID aims to solve, being at the helm of this project.",
      "Governments in Spain, Argentina, Kenya and Hong Kong have either suspended or investigated the project due to concerns over excessive data collection. Furthermore, cybersecurity experts warn that once biometric data is linked to an identity system, it becomes irreversible, raising fears of potential surveillance.",
      "OUTSMART HACKERS WHO ARE OUT TO STEAL YOUR IDENTITY",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "World ID helps prove that people online are real humans and not AI bots, something that is on the rise. In this AI-driven world, it can be an essential security measure to ensure the internet is a safer and more trustworthy place. Since the system is integrated with blockchain technology, it can definitely provide secure authentication across multiple platforms. However, the storage of sensitive biometric data in a global database will always raise concerns for many.",

    "summary": "British Prime Minister Keir Starmer unveiled plans to boost the U.K. military to &quot;war-fighting readiness&quot; and support NATO with new innovations.",
    "story": [
      "Sen. David McCormick, R-Pa., discusses the Russia-Ukraine war, President Donald Trump\u2019s tariff policies and the Gaza humanitarian crisis on \u2018Fox News Sunday.\u2019",
      "British Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced Monday that he is moving the United Kingdom's military into \"war-fighting readiness\" to address growing threats from Russia.",
      "During a visit to BAE Systems'Govan facility, a navy ship-building yard in Glasgow, Scotland, the prime minister laid out \"three fundamental changes\" to be made in response to the country's strategic defense review.",
      "\"First, we are moving to war-fighting readiness as the central purpose of our armed forces,\" Starmer said. \"When we are being directly threatened by states with advanced military forces, the most effective way to deter them is to be ready. And frankly, to show them that we're ready, to deliver peace through strength.\"",
      "\u2018MAKE NATO GREAT AGAIN\u2019: HEGSETH PUSHES EUROPEAN ALLIES TO STEP UP DEFENSE EFFORTS",
      "Starmer continued, \"Now Britain has the finest service men and women in the world. We're showing them the respect that they deserve by delivering the biggest armed forces pay rise in 20 years and by pledging today that we will end the hollowing out of our armed forces. \"We'll build a fighting force that is more integrated, more ready, more lethal than ever, backed by a stronger strategic reserve, fully trained and ready to mobilize at any time.\"",
      "Britain's Prime Minister Keir Starmer delivers a speech during a visit to the BAE Systems'Govan facility, in Glasgow, Scotland, on Monday, June 2, 2025.\u00a0 (Andy Buchanan, Pool Photo via AP)",
      "The new approach comes as President Donald Trump has warned European nations to take more responsibility for their own security. Starmer's announcement focused on a \"new era\" of threats, citing the war in Ukraine, new nuclear risks and \"daily cyberattacks,\" as well as reversing the post-Cold War defense decline. He called out \"growing Russian aggression\" in U.K. waters and skies, blaming \"their reckless actions\" for the increased cost of living \"hitting working people the hardest.\"",
      "\"The threat we now face is more serious, more immediate and more unpredictable than at any time since the Cold War,\" Starmer said.",
      "The U.K. government announced military plans in response to a strategic defense review commissioned by Starmer and led by George Robertson, a former U.K. defense secretary and NATO secretary general.",
      "It's the first such review since 2021. Months after Britain's last major defense review was published in 2021, then-Prime Minister Boris Johnson said with confidence that the era of \"fighting big tank battles on European landmass\" are over. Three months later, Russian tanks rolled into Ukraine. Starmer's center-left Labour Party government says it will accept all 62 recommendations made in the review, aiming to help the U.K. confront growing threats on land, air, sea and in cyberspace.",
      "The second change, Starmer explained from Scotland, is ensuring \"everything we do will add to the strength of NATO.\"",
      "\"As we step up to take greater responsibility for our collective defense, the NATO alliance means something profound, that we will never fight alone,\" Starmer said. \"It is a fundamental source of our strategic strength. That's why our defense policy will always be NATO first, something that's written through this review. The transformation we are driving in our defense must add up to Britain's biggest contribution to NATO since its creation. So that when we're building new capabilities at home, we are making our allies safer too, strengthening Europe, and strengthening our bridge to the US as Britain's first partner in defense.\"",
      "Britain's Prime Minister Keir Starmer delivers his speech during a visit to the BAE Systems'Govan facility, in Glasgow, Scotland, on Monday, June 2, 2025.\u00a0 (Andy Buchanan, Pool Photo via AP)",
      "RUBIO DEMANDS NATO PONY UP, DISMISSES 'HYSTERIA' OVER US ROLE UNDER TRUMP",
      "The third change laid out by Starmer is for the U.K. to \"innovate and accelerate at a wartime pace so we can meet the threats of today and of tomorrow as the fastest innovator in NATO.\" He said such advancements would not mean \"replacing people\" or hardware, but would rather mean \"learning the lessons of Ukraine\" and ensuring \"every capability we have works seamlessly together.\"",
      "\"Drones, destroyers, AI, aircraft, each different branch of our armed services, fully integrated to create an army which is 10 times more lethal by 2035,\" Starmer said.",
      "The U.K. government said it's expanding the country's armed, nuclear-powered submarine fleet with up to 12 new SSN-AUKUS boats through a partnership with Australia and the United States. The government also says it will invest 15 billion pounds in Britain\u2019s nuclear arsenal, which consists of missiles carried on a handful of submarines. Details of those plans are likely to be kept secret.",
      "Starmer has already pledged to increase defense spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2027, a boost from the current 2.3%, and to eventually get that up to 3%.",
      "Britain's Prime Minister Keir Starmer delivers his speech during a visit to the BAE Systems'Govan facility, in Glasgow, Scotland, Monday June 2, 2025.\u00a0 (Andy Buchanan, Pool Photo via AP)",
      "GB News noted at the press conference Monday that Starmer hasn\u2019t committed to having 3% of the GDP go to defense spending within the next nine years, even as Germany\u2019s defense chief warned Russia could invade a NATO ally within the next four years. In his response, Starmer reiterated the U.K. as a \"steadfast ally\" to Ukraine and said the changes coming as a result of the review would be the best way to deter further conflict.",
      "The U.K. government will also increase Britain\u2019s conventional weapons stockpiles with up to 7,000 U.K.-built long-range weapons.",

      "In last year\u2019s election, votes for the EFF slumped to under 10%, and both of Malema\u2019s sidekicks, party co-founders and men he described as \"brothers,\" left him and joined a competing party.",

      "To Malema, critics say, the chant may be more than just song lyrics. At least twice he told reporters here, \"We have not called for the killing of White people \u2013 at least for now.\" On another occasion, he demanded, \"We will cut the throat of Whiteness.\"",

However, his popularity as a political leader has faded somewhat.\"",
      "Malema openly supports the terror group Hamas, telling a rally in 2023, shortly after the October 7 attack on Israel, \"when you are oppressed, you only have one option, shoot to kill. There is nothing wrong with what Hamas is doing. The EFF is going to arm Hamas.\" He also shouted he intended to shut down the Israeli Embassy in South Africa. \"We are going to remove this embassy,\" he yelled to loud cheers.",

    "summary": "Cole Schmidtknecht, 22, had insurance but couldn\u2019t afford to refill his asthma inhaler after the cost jumped from $70 to more than $500 at his pharmacy.",
    "story": [
      "When 22-year-old Cole Schmidtknecht tried to get a refill on the inhaler prescribed by his doctor to prevent asthma attacks. The medication that had formerly cost him less than $70 at his Appleton, Wisconsin pharmacy was now priced at more than $500, according to Cole\u2019s father, Bil Schmidtknecht.",
      "Stunned, Cole left the store with a medication designed to stop asthma attacks once they start, but without the Advair Diskus inhaler he needed to prevent attacks from happening in the first place.",
      "Five days after his pharmacy visit last year, Cole had a severe asthma attack, stopped breathing and collapsed. He never regained consciousness and died. Doctors attributed his death to asthma.",
      "His parents, Bil and Shanon Schmidtknecht, blame what they say is a dysfunctional system where medications can change in price overnight and without notice.",
      "A part of the insurance system that many Americans don\u2019t know about was responsible for the spike in Cole\u2019s inhaler price. Pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, are the middlemen that control behind the scenes which drugs will be on an insurance company\u2019s list of covered medications (called its formulary).",
      "They add or subtract medications through a process that emphasizes profits for the pharmacy benefit manager by way of \u201crebates\u201d from drug makers, said Gerard Anderson, a professor of health policy and management at the Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health.",
      "PBMs \u201care looking for the drug that makes them the most money,\u201d Andersen said",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s insane that it\u2019s happening in America,\u201d Bil Schmidknecht said. \u201cIt\u2019s not broken. It\u2019s designed to work this way. It\u2019s just hurting us.\u201d",
      "The Schmidtknechts are pushing for legislation that would require a 90-day warning when an insurance company\u2019s formulary is changed. They are also suing Optum Rx, the PBM that took Cole\u2019s Advair Diskus off his insurance company\u2019s formulary, and Walgreens, his pharmacy, which, the Schmidtknechts say, didn\u2019t offer Cole a way to control his asthma while another solution could be found.",
      "The lawsuit claims that Cole did not get the required 30 days\u2019 notice of the change, that his doctor wasn\u2019t contacted and that the pharmacy didn\u2019t provide Cole with any more affordable options.",
      "The Schmidknechts said Cole left the pharmacy with only a rescue inhaler, which is used for quick relief. But that type of medication by itself isn\u2019t strong enough to keep someone out of the emergency room if the asthma attack is severe, Dr. David Bernstein, an immunologist who is a professor in the division of immunology, allergy and rheumatology at the University of Cincinnati, said.",
      "\u201cIt was empty at his house, next to his bed,\u201d Bil said of the emergency inhaler.",
      "In a motion to dismiss the Schmidkneckt\u2019s lawsuit, Optum Rx expressed \u201cits deepest sympathies\u201d for Cole\u2019s death and said federal law prohibits the case from being brought in state court. Optum also said three alternatives, each with a $5 copay, were available, and its system instructed Walgreens to contact Cole\u2019s doctor about those options.",
      "Walgreens also offered \u201cits deepest sympathies and cited privacy for why it can\u2019t discuss specifics in the case. In a statement, it added, \u201cIn general, in cases where a medication is not covered by insurance, pharmacy staff may work with the plan, patient, and/or prescriber in an effort to process and dispense the prescription if able.\u201d",
      "Cole would be 24 now. When speaking about all the things he could have been doing, his parents nearly break down.",
      "\u201cHe was just so young, and he had his whole life ahead of him,\u201d Shanon said. \u201cAnd it was so preventable and so unnecessary.\u201d",
      "For the Schmidkneckts, it's about policy change. \u201cJustice for Cole, of course, but bigger than that, justice for us all,\u201d Shanon said.",
      "Getting that change won\u2019t be easy.",
      "In the U.S., just three PBMs process 80% of prescriptions. And a big part of the PBM formulary playbook is secrecy, Anderson said.",
      "That way, patients don\u2019t learn how PBMs make their decisions about drugs and why a medication that had been on the formulary no longer is.",
      "Often no one, from the patients to the drug companies to the insurers, is aware of the details of the decisions the PBMs are making.",
      "\u201cThey do not share this information widely, as it is considered a trade secret,\u201d Anderson said.",
      "The deals are \u201ca negotiation between the drug companies and the PBM,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cThe drug company wants their drug on the formulary in a favorable position. The PBM wants to get the largest possible rebate.\u201d",
      "The \u201crebate\u201d is the difference between the list price for a drug and what the PBM can buy it for, which can be \u201ca very much lower number than the list price,\u201d Anderson said.",
      "When there are multiple drugs that do essentially the same thing, then there\u2019s a bidding war, usually a silent one.",
      "The rewards for the PBMs can be huge. A Federal Trade Commission report released in January found that, over the past few years, the three biggest PBMs \u2014 CVS Health Caremark Rx, Cigna\u2019s Express Scripts and UnitedHealth Group\u2019s Optum Rx \u2014 inflated the costs of numerous life-saving medications by billions of dollars. The companies countered that the FTC report\u2019s conclusions were misleading.",
      "In January, CVS Health said in a statement that it \u201cis inappropriate and misleading to draw broad conclusions from cherry-picked \u2018specialty generic\u2019 outliers\u201d and that the company\u2019s \u201ctop priority is to make health care more affordable.\u201d OptumRx said that it helped eligible patients save $1.3 billion last year and estimated that the median out-of-pocket payment for these patients was $5.",
      "To remember Cole, both his parents had a tattoo just like his inked onto their wrists. When they feel overwhelmed they glance down at it to remember the change they want to make in his honor.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just everyone\u2019s little reminder, you know, from Cole to just keep living and that we can still be happy,\u201d Shanon said. \u201cI keep trying to remind myself that happiness and joy and grief can co-exist.\u201d",

      "Authorities attempted life-saving measures until EMS arrived and pronounced Joss, 59, dead.",
      "Police have not released any other information on the shooting, including a motive, but said Monday afternoon the homicide unit of the San Antonio Police Department is investigating Joss' death.",
      "\"Despite online claims of this being a hate crime, currently the investigation has found no evidence to indicate that ... Mr. Joss's murder was related to his sexual orientation,\" SAPD said on X.",
      "But Joss' husband, Tristan Kern de Gonzales, alleged in a social media post that Joss was killed in a homophobic attack at the site of their old home.",
      "While living there, Kern de Gonzales said, the couple was \"harassed regularly by individuals who made it clear they did not accept our relationship,\" adding that \"much of the harassment was openly homophobic.\"",

    "published": "Mon, 02 Jun 2025 12:30:41 GMT",
    "summary": "Following the MIND diet is associated with a strong and consistent reduction in dementia risk.",
    "story": [
      "New evidence finds that the MIND diet lives up to its name, even when it is started later in life.",
      "Middle-aged and older participants in a large, long-term study were less likely to develop Alzheimer\u2019s disease or other types of dementia if they followed a diet filled with green, leafy vegetables, olive oil, whole grains and lots of berries, according to a report presented Monday at the annual meeting of the American Society for Nutrition.",
      "Researchers from University of Hawaii at M\u0101noa and the University of Southern California discovered that adhering to the MIND diet, which combines the Mediterranean diet with the blood-pressure-lowering DASH diet, results in a stronger and more consistent reduction in dementia risk than what is seen with other healthy diets.",
      "The new findings suggest it\u2019s never too late to switch to a healthy diet, said the study\u2019s lead author, Song-Yi Park, an associate professor at the University of Hawaii at M\u0101noa. \u201cIt shows that sticking to a healthy diet, as well as improving the health of the person\u2019s diet over time, is very important for older adults who want to prevent dementia.\u201d",
      "While all the Mediterranean-related diets appear to be good for the brain, the MIND dietary pattern was specifically designed for brain health.",
      "\u201cOne important difference is that MIND includes berries, which have been linked to brain health,\u201d Park said.",
      "The MIND diet, or Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay, scores individual foods based on how protective they are and how much is eaten. Berries \u2014 especially strawberries and blueberries \u2014 for example, get a score of 1 if two or more servings are consumed per week. The score drops to 0.5 if just one serving per week is consumed and a score of 0 if none are.",
      "A person\u2019s individual diet gets an overall rating by adding up the scores for individual foods. The higher the overall score, the better it\u2019s for the person\u2019s brain.",
      "Park and her colleagues turned to data from nearly 93,000 U.S. adults who had provided information about what they ate as part of a research project known as The Multiethnic Cohort to get a closer look at how diet influenced the risk of developing dementia.",
      "The Multiethnic Cohort was started in the early 1990s through a joint effort of the University of Hawaii Cancer Center and the USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center. The men and women enrolled in the study came from five ethnic/racial populations: Japanese Americans, Native Hawaiians, Black Americans, Latinos and whites.",
      "At the outset, the 215,000 participants were ages 45 to 75. When data for the new study was analyzed, more than 21,000 participants had developed Alzheimer\u2019s or a related dementia.",
      "At the beginning of the study, people who scored higher for adherence to MIND had a 9% lower risk of developing dementia.",
      "The amount of reduction varied among the racial groups in the new analysis. Greater risk reduction, 13%, was seen in participants who identified as Black, Latino or white.",
      "Participants who improved their adherence to MIND over the 10-year period had a 25% lower risk of dementia compared with those whose adherence declined, and that trend was seen across all age and racial groups.",
      "How to follow the MIND diet",
      "Some suggestions for reaching the optimal score for the MIND diet, according to a 2015 study:",
      "Leafy green vegetables, such as kale, spinach, broccoli, bok choy and mustard: six or more servings per weekOther vegetables: one serving per day Nuts, such as almonds, walnuts or pistachios: five or more servings per weekCheese: less than one per weekWhole grains: three or more per dayFish (not fried): one or more servings per weekRed meat: less than one serving per weekFast fried foods: less than one per weekPastries and sweets: less than five servings per week",
      "Leafy green vegetables, such as kale, spinach, broccoli, bok choy and mustard: six or more servings per week",
      "Other vegetables: one serving per day",
      "Nuts, such as almonds, walnuts or pistachios: five or more servings per week",
      "Cheese: less than one per week",
      "Whole grains: three or more per day",
      "Fish (not fried): one or more servings per week",
      "Red meat: less than one serving per week",
      "Fast fried foods: less than one per week",
      "Pastries and sweets: less than five servings per week",
      "Park cautioned that like all observational studies, the new research reports an association and doesn\u2019t prove that the diet prevents dementia.",
      "It is a high-quality study, Dr. Walter Willett, a professor of epidemiology and nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and a professor of medicine at the Harvard Medical School, said in an email.",
      "\u201cIt adds to the evidence that a Mediterranean-type diet has important benefits for reducing the risk of dementia,\u201d said Willett, who wasn\u2019t involved in the research. \u201cThe differences between groups defined by race/ethnicity may well be due to random variation, so at this time it\u2019s reasonable to assume that this healthy dietary pattern has benefits for all groups.\"",
      "When it comes to leafy green vegetables, it\u2019s probably best to consume a variety rather than a single type, Willett said.",
      "\u201cIn particular, spinach is good in many ways, but has high oxalate content and high intake of spinach can cause kidney stones,\u201d he said.",
      "In general, the MIND diet is in line with the principles of the two diets it\u2019s built from, said Dr. Yian Gu, an associate professor of neurological sciences at the Columbia University Irving Medical Center. \u201cEach of those diets has unique characteristics,\u201d she said.",
      "The Mediterranean diet emphasizes multiple daily servings of fruits and vegetables, along with whole grains, legumes, olive oil, seafood, and nuts and seeds, such as chia, flax, pumpkin and sesame.",
      "DASH, or Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension, is meant to prevent hypertension, so it emphasizes low salt, which isn\u2019t a major component in the Mediterranean diet.",
      "The MIND diet is easy to follow, Gu said, encouraging people to pick the green, leafy vegetables they prefer. What\u2019s important is to increase the diversity of vegetables.",
      "Another benefit of Mediterranean-type diets: They are helpful with other types of chronic disease, including heart disease and cancer, she said."

      "BOULDER, Colo. \u2014 Once again, the war in Gaza has come home to America.",
      "A man using what police called a \"makeshift flamethrower\" launched a gruesome attack on demonstrators in Boulder on Sunday, raising questions about why security wasn't stronger in the wake of an earlier attack in Washington, D.C.",
      "Run for Their Lives, the organization behind the long-standing demonstration that advocated for the return of Israeli hostages, had anticipated that its members would have safety concerns.",
      "The group offered principles to make the events safer, including \"don't protest,\" \"be polite and peaceful\" and \"don't disturb your neighbors.\"",
      "\"Focus on humanity,\" the guidance on its website says. \"This is about innocent children, women, the elderly, and other civilians being held by terrorists\u2014not about the war.\"",
      "The Boulder chapter of Run for Their Lives has been holding regular demonstrations demanding that Hamas release the hostages seized during the terrorist attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023.",
      "Kyle and Elizabeth Shorter, who live in a Denver suburb and were taking their wedding pictures in Boulder when the attack happened, said the Run for Their Lives demonstrators had become fixtures on the street.",
      "\u201cEvery time we\u2019ve come up here the past couple of years, they\u2019ve always been here,\u201d said Elizabeth Shorter, 26. \u201cThey\u2019ve never been aggressive or chanting, just simply walking.\u201d",
      "And that, an expert said, could make them harder to protect from a terrorist.",
      "\u201cUsually, there is a regular detail assigned to protect protesters,\u201d said Brian Higgins, who teaches at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York City and runs a security consulting firm called Group 77. \u201cBut it\u2019s not uncommon for a mindset to set in that, as time goes on and nothing out of the ordinary happens, that there\u2019s no need to be on high alert.\u201d",
      "Higgins, who said he wasn\u2019t aware of what security measures Boulder police had in place Sunday, was taken aback by video that showed the attacker threatening people before police intervened.",
      "\u201cThat shouldn\u2019t have happened,\u201d Higgins said. \u201cThat raises questions for me about how much security there was at this protest.\u201d",
      "Police Chief Stephen Redfearn said his department is aware of events taking place later in the month and will plan to provide additional security coverage. \u201cWe want to ensure that people feel comfortable and safe in this community,\u201d he told reporters on Monday.",
      "Shira Weiss, global coordinator for Run for Their Lives, said that some chapters have long relied on protection from local police or private security but that it's \"really the individual group leader\u2019s decision how and when they want to use security.\"",
      "And while some local chapters have paused to \"recompose themselves and give themselves space to heal\" after the Boulder attack, others have said, \"We won\u2019t stop; we\u2019re going to be right back out there next week,\" Weiss said.",
      "\u201cWe obviously keep reiterating to our group leaders that safety is the No. 1 priority,\u201d she said.",
      "Although clearly frightened by what she witnessed, attack survivor Lisa Turnquist, 66, said she won't be deterred from speaking out against Hamas and on behalf of the Israeli hostages.",
      "\"This is when we have to get up and we have to stand out and push back,\" said Turnquist, who spoke to a reporter outside the historic Boulder County Courthouse, where the attack happened. \"We just want the hostages home.\"",
      "A dozen people were injured Sunday, eight of whom remain hospitalized, authorities said. Initial calls to police reported people \"being set on fire,\" and officers found multiple victims with burns and other injuries, Boulder's police chief told reporters.",
      "Egyptian national Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, has been charged with attempted murder and a hate crime, among other offenses.",
      "The attack happened just 11 days after two Israeli Embassy workers were gunned down outside the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington.",
      "In both the Boulder and the Washington attacks, the attackers are alleged to have yelled the same thing: \u201cFree Palestine.\u201d",
      "Security experts who spoke with NBC News questioned how the man in Boulder was able to allegedly launch such an attack downtown even amid heightened awareness after the Washington killings.",
      "Higgins said his security clients include several major Jewish organizations. And ever since the killings of Israeli Embassy workers Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrim on May 22, they have been adding extra layers of security, he said.",
      "\u201cGiven what\u2019s going on out there and the agitation out there, my recommendation is that there should be an elevated level of security at all Gaza protests,\u201d Higgins said.",
      "Run for Their Lives has been holding regular demonstrations outside the county courthouse on Pearl Street since Hamas launched a bloody surprise attack on Israel and took 250 hostages. That spawned an Israeli invasion of Gaza that has left more than 54,000 people dead, many of them women and children, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.",
      "Michael Alcazar, a former hostage negotiator with the New York Police Department who also teaches at John Jay, said Pearl Street is a soft target for a terrorist attack. He said the attacker was able to approach the demonstrators because they didn\u2019t appear to be protected.",
      "\u201cThe police chief dropped the ball not having a uniform presence over there,\u201d Alcazar said. \u201cIs the police chief not aware of what\u2019s going in the world?\u201d",
      "The Boulder Police Department didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "The Anti-Defamation League said it had been in contact with local law enforcement in Boulder.",
      "\u201cWe feel at ADL like many across the country feel, which is just vulnerability and both sadness and anger at the violence that we\u2019ve seen,\u201d said Oren Segal, the Anti-Defamation League\u2019s senior vice president for counterextremism and intelligence. \u201cThis is a wake-up call \u2014 not just for the Jewish community.\"",
      "The FBI also said in a statement that \"our goal is always to get ahead of any threats.\"",
      "\"We have long warned that lone actors or small groups of conspirators present a great challenge to law enforcement because there may not be a lot of clues about their intentions,\" it said.",
      "An affidavit alleged that Soliman, a married father of five, had been planning the attack for over a year and was waiting for one of his daughters to graduate before he set his alleged plan into motion. It didn't specify where his daughter was graduating from.",
      "Soliman told investigators during his arrest interview that he researched how to make Molotov cocktails on YouTube, according to the affidavit. It alleged that he was also unrepentant about the attack, saying he would do it again to stop Israel from taking over \u201cour land,\u201d referring to the Palestinian territories.",
      "Elias Rodriguez, the Chicagoan charged with the deaths of Lischinsky and Milgrim, was also motivated by the Gaza war, authorities said. He told police when he was arrested, \u201cI did it for Palestine, I did it for Gaza,\u201d according to court records and published reports.",
      "In his first comments since the attack, President Donald Trump condemned the \"horrific\" incident Monday on Truth Social. Earlier, White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller sought to shift blame onto the Biden administration for allowing Soliman in the country.",
      "\u201cHe was granted a tourist visa by the Biden Administration and then he illegally overstayed that visa,\u201d Miller said Sunday on X. \u201cIn response, the Biden Administration gave him a work permit.\u201d",
      "Tricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security, amplified that on X, saying that Soliman \"is illegally in our country\" and that he applied for asylum in September 2022.",
      "McLaughlin later told NBC News that Soliman's asylum claim was pending and that while his visa had expired, he hadn't yet exhausted all legal routes to stay in the United States.",
      "Deon J. Hampton reported from Boulder, Alicia Victoria Lozano reported from Los Angeles and Elizabeth Chuck and Corky Siemaszko from New York City."

      "Ren\u00e9e Victor, who voiced the no-nonsense, sandal-throwing Abuelita in Disney's animated hit \"Coco\" and played the wisecracking Lupita on Showtime's \"Weeds,\" has died. She was 86.",
      "Victor's death was confirmed Monday by a representative, Julie Smith, who said the actor had lymphoma for several years. She died Friday at her home in Sherman Oaks, California, Smith said, with family by her side.",
      "A post on the Instagram feed of Pixar, which produced \"Coco,\" said: \"We are heartbroken to hear of the passing of Ren\u00e9e Victor, the voice [of] Abuelita in 'Coco' and an incredible part of the Pixar family. We will always remember you.\"",
      "Victor appeared in 22 episodes of \"Weeds\" as sassy housekeeper Lupita between 2005 and 2012, among many other TV credits including \"ER,\" \"Matlock\" and \"The Addams Family.\" But she was perhaps best known for what she called the chancla-throwing grandmother in \"Coco,\" the 2017 family-friendly movie that explored death through the journey of a young Mexican boy to the land of the dead.",
      "\"I play the part of 'Abuelita,' the chancla throwing grandma that preaches 'No Music!'\" she wrote on Instagram, looking back several years ago. \"Enjoy 'Coco' with your family this Dia de los Muertos and forever more!\"",
      "She also looked back at \"The Apostle,\" the 1997 movie that Robert Duvall wrote, directed and starred in. \"He took a chance on me with this film,\" Victor wrote on Instagram. \"This is where I got my nickname 'one take Ren\u00e9e,'\" she said, adding laughter emojis. \"I had a small role but what a great one! Can somebody give me an amen?!\"",
      "Born in San Antonio, Texas, on July 25, 1938, Victor began her performing career as a singer and dancer. She moved to Los Angeles in the 1960s, according to biography material provided by her representatives, where she launched her career singing with prominent big band leaders Xavier Cugat and P\u00e9rez Prado. She also taught Latin dancing, including salsa and the tango.",
      "She met her future husband, Ray, during that period, and from 1963 to 1973, they performed together as \"Ray & Ren\u00e9e,\" a variety show that took them around the world \u2014 including Australia, where \"they enjoyed particular fame,\" the materials said.",
      "In the 1970s, Victor hosted the \"Pacesetters\" public affairs show on KTLA, her representatives said, and by the '80s had moved into TV and film work.",
      "Her film credits, other than \"The Apostle,\" included the 2014 horror film \"Paranormal Activity 5: The Marked Ones,\" \"The Doctor\" with William Hurt (1991), and \"A Night in Old Mexico\" (2013), also with Duvall. In 2004, she had a recurring role as Florina Lopez on TV's \"ER,\" and the following year was cast in \"Weeds.\" Other series credits included \"Snowpiercer\" (2020-2021), \"Mayans M.C.\" (2022), \"Dead to Me\" (2020-2022), and Amazon's \"With Love\" (2021-2023).",
      "Victor is survived by her daughters, Raquel and Margo Victor, Smith said."

      "The fourth week of testimony in Diddy\u2019s sex trafficking trial commenced with one of his former personal assistants, a woman identified in court by the pseudonym \u201cMia,\u201d taking the stand for a third and final day. Her testimony, including allegations of forced labor, is an element of the federal prosecution\u2019s racketeering conspiracy charge in which the music mogul is accused of directing a \u201ccriminal enterprise.\u201d",
      "Amid Mia\u2019s testimony, an internal courthouse feed briefly displayed her image on an overflow room\u2019s video screen, despite a judge\u2019s order that her face not be shown or even drawn by courtroom sketch artists. Upon returning from a break, prosecutor Maurene Comey told Judge Arun Subramanian that she felt defense lawyer Brian Steel\u2019s line of questioning had been sarcastic and humiliating to Mia. Subramanian said he didn\u2019t believe Mia was being mistreated, but warned Steel to ask a question and move on, or he would step in.",
      "Here\u2019s what else to know about today\u2019s testimony:",
      "Steel revisited a text in which Mia wrote that she wanted to harm herself and that \u201cmy life is over\u201d after being let go from her job in 2017. She denied that she lied on the stand when she testified last week that Diddy sexually assaulted her. Steel also showed messages from 2018 to 2020 in which she expressed affection toward her former boss.Mia responded that \u201cI was brainwashed\u201d by Diddy, which, she said, prevented her from coming forward earlier about the alleged sexual abuse. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long process,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m still untangling these things. I\u2019m in therapy.\u201d",

      "After Mia, the government briefly called Sylvia Oken, area director of sales and marketing at the Beverly Hills Hotel, where Diddy allegedly caused damage to rooms. Oken said he used the aliases \u201cPhillip Pines\u201d and \u201cFrank Black\u201d for reservations.",

      "\ud83d\udd0e The view from inside",
      "A female juror could be seen smiling, seeming to enjoy Steel\u2019s cross-examination of Mia. At times, the juror would widen her eyes and furrow her brow, appearing to be skeptical of some of Mia\u2019s testimony.",
      "After the jury was dismissed, Comey alerted Subramanian that Mia\u2019s face was shown to the overflow room in an exhibit. The judge asked if it was redacted footage that should have been aired or if the incorrect version was used. Prosecutors didn\u2019t have an answer.",
      "\ud83d\udc68\u200d\u2696\ufe0f Analysis: Why stay?",
      "On cross-examination, Steel circled back to Mia\u2019s \u201ckill myself\u201d text message. And Mia didn\u2019t shy away from it either, testifying: \u201cMy entire world was being ripped away from me immediately. And even, in hindsight, that world was awful. I didn\u2019t know it at the time, so that\u2019s why it felt like everything was ending.\u201d",
      "This is one of those situations where the testimony could go either way for the jury. If a juror believes an employee can quit in the face of intolerable work conditions, then that\u2019s bad for the government. In fact, the more hostile the environment described by Mia, the less believable she is.",
      "But on the other hand, lots of people, including the jurors, can understand having to stay at a bad job. Not only do regular people have bills to pay, but psychologically, leaving a job is a major life change \u2014 and usually an unpleasant one. It raises an interesting question: Can employees be as trapped in a work \u201crelationship\u201d as a partner can be trapped in a domestic relationship?",
      "\ud83d\uddd3\ufe0f What\u2019s next",
      "Tomorrow: Eddy Garcia, a security supervisor at the Los Angeles hotel where Diddy was seen on security video assaulting longtime girlfriend Casandra Ventura in 2016, is expected to take the stand tomorrow. He was in court briefly today to invoke his Fifth Amendment rights against self-incrimination. Another of Diddy\u2019s accusers, who is going by the pseudonym \u201cJane,\u201d could take the stand later this week, prosecutors said.",
      "PSA: Every night during Diddy\u2019s trial, NBC\u2019s \u201cDateline\u201d will drop special episodes of the \u201cTrue Crime Weekly\u201d podcast to get you up to speed. \u201cDateline\u201d correspondent Andrea Canning chats with NBC News\u2019 Chloe Melas and special guests \u2014 right in front of the courthouse.

      "The Trump administration has been turning to DNA technology to help find and arrest immigrants, including children, but immigration advocates say it has been slow to spell out how it's using and overseeing the genetic information.",
      "Three groups sued the Department of Homeland Security on Monday after trying to get records about the data collection program since last summer, during the Biden administration.",
      "The plaintiffs are the Georgetown Law Center on Privacy & Technology, part of the Georgetown University Law School that focuses on privacy and surveillance law and policy; the Amica Center for Immigrant Rights and Americans for Immigrant Justice, both immigrant rights groups.",
      "The groups describe in their lawsuit their back-and-forth with DHS, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection since they originally requested information about their DNA collection from noncitizens on Aug. 1, 2024.",
      "Since 2020, DHS has expanded its DNA collection program and increased DNA contributions to the FBI's database, CODIS, by 5,000%, becoming the largest contributor, according to the Georgetown center. The DNA database of the FBI can be accessed by police across the country for criminal investigations, the plaintiff groups said in a statement.",
      "Stevie Glaberson, director of research and advocacy at the Georgetown center, said in a statement that DHS is expanding its database by \"collecting DNA from people accused of no crime and while operating with none of the constraints that are supposed to be in place before the government compels someone to give over their most sensitive personal information.\"",
      "He said Americans deserve more visibility on the program and said DHS's lack of transparency is unacceptable.",
      "DHS did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Daniel Melo, senior staff attorney with Amica's Immigration Impact Lab, told NBC News that previous administrations have also collected DNA. A 2005 law mandated federal agencies collect DNA from people in custody, including noncitizens.",
      "Prior to 2020, the Justice Department had told DHS that its immigration enforcement and border agents did not have to routinely collect DNA from every noncitizen it detained, Melo said. The Biden administration adopted rules requiring full compliance with the 2005 law, but whistleblowers and a government watchdog complained compliance was uneven.",
      "The \"Securing Our Borders\" executive order signed by President Donald Trump requires the attorney general and the DHS to fulfill requirements on DNA collection from noncitizens mandated in the 2005 law.",
      "'Sweeps in information about everyone'",
      "Privacy and civil rights groups have long had issues with the government's DNA collection program. Melo said the public should be concerned whether people are being advised of their rights and how the information is being collected and used.",
      "\"This information could tentatively be used in all sorts of ways to map full communities, to basically build a more intricate web of surveillance around noncitizen communities,\" Melo said.",
      "He said if DHS can continue to collect the DNA of noncitizens, essentially \"experimenting\" on them, \"then they are able to refine these technologies and deploy them in new and interesting and probably really dangerous and scary ways on the rest of us.\"",
      "Emily Tucker, the Georgetown center's executive director, said in a statement that \"it is a mistake to think of DHS' DNA collection program as 'immigration enforcement.'\"",
      "\"Trump is using immigration powers to justify the activities of his militarized federal police force because there is so little institutional or judicial oversight or accountability for executive enforcement actions that invoke \u2018immigration authority,\" she said in a statement. \"This program is one part of a massive surveillance dragnet that sweeps in information about everyone. They will use it for deportation, but they will also use it to intimidate, silence, and target anyone they perceive as the enemy.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "When 22-year-old Cole Schmidtknecht tried to get a refill on the inhaler prescribed by his doctor to prevent asthma attacks. The medication that had formerly cost him less than $70 at his Appleton, Wisconsin pharmacy was now priced at more than $500, according to Cole\u2019s father, Bil Schmidtknecht.",
      "Stunned, Cole left the store with a medication designed to stop asthma attacks once they start, but without the Advair Diskus inhaler he needed to prevent attacks from happening in the first place.",
      "Five days after his pharmacy visit last year, Cole had a severe asthma attack, stopped breathing and collapsed. He never regained consciousness and died. Doctors attributed his death to asthma.",
      "His parents, Bil and Shanon Schmidtknecht, blame what they say is a dysfunctional system where medications can change in price overnight and without notice.",
      "A part of the insurance system that many Americans don\u2019t know about was responsible for the spike in Cole\u2019s inhaler price. Pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, are the middlemen that control behind the scenes which drugs will be on an insurance company\u2019s list of covered medications (called its formulary).",
      "They add or subtract medications through a process that emphasizes profits for the pharmacy benefit manager by way of \u201crebates\u201d from drug makers, said Gerard Anderson, a professor of health policy and management at the Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health.",
      "PBMs \u201care looking for the drug that makes them the most money,\u201d Andersen said",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s insane that it\u2019s happening in America,\u201d Bil Schmidknecht said. \u201cIt\u2019s not broken. It\u2019s designed to work this way. It\u2019s just hurting us.\u201d",
      "The Schmidtknechts are pushing for legislation that would require a 90-day warning when an insurance company\u2019s formulary is changed. They are also suing Optum Rx, the PBM that took Cole\u2019s Advair Diskus off his insurance company\u2019s formulary, and Walgreens, his pharmacy, which, the Schmidtknechts say, didn\u2019t offer Cole a way to control his asthma while another solution could be found.",
      "The lawsuit claims that Cole did not get the required 30 days\u2019 notice of the change, that his doctor wasn\u2019t contacted and that the pharmacy didn\u2019t provide Cole with any more affordable options.",
      "The Schmidknechts said Cole left the pharmacy with only a rescue inhaler, which is used for quick relief. But that type of medication by itself isn\u2019t strong enough to keep someone out of the emergency room if the asthma attack is severe, Dr. David Bernstein, an immunologist who is a professor in the division of immunology, allergy and rheumatology at the University of Cincinnati, said.",
      "\u201cIt was empty at his house, next to his bed,\u201d Bil said of the emergency inhaler.",
      "In a motion to dismiss the Schmidkneckt\u2019s lawsuit, Optum Rx expressed \u201cits deepest sympathies\u201d for Cole\u2019s death and said federal law prohibits the case from being brought in state court. Optum also said three alternatives, each with a $5 copay, were available, and its system instructed Walgreens to contact Cole\u2019s doctor about those options.",
      "Walgreens also offered \u201cits deepest sympathies and cited privacy for why it can\u2019t discuss specifics in the case. In a statement, it added, \u201cIn general, in cases where a medication is not covered by insurance, pharmacy staff may work with the plan, patient, and/or prescriber in an effort to process and dispense the prescription if able.\u201d",
      "Cole would be 24 now. When speaking about all the things he could have been doing, his parents nearly break down.",
      "\u201cHe was just so young, and he had his whole life ahead of him,\u201d Shanon said. \u201cAnd it was so preventable and so unnecessary.\u201d",
      "For the Schmidkneckts, it's about policy change. \u201cJustice for Cole, of course, but bigger than that, justice for us all,\u201d Shanon said.",
      "Getting that change won\u2019t be easy.",
      "In the U.S., just three PBMs process 80% of prescriptions. And a big part of the PBM formulary playbook is secrecy, Anderson said.",
      "That way, patients don\u2019t learn how PBMs make their decisions about drugs and why a medication that had been on the formulary no longer is.",
      "Often no one, from the patients to the drug companies to the insurers, is aware of the details of the decisions the PBMs are making.",
      "\u201cThey do not share this information widely, as it is considered a trade secret,\u201d Anderson said.",
      "The deals are \u201ca negotiation between the drug companies and the PBM,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cThe drug company wants their drug on the formulary in a favorable position. The PBM wants to get the largest possible rebate.\u201d",
      "The \u201crebate\u201d is the difference between the list price for a drug and what the PBM can buy it for, which can be \u201ca very much lower number than the list price,\u201d Anderson said.",
      "When there are multiple drugs that do essentially the same thing, then there\u2019s a bidding war, usually a silent one.",
      "The rewards for the PBMs can be huge. A Federal Trade Commission report released in January found that, over the past few years, the three biggest PBMs \u2014 CVS Health Caremark Rx, Cigna\u2019s Express Scripts and UnitedHealth Group\u2019s Optum Rx \u2014 inflated the costs of numerous life-saving medications by billions of dollars. The companies countered that the FTC report\u2019s conclusions were misleading.",
      "In January, CVS Health said in a statement that it \u201cis inappropriate and misleading to draw broad conclusions from cherry-picked \u2018specialty generic\u2019 outliers\u201d and that the company\u2019s \u201ctop priority is to make health care more affordable.\u201d OptumRx said that it helped eligible patients save $1.3 billion last year and estimated that the median out-of-pocket payment for these patients was $5.",
      "To remember Cole, both his parents had a tattoo just like his inked onto their wrists. When they feel overwhelmed they glance down at it to remember the change they want to make in his honor.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just everyone\u2019s little reminder, you know, from Cole to just keep living and that we can still be happy,\u201d Shanon said. \u201cI keep trying to remind myself that happiness and joy and grief can co-exist.\u201d",

      "When South Koreans elect a new president Tuesday, it will end months of domestic political turmoil \u2014 but their choice could bring big changes to the country\u2019s relationship with the United States.",
      "Lee Jae-myung, leader of the liberal opposition Democratic Party, had a clear lead in polls going into the election, which is being held six months to the day after then-President Yoon Suk Yeol plunged the East Asian democracy of more than 50 million people into turmoil by abruptly declaring martial law.",
      "Since lawmakers impeached Yoon in December over the short-lived martial law order, South Korea has been stuck in a leadership vacuum, churning through a series of acting presidents. The uncertainty has also constrained the U.S. ally in Washington even as President Donald Trump slapped it with a 25% \u201creciprocal\u201d tariff, among other levies.",
      "The presidential by-election, which was triggered in April when South Korea\u2019s Constitutional Court upheld Yoon\u2019s impeachment, promises a return to stability, and South Koreans have turned out in record numbers for early voting.",
      "\u201cA lot of people just want to move on, because it\u2019s been a long six months,\u201d said Jennifer Lee, a principal at the Asia Group corporate consultancy in Washington, who recently returned from a trip to South Korea.",
      "Lee Jae-myung, 61, who narrowly lost to Yoon in 2022, has been seen as the most likely next president since Yoon was impeached.",
      "But public support for Lee has been driven more by anger at Yoon\u2019s conservative People Power Party, which has declined to condemn his actions, than by agreement with Lee\u2019s policy positions, said Rob York, director for regional affairs at Pacific Forum, a foreign policy research institute in Honolulu.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think enthusiasm for him is especially strong,\u201d York said. \u201cHe\u2019s not an especially inspiring figure for a number of reasons, but the conservative party is simply so tainted right now.\u201d",
      "Further boosting Lee\u2019s chances is the fact that conservative votes are being split between Kim Moon Soo, the People Power Party candidate, and Lee Jun-seok, a young lawmaker from the upstart Reform Party who has been generating controversy with his antifeminist remarks.",
      "Though Lee has moved toward the center during the campaign, he is generally seen as more open to China and North Korea than his predecessor and less friendly toward Japan, which is part of a trilateral security partnership with the United States and South Korea.",
      "Because Yoon was \u201cso pro-U.S. and hardcore U.S.,\u201d it seems unlikely that the U.S.-South Korea relationship will remain as strong, the Asia Group\u2019s Jennifer Lee said.",
      "\u201cI think that there will be some more balancing act between the United States and China,\u201d she said, and if the Trump administration \u201ccomes out hard\u201d on issues such as tariffs or cost-sharing for the 28,500 U.S. troops stationed in South Korea, \u201cI think there may be a lot more frictions ahead.\u201d",
      "Still, Lee the candidate has expressed support for the U.S.-South Korea alliance and already begun reaching out to the Trump administration. In an interview last week with Time magazine, Lee said Trump \u201chas outstanding skills in terms of negotiation\u201d and that both he and Trump are simply looking out for the interests of their people.",
      "Though he doesn\u2019t align with Trump\u2019s conservative views, Lee has in the past been nicknamed \u201cKorea\u2019s Trump\u201d by supporters enamored with his populist, outspoken style.",
      "Like Trump, Lee also survived an attempt on his life last year, having been stabbed in the neck during a visit to the city of Busan.",
      "\u201cPersonality-wise I think the two of them, if they\u2019re in a room together, would probably get along,\u201d York said. \u201cBoth of them are people who view themselves as dealmakers, and I think they\u2019re more concerned with crafting a deal that makes both of them look good.\u201d",
      "One of Lee\u2019s top priorities will be reaching a deal on tariffs, which have hit South Korea hard. In addition to the 25% tariff, South Korea \u2014 the world\u2019s 10th-largest economy \u2014 is vulnerable to steep duties on some of its biggest exports, such as steel and automobiles.",
      "Lee is also facing a more assertive North Korea, whose leader, Kim Jong Un, has been advancing his ballistic missile and nuclear weapons programs. Like Trump, Lee favors greater engagement with the North, pledging last week to restore a military hotline between the two rivals, who technically remain at war.",
      "Though Trump has said he\u2019d like to revive his in-person diplomacy with Kim, North Korea appears far less interested in negotiating than it was when the two leaders met in 2018 and 2019. Kim is now receiving crucial economic and military support through a security partnership with Russia, and he said last year that North Korea is no longer pursuing reconciliation with the South.",
      "The heightened tensions on the Korean Peninsula come amid reports that Trump is considering withdrawing thousands of U.S. troops from the South, an idea he also floated during his first term. Though Seoul says there have been no such discussions, Pentagon officials say a troop reduction has not been ruled out.",
      "Neither South Korea nor U.S. Forces Korea (USFK) were barely mentioned in Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth\u2019s speech in Singapore last weekend laying out the U.S. approach to the Indo-Pacific, adding to concerns about where the country stands with Washington.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. can unilaterally decide and act on reducing USFK troops. It\u2019s their military, after all,\u201d said Bong Young Sik, a North Korea specialist at the Yonsei Institute for North Korean Studies at Yonsei University in Seoul, referring to U.S. Forces Korea.",
      "But \u201cthey need to consider and accommodate the situations their security partners are under and facing,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cIf they go with \u2018What is good for the U.S. is good for the world,\u2019 I am not sure how long that approach could work,\u201d Bong said.",
      "Jennifer Jett reported from Hong Kong and Stella Kim from Los Angeles."

    "summary": "New York Lt. Gov. Antonio Delgado launched a Democratic primary challenge against Gov.",
    "story": [
      "New York Lt. Gov. Antonio Delgado launched a Democratic primary challenge against Gov. Kathy Hochul on Monday, saying in a video announcing his campaign that the state needs \u201cbold, decisive, transformational leadership.\u201d",
      "\"Let's not drop the ball on figuring out what it is we're fighting for. We believe in facts, truth, liberty, the rule of law and justice for all,\" Delgado said. \"Listen, the powerful and well-connected have their champions. I'm running for governor to be yours.\"",
      "Delgado did not mention Hochul by name in the video. He told The New York Times, \u201cPeople are hurting and New York deserves better leadership.\u201d",
      "Hochul selected Delgado to be lieutenant governor and her running mate in May 2022, after then-Lt. Gov. Brian Benjamin was arrested on charges related to campaign finance fraud. Delgado fueled speculation he could challenge Hochul when he announced in February that he would not be Hochul\u2019s running mate as she seeks another term next year.",
      "Delgado and Hochul have had some high-profile disagreements, including when Delgado called on President Joe Biden to end his 2024 re-election bid and said embattled New York Mayor Eric Adams should resign.",
      "Delgado was first elected to the House in 2018, winning a crowded primary that year and going on to defeat GOP Rep. John Faso in a competitive district in the Hudson Valley.",
      "Delgado could face a tough race against a sitting governor who has already started to build up her campaign, having reported nearly $15.5 million in her campaign account as of Jan. 15. Hochul also fended off two primary challengers in 2022, easily defeating New York City Public Advocate Jumaane Williams and Rep. Tom Suozzi.",
      "Suozzi posted on X that Delgado is \"a talented guy, with a great future,\" but added, \"Based upon my experience this may not be the most well-thought out idea!\"",
      "Democratic Governors Association Executive Director Meghan Meehan-Draper said in a statement that the DGA is \"100 percent behind Governor Hochul as she continues to deliver for New York, take on Donald Trump, and build the operation it will take to beat Republicans up and down the ballot in 2026.\"",
      "\"For years, Governor Hochul has been underestimated \u2014 and each time proved her critics wrong,\" Meehan-Draper said.",
      "Republicans are eyeing New York as a possible pickup opportunity next year, despite its Democratic lean. New York swung toward Donald Trump more than any other state last year as Trump made gains in other blue states. But it is still an uphill climb for Republicans, as Trump still lost it by 13 points last year.",
      "GOP Reps. Mike Lawler and Elise Stefanik have been considering running for governor.",
      "Stefanik said in a statement that Hochul's \"own Lieutenant Governor that she hand picked is now primarying her which shows she has lost support not just from Republicans and Independents, but Democrat New Yorkers as well.\"",
      "\"It is time for new leadership to save New York from the decades of catastrophic failed policies of single-party Democrat rule,\" she added.",
      "Lawler wrote on X that Hochul \"must be defeated in 2026 and replaced with a Republican Governor who can restore balance and common sense to Albany.\""

      "Welcome to the online version of From the Politics Desk, an evening newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team\u2019s latest reporting and analysis from the White House, Capitol Hill and the campaign trail.",
      "Happy Monday and welcome to our first edition of June! The Senate is back this week and will begin the process of taking up the \u201cbig, beautiful bill\u201d the House passed. Sahil Kapur breaks down the challenges facing GOP leaders as they try to send the legislation to President Donald Trump\u2019s desk by July 4.

      "\u2014 Adam Wollner",
      "Senate GOP leaders face spending squeeze on Trump\u2019s big bill",
      "The House-passed legislation for President Donald Trump\u2019s domestic agenda is moving to the Senate, where Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., is facing a squeeze from opposing party factions about how to modify it.",
      "Spending and the debt: Some Republicans say they want steeper spending cuts to offset the debt increase as a result of the tax breaks and funding bumps for immigration enforcement and the military. That includes Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., and Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., both of whom have said they cannot support the bill in its current form as it adds an estimated $2.3 trillion to the debt.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s wrong. It\u2019s immoral. It has to stop,\u201d Johnson said Sunday on Fox News. \u201cMy loyalty is to the American people, to my kids and grandkids. We cannot continue to mortgage their future.\u201d",
      "Medicaid: On the other hand, Thune must navigate worries and political considerations from senators about the existing spending cuts in the legislation \u2014 particularly on Medicaid, SNAP and clean energy funding.",
      "Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, voted for the Senate\u2019s initial budget blueprint to begin work on the bill, but later objected to a revised version, citing concerns that it could impact her constituents who rely on Medicaid coverage.",
      "Collins is up for re-election in 2026, along with Sens. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., and Joni Ernst, R-Iowa. All are likely to face attacks from Democrats about the stricter burdens for Americans to stay on the health care program.",
      "And at least one solid Trump ally from a red state is warning against rolling back Medicaid. \u201cI\u2019ve got some concerns,\u201d Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., told reporters recently. \u201cI continue to maintain my position; we should not be cutting Medicaid benefits.\u201d",
      "Hawley notably told NBC News last month he\u2019s fine with \u201ccoverage losses\u201d resulting from the work requirements and anti-fraud measures. So he may ultimately get in line with the bill, as Trump and Republican leaders are portraying the Medicaid provisions as program integrity measures, instead of cuts to rescind coverage.",
      "Regardless, Hawley\u2019s vocal support for preserving Medicaid benefits creates a potential land mine for Republicans to maneuver around, making it harder to cut deeper than the House bill if they want more savings to appease spending hawks.",
      "Clean energy: As part of the spending caution, Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, says there is a faction of GOP senators who opposes the \u201ctermination\u201d of the clean energy tax credits passed by Democrats in 2022, which Republican leaders have put on the chopping block to finance their bill.",
      "Getting technical: And there\u2019s a procedural hurdle Thune must navigate: The so-called \u201cByrd bath.\u201d Senate rules limit bills under the \u201creconciliation\u201d process \u2014 which Republicans are using here to bypass Democrats in the Senate \u2014 to budgetary measures that are primarily about dollars and cents, not policy changes. Democrats are preparing to challenge a host of provisions in the package.",
      "In the end, the three-vote margin for defection may give Thune the breathing room he needs to pass the bill. But any changes the Senate makes need to go back to the House for another vote in the paper-thin majority.",
      "And Thune is on deadline, as the Treasury Department has said Congress needs to pass a debt ceiling increase \u2014 which is part of the broader package \u2014 no later than July in order to prevent a catastrophic default.",
      "Up until now, the GOP\u2019s deadlines have all been fuzzy. But this one is real.",
      "Related read: Thune says Senate on track to pass GOP megabill by July 4, by Frank Thorp V",
      "A key lesson Democrats can learn from 2016 candidate Marco Rubio",
      "Democrats are in regroup mode after losing the 2024 election, acutely aware of the party\u2019s low standing with the American public and thinking through everything from their policy platform to where and how they talk to voters \u2014 like the $20 million pitch reported by The New York Times for a research project titled \u201cSpeaking with American Men: A Strategic Plan.\u201d",
      "More power to them, if someone wants to fund it. And Democrats desperately want to do something to move forward right now.",
      "They might want to consider some long-ago advice from one Marco Rubio about what really matters for a political party\u2019s viability \u2014 and why it could take an excruciatingly long time to get there.",
      "When Rubio \u2014 currently President Donald Trump\u2019s secretary of state \u2014 was running for president in August 2015, he gave a prescient response to questions about then-candidate Donald Trump\u2019s rhetoric about immigration. Asked by CNBC whether the way Trump and others were talking about immigrants would hurt the Republican Party in the 2016 general election, Rubio said, \u201cThis is not the Republican Party. These are individual candidates who are responsible for their own rhetoric and what they say,\u201d adding, \u201cThe face of the Republican Party is going to be our nominee.\u201d",
      "Rubio hit a similar theme days later, speaking to Bloomberg News in New Hampshire: \u201cUltimately the Republican Party will reach out to all voters based on who our nominee is. And I don\u2019t believe Donald Trump will be our nominee.\u201d",
      "Don\u2019t be distracted by the admittedly big thing that Rubio got wrong. The broader point is that American political parties are shaped and defined by their candidates.",
      "The biggest and best thing that the Democratic Party can do to change voter perceptions of itself is to nominate a national candidate that voters see more favorably. The party can\u2019t just erase former President Joe Biden\u2019s struggles and former Vice President Kamala Harris\u2019 loss to Trump \u2014 especially among the slice of Democrats fed up with their own party right now, a big contributor to those record-low poll numbers. That\u2019s just stuck to the Democratic brand right now.",
      "Of course, Democrats aren\u2019t going to nominate another presidential candidate for three years or so. Perhaps that\u2019s why some are itching to get that contest started sooner rather than later. Even formally nominating the party\u2019s next slate of congressional or Senate contenders is a year or so away.",
      "It\u2019s no wonder that research and investment efforts are getting a lot of attention \u2014 on the long road to fixing a party brand, that\u2019s what\u2019s available right now.",

    "summary": "The more Jamie Dimon worries, the better his bank seems to do.",
    "story": [
      "The more Jamie Dimon worries, the better his bank seems to do.",
      "As JPMorgan Chase has grown larger, more profitable and increasingly more crucial to the U.S. economy in recent years, its star CEO has grown more vocal about what could go wrong \u2014 all while things keep going right for his bank.",
      "In the best of times and in the worst of times, Dimon\u2019s public outlook is grim.",
      "Whether it\u2019s his 2022 forecast for a \u201churricane\u201d hitting the U.S. economy, his concerns over the fraying post-World War II world order or his caution about America getting hit by a one-two punch of recession and inflation, Dimon seems to lace every earnings report, TV appearance and investor event with another dire warning.",
      "\u201cHis track record of leading the bank is incredible,\u201d said Ben Mackovak, a board member of four banks and investor through his firm Strategic Value Bank Partner. \u201cHis track record of making economic-calamity predictions, not as good.\u201d",
      "Over his two decades running JPMorgan, Dimon, 69, has helped build a financial institution unlike any the world has seen.",
      "A sprawling giant in both Main Street banking and Wall Street high finance, Dimon\u2019s bank is, in his own words, an end-game winner when it comes to money. It has more branches, deposits and online users than any peer and is a leading credit card and small business franchise. It has a top market share in both trading and investment banking, and more than $10 trillion moves over its global payment rails daily.",
      "'Warning shot'",
      "A review of 20 years of Dimon\u2019s annual investor letters and his public statements show a distinct evolution. He became CEO in 2006, and his first decade at the helm of JPMorgan was consumed by the U.S. housing bubble, the 2008 financial crisis and its long aftermath, including the acquisition of two failed rivals, Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual.",
      "By the time he began his second decade leading JPMorgan, however, just as the legal hangover from the mortgage crisis began to fade, Dimon began seeing new storm clouds on the horizon.",
      "\u201cThere will be another crisis,\u201d he wrote in his April 2015 CEO letter, musing on potential triggers and pointing out that recent gyrations in U.S. debt were a \u201cwarning shot\u201d for markets.",
      "That passage marked the start of more frequent financial warnings from Dimon, including worries of a recession \u2014 which didn\u2019t happen until the 2020 pandemic triggered a two-month contraction \u2014 as well as concerns around market meltdowns and the ballooning U.S. deficit.",
      "But it also marked a decade in which JPMorgan\u2019s performance began lapping rivals.",
      "After leveling out at roughly $20 billion in annual profit for a few years, the sprawling machine that Dimon oversaw began to truly hit its stride. JPMorgan generated seven record annual profits from 2015 to 2024, over twice as many as in Dimon\u2019s first decade as CEO.",
      "In that time, investors began aggressively bidding up JPMorgan\u2019s shares, buying into the idea that it was a growth company in an otherwise boring sector. JPMorgan is now the world\u2019s most valuable publicly traded financial firm and is spending $18 billion annually on technology, including artificial intelligence, to stay that way.",
      "While Dimon seems perpetually worried about the economy and rising geopolitical turmoil, the U.S. keeps chugging along. That means unemployment and consumer spending has been more resilient than expected, allowing JPMorgan to churn out record profits.",
      "In 2022, Dimon told a roomful of professional investors to prepare for an economic storm: \u201cRight now, it\u2019s kind of sunny, things are doing fine, everyone thinks the Fed can handle this,\u201d Dimon said, referring to the Federal Reserve managing the post-pandemic economy.",
      "\u201cThat hurricane is right out there, down the road, coming our way,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cThis may be the most dangerous time the world has seen in decades,\u201d Dimon said the following year in an earnings release.",
      "But investors who listened to Dimon and made their portfolios more conservative would have missed out on the best two-year run for the S&P 500 in decades.",
      "'You look stupid'",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an interesting contradiction, no doubt,\u201d Mackovak said about Dimon\u2019s downbeat remarks and his bank\u2019s performance.",
      "\u201cPart of it could just be the brand-building of Jamie Dimon,\u201d the investor said. \u201cOr having a win-win narrative where if something goes bad, you can say, \u2018Oh, I called it,\u2019 and if doesn\u2019t, well your bank\u2019s still chugging along.\u201d",
      "According to the former president of a top five U.S. financial institution, bankers know that it\u2019s wiser to broadcast caution than optimism. Former Citigroup CEO Chuck Prince, for example, is best known for his ill-fated 2007 comment about the mortgage business that \u201cas long as the music is playing, you\u2019ve got to get up and dance.\u201d",
      "\u201cOne learns that there\u2019s a lot more downside to your reputation if you are overly optimistic and things go wrong,\u201d said the former president, who asked to remain anonymous to discuss Dimon. \u201cIt\u2019s damaging to your bank, and you look stupid, whereas the other way around, you just look like you\u2019re being a very cautious, thoughtful banker.\u201d",
      "Banking is ultimately a business of calculated risks, and its CEOs have to be attuned to the downside, to the possibility that they don\u2019t get repaid on their loans, said banking analyst Mike Mayo of Wells Fargo.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the old cliche that a good banker carries an umbrella when the sun is shining; they\u2019re always looking around the corner, always aware of what could go wrong,\u201d Mayo said.",
      "But other longtime Dimon watchers see something else.",
      "Dimon has an \u201culterior motive\u201d for his public comments, according to Portales Partners analyst Charles Peabody.",
      "\u201cI think this rhetoric is to keep his management team focused on future risks, whether they happen or not,\u201d Peabody said. \u201cWith a high-performing, high-growth franchise, he\u2019s trying to prevent them from becoming complacent, so I think he\u2019s ingrained in their culture a constant war room-type atmosphere.\u201d",
      "Dimon has no shortage of things to worry about these days, despite the fact that his bank generated a record $58.5 billion in profit last year. Conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza rage on, the U.S. national debt grows, and President Donald Trump\u2019s trade policies continue to jolt adversaries and allies alike.",
      "Graveyard of bank logos",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s fair to observe that he\u2019s not omniscient and not everything he says comes true,\u201d said Truist bank analyst Brian Foran. \u201cHe comes at it more from a perspective that you need to be prepared for X, as opposed to we\u2019re convinced X is going to happen.\u201d",
      "JPMorgan was better positioned for higher interest rates than most of its peers were in 2023, when rates surged and punished those who held low-yielding long-term bonds, Foran noted.",
      "\u201cFor many years, he said, \u2019Be prepared for the 10-year at 5%, and we all thought he was crazy, because it was like 1% at the time,\u201d Foran said. \u201cTurns out that being prepared was not a bad thing.\u201d",
      "Perhaps the best explanation for Dimon\u2019s dour outlook is that, no matter how big and powerful JPMorgan is, financial companies can be fragile. The history of finance is one of the rise and fall of institutions, sometimes when managers become complacent or greedy.",
      "In fact, the graveyard of bank logos that are no longer used includes three \u2014 Bear Stearns, Washington Mutual and First Republic \u2014 that have been subsumed by JPMorgan.",
      "During his bank\u2019s investor day meeting this month, Dimon pointed out that, in the past decade, JPMorgan has been one of the only firms to earn annual returns of more than 17%.",
      "\u201cIf you go back to the 10 years before that, OK, a lot of people earned over 17%,\u201d Dimon said. \u201cAlmost every single one went bankrupt. Hear what I just said?\u201d",
      "\u201cAlmost every single major financial company in the world almost didn\u2019t make it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a rough world out there.\u201d"

      "Uber said Monday that Pierre-Dimitri Gore-Coty, one of the company\u2019s longest-tenured top executives and the head of is delivery business is leaving after almost 13 years.",
      "Gore-Coty joined Uber as a general manager in France in 2012, and worked his way up to become vice president of mobility for the Europe and Middle East region four years later, according to his LinkedIn profile. He was named senior vice president of delivery in 2021.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine Uber without Pierre, because there hasn\u2019t been much Uber without Pierre,\u201d CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said in a statement that was part of a regulatory filing. \u201cAs one of our first employees, he was a driving force behind our global Mobility expansion and stepped up to run Uber Eats just weeks before the first Covid lockdowns.\u201d",
      "The company didn\u2019t say what Gore-Coty plans to do next.",
      "Uber also said that Andrew Macdonald, the company\u2019s senior vice president of mobility and business operations, will become chief operating officer, reporting to Khosrowshahi. Macdonald, 41, will oversee the company\u2019s global mobility, delivery and autonomous businesses in addition to \u201ckey cross-platform functions like membership, customer support, safety, and more,\u201d the filing said.",
      "Gore-Coty is one of 11 people listed on Uber\u2019s executive team page. Macdonald is the only one who has worked at the company longer. He joined in May 2012, four months before Gore-Coty, according to LinkedIn.",
      "\u201cThese last nearly 13 years have been the ride of a lifetime,\u201d Gore-Coty said in the statement. \u201cIt was a true team effort, and I\u2019m so proud of what we\u2019ve built and the impact we\u2019ve had on daily life in cities around the world.\u201d",
      "Uber shares were little changed in extended trading after closing on Monday at $83.64. The stock is up 39% this year, while the Nasdaq is about flat.",
      "Last month, the company reported first-quarter results that beat on earnings but missed on revenue. A month earlier, the Federal Trade Commission sued Uber, alleging that the company engaged in \u201cdeceptive billing and cancellation practices\u201d related to its Uber One subscription service.",
      "In an interview with CNBC\u2019s \u201cSquawk Box,\u201d Khosrowshahi characterized the lawsuit as \u201ca bit of a head-scratcher for us.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "After several years of deep distress, the beleaguered U.S. office market has reached an inflection point. This year, office conversions and demolitions will exceed new construction for the first time in at least 25 years.",
      "Simply put, more office space is being removed than added, shrinking the overall office footprint, according to exclusive new data from CBRE Group. The commercial real estate services firm has been tracking this since 2018, but estimates it may be the first time such a dynamic has played out this century, and likely longer.",
      "CBRE found that across the largest 58 U.S. markets, 23.3 million square feet of space is slated for demolition or conversion to other uses by the end of this year. In comparison, developers are projected to complete construction of 12.7 million square feet of office space in those same markets.",
      "\u201cThis net reduction \u2014 albeit slight \u2014 of office space across major markets likely will contribute to lowering the vacancy rate in the quarters ahead, which would benefit building owners,\u201d said Mike Watts, CBRE Americas president of investor leasing.",
      "All of this is being driven by the fundamental shift in office attendance, resulting from the growing remote-work culture since the start of the pandemic. Office vacancies soared to a record high and still hover right around there at 19%.",
      "But the market is starting to recover. More employers are ordering staff back to the office full-time, and, as the job market tightens, more employees are willing to take what they can get, even if it means more in-person attendance.",
      "Net absorption, which is the amount of space newly occupied in a quarter versus the amount vacated, has been positive for the past four quarters after six straight quarters of being negative. Office-leasing activity increased 18% in the first quarter of this year, compared with the same time frame the year before.",
      "With less supply and steadily increasing demand, office rents should stabilize. For prime office locations and new, so-called Class A space, rent has recovered. Beneficiaries in that space are some of the major office REITs, like Vornado, BXP, Alexandria Real Estate Equities and SL Green.",
      "\u201cThe office market will benefit as obsolete space is removed from the market in favor of the highest and best use. Additionally, conversions will boost the vibrancy of neighborhoods within various markets,\u201d said Jessica Morin, CBRE Americas head of office research.",
      "Developers also have another 85 million square feet of office space being readied for conversion in the next few years. Since 2016, office conversions to multifamily residences have generated roughly 33,000 apartments and condominiums, according to CBRE, given that each conversion, on average historically, yields about 170 units. There are about 43,500 units in the pipeline from conversions already underway.",
      "The reduction in office space overall is a positive for commercial real estate, but it will be slow going.",
      "\u201cThe conversion trend faces a few headwinds. The pool of ideal buildings for conversion will dwindle over time. And costs for construction labor, materials and financing remain high,\u201d Watts said.",

I self-regulate so I have a good relationship with food and exercise,\" she said. \"It wasn't always that way. This is not that I have a good metabolism or just good genes, because I used to be 25 pounds heavier in my early 30s.\"",
      "Frankel said she doesn't have issues with \"food noise\" or \"exercise noise\" at this point in her life.",
      "\"The reason my body is natural is because the exercise that I do, and have always done for my body is natural. I'll go months without exercise, and definitely days without doing anything, but I always come back to it,\" she said. \"I have a good relationship with it, and I have a good relationship with food because it's the obsession, it's the extremes, it's the binging, it's the emotions, it's the noise. That is why we are struggling.\"",
      "She concluded by telling her followers, \"I want you to allow yourselves to have, but not beat yourselves up when you do indulge. And I want you to have a good relationship with food and exercise.\"",
      "Frankel spoke more about her experience participating in the show in a June 1 Instagram post.",
      "\"There are so many things I could say about the Sports Illustrated experience. I didn't know much going into it. I mean, I know it's a magazine, and I know that once a year they do a swimsuit issue,\" she said.",
      "\"What I didn't know is what the culture is like there. And I didn't know who 90% of the women were. I will tell you that the resounding theme and culture is women supporting women,\" she continued.",
      "Frankel said the women at the event were not just giving compliments, but asking about what people were planning to do during their walks and helping them with their ideas.",
      "\"I have to say that as much as the runway show was really fun ... I wasn't nervous. I was aware of my age. I was aware that I'm not a model, and there were a lot of models, and I was just like, 'Am I gonna stick this landing or make an absolute fool myself and embarrass you guys?'\" she said.",
      "In the caption of another Instagram post, she summarized the event: \"This runway show was such an amazing experience and I am forever grateful to my community here in Florida and the people for your endless support.\""

      "Jenna Bush Hager is overcome by emotion and admits she\u2019s going to cry.",
      "Standing on a stage at the W Nashville at 9 a.m., in front of navy-blue bookshelves created for this moment, Jenna reflects on six years of her book club. Or, as she puts it, \u201cRead With Jenna is in kindergarten!\u201d",
      "The book club started as a dare to prove that people still read \u2014 the festival, which unfolded over May 30 and 31 and was sponsored by Nashville Music City, is proof that she was right.",
      "Since Read With Jenna launched in 2019, Jenna has chosen 80 books and counting, with a focus on championing debut and diverse voices. Fifty books became bestsellers. And 15 of the club\u2019s authors are in the room at the Read With Jenna Book Festival.",
      "The first ever live gathering of Jenna\u2019s book community and authors is the culmination of years of work. But it\u2019s also the product of a lifetime.",
      "Jenna, onstage, talks about the two grandmothers and mother whose love of reading molded her into the woman, and literary tastemaker, she is. She says Jenna Welch, her namesake, read to explore beyond her life in central Texas. Her grandmother Barbara Bush read for connection and enjoyed reading her granddaughters\u2019 selections. Her mother, Laura Bush, a librarian, read for purpose.",
      "You could say Jenna reads for all those reasons \u2014 plus, perhaps, change-making. In addition to bringing people together around her monthly picks, Jenna is starting her own imprint and having a hand in shaping books that go out into the world. (The first book, \u201cConform,\u201d is out later this year.)",
      "At the Read With Jenna Book Festival, audience members experienced the magic of books. While reading is a solitary act, Jenna believes a shared love of books, and the conversation they inspire, can bring people together.",
      "On the morning of May 31, the room was full of about 200 readers from more than 35 states around the country \u2014 cities including Atlanta, Charleston, Chicago, Huntsville, Alabama and of course, Nashville.",
      "Many attendees were friends, like an Elin Hilderbrand-loving duo who met in high school and Amy Sixbey and Cindy Hedges, who met at a yarn store they later co-owned. (Hedges and Sixbey, who are in multiple book clubs each, give advice for running one: Meet once a month and \"read the book.\")",
      "Another woman gave an instant \u201cyes\u201d the moment her sister sent the event\u2019s registration link.",
      "Multiple sets of mothers and daughters at the festival said reading keeps them together even as their lives diverge. \"We communicate through the books we read,\" Patti Grote of Chicago said, next to her grown daughter. \"Bad on Paper\" cohost and novelist Olivia Muenter got her mom tickets for Mother's Day.",
      "Many came by themselves, like one woman who wore Read With Jenna merch she hand-bedazzled for the event \u2014 a jean jacket for the VIP event on Friday and another T-shirt for Saturday\u2019s mainstage. When a 20-year-old couldn't find a friend to join her, she drove by herself.",
      "The day began around 8 a.m. with breakfast and mingling. On the sunny terraces of the W Nashville overlooking Nashville's Gulch district, longtime friends sat side-by-side with solo travelers.",
      "Before events started, and throughout the day, attendees stopped by the many vendors, picking charms to feature on bracelets from local store Charm Bar (cowboy hats and books were popular options), decorating book-shaped cookies from Butterfly Bakehouse, creating a bouquet from Amelia's Flowers, assembling bags of children's books for local libraries and getting their tarot cards read by Sarah Jane Chapman. They also perused pop-ups \u2014 Parnassus Books, the record store Groove and Shop TODAY.",
      "The itinerary was stacked enough to impress a preteen. When Jenna called her eldest daughter Mila to describe the day, Mila responded, \u201cJenna, are you trying to make me jealous?\u201d",
      "Following breakfast came what could only be called a literary marathon. Stepping through the secret door in the bookcase were two bestselling authors, whose chats with Jenna will eventually feature on the Open Book with Jenna podcast.",
      "First, Jenna spoke to \u201cTom Lake\u201d author Ann Patchett about the nun who taught her to read, running a bookstore in Nashville and why she doesn\u2019t have a cell phone.",
      "Jenna also marveled at the full circle moment their conversation represented: At 18, Jenna and her twin Barbara Bush said Donna Tartt and Patchett were their favorite authors \u2014 and now, she was sitting on stage with Patchett. (Patchett said she and Tartt were chuffed by the Bush twins' answer at the time).",
      "From the back of the room, the next speaker, Elin Hilderbrand looked on wearing a white dress that contrasted with her perpetual Nantucket tan. Hilderbrand took the stage after Patchett to discuss whether she\u2019s really retiring, writing with her daughter and how, after 25 years, she\u2019s ushering in a new era: Adaptations.",
      "She and Jenna also shared some news: They are collaborating on a screen project \u2014 but, as Jenna said, \"We can't share much.\" Hilderbrand's fans (\u201cHilderbabes,\" as they're called), will be delighted but not surprised to know that throughout the day of the festival, the best-selling author took breaks out by the pool.",
      "From there, attendees shuffled between the day\u2019s activities. There were interactive book club sessions with Read With Jenna authors Amity Gaige (\u201cHeartwood\u201d), Emma Straub (\u201cAll Adults Here\u201d) and Christina Henriquez (\u201cThe Great Divide\u201d), asking questions about the novels and answering questions about how they were personally moved.",
      "Later came a chance to tap into their creative sides in workshops led by novelist Jessica Soffer (\u201cThis Is a Love Story\u201d) and songwriter Eric Paslay.",
      "After lunch, comedian Tiffany Haddish took the mainstage with Jenna. Haddish got deep, fast, about how her past trauma informs her comedy, and her revelations about her childhood in the foster care system inspired an attendee to share her own story.",
      "One undeniable highlight came when Haddish \u201ccursed\u201d the audience with joy \u2014 \u201cI curse you with all the joy and abundance and success you can handle. You deserve to be happy.\u201d Another unplanned moment came when she and Paslay collaborated on a moving song about her.",
      "The day rounded out with a celebration of what makes Read With Jenna so special: Its authors (who Jenna calls rock stars).",
      "Jenna moderated a panel with multiple Read With Jenna authors (Coco Mellors, Rumaan Alam, Jean Kwok, Alison Espach, and Chris Whitaker, plus a cameo from Mellors\u2019 son, Indigo). Then, lines formed for signings with all the authors in attendance, a list that included Cara Wall, Diane Marie Brown and Tara Stringfellow, too.",
      "Almost 11 hours after the Read With Jenna Book Festival started at 8 a.m., the crowd gathered to listen to singer Blessing Offor perform. (Holly Williams performed with her husband during the VIP event \u2014 it's Music City, after all).",
      "Jenna, overcome yet again, thanked attendees \u2014 and made, if not a firm promise, then the hope of one.",
      "\u201cMaybe we\u2019ll make this an annual pilgrimage. Until then I hope you connect with us,\" she said."

      "Wendt got the ultimate tribute during the event on May 31 when the crowd in attendance sang the iconic \u201cCheers\u201d theme to salute him. Sudeikis was seen onstage with Rudd, Heidi Gardner, Eric Stonestreet and a slew of others.",
      "\u201cTo the one and only George Wendt, who couldn\u2019t be with us this year,\u201d the person introducing the song said. \u201cBut good lord, is he not. If you know the words, sing it.

      "Bader shared photos and videos from the milestone moment on her Instagram June 1 that showed her smiling wide and throwing her hands up in the air as she fully embraced the spotlight.",
      "In the caption, she penned a \u201csappy long\u201d statement about why the runway show was so meaningful after opening up about her weight loss and surgery.",
      "\u201cThe past two months since I opened up about my surgery and everything I\u2019ve been through mentally and physically over the past year and a half, I have been feeling quite a range of emotions,\u201d she said. \u201cBefore I walked the runway last night, my dear friend, @noordinarynoire asked me how I was feeling \u2014 and I told her: not the way I thought I would.\u201d",
      "She said she was unsure who she would represent when she appeared on the catwalk because she doesn\u2019t know where she fits in.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not plus size, I\u2019m not skinny\u2026 I didn\u2019t know what people wanted me to stand for and I didn\u2019t like not having an answer,\u201d she wrote.",

      "\u201cAnd in that moment, something finally clicked,\u201d the TikToker wrote. \u201cSince I started sharing my life online 5 years ago, I\u2019ve constantly tried to figure out which box I belong in based on solely what others want me to be in and that has only been based on my appearance. But last night, I simply just stood for every girl or woman who\u2019s felt lost about where she belongs, but still chooses to show up and put herself out there no matter what.\u201d",
      "She said that was all she needed to embody when she walked the runway.",
      "Bader continued, \u201cLooking at these unedited photos and not wishing to change a thing reminds me how far I\u2019ve come \u2014 not for vanity, but for my mental, emotional, and physical health. To go from not knowing if I\u2019d ever be able to walk out of my house again a year ago, to walking that runway confidently, smiling, and not thinking twice about what anyone else saw, but how good I FELT \u2014 and that\u2019s something I\u2019ll never take for granted.\u201d",
      "To conclude, she expressed her gratitude to Sports Illustrated Swimsuit for asking her to participate.",
      "\u201cAnd sorry (but very much not sorry) for the long caption,\u201d she cheekily added and included a white heart.",
      "As she mentioned in her post, Bader has opened up in the past about her health journey. In March, she revealed in an interview with Self magazine that she underwent a weight loss surgery called single anastomosis duodenal-ileal bypass (SADI-S) in December 2023. The procedure is a hybrid of gastric sleeve and gastric bypass.",
      "She described the recovery process as \u201cthe most brutal thing.\u201d",
      "\u201cI was in recovery hours, hours, hours, hours, throwing up. It was not normal,\u201d she explained. \u201cI was supposed to leave (the hospital) in one day. I could not stop projectile vomiting, and I couldn\u2019t drink water. They won\u2019t let you leave if you can\u2019t drink water. I actually can\u2019t explain how horrible it was.\u201d",
      "Bader continued to struggle as she recovered. She shared that she fell into a \u201cdeep depression\u201d that was \u201cthe scariest time of my life.\u201d",
      "But, she said later in the interview that she has improved.",
      "\u201cAm I happy overall right now, happier than when I was dealing with the health issues and the back pain and all those things? Yes. I have more energy. All of my health stuff went back to normal after years and years and years,\u201d she said at the time.",
      "She added, \u201cI think I\u2019ve let so many people take my power away for a long time. I will never regret having my time to heal, and I\u2019m still healing and figuring it out. ... That was none of the internet\u2019s business\u2014these people that don\u2019t know me\u2014and that was for me to figure out.\u201d"

      "\u201cTo say this is my greatest dream come true is actually being pretty reserved about it. To my fans, you know how important this has been to me \u2014 so much so that I meticulously re-recorded and released 4 of my albums, calling them Taylor\u2019s Version. The passionate support you showed those albums and the success story you turned The Eras Tour into is why I was able to buy back my music. I can\u2019t thank you enough for helping to reunite me with this art that I have dedicated my life to, but have never owned until now.\u201d",
      "This saga dates back to 2019 when music executive Scooter Braun bought Swift\u2019s former record label Big Machine Records \u2014 and the master recordings of her first six albums. Those masters were then sold to a Shamrock Capital in 2020, and in November of that year, Swift said she had begun rerecording her first six albums.",

Full transparency: I haven\u2019t even re-recorded a quarter of it,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThe Reputation album was so specific to that time in my life, and I kept hitting a stopping point when I tried to remake it. All that defiance, that longing to be understood while feeling purposely misunderstood, that desperate hope, that shame-born snarl and mischief.\u201d",
      "\u201cReputation,\u201d as many fans know, has a controversial past. The album dropped in November 2017 after nearly a year of Swift staying largely out of the spotlight, following a public fallout with Kanye West and his then-wife Kim Kardashian. (You can read all about that saga in full here.)",
      "The abbreviated version: In 2016, Swift\u2019s feud with West (who now goes by Ye) reached new heights after he released his song \u201cFamous,\u201d featuring a vulgar lyric about Swift, which she denounced. Kardashian later published a video clip that seemingly showed Swift approving the name drop. The singer was branded a \u201csnake\u201d and hashtags like \u201c#KimExposedTaylorParty\u201d went viral.",
      "Swift reclaimed the snake imagery with \u201cReputation\u201d and appeared to reference the feud on the album in songs like \u201cLook What You Made Me Do\u201d and \u201cThis Is Why We Can\u2019t Have Nice Things.\u201d",
      "The album demonstrated a lackluster performance when it came to Grammy nominations. But \u201cReputation\u201d has since become a fan-favorite, and listeners have been eager for its rerelease.",
      "In her letter, Swift said now that though she now owns her master recordings, some tracks from \u201cReputation (Taylor\u2019s Version)\u201d may be released down the line.",
      "\u201cTo be perfectly honest, it\u2019s the one album in those first 6 that I thought couldn\u2019t be improved upon by redoing it. Not the music, or the photos, or the videos.

A flashback sequence of all the times I daydreamed about, wished for, and pined away for a chance to get to tell you this news. All the times I was thiiiiiiis close, reaching out for it, only for it to fall through. I almost stopped thinking it could ever happen, after 20 years of having the carrot dangled and then yanked away. But that\u2019s all in the past now.

I will be forever grateful to everyone at Shamrock Capital for being the first people to ever off this to me. The way they\u2019ve handled every interaction we\u2019ve had has been honest, fair, and respectful. This was a business deal to them, but I really felt like they say it for what it was to me: My memories and my sweat and my handwriting and my decades of dreams. I am endlessly thankful.

      "While there are differing accounts on the extent of the ensuing damage of Sunday\u2019s \u201cSpiderweb\u201d operation, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said 40 Russian aircraft \u2014 34% of Russia's strategic cruise missile carriers \u2014 were hit. Ukraine's security service, the SBU, put the estimated cost to the Kremlin at $7 billion.",
      "Some military commentators and pro-Russian bloggers have called it the country's \"Pearl Harbor\" \u2014 a reference to Japanese attack in 1941 that led the United States to enter World War II.",
      "It came Sunday, a day before the latest round of direct peace talks between Ukraine and Russia on Monday.",
      "There was little optimism for diplomatic progress even before the strike, with Ukraine sending its defense minister, Rustem Umerov, but Russia dispatching only the far more junior Putin aide Vladimir Medinsky to the \u00c7\u0131ra\u011fan Palace in Istanbul.",
      "Those talks have concluded for the day, Zelenskyy said at a news conference in the Lithuanian capital, Vilnius, just after midday local time (9 a.m. ET).

      "\u201cI am waiting to hear Minister Umerov\u2019s full report,\u201d Zelenskyy said.",
      "A far more likely outcome of Sunday's strike is Russia\u2019s continuing to bomb Ukrainian civilians \u2014 this time under the pretext of retaliation, \u201ceven though in reality these strikes are planned long in advance,\u201d said Keir Giles, a senior consulting fellow with the London-based think tank Chatham House's Russia and Eurasia program.",
      "Less hard to quantify will be the huge blow to Vladimir Putin's pride, with Western analysts in agreement that this was a humiliation for the Russian president.",
      "\u201cAt a time when Putin seems to think that he is winning on the battlefield, this demonstrates that his forces are in fact very vulnerable,\u201d said Sven Biscop, a director at the Egmont Institute, a think tank in Brussels. \u201cThis may not change the course of the war, but it does mean that every gain Russia makes will be at high cost.\u201d",

      "It's still unclear what impact the surgical strike will have on Monday's negotiations, hopes for which were already dim thanks to the deep divisions between the positions of Kyiv and Moscow. Ukraine says it is ready to sign an unconditional 30-day ceasefire; Russia is essentially demanding Ukraine's surrender.",
      "Brokering the talks, President Donald Trump has shifted from the unambiguously pro-Ukrainian stance of his predecessor, President Joe Biden, and offered concessions to the Kremlin that have outraged many in the West.",
      "At the same time, he accused Putin last week of going \u201cabsolutely crazy\u201d by continuing to launch regular attacks on Ukraine civilians. Ultimately, he has threatened to walk away from the peace talks if they do not yield the results he once promised he would achieve in just 24 hours.",
      "Indeed, overnight into Sunday, Russia launched 500 attack drones into Ukraine, Zelenskyy said. The night next came 84 more, with at least 10 people killed and dozens more injured across the country, Ukraine's air force said.",

      "\u201cWe can expect a great deal of sound and fury from Moscow,\u201d Giles said. Russia \u201cwill be working hard on convincing the United States to attempt to rein Ukraine in, in order to prevent any further damage to Russia\u2019s means of bombarding Ukrainian cities with long range missiles,\u201d he added.",

      "President Donald Trump told reporters at the Oval Office on Friday that the deal, which would pause hostilities for 60 days, allow the phased release of hostages and pave the way for more humanitarian aid to flow into the devastated enclave, was \u201cvery close.\u201d",

      "NBC News looks at what\u2019s at stake:",
      "What does the deal include?",
      "Basem Naim, a senior Hamas official, shared a framework of the agreement with NBC News, which calls for an immediate 60-day halt in fighting, during which Hamas would release 33 Israeli captives in exchange for \u201ca number of Palestinian prisoners.\u201d In return, Israel would \u201chalt all military operations\u201d in Gaza as soon as the truce takes effect, and civilians would be allowed to return to their homes across the enclave.",
      "Under the terms of the framework, Israeli forces would withdraw in two phases \u2014 first from densely populated areas, then from urban centers \u2014 with full withdrawal to be completed by the end of the ceasefire period.",
      "During the truce, it says \u201cnegotiations will continue to reach an agreement on the release of Israeli soldiers in exchange for a number of Palestinian prisoners.\u201d",

      "The latest proposals lay the groundwork for a temporary pause in the fighting, but offer no guarantee of a permanent end to the war.",
      "Hamas has signaled openness to talks but insists any lasting deal must include a complete cessation of hostilities and a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza.",
      "Israel meanwhile, has demanded that Hamas disarm, dismantle its military and governing infrastructure, and return all 58 remaining hostages before agreeing to end the war. Hamas has rejected those terms.",

      "The 'hungriest place on Earth'",
      "More than 4,000 people have been killed in the strip since Israel shattered its ceasefire with Hamas in early March and imposed a blockade preventing food, fuel and medical supplies from entering Gaza. The country\u2019s military launched a major new operation dubbed \u201cGideon\u2019s Chariot\u201d earlier this month.",
      "The latest proposals to end the fighting come as the U.N.

      "That was exciting news for fans like Haerin Ouyang, a university student in the coastal Chinese city of Fuzhou, where the South Korean boy band Epex had been scheduled to perform on Saturday.",
      "But the show was canceled earlier this month, less than two weeks after it was announced, leaving Ouyang \u201cheartbroken.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe venue is only a 10-minute ride from my school, and it would have been fun to go with friends,\u201d she said.",
      "C9 Entertainment, which manages Epex, cited \u201clocal circumstances\u201d in announcing the cancellation on May 9, dashing hopes that China was opening its doors to K-pop shows for the first time since 2016.",
      "The ban, which China has never officially acknowledged, began after South Korea announced the deployment of an American anti-ballistic missile defense system that China said was aimed at constraining its power in the region.",
      "Before the ban, China \u2014 the second-biggest music market in Asia after Japan \u2014 was one of the fastest-growing markets for K-pop and other South Korean pop culture, whose rapid rise in global popularity is known as the Korean Wave, or hallyu.",
      "\u201cIn the K-content and K-pop markets as well, China\u2019s consumer power is regarded as top-tier,\u201d said Kang Soyoung, a professor at Seoul Digital University.",
      "The China ban is estimated to have cost the South Korean economy almost $16 billion since 2016, she said.",
      "But the Epex concert\u2019s cancellation does not necessarily reflect the official position of the Chinese government, Kang cautioned, as China has been gradually reopening to South Korean culture after years of tension.",
      "While K-pop acts have been blocked, other South Korean bands have been allowed to play. In April, the South Korean hip-hop trio Homies became the first all-Korean act to perform in mainland China in eight years. A South Korea-based Korean American musician in a one-man indie rock band performed in the Chinese cities of Xi'an, Wuhan and Zhengzhou in late 2024 and early 2025.",
      "A large-scale K-pop joint concert is also scheduled to be held in September at a 40,000-seat stadium in the Chinese island province of Hainan. The Korea Entertainment Producers\u2019 Association, which announced the event in April, did not reply to an email asking whether that concert is still going ahead.",
      "Kang said she believed the hallyu ban would soon be lifted and the Hainan concert would \u201cproceed without issue.\u201d",
      "There are also signs of growing business ties. Hybe, the South Korean entertainment company that manages the global K-pop sensation BTS, recently opened an office in Beijing, according to South Korean media. On Friday, China\u2019s Tencent Music was set to become the second-largest shareholder in the other major K-pop label, SM Entertainment, after Hybe said in a regulatory filing that it would sell Tencent its entire stake.",
      "\u201cIt shows that there is a greater opportunity for collaboration between the two countries, especially in the entertainment industry,\u201d said Ellen Kim, director of academic affairs at the Korea Economic Institute of America. \u201cIt might be a starting point for industry-level cooperation that could open more doors between the two countries.\u201d",
      "The diplomatic thaw extends beyond culture. In November, China said it would grant visa exemptions for South Korean visitors, and South Korea has said it will do the same for visitors from China.",
      "China\u2019s growing friendliness toward South Korea might be partly motivated by the unstable situation on the international stage, Kim said. Both countries face increasingly hostile and unpredictable U.S. trade policies under President Donald Trump.",
      "In addition, China is struggling with weak domestic consumption that would be aided by K-pop\u2019s high-spending fans.",
      "China has also been strengthening its own entertainment industry and has more confidence in it, Kang said, pointing to the record-breaking success this year of the Chinese film \u201cNe Zha 2,\u201d the world\u2019s highest-grossing animated film ever.",
      "\u201cIt now has robust resilience against the \u2018invasion\u2019 of foreign content,\u201d she said.",
      "China\u2019s potential thaw toward South Korean entertainment comes as it further restricts the number of Hollywood films allowed to be screened in its theaters in response to Trump\u2019s tariffs.",
      "China-South Korea ties could also get a boost from next week\u2019s South Korean presidential election. The front-runner, Lee Jae-myung, is considered friendlier to China than his predecessor.",

    "story": [
      "When South Koreans elect a new president Tuesday, it will end months of domestic political turmoil \u2014 but their choice could bring big changes to the country\u2019s relationship with the United States.",
      "Lee Jae-myung, leader of the liberal opposition Democratic Party, had a clear lead in polls going into the election, which is being held six months to the day after then-President Yoon Suk Yeol plunged the East Asian democracy of more than 50 million people into turmoil by abruptly declaring martial law.",
      "Since lawmakers impeached Yoon in December over the short-lived martial law order, South Korea has been stuck in a leadership vacuum, churning through a series of acting presidents. The uncertainty has also constrained the U.S. ally in Washington even as President Donald Trump slapped it with a 25% \u201creciprocal\u201d tariff, among other levies.",
      "The presidential by-election, which was triggered in April when South Korea\u2019s Constitutional Court upheld Yoon\u2019s impeachment, promises a return to stability, and South Koreans have turned out in record numbers for early voting.",
      "\u201cA lot of people just want to move on, because it\u2019s been a long six months,\u201d said Jennifer Lee, a principal at the Asia Group corporate consultancy in Washington, who recently returned from a trip to South Korea.",
      "Lee Jae-myung, 61, who narrowly lost to Yoon in 2022, has been seen as the most likely next president since Yoon was impeached.",
      "But public support for Lee has been driven more by anger at Yoon\u2019s conservative People Power Party, which has declined to condemn his actions, than by agreement with Lee\u2019s policy positions, said Rob York, director for regional affairs at Pacific Forum, a foreign policy research institute in Honolulu.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think enthusiasm for him is especially strong,\u201d York said. \u201cHe\u2019s not an especially inspiring figure for a number of reasons, but the conservative party is simply so tainted right now.\u201d",
      "Further boosting Lee\u2019s chances is the fact that conservative votes are being split between Kim Moon Soo, the People Power Party candidate, and Lee Jun-seok, a young lawmaker from the upstart Reform Party who has been generating controversy with his antifeminist remarks.",
      "Though Lee has moved toward the center during the campaign, he is generally seen as more open to China and North Korea than his predecessor and less friendly toward Japan, which is part of a trilateral security partnership with the United States and South Korea.",
      "Because Yoon was \u201cso pro-U.S. and hardcore U.S.,\u201d it seems unlikely that the U.S.-South Korea relationship will remain as strong, the Asia Group\u2019s Jennifer Lee said.",
      "\u201cI think that there will be some more balancing act between the United States and China,\u201d she said, and if the Trump administration \u201ccomes out hard\u201d on issues such as tariffs or cost-sharing for the 28,500 U.S. troops stationed in South Korea, \u201cI think there may be a lot more frictions ahead.\u201d",
      "Still, Lee the candidate has expressed support for the U.S.-South Korea alliance and already begun reaching out to the Trump administration. In an interview last week with Time magazine, Lee said Trump \u201chas outstanding skills in terms of negotiation\u201d and that both he and Trump are simply looking out for the interests of their people.",
      "Though he doesn\u2019t align with Trump\u2019s conservative views, Lee has in the past been nicknamed \u201cKorea\u2019s Trump\u201d by supporters enamored with his populist, outspoken style.",
      "Like Trump, Lee also survived an attempt on his life last year, having been stabbed in the neck during a visit to the city of Busan.",
      "\u201cPersonality-wise I think the two of them, if they\u2019re in a room together, would probably get along,\u201d York said. \u201cBoth of them are people who view themselves as dealmakers, and I think they\u2019re more concerned with crafting a deal that makes both of them look good.\u201d",
      "One of Lee\u2019s top priorities will be reaching a deal on tariffs, which have hit South Korea hard. In addition to the 25% tariff, South Korea \u2014 the world\u2019s 10th-largest economy \u2014 is vulnerable to steep duties on some of its biggest exports, such as steel and automobiles.",
      "Lee is also facing a more assertive North Korea, whose leader, Kim Jong Un, has been advancing his ballistic missile and nuclear weapons programs. Like Trump, Lee favors greater engagement with the North, pledging last week to restore a military hotline between the two rivals, who technically remain at war.",
      "Though Trump has said he\u2019d like to revive his in-person diplomacy with Kim, North Korea appears far less interested in negotiating than it was when the two leaders met in 2018 and 2019. Kim is now receiving crucial economic and military support through a security partnership with Russia, and he said last year that North Korea is no longer pursuing reconciliation with the South.",
      "The heightened tensions on the Korean Peninsula come amid reports that Trump is considering withdrawing thousands of U.S. troops from the South, an idea he also floated during his first term. Though Seoul says there have been no such discussions, Pentagon officials say a troop reduction has not been ruled out.",
      "Neither South Korea nor U.S. Forces Korea (USFK) were barely mentioned in Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth\u2019s speech in Singapore last weekend laying out the U.S. approach to the Indo-Pacific, adding to concerns about where the country stands with Washington.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. can unilaterally decide and act on reducing USFK troops. It\u2019s their military, after all,\u201d said Bong Young Sik, a North Korea specialist at the Yonsei Institute for North Korean Studies at Yonsei University in Seoul, referring to U.S. Forces Korea.",
      "But \u201cthey need to consider and accommodate the situations their security partners are under and facing,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cIf they go with \u2018What is good for the U.S. is good for the world,\u2019 I am not sure how long that approach could work,\u201d Bong said.",

    "summary": "Magnus Carlsen, the top-ranked chess player in the world, lost for the first time in the classical format to Gukesh Dommaraju, the current world champion who at 19 years old is seen as among the game's brightest young stars.",
    "story": [
      "It was the fist slam heard 'round the chess world.",
      "Two of the titans of chess \u2014 one, the up-and-coming champion versus arguably the greatest player of all time \u2014 squared off over the weekend in a game that has drawn attention not just for its result but for the post-game reaction.",
      "Magnus Carlsen, the top-ranked chess player in the world, lost for the first time in the classical (think long, complex games) format to Gukesh Dommaraju, the current world champion who at 19 years old is seen as among the game's brightest young stars.",
      "The game, which came as part of the Norway Chess 2025 tournament, swung after Carlsen lost a knight, leading to a frantic endgame in which each player had only seconds left on their clocks.",
      "With Gukesh in a clearly winning position, Carlsen expressed his frustration in a manner relatable to most anyone who has ever played chess: with a fist to the table.",
      "Carlsen then offered a handshake of resignation before standing up and offering another relatable exasperation: \"Oh my god,\" along with an apology.",
      "While the game probably wouldn't have made the same waves without Carlsen's reaction, the loss does offer a growing sense of Gukesh's rise. But it also offers some sense of just how dominant Carlsen remains at the age of 34.",
      "In an interview immediately after the match, Gukesh detailed his shock at winning the game, which at one point looked hopeless for him.",
      "\"There wasn't much I could do,\" he said. \"It was just clearly lost, so I was just trying to make moves which were tricky for him, and luckily he got into time scramble.\"",
      "\"99 out of 100 times I would lose,\" Gukesh added.",
      "Others in the chess community offered a bit more support for Gukesh's performance.",
      "Gukesh also reportedly told Chess.com that he could relate to Carlsen's reaction: \u201cI\u2019ve also banged a lot of tables in my career!\u201d",
      "Carlsen retains his title as the top-ranked player by the International Chess Federation (FIDE), which calculates ratings based on performances across sanctioned tournaments. Carlsen is also a five-time world chess champion, a title awarded for winning the game's most prestigious tournament (The Candidates Tournament) and besting the current world champion (or with the current champion beating the winner of the Candidates).",
      "Carlsen declined to defend the title in 2022, with China's Ding Liren taking the top spot only to be defeated by Gukesh in 2024. Then only 18, Gukesh became the youngest world champion in history.",
      "That has meant something of a natural rivalry between the two.",
      "Carlsen has praised the Indian phenom, noting recently in an appearance on the podcast \"The Joe Rogan Experience\" that Gukesh \"works his a-- off all time\" but also is not as strong as some of the shorter time formats that have gained in popularity and prestige in recent years.",
      "Along with the embrace of shorter time formats, chess has boomed online, with a boom in coverage and content creators who analyze games in real time and provide plenty of commentary.",
      "And with Carlsen still by far the game's top star, a blunder and loss \u2014 and reaction\u00a0\u2014 like the one to Gukesh has sparked its own compilations of reactions."

    "story": [
      "MEXICO CITY \u2014 Mexico held its first judicial elections Sunday, stirring controversy and sowing confusion among voters who struggled to understand a process set to transform the country's court system.",
      "Polls closed and poll workers began counting colored ballots Sunday night with the question hanging in the air of what will become of Mexico's judiciary, the answer to which will only emerge in the coming days as results roll in.",
      "Mexico's electoral authority announced late in the night that 13% of Mexico's 100 million voters cast ballots at the polls, lagging far behind the 60% turnout just a year before during the country's presidential election.",
      "Nevertheless, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum called the voting \"a complete success.\"",
      "\"Mexico is the most democratic country in the world,\" she added.",
      "Experts warned of startling low turnout in the lead up to the historic elections due to the mindboggling array of unfamiliar choices and the novelty of voting for judges. Experts say those factors may throw into question the legitimacy of the election, which has faced months of fierce scrutiny.",
      "Sheinbaum, a member of Mexico's ruling party, Morena, rejected the criticisms and insisted the election would only only make Mexico more democratic and root out corruption in a system that most people in the country believe is broken.",
      "\"Whoever says that there is authoritarianism in Mexico is lying,\" she said. \"Mexico is a country that is only becoming more free, just and democratic because that is the will of the people.\"",
      "While some voters said they felt pushed to vote in an election they felt would determine the fate of the country's democracy, many more expressed a deep sense of apathy, citing disillusionment due to decades of corruption and lack of basic information about the vote.",
      "\"I'm not interested (in voting). Parties and their messages \u2014 they come and they go. It's all the same,\" said Raul Bernal, a 50-year-old factory worker in downtown Mexico City walking is dog.",
      "A historic vote",
      "Even without the final tally, the results of the vote are set to transform Mexic",
      "o's judiciary. Morena overhauled the court system late last year, fueling protests and criticism that the reform is an attempt by those in power to seize on their political popularity to gain control of the branch of government until now out of their reach.",
      "\"It's an effort to control the court system, which has been a sort of thorn in the side\" of those in power, said Laurence Patin, director of the legal organization Juicio Justo in Mexico. \"But it's a counter-balance, which exists in every healthy democracy.\"",
      "Instead of judges being appointed on a system of merit and experience, Mexican voters have cast ballots to choose between some 7,700 candidates vying for more than 2,600 judicial positions.",
      "Mexicans head to the polls",
      "Some of the country's voting centers opened with only a trickle of people and small lines forming throughout the day.",
      "Esteban Hern\u00e1ndez, a 31-year-old veterinary student, said he didn't agree with electing judges and doesn't support Morena, but came to vote because \"since there isn't much participation, my vote will count more.\"",
      "He had studied the candidates on a website listing their qualifications and decided to pick those who had doctorates. Other critics said they only voted for the Supreme Court and other top courts.",
      "Francisco Torres de Le\u00f3n, a 62-year-old retired teacher in southern Mexico, called the process \"painstaking because there are too many candidates and positions that they're going to fill.\"",
      "Sheinbaum's predecessor and political mentor, former President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, who had pushed through the judicial reform but remained out of the public eye since leaving office last year, voted in Chiapas near his ranch.",
      "\"I wanted to participate in this historic election,\" he said. \"Never in the history of our country \u2026 have the people decided and had the right to elect judges.\"",
      "Democratic concerns",
      "The process has raised concerns.",
      "Civil society organizations like Defensorxs have raised red flags about a range of candidates running for election, including lawyers who represented some of Mexico's most feared cartel leaders and local officials who were forced to resign from their positions due to corruption scandals.",
      "Also among those putting themselves forward are ex-convicts imprisoned for years for drug trafficking to the United States and a slate of candidates with ties to a religious group whose spiritual leader is behind bars in California after pleading guilty to sexually abusing minors.",
      "Others like Martha Tamayo, a lawyer and former congresswoman from conflict-ravaged Sinaloa, cast doubt on projections that the election could hand even more power over to criminals and criminal groups, simply because they already have a strong control over courts.",
      "\"The influence of criminal groups already exists,\" she said. \"The cartels go with the judges (bribe them) whether they are elected or not.\"",
      "'You have to start with something'",
      "The public has been plagued by confusion over a voting process that Patin warned has been hastily thrown together. Voters often have to choose from more than a hundred candidates who are not permitted to clearly voice their party affiliation or carry out widespread campaigning.",
      "As a result, many Mexicans said they were going into the vote blind, though others voting Sunday noted they supported the process despite the confusion.",
      "Mexico's electoral authority has investigated voter guides being handed out across the country, in what critics say is a blatant move by political parties to stack the vote in their favor.",
      "\"Political parties weren't just going to sit with their arms crossed,\" Patin said.",
      "While still unsure if his vote would improve access to justice for many Mexicans, 61-year-old actor Manuel Jos\u00e9 Contreras defended the election, Sheinbaum and her party. He cast his ballot with a tone of hope.",
      "\"The reform has its problems but we needed an urgent change,\" he said. \"You have to start with something.\""

    "summary": "Conservative Karol Nawrocki has won Poland's weekend presidential runoff election, according to the final vote count.",
    "story": [
      "WARSAW, Poland \u2014 Conservative Karol Nawrocki won Poland\u2019s weekend presidential runoff election, according to the final vote count on Monday. Nawrocki won 50.89% of votes in a very tight race against liberal Warsaw Mayor Rafa\u0142 Trzaskowski, who received 49.11%.",
      "The race had Poland on edge since a first round of voting two weeks earlier, revealing deep divisions in the country along the eastern flank of NATO and the European Union.",
      "An early exit poll released Sunday evening suggested Trzaskowski was headed to victory before updated polling began to reverse the picture a couple of hours later.",
      "The outcome suggests that Poland can be expected to take a more populist and nationalist path under its new leader, who was backed by U.S. President Donald Trump.",
      "Most day-to-day power in the Polish political system rests with a prime minister chosen by the parliament. However, the president's role is not merely ceremonial. The office holds the power to influence foreign policy and veto legislation.",
      "Nawrocki will succeed Andrzej Duda, a conservative whose second and final term ends on Aug. 6.",
      "Under the Polish constitution, the president serves a five-year term and may be re-elected once.",
      "Prime Minister Donald Tusk came to power in late 2023 with a coalition government that spans a broad ideological divide \u2014 so broad that it hasn\u2019t been able to fulfill certain of Tusk\u2019s electoral promises, such as loosening the restrictive abortion law or passing a civil partnership law for same-sex couples.",
      "But Duda\u2019s veto power has been another obstacle. It has prevented Tusk from fulfilling promises to reverse laws that politicized the court system in a way that the European Union declared to be undemocratic.",
      "Now it appears Tusk will have no way to fulfill those promises, which he made to both voters and the E.U.",
      "Some observers in Poland have said the unfulfilled promises could make it more difficult for Tusk to continue his term until the next parliamentary election scheduled for late 2027, particularly if the Law and Justice party dangles the prospect of future cooperation with conservatives in his coalition.",
      "Nawrocki, a 42-year-old amateur boxer and historian, was tapped by Law and Justice as part of its push for a fresh start.",
      "The party governed Poland from 2015 to 2023, when it lost power to a centrist coalition led by Tusk. Some political observers predicted the party would never make a comeback, and Nawrocki was chosen as a new face who would not be burned by the scandals of the party\u2019s eight years of rule.",
      "Nawrocki has most recently been the head of the Institute of National Remembrance, which embraces nationalist historical narratives. He led efforts to topple monuments to the Soviet Red Army in Poland, and Russia responded by putting him on a wanted list, according to Polish media reports.",
      "Nawrocki\u2019s supporters describe him as the embodiment of traditional, patriotic values. Those who oppose secular trends, including LGBTQ+ visibility, have embraced him, viewing him as a reflection of the values they grew up with.",
      "Nawrocki\u2019s candidacy was clouded by allegations of past connections to criminal figures and his participation in a violent street brawl. He denies the criminal links but was unapologetic about the street fight, saying he had taken part in \u201cnoble\u201d fights in his life. The revelations did not seem to hurt his support among right-wing voters, many of whom see the allegations as politically motivated.",
      "Trump made it clear he wanted Nawrocki as Poland\u2019s president.",
      "He welcomed Nawrocki to the White House a month ago. And last week the conservative group CPAC held its first meeting in Poland to give Nawrocki a boost. Kristi Noem, the U.S. Homeland Security secretary and a prominent Trump ally, strongly praised Nawrocki and urged Poles to vote for him.",
      "The U.S. has about 10,000 troops stationed in Poland, and Noem suggested that military ties could deepen with Nawrocki as president.",
      "A common refrain from Nawrocki\u2019s supporters is that he will restore \u201cnormality,\u201d as they believe Trump has done. U.S. flags often appeared at Nawrocki\u2019s rallies, and his supporters believed that he offered a better chance for good ties with the Trump administration.",
      "Nawrocki has also echoed some of Trump\u2019s language on Ukraine. He promises to continue Poland\u2019s support for Ukraine but has been critical of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, accusing him of taking advantage of allies. He has accused Ukrainian refugees of taking advantage of Polish generosity, vowing to prioritize Poles for social services such as health care and schooling."

      "\"I hope there will be less division, that maybe there will be more dialogue,\" she said.",
      "The campaign has highlighted stark ideological divides. Trzaskowski, 53, has promised to restore judicial independence, ease abortion restrictions and promote constructive ties with European partners. Nawrocki, 42, has positioned himself as a defender of traditional Polish values, skeptical of the EU and aligned with U.S. conservatives, including President Donald Trump.",
      "Nawrocki's candidacy has been clouded by allegations of past connections to criminal figures and participation in a violent street battle. He denies the criminal links but acknowledges having taken part in \"noble\" fights. The revelations have not appeared to dent his support among right-wing voters, many of whom see the allegations as politically motivated.",
      "Some of those voting for Nawrocki in Warsaw dismissed those allegations, saying he shouldn't be punished for his past and that Trzaskowski has also made mistakes as mayor.",
      "W\u0142adys\u0142awa W\u0105sowska, an 82-year-old former history teacher, recalled instilling patriotism in her students during the communist era, when Poland was under Moscow's influence.",
      "\"I'm a right-wing conservative. I love God, the church and the homeland,\" she said, explaining that Nawrocki for her is the only patriotic choice, and accusing Trzaskowski of serving foreign interests.",
      "\"He's controlled by Germany,\" she said. \"I want a sovereign, independent, democratic Poland \u2014 and a Catholic one.\"",
      "Amid rising security fears over Russia's war in neighboring Ukraine, both candidates support aid to Kyiv, though Nawrocki opposes NATO membership for Ukraine, while Trzaskowski supports it in the future.",
      "Nawrocki's campaign has echoed themes popular on the American right, including an emphasis on traditional values. His supporters feel that Trzaskowski, with his pro-EU views, would hand over control of key Polish affairs to larger European powers like France and Germany.",
      "Many European centrists are rooting for Trzaskowski, seeing in him someone who would defend democratic values under pressure from authoritarian forces across the globe."

      "The sailing boat Madleen \u2014 operated by activist group Freedom Flotilla Coalition \u2014 will embark from the Sicilian port of Catania, in southern Italy.",
      "It will try to reach the shores of the Gaza Strip in an effort to bring in some aid and raise \u201cinternational awareness\u201d over the ongoing humanitarian crisis, the activists said at a press conference on Sunday, ahead of departure.",
      "\u201cWe are doing this because, no matter what odds we are against, we have to keep trying,\u201d Thunberg said, bursting into tears during her speech.",
      "\u201cBecause the moment we stop trying is when we lose our humanity. And no matter how dangerous this mission is, it\u2019s not even near as dangerous as the silence of the entire world in the face of the live-streamed genocide,\u201d she added.",
      "Israel, which was founded in the aftermath of the Holocaust, has adamantly rejected genocide allegations against it as an antisemitic \u201cblood libel.\u201d",
      "In mid-May, Israel slightly eased its blockade of Gaza after nearly three months, allowing a limited amount of humanitarian aid into the territory.",
      "Experts have warned that Gaza is at risk of famine if more aid is not brought in.",
      "U.N. agencies and major aid groups say Israeli restrictions, the breakdown of law and order, and widespread looting make it extremely difficult to deliver aid to Gaza\u2019s roughly 2 million Palestinians.",
      "Among those joining the crew of the Madleen are \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d actor Liam Cunningham and Rima Hassan, a French member of the European Parliament who is of Palestinian descent. She has been barred from entering Israel due to her active opposition to the Israeli assault on Gaza.",
      "The activists expect to take seven days to get to their destination, if they are not stopped.",
      "Thunberg, who became an internationally famous climate activist after organizing massive teen protests in her native Sweden, had been due to board a previous Freedom Flotilla ship last month.",
      "That attempt to reach Gaza by sea, in early May, failed after another of the group\u2019s vessels, the \u201cConscience\u201d, was attacked by two alleged drones while sailing in international waters off the coast of Malta.",
      "The group blamed Israel for the attack, which damaged the front section of the ship, in the latest confrontation over efforts to send assistance to the Palestinian territory devastated by nearly 19 months of war.",
      "The Israeli government says the blockade is an attempt to pressure Hamas to release hostages it took during the Oct. 7, 2023, attack that triggered the conflict. Hamas-led militants assaulted southern Israel that day, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting 251. Hamas is still holding 58 hostages, 23 of whom are believed to be alive.",
      "In response, Israel launched an offensive that has killed over 52,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and civilians. Israel\u2019s bombardment and ground operations have destroyed vast areas of the territory and left most of its population homeless.",
      "The Flotilla group was only the latest among a growing number of critics to accuse Israel of genocidal acts in its war in Gaza. Israel vehemently denies the allegations, saying its war is directed at Hamas militants, not Gaza\u2019s civilians.",
      "\u201cWe are breaking the siege of Gaza by sea, but that\u2019s part of a broader strategy of mobilizations that will also attempt to break the siege by land,\u201d said activist Thiago Avila.",
      "Avila cited the upcoming Global March to Gaza \u2014 an international initiative also open to doctors, lawyers and media \u2014 which is set to leave Egypt and reach the Rafah crossing in mid-June to stage a protest there, asking Israel to stop the Gaza offensive and reopen the border."
