      "His freewheeling tunes and cosmic-stoner songwriting made him a beloved figure.",
      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) \u2014 Todd Snider, a singer whose thoughtfully freewheeling tunes and cosmic-stoner songwriting made him a beloved figure in American roots music, has died. He was 59.",
      "His record label said Saturday in a statement posted to his social media accounts that Snider died Friday.",
      "\u201cWhere do we find the words for the one who always had the right words, who knew how to distill everything down to its essence with words and song while delivering the most devastating, hilarious, and impactful turn of phrases?\u201d the statement read. \u201cAlways creating rhyme and meter that immediately felt like an old friend or a favorite blanket. Someone who could almost always find the humor in this crazy ride on Planet Earth.\u201d",
      "Snider's family and friends had said in a Friday statement that he had been diagnosed with pneumonia at a hospital in Hendersonville, Tennessee, and that his situation had since grown more complicated and he was transferred elsewhere. The diagnosis came on the heels of the cancellation of a tour after Snider had been the victim of a violent assault in the Salt Lake City area, according to a Nov. 3 statement from his management team.",
      "But Salt Lake City police later arrested Snider himself when he at first refused to leave a hospital and later returned and threatened staffers, the Salt Lake Tribune reported.",
      "The scrapped tour was in support of his most recent album, \u201cHigh, Lonesome and Then Some,\u201d which released in October. Snider combined elements of folk, rock and country in a three-decade career. In reviews of his recent albums, The Associated Press called him a \u201csinger-songwriter with the persona of a fried folkie\u201d and a \u201cstoner troubadour and cosmic comic.\u201d",
      "He modeled himself on \u2014 and at times met and was mentored by \u2014 artists like Kris Kristofferson, Guy Clark and John Prine. His songs were recorded by artists including Jerry Jeff Walker, Billy Joe Shaver and Tom Jones. And he co-wrote a song with Loretta Lynn that appeared on her 2016 album, \u201cFull Circle.\u201d",

      "\u201cHe relayed so much tenderness and sensitivity through his songs, and showed many of us how to look at the world through a different lens,\u201d the Saturday statement from his label read. \u201cHe got up every morning and started writing, always working towards finding his place among the songwriting giants that sat on his record shelves, those same giants who let him into their lives and took him under their wings, who he studied relentlessly.\u201d",
      "Snider would do his best-known and most acclaimed work for Prine's independent label Oh Boy in the early 2000s. It included the albums \u201cNew Connection,\u201d \u201cNear Truths and Hotel Rooms\u201d and \u201cEast Nashville Skyline,\u201d a 2004 collection that's considered by many to be his best.",

      "Snider was born and raised in Oregon before settling and making his musical chops in San Marcos, Texas. He eventually made his way to Nashville, and was dubbed by some the unofficial \u201cmayor of East Nashville,\u201d assuming the title from a friend memorialized thusly in his \u201cTrain Song.\u201d In 2021, Snider said a tornado that ripped through the neighborhood home to a vibrant arts scene severely damaged his house.",
      "Snider had an early fan in Jimmy Buffett, who signed the young artist to his record label, Margaritaville, which released his first two albums, 1994's \u201cSongs for the Daily Planet\u201d and 1996's \u201cStep Right Up.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- The White House Historical Association has reclaimed a series of sketches by American painter and illustrator Norman Rockwell, spending a whopping $7.25 million at auction on Friday.",
      "The four 1940s-era sketches titled \u201cSo You Want to See the President!\u201d were displayed in the West Wing for years, but were removed in 2022 after a family dispute over who owned them.",
      "The sketches show a variety of people \u2014 journalists, military officers and even a Miss America Pageant winner and her publicist \u2014 seated on plush-looking red chairs as they waited to meet President Franklin D. Roosevelt. They were put up for sale by a grandson of the White House official who had received them as a gift from Rockwell.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t tell you how personally thrilled I am that the White House Historical Association preserved this piece of White House history,\u201d said Anita McBride, who sits on the association\u2019s board of directors.",
      "The White House Historical Association's winning bid was $5.8 million. It's total cost to reclaim the art, including the buyer's premium paid to the auction house, was $7.25 million.",
      "The price tag is by far the most ever paid by the association, which holds a vast collection of art, furniture and other items as part of its mission to help the White House collect and display artifacts that represent American history and culture.",
      "Before Friday, the most the association had paid for an artifact was $1.5 million for \u201cThe Builders,\u201d by African American artist Jacob Lawrence, in 2007, McBride said. That work depicts hard-working men in orange, red and brown tones, and hangs in the White House Green Room.",
      "The sketches sold Friday are Rockwell\u2019s only known collection of four interrelated paintings that he conceived to tell a story, according to Heritage Auctions, the Dallas-based auction house that sold them. The series was created in 1943 and published in the Saturday Evening Post.",

      "NEW YORK -- When Kristen Wiig steps out of a vintage Rolls-Royce in the opening scene of Season 2 of \u201cPalm Royale,\u201d she\u2019s sporting a tall, yellow, fringed hat, gold platform sandals and sunny bell bottoms, with fabric petals that sway with every determined step. It\u2019s the first clue that the costumes on the female-driven comedy are taking center stage.",
      "The Apple TV show made a splash in its first season with the starry cast, high production values and ubiquitous grasshopper cocktail. Wiig\u2019s character, Maxine, tries to break into Palm Beach high society in 1969 and bumps heads with co-stars Carol Burnett, Allison Janney, Leslie Bibb and Laura Dern. But also playing a starring role are the vintage designer frocks that reflect each character.",
      "For Season 2, which premiered this week, Emmy-winning costume designer Alix Friedberg says she and her team coordinated \u201cthousands\u201d of looks that reflect the characters\u2019 jet-setting style. She says 50-60% of the brightly colored and graphic print costumes are original vintage designer pieces, sourced by shoppers and costume designers.",
      "\u201cThe looks are so iconic. Sometimes Kristen will walk in in something, and it brings tears to my eyes,\u201d Kaia Gerber \u2014 who plays Mitzi \u2014 told The Associated Press in a recent interview.",
      "If not original vintage, Friedberg\u2019s team builds the costumes, and if a character has to wear an outfit in multiple scenes or in big dance numbers, the team may create duplicates to preserve continuity. Friedberg says she was lucky to find so many vendors with vintage designer pieces in great condition.",
      "\u201c(Bibb\u2019s character) Dinah wears a few original Oscar de la Renta pieces that are really so perfect. Bill Blass was a big one, Oleg Cassini,\u201d Friedberg says. \u201cThere\u2019s a dress that (Janney\u2019s character) Evelyn wears that's this all emerald green jersey, it\u2019s an original Halston and it\u2019s so stunning on her and it really does sort of evoke what\u2019s to come in the '70s.\u201d",
      "Janney calls Friedberg \u201cbrilliant\u201d and marveled at her talent at finding pieces that are like works of art. Some of her favorites were the characters\u2019 apr\u00e8s-ski looks in the Swiss Alps \u2014 but she finds it hard to pick an ultimate favorite.",
      "\u201cAll of them just make me feel divine. And the hair is just a masterpiece, and the makeup \u2014 it all goes together to just create Evelyn and I barely have to do anything,\u201d Janney says.",
      "The costumes also help heighten the comedy. Friedberg says Evelyn\u2019s stoic and deadpan character elicits laughs with some of her over-the-top getups.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s delivering this dialogue, these lines with, like, seven wigs on top of her,\u201d Friedberg says. \u201cThe absurdity comes out really in how these women present themselves time and time again. \u2026 It was just so much fun to get to laugh and wink at the audience.\u201d",
      "Burnett called costume fittings on the show \u201cgreat fun\u201d and said they helped her find her character, the scheming Norma. \u201cI work from the outside in. I have to know what I\u2019m going to look like,\u201d she says.",

      "The costumes also help set the tone for the female empowerment theme that permeates this season. \u201cEvelyn wore a lot more pants \u2014 which seems ridiculous to say today \u2014 but back then that was a real power move,\u201d Friedberg says.",

      "LONDON -- The BBC has issued a public apology to U.S. President Donald Trump over a misleading edit of his speech on Jan. 6, 2021, but said it \u201cstrongly disagreed there is a basis for a defamation claim.\u201d",
      "Since it was established more than a century ago, Britain's public broadcaster has been no stranger to controversy. Over the past week, it has been embroiled in one of its deepest-ever crisis as its director general stepped down, its head of news quit, questions were raised over the veracity of its journalism and Trump said he is mulling a billion-dollar lawsuit.",
      "Here's what to know.",
      "Pressure on the broadcaster has been growing since the right-leaning Daily Telegraph newspaper published parts of a dossier compiled by the BBC's adviser on standards and guidelines on Nov. 3.",
      "As well as criticizing the BBC\u2019s coverage of transgender issues and raising concerns of anti-Israel bias in the BBC\u2019s Arabic service, the dossier said that an edition of the BBC\u2019s flagship current affairs series \u201cPanorama\" \u2014 titled \u201cTrump: A Second Chance?\u201d \u2014 broadcast days before the 2024 U.S. presidential election was misleading.",
      "Specifically, it showed how the third-party production company that made the film spliced together three quotes from two sections of the Jan. 6, 2021 speech into what appeared to be one quote in which Trump urged supporters to march with him and \u201cfight like hell.\u201d",
      "By doing so, it made it look like Trump was giving the green light to his supporters to storm the U.S. Capitol as Congress was poised to certify President-elect Joe Biden\u2019s victory in the 2020 election that Trump falsely alleged was stolen from him.",
      "The outcry from opponents of the BBC \u2014 and there are many both in the U.K. and abroad \u2014 was immediate and vociferous.",
      "The broadcaster, which is funded by an annual license fee of 174.50 pounds ($230) paid by all U.K. households who watch live TV or any BBC content, was accused of bias against Trump, symptomatic of they say an inherent liberal bias within the organization.",
      "For days, the BBC said very little, saying it did not report to leaked reports. Many thought that was a misjudgement as it allowed the narrative around the edit to be led by its opponents.",
      "By Nov. 9, the pressure on the BBC was becoming increasingly acute, prompting its top executive, Tim Davie, and head of news Deborah Turness to resign over what the broadcaster called an \u201cerror of judgment.\u201d",
      "It was also revealed that Trump was demanding a retraction, apology and compensation over the sequence. \u201cI guess I have to,\u201d Trump said when asked about whether he would go through with his legal threat. \u201cBecause I think they defrauded the public and they\u2019ve admitted it.\u201d",

      "In a statement, it said its chair, Samir Shah, had personally sent a letter via a letter from its chair over the misleading edit but said it had not defamed him.",
      "While the BBC statement doesn\u2019t respond to Trump\u2019s demand that he be compensated for \u201coverwhelming financial and reputational harm,\u201d the headline on its news story about the apology said it refused to pay compensation.",
      "The U.S. president has yet to respond to the BBC's apology and its rejection of of his demands for compensation.",
      "Legal experts have said that Trump would face challenges taking the case to court in the U.K. or the U.S. They said that the BBC could show that Trump wasn\u2019t harmed because he was ultimately elected president in 2024.",
      "While many legal experts have dismissed the president\u2019s claims against the media as having little merit, he has won some lucrative settlements against U.S. media companies and he could try to leverage the BBC mistake for a payout, potentially to a charity of his choice.",
      "However this latest crisis pans out in the days and weeks ahead, the heat will remain on the BBC, especially in its newsrooms where any mistake, or seeming bias, will no doubt be picked up opponents.",
      "As a public broadcaster, the BBC has to be impartial in the way it covers news events. It's a fine balancing act that often gets the BBC into trouble. Some think it leans too much to the right, while others think it goes the other way. Whatever the truth of the matter, many think that the BBC is often cowed in its coverage, particularly on domestic political matters.",

      "Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy said the government would ensure the BBC is \u201csustainably funded (and) commands the public\u2019s trust,\u201d but did not say whether the license fee might be scaled back or scrapped.",

      "The four 1940s-era sketches are titled \u201cSo You Want to See the President!\u201d and depict people from all walks of life hanging out in the White House lobby as they anticipate meeting President Franklin D. Roosevelt. They were put up for sale by a grandson of the White House official who received them as a gift from Rockwell after a court battle over their ownership was settled.",
      "The sketches are set to be sold by a Dallas-based auction house Friday. In keeping with its mission to help the White House collect and display artifacts that represent American history and culture, including the history of the White House, the association hopes to prevail. It wants to add the drawing to the vast White House collection of art, furniture and other items.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re so different from any of the other art that was exhibited in the West Wing,\u201d said Anita McBride, who sits on the association's board of directors.",
      "McBride remembers seeing the drawings in 1981 when she went to work in Ronald Reagan\u2019s administration. They were a \u201cfocal point\u201d when staffers took visitors on tours, she said. \u201cPeople just loved seeing\u201d the \u201cwide array and depiction of Americans that have access to their president.\u201d",
      "The series, created in 1943 and published in the Saturday Evening Post during World War II, \u201coffers an intimate and deeply human portrayal of American democracy in action,\u201d according to a description on the Heritage Auctions website.",
      "The sketches show a variety of people \u2014 journalists, military officers and even a Miss America Pageant winner and her publicist \u2014 waiting on plush-looking red chairs in the West Wing lobby as they waited to meet Roosevelt. A Secret Service agent stands watch in one of the scenes.",
      "\u201cIn a way, it sort of illustrates how FDR always talked about the \u2018arsenal of democracy\u2019 and what made the United States unique,\u201d said Matthew Costello, the association\u2019s chief education officer. \u201cIt\u2019s an incredible series of renderings.\u201d",
      "The sketches are Rockwell\u2019s only known collection of four interrelated paintings that he conceived to tell a story, the auction house said.",
      "Rockwell gave the original drawings to Stephen Early, who was Roosevelt's longtime press secretary, seen in a drawing smoking a pipe as reporters huddle around him. A family member turned them over to the White House in 1978, and they were on display throughout the West Wing for more than four decades, sometimes in a hallway between the press offices that are mere steps from the Oval Office.",

      "The family's ownership dispute began in 2017 when Thomas Early, one of the press secretary's sons, was watching a television interview with President Donald Trump and spied them on a wall in the White House, according to court records.",
      "William Elam III, a grandson of Stephen Early's, said his mother received the drawings as a gift from her father, the former press secretary, before he died, and that ownership had later passed to him.",
      "The illustrations had gone to the White House in 1978 under an agreement which obligated the White House to return them to Elam upon request. The White House gave back the drawings in 2022.",
      "A federal appeals court settled the dispute in May, upholding a lower-court ruling in favor of Elam, according to court records.",
      "Bidding will start at $2.5 million and clients are \u201cready and waiting to compete for this American icon,\u201d Christina Rees, director of communications for Heritage Auctions, said in an email. The auction house has estimated the drawings will sell for between $4 million and $6 million.",
      "That price tag could present a hurdle for the White House Historical Association, which was created in 1961 by first lady Jacqueline Kennedy to help preserve the museum quality of the interior of the White House and educate the public. It is a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization that receives no government funding. It raises money mostly through private donations and merchandise sales, including an annual Christmas ornament.",
      "The association did not reveal how much it is willing to spend, but the most it has ever paid for a painting in the past was $1.5 million for \u201cThe Builders,\u201d by African American artist Jacob Lawrence, in 2007, McBride said. That work depicts hard-working men in orange, red and brown tones, and hangs in the White House Green Room.",
      "McBride said she expected stiff competition for Rockwell's work because of the broad interest in Americana, as well as the artist's work. But the association's mission is to go after art, furniture and other items it believes belong in the White House.",
      "\u201cWe try hard to bring them back,\u201d McBride said.",

      "Sofia Coppola has been honored at the Museum of Modern Art Film Benefit in New York for her filmmaking achievements",
      "NEW YORK -- When Sofia Coppola was 20 years old and figuring out who she wanted to be in the world, Angelica Huston offered some advice: \u201cNot everyone\u2019s going to love you. Don\u2019t waste your time on the people who don\u2019t,\u201d Coppola recalled Wednesday night in New York at the Museum of Modern Art Film Benefit, where she was being honored for her films.",
      "Coppola was surrounded by family, friends and collaborators like Bill Murray, Josh Hartnett and Elle Fanning for the Chanel-presented event, which helps raise funds for the museum\u2019s film collection and preservation efforts.",
      "\u201cShe\u2019s not just the daughter of a great filmmaker,\u201d Murray said. \u201cShe\u2019s a great filmmaker.\u201d",
      "But it's a distinction that was hard earned. Just over 27 years after her father Francis Ford Coppola encouraged her to make her first short film, Coppola reflected on starting a filmmaking career at a time when she was thought of as \u201ca nepo baby before they were charming\u201d and \u201cthe amateur actress who had single-handedly ruined \u2018The Godfather\u2019 films.\u201d",
      "\u201cMost people didn\u2019t think I had something to say that mattered,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I found a few who did.\u201d",
      "Since making her feature debut with \u201cThe Virgin Suicides,\u201d Coppola has written and directed seven narrative features and one documentary, about Marc Jacobs, that A24 plans to release next year. She's been both celebrated, winning an Oscar for writing \u201cLost in Translation,\u201d which also earned her a best director nomination, and dismissed. \u201cMarie Antoinette\u201d was infamously booed at Cannes, but over the next 20 years would become beloved and celebrated.",
      "Fanning remembered meticulously planning her outfit to meet Coppola for the first time at age 11, where she would go on to be cast as the daughter of a famous movie star in \u201cSomewhere.\u201d A few years prior she had convinced her grandmother to take her to see \u201cMarie Antoinette\u201d and she immediately became a fan.",
      "\u201cLiving in that cinema, in Sofia\u2019s world for a few hours, it would change my girlhood forever,\u201d Fanning said. \u201cIt was the place that I felt safe and seen, and I wanted to live in it a hundred times over.\u201d",
      "On \u201cSomewhere,\u201d Coppola made Fanning feel like an equal on set and saw beauty in things like her glasses and retainer and made them \u201ccool\u201d through her approval. At 18, she\u2019d reunite with Coppola to play the \u201cbad girl\u201d in the Civil War era film \u201cThe Beguiled.\u201d",
      "Hartnett also thanked Coppola for giving him one of his first big roles as a teenage heartthrob in \u201cThe Virgin Suicides.\u201d He recalled being in awe of her, the mixtapes she made for the cast and her \u201cincredible chill\u201d under the immense pressure of directing her first feature at only 26.",

      "Filmmaker Lotfy Nathan has turned the apocryphal Infancy Gospel of Thomas into a supernatural thriller called \u201cThe Carpenter\u2019s Son,\u201d starring Nicolas Cage",
      "LOS ANGELES -- In the second century, as the canonical Gospels were being copied and circulated throughout the Roman Empire, another text about the life of Jesus was simultaneously spreading. Although the Infancy Gospel of Thomas didn\u2019t make it into the New Testament, it remained popular among Christians for centuries.",
      "When filmmaker Lotfy Nathan was introduced to the apocryphal text about Jesus\u2019 childhood by his history-loving father, he immediately began poring over it as a springboard for what would eventually become \u201cThe Carpenter\u2019s Son,\u201d the supernatural thriller starring Nicolas Cage and opening in theaters Friday.",
      "\u201cThe thought gave me chills,\u201d recalled the writer and director, who was raised Coptic Orthodox. \u201cThe novelty of this, in a way, being an origin story that hadn\u2019t been told before.\u201d",
      "The film, which stars FKA twigs and Noah Jupe alongside Cage, follows Jesus as a young boy being tempted by Satan to rebel against his father, Joseph (Cage). The film\u2019s source material is established with an opening title card. \u201cBased on the Infancy Gospel of Thomas,\u201d it reads. But Nathan concedes he couldn\u2019t rely solely on the text and had to fill in narrative gaps, as with a storyline involving Satan.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s written like a laundry list of events. It doesn\u2019t really have an arc, so to speak,\u201d he said of the apocryphal account of Jesus\u2019 life from ages 5 to 12. \u201cI had a historian pull a lot of research for me before I wrote the first draft.\u201d",
      "As fate would have it, Cage had already read the Infancy Gospel of Thomas years ago, during a period in his life of deep philosophical curiosity and reflection. When Nathan came to the Oscar winner with the script, Cage said he saw a through line to a type of story he\u2019s long been attracted to.",
      "\u201cFamily dramas, it\u2019s no secret, is one of my favorite subject matters or genres. I couldn\u2019t think of a more compelling family dynamic than the Nativity,\u201d Cage told The Associated Press. \u201cAs I read it and thought about it, I never thought of it as a horror film per se. I saw it as a family drama about an existential crisis.\u201d",
      "The Infancy Gospel of Thomas might seem novel and obscure for some contemporary audiences, but history attests to both its popularity and longevity, according to Tony Burke, a professor at York University in Toronto whose specialties include early Christian apocrypha.",
      "Stories within it permeated ancient Christian lore, art and even some medieval plays. One account from the text about Jesus giving life to clay birds even made its way into the Quran.",
      "Also referred to as the Paidika \u2014 a nod to its original Greek title, \u201cPaidika Iesou,\u201d which translates to \u201cThe Childhood Acts of Jesus\u201d \u2014 the Infancy Gospel of Thomas often surprises modern readers.",
      "\u201cThis is not the Jesus that they expect \u2014 a Jesus that kills a boy in the marketplace or strikes down his teacher,\u201d Burke said, though he argues that Christian audiences during that time wouldn\u2019t have been bothered by this characterization. \u201cIn the ancient world, it was not that uncommon to tell stories of revered holy men cursing as well as blessing.\u201d",

      "The Paidika is one of two primary infancy gospels from that time \u2014 the other being the Infancy Gospel of James \u2014 that were popular among early Christians. \u201cThey never became canonical in the strict sense, but they were always kind of something on the periphery,\u201d Burke said.",
      "Although Jesus movies aren't often described as horror films or supernatural thrillers, the second century text upon which \u201cThe Carpenter\u2019s Son\u201d is based is \u201cquite disturbing,\u201d argues Joan E. Taylor, a professor of early Christianity at King\u2019s College London. She recently wrote \u201cBoy Jesus: Growing Up Judaean in Turbulent Times.\u201d",
      "\u201cJesus is portrayed as having these powers but not really having the moral compass in terms of how he uses his powers, or at least not the moral compass we would expect from, say, the Gospel of Luke,\u201d she said of the Paidika. \u201cYou have this child who has these supernatural powers and punishes those who come in his way.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe Carpenter\u2019s Son\u201d isn\u2019t the only recent film to reimagine the apocryphal gospel. \u201cThe Young Messiah,\u201d the 2016 drama based upon Anne Rice's novel \u201cChrist the Lord: Out of Egypt,\u201d also pulls from the Paidika.",
      "Both films reinterpret some of the aspects of the text that are ostensibly at odds with the Jesus of the canonical Gospels. In \u201cThe Young Messiah,\u201d for example, it\u2019s Satan who kills the boy in the marketplace, then frames Jesus. That encounter is left out of \u201cThe Carpenter\u2019s Son\u201d entirely.",
      "Despite their popularity, telling any story about Jesus on-screen is tricky, especially when filmmakers veer into territory outside of the canonical Gospels. Cage recalled seeing \u201cThe Last Temptation of Christ,\u201d Martin Scorsese\u2019s notoriously controversial 1988 drama starring Willem Dafoe as Jesus, in theaters when it first came out.",
      "\u201cI was in line to get my tickets and I remember there were the picketers and they were angry. And I said, \u2018Well have you seen the movie?\u2019 And they said no,\u201d Cage recalled. \u201cDon\u2019t you think you should see it before you make a statement about it or judge it?\u201d",
      "Still, he\u2019s cognizant of the fact that any film tackling subjects sacred to people is vulnerable to critique. The American Family Association, a conservative Christian advocacy group, has denounced the film and urged people to sign a petition blocking its release.",
      "\u201cNobody wanted to offend anybody in the making of this movie,\u201d Cage said emphatically. \u201cIf anyone does go to this movie, they would see that everyone treated it with love and not with any approach of mockery or contempt. It was all about love.\u201d",

      "Fans of Danmei same-sex romance stories in China say the government is cracking down harder than ever on the popular genre",
      "For Cindy Zhong, like many young Chinese women, a relaxing night used to mean curling up with a steamy story about two men in love. Then her favorite authors, and their tales, started disappearing.",
      "Fans of the popular Danmei same-sex romance genre, written and read mainly by straight women, say the Chinese government is carrying out the largest crackdown yet on it, effectively neutering the enjoyment.",
      "In the vast world of fantasy, Danmei is relatively straightforward: Two men stand in for idealized relationships, from chaste to erotic. Some scholars believe the stories appeal to Chinese women as a way to sidestep the country\u2019s conservative gender values and imagine relationships on a more equal footing.",
      "\"Women turn to Danmei for pure love, especially as they face pressure from families, peers and society to get married and have kids,\u201d said Aiqing Wang, a senior lecturer at the University of Liverpool who studies Chinese popular culture and internet literature.",
      "The once-niche Chinese literary subculture has seen a boom in recent years, with novels adapted into blockbuster television series and translated into Western languages.",
      "Danmei \u2014 also known as \u201cBoys Love\u201d in English \u2014 has also caught the eye of Chinese authorities. At least dozens of writers have been interrogated, arrested and charged with producing and selling obscene materials in China in the past year, according to media reports and witness accounts online.",
      "Some writers have stopped publishing or taken work offline. Websites have shut down or removed many stories, leaving the tamest behind.",
      "\u201cChinese female readers can no longer find a safe, uncensored space to place our desires,\u201d said Zhong, an educator in her 30s.",
      "Writers have said they enjoy directing lives that aren\u2019t their own.",
      "\u201cWhen I was writing, I felt so powerful that I could create a world,\u201d said Zou Xuan, a teacher who used to write Danmei for fun and has been reading them for a decade.",
      "China\u2019s government has been tightening its grip on the LGBTQ+ community, shutting down rights groups and social media accounts, despite removing homosexuality from its list of mental illness in 2001. Same-sex relationships are not criminalized.",
      "Even though China\u2019s censorship apparatus has long disapproved of same-sex love stories, the most popular Danmei stories have become bestselling books and been adapted into cartoons, video games and TV series. Adaptations often get around censorship by changing the characters to a heterosexual couple or presenting the relationship between male leads as an intense \u201cfriendship.\u201d",
      "The stories, usually published online by amateurs, are some of the most widely read fiction in China. Ranging from the flowery to the heavily erotic, they can include scenes of men fighting with a sword and a flute in ethereal ancient costumes or sex scenes in nature after rainfall.",

      "NEW YORK -- Prosecutors urged a judge on Wednesday to reject Harvey Weinstein \u2019s claims that his June sexual assault conviction was marred by threats and bullying among jurors.",
      "The disgraced movie mogul\u2019s lawyers submitted sworn affidavits last month from two jurors who said they regretted voting to convict Weinstein and only did so because others on the panel bullied them during five contentious days of deliberations.",
      "The Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office said the jurors\u2019 claims were \u201cinconsistent and implausible\u201d and that they provided no legal basis for Weinstein\u2019s lawyers to challenge his conviction.",
      "One juror who claimed in an affidavit that he observed \u201cthreats\u201d and \u201cintimidation\u201d had told the judge during deliberations that he only saw \u201cplayground stuff,\" prosecutors said. Immediately after the trial ended, the same juror told reporters, \u201cit\u2019s not like a fight was going to break out. No, obviously not.\u201d",
      "Weinstein\u2019s bid to overturn his first-degree criminal sex act conviction \u201cutterly fails, on both the law and the facts, to meet the standard necessary to set aside the guilty verdict,\u201d prosecutors Matthew Colangelo, Nicole Blumberg, Shannon Lucey and Becky Mangold wrote.",
      "They cited a centuries-old rule that the U.S. Supreme Court has said gives \u201csubstantial protection to verdict finality\u201d and assures that once a trial is over, jurors won\u2019t be \"harassed or annoyed by litigants seeking to challenge the verdict.\u201d",
      "Judge Curtis Farber said he'll rule on Dec. 22.",
      "Prosecutors said they declined to interview any jurors before responding to the defense\u2019s claims because doing so would \u201ccause the very harms\u201d the centuries-old rule was meant to avoid.",
      "Weinstein\u2019s defense team, led by attorney Arthur Aidala, argued in court papers last month that the verdict was marred by \u201cthreats, intimidation, and extraneous bias,\u201d and that Farber failed to properly deal with it at the time.",
      "The two jurors said in their affidavits that they felt overwhelmed and intimidated by others on the panel who wanted to convict Weinstein on the criminal sex act charge, which accused him of forcing oral sex on TV and film production assistant and producer Miriam Haley in 2006.",
      "One of the jurors said she was screamed at in the jury room and told, \u201cwe have to get rid of you.\u201d The other juror said anyone who doubted Weinstein\u2019s guilt was grilled by other jurors and that if he could have voted by secret ballot, \u201cI would have returned a not guilty verdict on all three charges.\u201d",
      "\u201cI regret the verdict,\u201d that juror said. \u201cWithout the intimidation from other jurors, I believe that the jury would have hung on the Miriam Haley charge.\u201d",

The judge declared a mistrial on the final charge, alleging Weinstein raped former actor Jessica Mann, after the jury foreperson declined to deliberate further.",
      "It was the second time the Oscar-winning producer was tried on some of the charges. His 2020 conviction, a watershed moment for the # MeToo movement, was overturned last year. In addition to seeking to overturn his June conviction, Weinstein\u2019s lawyers are also fighting to avoid yet another retrial on the undecided count.",
      "Weinstein denies all of the charges. The first-degree criminal sex act conviction carries the potential for up to 25 years in prison, while the unresolved third-degree rape charge is punishable by up to four years \u2014 less than he already has served.",
      "The Oscar-winning producer has been behind bars since his initial conviction in 2020, and he later also was sentenced to prison in a separate California case, which he is appealing.",
      "Some of what the two jurors said in their affidavits echoed acrimony that spilled into public view during deliberations.",

      "Meghan Trainor will release her seventh studio album in April",
      "NEW YORK -- In the decade following her debut album, Meghan Trainor has lived myriad lives \u2014 but the message of her bright, cheery pop music has remained the same: Stay true to who you are and ignore the haters. That spirit endures on her lead single, the jovial \u201cStill Don't Care,\u201d the first tease of her forthcoming seventh full-length album, \u201cToy with Me,\u201d out April 24.",
      "And in true Trainor fashion, \u201cStill Don't Care\u201d was inspired by real life situations. \u201cI was seeing a lot of hate all over the world, but I was getting a lot of hate when I started posting more pictures of ... my fitness journey and my health journey. And I didn\u2019t really expect that,\u201d Trainor told The Associated Press. \u201cI would get really upset at comments and I was like, \u2018I wish I didn\u2019t feel like this. I wish I didn\u2019t give them so much power.\u2019",
      "\u201cAnd so, when I write songs, I always write in the perspective of how I wish I thought, like \u2018All About That Bass.\u2019 I didn\u2019t feel like that when I wrote it,\u201d she continued. \u201cAnd all my self-love anthems. But when I perform them and I see how it affects other people, I start believing them.\u201d",
      "\u201cStill Don't Care\u201d is yet another example, with its maximalist, \u201880s pop production and choir courtesy of Pentatonix\u2019s Scott Hoying. Her mom, brother and sister-in-law contribute background vocals on it as well \u2014 perhaps softening the song's gloves-up approach to combating online hate. \u201cYou could tear me apart,\u201d Trainor sings. \u201cBut I sleep well at night.\u201d",
      "It's the first taste of \u201cToy with Me,\u201d which Trainor teases will have a few self-love bops, songs to excise her anger through and lots of familial love. \u201cThe only features I have right now in this moment are my kids, Riley and Barry, because I wrote them a beautiful song, the only, like, slower song. It\u2019s called \u2018Little One' and it's about how I wish they could stay little forever,\u201d she said, smiling. \u201cWhen I play it, Riley goes, \u2018Oh, this is my song. Play my song!' It\u2019s literally my lullaby for them. And at the end of the song they say, \u2018I love you, Mama,\u2019 and it\u2019s just the cutest thing ever. And that\u2019s when everyone\u2019s crying.\u201d",
      "Trainor said she worked on the album for eight months. \u201cI exhausted myself, and I went a little too hard. I got excited to be home with the kids and work on my songs, but then I definitely, I overdid it, and my body started doing weird things, giving me signals. Like, my tongue started burning one day. And I was like, \u2018What\u2019s this?\u2019 And it wouldn\u2019t go away forever. And the dentist was like, \u2018Oh, you\u2019re stressed,\u2019\u201d she recalled.",
      "Songwriting, too, was a challenge. \u201cI usually write a song in one day and I\u2019m done with it, but each song on this album took, like, months to finish,\u201d she said. \u201cSo that was the only difference from this album than any other album I\u2019ve done.\u201d",

      "TOKYO -- TOKYO (AP) \u2014 \u201cLast Samurai Standing,\u201d a Netflix series launching on Thursday, is set in a Japan where the feudal samurai era is about to end.",
      "The hero, Saga Kokushu, played by Junichi Okada, is one of dozens of samurai in a live-or-die survival game to save family, community and honor. Participants receive wooden tags to wear and add another for each rival they kill. The last man standing collects 100 billion yen ($650 million).",
      "Directed by Michihito Fujii, whose credits include \u201cThe Journalist,\u201d about a fearless reporter, and \u201cA Family,\u201d depicting yakuza gangsters, the series pays homage to modern-day video games as well as the legacy of Japanese filmmakers like Akira Kurosawa and the original \u201cThe Last Samurai.\u201d",
      "That 2003 film, directed by Edward Zwick, starred Tom Cruise as the samurai hero. It was a big hit, including in Japan, and it helped Japan\u2019s own stars like Ken Watanabe and Hiroyuki Sanada in their Hollywood careers.",
      "\u201cThe purpose we had in mind was to update the jidaigeki,\u201d said Okada, using the Japanese term for the samurai drama genre.",
      "Okada, who also served as choreographer and producer in \u201cLast Samurai Standing,\u201d said everybody in Japanese film knew so much about the greats who had preceded them, like Kurosawa. The genre even came with a grandiose \u201ctextbook\u201d about the proper portrayal of Japanese culture.",
      "\u201cWe took the want-to approach, keeping in mind that, while thoroughly studying jidaigeki, we were going to do what we want to make, and make something that looked absolutely cool,\u201d Okada told The Associated Press.",
      "Okada is a black belt in Brazilian jujitsu. He has starred in various films including \u201cThe Eternal Zero,\u201d about World War II Zero pilots, directed by Takashi Yamazaki, of \u201cGodzilla Minus One.\u201d",
      "Okada previously worked with director Fujii in \u201cHard Days,\u201d a 2023 film about a police officer who tries to cover up a hit-and-run. Okada handpicked Fujii for \u201cLast Samurai Standing.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe wanted something more emotional, with more of a story, and more depth in character portrayal, more of a depiction of culture. That\u2019s what I kept in mind,\u201d Okada said.",

      "Billed as \u201cThe Great Melbourne Bagpipe Bash,\u201d the eclectic performance took place in Melbourne\u2019s Federation Square, on Swanston Street, which was the scene of the Australian hard rock band\u2019s 1976 film clip in which they played the hit on the back of a flatbed truck traveling slowly through downtown traffic with music blaring from speakers.",
      "Federation Square is also a short stroll from the Melbourne Cricket Ground where AC/DC is scheduled to play their first Australian gig in a decade on Wednesday. Guitarist Angus Young, 70, is the only band member who played on the truck and is performing on the latest Australian tour.",

      "The Monkey King, a beloved figure in Chinese mythology, is now the star of an opera",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- A rascally superhero born from a stone egg, the Monkey King is beloved in Chinese mythology, appearing in everything from a 16th century epic to modern comics, animated movies and video games \u2014 even in poetry by Mao Zedong.",
      "And now he\u2019s the star of an opera.",
      "\u201cThe Monkey King,\u201d with music by Huang Ruo and libretto by David Henry Hwang, has its world premiere at the San Francisco Opera on Friday with performances through Nov. 30.",
      "It\u2019s adapted from \u201cJourney to the West,\u201d a 100-chapter novel inspired by the true story of a 7th-century Chinese monk who traveled to India to find Buddhist sutras, or scriptures, and bring them back home.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s essentially an allegory of how Buddhism came to China,\u201d Hwang said.",
      "His libretto, in both English and Mandarin, is based on early chapters of the epic, portraying Monkey King\u2019s birth and daring exploits, as well as the arrogance and pride that lead him to be imprisoned for 500 years until he learns humility, compassion and discipline. At the end of the opera he is finally worthy of accompanying the monk on his journey.",
      "For Hwang, part of the Monkey King\u2019s appeal is the way he undercuts stereotypes.",
      "\u201cEveryone associates the Chinese persona with respect and deference and conformity,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd Monkey represents this whole other side that doesn\u2019t normally get expressed in terms of being individualistic, being rebellious, being egotistical.",
      "\u201cAlso given the fact that Monkey is rebelling against a corrupt administration, people can look at that however they want to see it.\u201d",
      "Mounting the opera is an ambitious undertaking for the company, which has a long track record of producing new work but faced unique challenges in bringing Monkey\u2019s fantastical adventures to life.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s flying on clouds, diving underwater, soaring to the heavens,\u201d director Diane Paulus said. \u201cI thought, oh, my gosh, how are we going to do this on the stage? How do we realize this and in what style?\u201d",
      "One answer was to collaborate with puppeteer Basil Twist, who designed the sets as well as puppets, making extensive use of his trademark silks.",
      "\u201cThe whole notion of the ephemeral and letting go of things and the power of transformation to me is beautifully expressed by silk that can become water that then disappears and becomes clouds, and then becomes a giant column,\u201d she said.",
      "Since Monkey King has to perform supernatural feats, engage in acrobatic fighting, shift his shape at will, and also \u2014 this is an opera, after all \u2014 perform arias accompanied by full orchestra, the creators represent him by three different figures: a singer, a puppet and a dancer.",
      "\u201cI call it the Holy Trinity of Monkey King,\u201d said Kang Wang, the Chinese-Australian tenor who sings the title role.",
      "While that spares Wang from having to perform backflips or other complicated dance moves, it doesn\u2019t mean he can stand up straight the whole time. Whenever he\u2019s not singing full out, he has to crouch in a semi-squat the way a character would who is half-monkey, half-man.",

But we also have Kung Fu fighting, operatic dance, and puppetry, and mixed media to convey this magical world.\u201d",
      "For Matthew Shilvock, the company\u2019s general director, the score is \u201cincredibly propulsive \u2026 but also lyrical.",

      "Shilvock is hopeful the opera will appeal to audiences across cultural lines.",
      "\u201cFor people who grew up with the Monkey King there\u2019s a huge sense of nostalgia about it, so it\u2019s tapping into something deep,\u201d he said. \u201cFor people who are getting to know it for the first time you\u2019re being introduced to this extraordinary piece of world literature\u2026 so there\u2019s a wonderful sense of discovery.\u201d",

      "BELEM, Brazil -- Going into United Nations climate negotiations, the Brazilian hosts weren\u2019t looking for big end-of-session pronouncements on lofty goals. This conference was supposed to hyperfocus on \u201cimplementation\u201d of past promises not yet kept.",
      "Throw that out the window.",
      "The urgency of climate change is causing some negotiators to push for more big-picture action \u2014 on weak plans to cut emissions of heat-trapping gases, on too little money to help nations wracked by climate change, on putting teeth into phasing out coal, oil and gas. Because of that pressure to do more \u2014 including from Brazil President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva \u2014 the diplomat chairing the talks said Saturday he'll consider a big-picture, end-of-negotiations communiqu\u00e9, sometimes known as a decision or cover text.",
      "\u201cI think things have changed, which is a very good thing,\u201d said veteran observer Jean Su of the Center for Biological Diversity. \u201cSo I think there\u2019s momentum that we will get some type of decision text, and our hope is that in particular there\u2019s going to be some commitment on phasing out fossil fuels.\u201d",
      "\u201cI would say that what\u2019s at stake now is probably higher than the last several COPs because you\u2019re looking at an ambition gap,\u2033 said former Philippine negotiator Jasper Inventor, international program director at Greenpeace International. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of expectation, there\u2019s a lot of excitement here, but there\u2019s also a lot of political signals that\u2019s been sent by President Lula.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re at the middle of the COP, and at the middle of COP is usually where the negotiators stare each other eye-to-eye. It\u2019s almost like a staring contest,\u201d Inventor said. \u201cBut next week, this is where the negotiations need to happen, where political decisions are made by the ministers.\u201d",
      "Because this process stems from the Paris climate Agreement, which is mostly voluntary, these end statements grab headlines and set global tone but have limited power. The last few COP end statements have made still-unfulfilled pledges for rich countries to give money to poor nations to cope with climate change and the world to phase out fossil fuels.",
      "Key among those issues is the idea of telling nations to go back to the drawing board on what experts consider inadequate climate-fighting plans submitted this year.",
      "In the 2015 Paris agreement, which is being celebrated here on its 10th anniversary, nations are supposed to have submitted climate-fighting, emissions-curbing plans every five years. So far 116 of 193 countries have filed theirs this year, but what they promised isn\u2019t much. United Nations and Climate Action Tracker, a group of scientists, calculates that these new pledges barely reduced future projections for Earth's warming.",
      "Even if the world does all it promises, Earth would be about seven-tenths of a degree Celsius (1.3 degrees Fahrenheit) above the Paris goal of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial times, the groups estimated.",
      "So small island nations, led by Palau, asked that this conference confront the gap between what\u2019s planned in national pledges and what\u2019s needed to keep the world from hitting the temperature danger zone.",
      "That's not on the agenda for these talks. Nor are specific details on how to fulfill last year\u2019s pledge by rich nations to provide $300 billion annually in climate financial aid.",
      "So when nations early on wanted to address these issues, COP President Andr\u00e9 Corr\u00eaa do Lago, a veteran Brazilian diplomat, set up special small confabs to try to decide if the controversial topics should be discussed.",
      "On Saturday, the conference punted the issue to the incoming ministers.",
      "\u201cThe parties will decide how they want to proceed,\u201d do Lago said at a Saturday evening news conference. Given what countries are saying and past history that usually means a final end-of-COP message to the world, several experts said.",
      "In a casual exchange with a reporter about how the conference is going, COP President do Lago said: \u201cEh, could be better but not as bad it could be.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- Lawyers representing OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma, branches of the Sackler family that own it, cities, states, counties, Native American tribes, people with addiction and others across the U.S. are expected to deliver a nearly unanimous message for a bankruptcy court judge Friday: Approve a plan to settle thousands of opioid-related lawsuits against the company.",
      "If U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Sean Lane abides, it will close a long chapter \u2014 and maybe the entire book \u2014 on a legal odyssey over efforts to hold the company to account for its role in an opioid crisis connected to 900,000 deaths in the U.S. since 1999, including deaths from heroin and illicit fentanyl.",
      "Closing arguments were expected Friday in the third day of a hearing over a bankruptcy plan for the company, which filed for protection six years ago as it faced lawsuits with claims that grew to trillions of dollars.",
      "The saga has been emotional and full of contentious arguments between the many groups that took Purdue to court, often exposing a possible mismatch between the quest for justice and the practical role of bankruptcy court.",
      "The U.S. Supreme Court rejected a previous deal because it said it was improper for Sackler family members to receive immunity from lawsuits over opioids. In the new arrangement, entities who don't opt into the settlement can sue them. Family members are collectively worth billions, but much of their assets are held in trusts in offshore accounts that would be hard to access through lawsuits.",
      "This time, the government groups involved have reached an even fuller consensus and there's been mostly subdued opposition from individuals. Out of more than 54,000 personal injury victims who voted on whether the plan should be accepted. just 218 said no. A larger number of people who are part of that group didn't vote.",
      "A handful of objectors spoke Thursday at the hearing, sometimes interrupting the judge. Some said that only the victims, not the states and other government entities, should receive the funds in the settlement. Others wanted the judge to find the members of the Sackler family criminally liable \u2014 something Lane said is beyond the scope of the bankruptcy court, but that the settlement doesn't bar prosecutors from pursuing.",

      "The company would get a name change and new overseers who would dedicate future profits to battling the opioid crisis.",

      "Unlike the other major opioid settlements, individuals harmed by Purdue\u2019s products would be in line for some money as part of the settlement. About $850 million would be set aside for them, with more than $100 million of that amount carved out to help children born dealing with opioid withdrawal.",
      "About 139,000 people have active claims for the money. Many of them, however, have not shown proof that they were prescribed Purdue\u2019s opioids and will receive nothing. Lawyers expect that those who had prescriptions for at least six months would receive about $16,000 each and those who had them more briefly would get around $8,000.

      "Vice President JD Vance has praised Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for questioning established science and embracing nontraditional voices in health care",
      "WASHINGTON -- Vice President JD Vance on Wednesday praised Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\u2019s willingness to question established science and embrace nontraditional voices in the health care space, saying that often throughout history, \u201call the experts were wrong.\u201d",
      "In remarks in a fireside chat between the two men at a \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d summit in the nation's capital, Vance also propped up Kennedy\u2019s MAHA movement, saying it has been \u201ca critical part of our success in Washington.\u201d",
      "Vance\u2019s words show how Kennedy, whose wrecking-ball approach to public health agencies and longstanding vaccine skepticism have made him a polarizing figure among the public and in Congress, has been embraced by the White House as a needed force for change.",
      "\u201cOf all the specific initiatives that you guys have worked on effectively, the most important thing is that your team is willing to ask questions that people in government haven't been asking in a long time,\u201d Vance told Kennedy onstage.",
      "The Vance-Kennedy event was livestreamed, but the summit was otherwise off limits to the press.",
      "Even as President Donald Trump and Kennedy have disagreed on issues from COVID-19 vaccines to abortion, the White House this year has largely left Kennedy alone as he has made sweeping changes to the agencies he leads, including laying off thousands of workers, firing science advisers and remaking vaccine guidelines.",
      "The Trump administration has touted Kennedy's efforts to phase out artificial dyes in foods, wage war on ultra-processed foods and update the national dietary guidelines. As health secretary, he has said he wants to find the root causes of chronic disease and help Americans reduce their exposure to toxins.",
      "Critics, including some of the country's leading medical associations, say that Kennedy\u2019s disregard for established science is fomenting public distrust in mainstream medicine and that his views, once considered fringe, are being amplified from his perch as health secretary.",
      "\u201cThis closed-door convention is nothing more than an ego-stroking symposium of \u2018wellbeing influencers\u2019 and \u2018MAHA moms\u2019 whose rejection of scientific expertise puts our public health at risk,\u201d said Erik Polyak, executive director of the progressive political action committee 314 Action, which works to elect Democratic scientists to office.",
      "Kennedy and his allies dispute that their agenda is anti-science.",
      "Vance nodded to the fact that many in Kennedy\u2019s network don\u2019t come from conventional medical circles, and some have more experience in business than in health. In fact, many of the health secretary's close allies and new hires have outright rejected medical consensus on topics including vaccines and how to heal chronic disease.",

      "Tuberculosis is caused by bacteria that attack the lungs, and is spread through the air when an infectious person coughs or sneezes. Roughly a quarter of the global population is estimated to have TB, but only a fraction develop symptoms. It can be fatal if not treated, and is one of the top causes of death worldwide.",

      "The signing ceremony came just hours after the House passed the measure on a mostly party-line vote of 222-209. The Senate had already passed the measure Monday.",
      "Democrats wanted to extend an enhanced tax credit expiring at the end of the year that lowers the cost of health coverage obtained through Affordable Care Act marketplaces. They refused to go along with a short-term spending bill that did not include that priority. But Republicans said that was a separate policy fight to be held at another time.",
      "\u201cWe told you 43 days ago from bitter experience that government shutdowns don\u2019t work,\u201d said Rep.

Johnson sent lawmakers home after that vote and put the onus on the Senate to act, saying House Republicans had done their job.",
      "The legislation is the result of a deal reached by eight senators who broke ranks with the Democrats after reaching the conclusion that Republicans would not bend on using a government funding to bill to extend the health care tax credits.",
      "The compromise funds three annual spending bills and extends the rest of government funding through Jan. 30. Republicans promised to hold a vote by mid-December to extend the health care subsidies, but there is no guarantee of success.",
      "The bill includes a reversal of the firing of federal workers by the Trump administration since the shutdown began. It also protects federal workers against further layoffs through January and guarantees they are paid once the shutdown is over. The bill for the Agriculture Department means people who rely on key food assistance programs will see those benefits funded without threat of interruption through the rest of the budget year.",

      "The agreement includes bipartisan bills worked out by the Senate Appropriations Committee to fund parts of government \u2014 food aid, veterans programs and the legislative branch, among other things. All other funding would be extended until the end of January, giving lawmakers more than two months to finish additional spending bills.",
      "Here's a look at how the shutdown started and is likely to end:",
      "Democrats made several demands to win their support for a short-term funding bill, but the central one was an extension of an enhanced tax credit that lowers the cost of health coverage obtained through Affordable Care Act marketplaces.",
      "The tax credit was boosted during the COVID-19 pandemic response, again through President Joe Biden's big energy and health care bill, and it's set to expire at the end of December. Without it, premiums on average will more than double for millions of Americans. More than 2 million people would lose health insurance coverage altogether next year, the Congressional Budget Office projected.",

      "\u201cRepublicans are ready to sit down with Democrats just as soon as they stop holding the government hostage to their partisan demands,\u201d Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said.",
      "Thune eventually promised Democrats a December vote on the tax credit extension to help resolve the standoff, but many Democrats demanded a guaranteed fix, not just a vote that is likely to fail.",
      "Thune's position was much the same as the one Schumer took back in October 2013, when Republicans unsuccessfully sought to roll back parts of the Affordable Care Act in exchange for funding the government. \u201cOpen up all of the government, and then we can have a fruitful discussion,\u201d Schumer said then.",
      "The first year of President Donald Trump's second term has seen more than 200,000 federal workers leave their job through firings, forced relocations or the Republican administration's deferred resignation program, according to the Partnership for Public Service. Whole agencies that don't align with the administration's priorities have been dismantled. And billions of dollars previously approved by Congress have been frozen or canceled.",
      "Democrats have had to rely on the courts to block some of Trump's efforts, but they have been unable to do it through legislation. They were also powerless to stop Trump's big tax cut and immigration crackdown bill that Republicans helped pay for by cutting future spending on safety net programs such as Medicaid and SNAP, formerly known as food stamps.",
      "The Democrats' struggles to blunt the Trump administration's priorities has prompted calls for the party's congressional leadership to take a more forceful response.",
      "Schumer experienced that firsthand after announcing in March that he would support moving ahead with a funding bill for the 2025 budget year. There was a protest at his office, calls from progressives that he be primaried in 2028 and suggestions that the Democratic Party would soon be looking for new leaders.",

      "But those negotiations did not occur, at least not with Schumer. Republicans instead worked with a small group of eight Democrats to tee up a short-term bill to fund the government generally at current levels and accused Schumer of catering to the party's left flank when he refused to go along.",

      "At least three-quarters of Americans believe each deserves at least a \u201cmoderate\u201d share of blame, underscoring that no one was successfully evading responsibility.",
      "Both parties looked to the Nov. 4 elections in Virginia, New Jersey and elsewhere for signs of how the shutdown was influencing public opinion. Democrats took comfort in their overwhelming successes. Trump called it a \u201cbig factor, negative\" for Republicans. But it did not change the GOP's stance on negotiating. Instead, Trump ramped up calls for Republicans to end the filibuster in the Senate, which would pretty much eliminate the need for the majority party to ever negotiate with the minority.",
      "The Congressional Budget Office says that the negative impact on the economy will be mostly recovered once the shutdown ends, but not entirely. It estimated the permanent economic loss at about $11 billion for a six-week shutdown.",
      "Beyond the numbers, though, the shutdown created a cascade of troubles for many Americans. Federal workers missed paychecks, causing financial and emotional stress. Travelers had their flights delayed and at times canceled. People who rely on safety net programs such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program saw their benefits stopped, and Americans throughout the country lined up for meals at food banks.",

      "ByHeart officials expanded the voluntary recall from two lots announced Saturday to all products in consumers' homes and in stores. That includes ByHeart Whole Nutrition Infant Formula and Anywhere Pack pouches of powdered formula.

      "Canada is no longer measles-free because of ongoing outbreaks, international health experts said Monday, as childhood vaccination rates fall and the highly contagious virus spreads across North and South America.",
      "The loss of the country\u2019s measles elimination status comes more than a year after the highly contagious virus started spreading.",
      "Canada has logged 5,138 measles cases this year and two deaths. Both were babies who were exposed to the measles virus in the womb and born prematurely.",
      "Measles elimination is a symbolic designation, but it represents a hard-won battle against the infectious disease. It is earned when a country shows it stopped continuous spread of the virus within local communities, though occasional cases might still pop up from travel.",
      "Measles typically begins with a high fever followed by a telltale rash that starts on the face and neck. Most people recover, but it\u2019s one of the leading causes of death among young children, according to the World Health Organization. Serious complications, including blindness and swelling of the brain, are more common in young children and adults over age 30.",
      "It is prevented by a vaccine administered routinely and safely to children around the world.",
      "\u201cIt's a deeply disheartening development. It's a deeply worrisome development. And, frankly, it's an embarrassing development,\" said Jennifer Nuzzo, a Brown University infectious disease expert. \u201cNo country with the amount of resources of Canada \u2014 or other countries in North America even \u2014 should lose their measles elimination status.\u201d",
      "Canada eliminated measles in 1998, followed by the United States two years later. After hugely successful vaccination campaigns, the Americas became the first region in the world to be free of measles in 2016. Health officials estimate the measles vaccine prevented 6.2 millions deaths in the Americas between 2000 and 2023.",
      "But vaccination rates have since slipped below the 95% coverage rate needed to stop outbreaks. Large outbreaks in Venezuela and Brazil in 2018 and 2019 cost the region its elimination status. It was reclaimed in 2024, but ends again with Canada\u2019s loss.",
      "Experts from the Pan American Health Organization, an independent health agency, made the determination after analyzing data on Canada\u2019s outbreaks that showed the virus has spread continuously for a year.",
      "It has never been easy to stop measles from circulating in local communities, Dr. Jarbas Barbosa, director of the Pan American Health Organization, said in a briefing Monday.",
      "\u201cAs a region, we have eliminated measles twice,\u201d Barbosa said. \u201cWe can do it a third time.\u201d",
      "In a statement, Canadian health officials said they were working with government and community partners to improve vaccination coverage, share data and provide evidence-based guidance.",
      "The virus is one of the most contagious known to medicine. One infected person can spread it to up to 9 out of 10 unprotected people they come into close contact with. Health experts say, by far, the best prevention against measles is the vaccine, which provides 97% protection after two doses.",
      "Barbosa's organization has confirmed nearly 12,600 cases this year across 10 countries, a 30-fold increase from 2024. The vast majority are in Canada, the U.S. and Mexico, but Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay, and Belize also have active outbreaks.",
      "In 2024, the region had a 79% vaccination rate, an increase from years past but still too low, he said.",

She is also helping care for her infant granddaughter, who has food allergies, and her 80-year-old mother.",

      "Trump\u2019s administration initially said SNAP benefits would not be available in November because of the shutdown. After some states and nonprofit groups sued, judges in Massachusetts and Rhode Island ruled the administration could not skip November\u2019s benefits entirely.",
      "The administration then said it would use an emergency reserve fund to provide 65% of the maximum monthly benefit. On Thursday, Rhode Island-based U.S. District Judge John J. McConnell said that wasn\u2019t good enough, and ordered full funding for SNAP benefits by Friday.",
      "Some states acted quickly to direct their EBT vendors to disburse full monthly benefits to SNAP recipients. Millions of people in at least a dozen states \u2014 all with Democratic governors \u2014 received the full amount to buy groceries before Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson put McConnell\u2019s order on hold Friday night, pending further deliberation by an appeals court.",

      "He said the parties agreed to activate prisoner exchange agreements brokered in Istanbul to release 1,200 Ukrainians. Moscow did not immediately comment.",
      "The Istanbul agreements refer to prisoner-exchange protocols established with Turkish mediation in 2022 that set rules for large, coordinated swaps. Since then, Russia and Ukraine have traded thousands of prisoners, though exchanges have been sporadic.",
      "Umerov said technical consultations would be held soon to finalize procedural and organizational details, expressing hope that returning Ukrainians could \u201ccelebrate the New Year and Christmas holidays at home \u2014 at the family table and next to their relatives.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "President Alexander Stubb of Finland told The Associated Press that a ceasefire in Ukraine is unlikely before spring",
      "HALVALA, Finland -- A ceasefire in Ukraine is unlikely before the spring and European allies need to keep up support despite a corruption scandal which has engulfed Kyiv, President Alexander Stubb of Finland told The Associated Press.",
      "Europe, meanwhile will require \u2018\u2019sisu\u2019\u2019 \u2013 a Finnish word meaning endurance, resilience and grit \u2014 to get through the winter months, he said, as Russia continues its hybrid attacks and information war across the continent.",
      "Stubb also needs that quality as one of the key European interlocutors between U.S. President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. As the leader of one of Europe's smaller countries, but one that shares a 1,340-kilometer (830-mile) border with Russia, he is well aware of what's at stake.",
      "In the 1940s, after two wars with Russia, Finland lost about 10% of its territory to Moscow and agreed to become militarily neutral, a stance only reversed after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, when the Finns joined NATO. Stubb leverages his good relationship with Trump \u2014 the two men have played golf together and speak regularly \u2014 to argue the case for Ukraine.",
      "\u201cI can explain to President Trump what Finland went through or how I see the situation on the battlefield, or how do you deal with (Russian President Vladimir) Putin? And then, you know, if he accepts one out of 10 ideas, that\u2019s good,\u201d he said.",
      "Stubb spoke to AP Saturday at a military base north of the capital Helsinki where he observed Finnish volunteers take part in defense training. Wearing a jacket with the word \u201csisu\u201d emblazoned across the back, he watched as volunteers practiced evacuating wounded soldiers from a conflict zone in freezing temperatures.",
      "Stubb told AP that Zelenskyy must deal quickly with allegations of kickbacks and embezzlement, saying the scandal plays into the hands of Russia. Nonetheless, he urged European leaders to look at boosting financial and military support for Kyiv which is also facing creeping gains by Russia on the battlefield.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not very optimistic about achieving a ceasefire or the beginning of peace negotiations, at least this year,\u201d Stubb said, adding it would be good to \u201cget something going\u201d by March.",
      "The three big questions on the road to a ceasefire are security guarantees for Ukraine, rebuilding its economy and coming to some sort of understanding about territorial claims, he said.",
      "To bring peace to Ukraine, Stubb said, Trump and European leaders need to maximize pressure on Russia and on Putin in order to change his strategic thinking. Putin \"basically wants to deny the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine,\" aims that have not altered since the war began nearly four years ago, Stubb said.",
      "To do this, he suggested using tools such as the hundreds of billions of dollars in frozen Russian assets held in Europe as collateral to fund Ukraine, as well as increasing military pressure on Moscow.",
      "Stubb praised Trump for sanctioning the major Russian energy companies Lukoil and Rosneft in October, saying he did \u201can excellent job,\u201d but argued more must be done to give Ukraine the capacity to hit Russia\u2019s \u201cmilitary or defense industry.\"",
      "Last month Trump denied a Ukrainian request for long-range Tomahawk missiles which would theoretically allow Ukraine to strike deeper into Russia \u2013 although Kyiv does not currently have any launchers or platforms from which to fire them.",
      "Ukraine is still negotiating with the U.S. for more firepower, Stubb indicated.",
      "In mid-October the White House announced Trump would meet Putin in Budapest before abruptly canceling the meeting less than a week later.",
      "The decision came after a call between Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov where Rubio probably realized that \u201cthe Russians haven\u2019t moved an inch,\u201d Stubb said, and there was \u201cno point in taking President Trump into a situation whereby he doesn\u2019t get a deal or anything.\u201d",

      "The cancellation was \u201canother example of a strategic mistake by the Russians. They had an opportunity and they blew it,\u201d Stubb said.",
      "Trump has swung back and forth between seeking rapprochement with Putin and applying pressure to him, and has done the same with Zelenskyy. Stubb said he deals with any shifts by being \u201cquite patient\u201d and living with \u201creality.\u201d",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s been a bit of a grind. I guess you need \u2018sisu\u2019 in these types of negotiations as well.\"",
      "But, he said, the work is paying off and the military options for guaranteeing Ukraine\u2019s security once a ceasefire or peace negotiation is reached are now \u201cclear,\u201d with various countries having committed resources \u2014 although he declined to give more details, citing confidential military planning.",
      "Despite some of Ukraine's missteps, Stubb is unstinting in his praise for Zelenskyy. \u201cI admire a lot of the things that he\u2019s doing because to lead a country in a war ... is existential. You learn a lot from other human beings in that situation,\u201d he said.",
      "When it comes to dealing with Donald Trump, Stubb is in a better position than many European leaders. In his youth, he studied in the United States on a golf scholarship, and in March the two spent about seven hours playing a round at Mar-a-Lago.",
      "Golf was a \u201cdoor-opener,\u201d and helped him create a bond with the U.S. president, he suggested. While Trump and Zelenskyy have a notoriously tempestuous relationship, Stubb said he and other European leaders can help act as a bridge between them.",
      "\u201cWe interpret President Trump to President Zelenskyy and vice versa,\u201d he said.",
      "But when it comes to Putin, only one person should negotiate directly and publicly with him and that\u2019s Trump, Stubb indicated, suggesting the European Union is unlikely to open a direct channel of communication with the Russian leader any time soon.",
      "At the same time Trump is leading negotiations with Putin, multiple European countries have faced incursions from Russian drones \u2014 suspected or confirmed \u2014 as well as fighter jets and an alleged widespread Russian sabotage campaign.",
      "Russia is not only conducting a kinetic war in Ukraine but also a hybrid war in Europe, Stubb told AP.",
      "\u201cThe line between war and peace has been blurred,\u201d Stubb said",
      "Russia, he said, is trying to destabilize Europe and \u201ccause havoc and panic,\u201d with attacks including arson, vandalism and propaganda.",
      "The way to deal with those threats is to \u201cbe Finnish,\u201d Stubb said.",

      "DUKOVANY NUCLEAR PLANT, Czech Republic -- The eight huge cooling towers of the Dukovany power plant overlook a construction site for two more reactors as the Czech Republic pushes ahead with plans to expand its reliance on nuclear energy.",
      "Mobile drilling rigs have been extracting samples 140 meters below ground for a geological survey to make sure the site is suitable for a $19 billion project as part of the expansion that should eventually at least double the country\u2019s nuclear output and cement its place among Europe\u2019s most nuclear-dependent nations.",
      "South Korea\u2019s KHNP beat France\u2019s EDF in a tender to construct a new plant whose two reactors will have an output of over 1,000 megawatts each. After becoming operational in the second half 2030s, they will complement Dukovany\u2019s four 512-MW reactors that date from the 1980s.",

      "The Czech expansion comes at a time when surging energy demand and looming deadlines by countries and companies to sharply cut carbon pollution are helping to revive interest in nuclear technology. While nuclear power does produce waste, it does not produce greenhouse gas emissions, like carbon dioxide, the main driver of climate change.",
      "The European Union has accepted nuclear by including it in the classification system for environmentally sustainable economic activities, opening the door to financing. That has been a boost for the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and France \u2014 the continent\u2019s nuclear leader \u2014 that have heavily relied on nuclear.",
      "Belgium and Sweden recently scrapped plans to phase out nuclear power. Denmark and Italy are reconsidering its use, while Poland is set to join a club of 12 nuclear-friendly nations in the European Union after signing a deal with U.S.-based Westinghouse to build three nuclear units.",
      "The EU generated 24% of nuclear electricity in 2024.",
      "Britain signed a cooperation deal with the United States in September that Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said would lead to \u201ca golden age of nuclear in this country.\u201d It will also invest 14.2 billion pounds ($19 billion) to build the Sizewell C nuclear power plant, the first in the U.K. since 1995.",

      "Chile is holding an election that is expected to steer the South American nation to the right, with fears over crime and migration dominating the race",
      "SANTIAGO, Chile -- Chile votes for its next president and parliament on Sunday in a contest expected to favor the right as candidates play on popular fears over organized crime and immigration.",
      "It\u2019s the first of what\u2019s likely to be two rounds of presidential elections in the South American country, as polls show none of the candidates clearing the 50% threshold needed to avoid a runoff scheduled for Dec. 14.",
      "On the surface, Sunday\u2019s election offers Chileans a dramatic choice between two extremes: Jeannette Jara, 51, a card-carrying communist and former labor minister in the left-wing government, and, among other right-wing contenders, Jos\u00e9 Antonio Kast, 59, an ultraconservative lawyer and former lawmaker who opposes abortion and vows to shrink the state.",
      "But with voters anxious about a rise in gang-driven crime that they blame on a recent surge of illegal immigration from crisis-stricken Venezuela, the campaign has steered the starkly opposed front-runners toward the shared theme of public insecurity.",
      "In a feat of political gymnastics, the communist candidate has promoted fiscal restraint and the Catholic father of nine has avoided talk of traditional family values.",
      "Both say it's a top priority to fight foreign gangs, like Venezuela\u2019s Tren de Aragua, whose recent push into Chile has fueled kidnappings, extortion and sex trafficking and shattered the country's self-perception as far safer and more stable than the rest of the region.",
      "\u201cThey're talking about things that all voters care about, they're vying for the center,\u201d said Rodolfo Disi, a political scientist at Chile's Adolfo Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez University.",
      "Polling behind Jara and Kast in the eight-candidate field are Johannes Kaiser, 49, a radical libertarian congressman and YouTuber, and Evelyn Matthei, 72, a veteran center-right politician.",
      "With the right-wing vote divided and President Gabriel Boric\u2019s center-left coalition united behind its former minister, most experts see the charismatic Jara prevailing in Sunday\u2019s first round. Boric is constitutionally barred from seeking a consecutive term.",
      "But an initial win for Jara may yet spell her defeat in a runoff against a right-wing rival who promises a harsher security crackdown.",
      "\u201cIf (Jara) moves toward being tougher on crime, the right can always be tougher,\u201d said Disi. \u201cIt's a losing game.\u201d",
      "This is the first time in Chile's history that all eligible citizens will be obliged to vote for president.",
      "The country recently reintroduced mandatory voting after ending the practice in 2012. Voter registration is now automatic, so the millions of people who never bothered to register, even when voting was compulsory, will be casting their first ballots in a presidential race. Those who fail to do so face fines up to $100.",
      "Analysts are divided over the potential effects.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a huge question,\u201d said Robert Funk, an associate professor of political science at the University of Chile. \u201cWe have 4 million new voters. Who are they? Are they young people who like Jara? Are they people from marginal neighborhoods attracted to Kast's hard-line stance on crime?\u201d",

      "Taking a page from the playbook of President Javier Milei in neighboring Argentina, Kast vows to shrink the public payroll and slash corporate taxes in a bid to revive a stagnant economy that has slowed the pace of job creation as immigrants flood the labor market.",
      "He says he'll cut more than $6 billion in spending over 18 months \u2014 something his conservative rival Matthei, an economist by training, has called \u201ctotally and absolutely impossible.\u201d She proposes a more gradual fiscal adjustment over four years.",

      "Russia's economy has slowed after two years of robust growth fueled by the war in Ukraine",
      "After two years of robust growth fueled by military spending on the war in Ukraine, Russia\u2019s economy is slowing. Oil revenues are down, the budget deficit is up and defense spending has leveled off.",
      "The Kremlin needs money to keep its finances steady \u2014 and it\u2019s clear where President Vladimir Putin intends to get it: at the cash register, from ordinary people and small businesses.",
      "An increase in value-added tax to 22% from 20% is expected to add as much as 1 trillion rubles, or about $12.3 billion, to the state budget. The increase is contained in legislation already making its way through Russia\u2019s compliant parliament and would take effect from Jan. 1.",
      "On top of the rate increase, the legislation lowers the threshold for requiring businesses to collect VAT to a mere 10 million rubles (about $123,000) in annual sales revenue, in stages by 2028. That's down from 60 million rubles, or $739,000. That change is aimed in part at tax avoidance schemes in which companies split their operations to skirt the threshold.",
      "But it also will hit previously exempt businesses like corner convenience stores and beauty salons.",
      "The government also has proposed increasing taxes on spirits, wine, beer, cigarettes and vapes. For instance, the tax on stronger spirits such as vodka would go up by 84 rubles per liter of pure alcohol, which works out to 17 rubles or about 20 U.S. cents for a half-liter bottle, or about 5% of the minimum price of 349 rubles ($4.31). Fees for renewing driver's licenses or getting an international license also are going up, and a key tax break on imported cars is being axed. The government is weighing a tech tax on digital equipment including smartphones and notebooks of up to 5,000 rubles ($61.50) for the highest priced items, the Kommersant news site reported.",
      "The economic slowdown and tax increases are signs that Putin and ordinary Russians will face harder choices in the months ahead between guns and butter \u2014 that is, between military spending and consumer welfare after 3 1/2 years of war against Ukraine.",
      "Muscovites interviewed on a main street in the Russian capital by The Associated Press expressed dismay mingled with resignation, saying the higher food prices would be widely felt, especially in poorer regions and among those with low incomes.",
      "Pensioner Svetlana Martynova said making small businesses collect VAT would backfire.",
      "\u201cI think that small and medium businesses will fold,\" she said. \"The budget will get less, not more.\u201d",
      "The VAT increase comes on top of changes in the recycling fee paid for registering cars, a step that mostly hits high-priced imports. From Dec. 1 individuals can no longer get a concessionary rate of 3,400 rubles ($42) on cars with more than 160 horsepower, but must pay the commercial rate, which can be hundreds of thousands of rubles, or thousands of dollars, per car.",
      "The step, however, was unlikely to boost investment in domestic manufacturing, given high central bank interest rates and the smaller size of the Russian market compared with neighboring China, now the source of most imported cars. That\u2019s according to Andrei Olkhovsky, general director of Avtodom, a major auto dealer group.",

Growth has suffered from high central bank interest rates, currently at 16.5%, aimed at controlling inflation of 8% fueled by massive military spending. Oil revenues are down about 20% this year mainly due to lower global prices, according to the Kyiv School of Economics Institute. Western sanctions imposed over the war against Ukraine have been an ongoing drag on growth by increasing costs and deterring investment that could expand the economy\u2019s productive capacity.",
      "As a result, this year\u2019s budget deficit has been revised upward from 0.5% to 2.6%, up from 1.7% last year. That doesn't seem huge in comparison with other countries \u2014 but unlike them, Russia can't borrow on international bond markets and must rely on domestic banks for credit.",
      "Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said raising revenue was preferable to increasing borrowing, saying excessive borrowing \u201cwould lead to a speeding up of inflation, and as a result, to an increase in the key rate\u201d from the central bank that would hurt investment and growth.",
      "The VAT increase could boost inflation at first as merchants change their price lists. But over the longer term, it could lower price pressures by dampening demand for goods \u2014 and help the central bank in its battle to keep inflation in check.",
      "The tax and fee increases are a step back from Russia\u2019s wartime economy of the two previous years that put more money in people's pockets. Then-higher prices for oil exports filled state coffers, while vast increases in military spending boosted hiring, and paychecks for factory workers kept pace with inflation. Along with that, military recruitment and death bonuses pumped cash into poorer regions.",

      "After that, she said, \"he will need to make tough choices, trade-offs between maintaining military effort or, for example, maintaining consumer abundance so people won\u2019t feel 100% that the war is going on.\u201d",

      "The Vatican has returned 62 artifacts to Indigenous peoples from Canada",
      "VATICAN CITY -- The Vatican on Saturday returned 62 artifacts to Indigenous peoples from Canada as part of the Catholic Church\u2019s reckoning with its role in helping suppress Indigenous culture in the Americas.",
      "Pope Leo XIV gave the artifacts, including an iconic Inuit kayak, and supporting documentation to a delegation of the Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops during an audience. According to a joint statement from the Vatican and Canadian church, the pieces were a gift and a \u201cconcrete sign of dialogue, respect and fraternity.\u201d",
      "The items were part of the Vatican Museum\u2019s ethnographic collection, known as the Anima Mundi museum. The collection has been a source of controversy for the Vatican amid the broader museum debate over the restitution of cultural goods taken from Indigenous peoples during colonial periods.",
      "Most of the items in the Vatican collection were sent to Rome by Catholic missionaries for a 1925 exhibition in the Vatican gardens that was a highlight of that year\u2019s Holy Year.",
      "The Vatican insists the items were \u201cgifts\u201d to Pope Pius XI, who wanted to celebrate the church\u2019s global reach, its missionaries and the lives of the Indigenous peoples they evangelized.",
      "But historians, Indigenous groups and experts have long questioned whether the items could really have been offered freely, given the power imbalances at play in Catholic missions at the time. In those years, Catholic religious orders were helping to enforce the Canadian government\u2019s forced assimilation policy of eliminating Indigenous traditions, which Canada\u2019s Truth and Reconciliation Commission has called \u201ccultural genocide.\u201d",
      "Part of that policy included confiscating items used in Indigenous spiritual and traditional rituals, such as the 1885 potlatch ban that prohibited the integral First Nations ceremony. Those confiscated items ended up in museums in Canada, the U.S. and Europe, as well as private collections.",
      "Negotiations on returning the Vatican items accelerated after Pope Francis in 2022 met with Indigenous leaders who had traveled to the Vatican to receive his apology for the church\u2019s role in running Canada\u2019s disastrous residential schools. During their visit, they were shown some objects in the collection, including an Inuit kayak, wampum belts, war clubs and masks, and asked for them to be returned.",
      "Francis later said he was in favor of returning the items and others in the Vatican collection on a case-by-case basis, saying: \u201cIn the case where you can return things, where it\u2019s necessary to make a gesture, better to do it.\u201d",
      "The Vatican said Saturday the items were given back during the Holy Year, exactly 100 years after the 1925 exhibition where they were first exhibited in Rome.",
      "\u201cThis is an act of ecclesial sharing, with which the Successor of Peter entrusts to the Church in Canada these artifacts, which bear witness to the history of the encounter between faith and the cultures of the Indigenous peoples,\u201d said the joint statement from the Vatican and Canadian church.",

      "The U.S. Commerce Department has launched an antidumping review targeting Italian pasta, claiming it\u2019s sold below market prices",
      "PHILADELPHIA -- Steel: 50%. Copper: 50%. Cars: up to 25%. But an even bigger Trump-era levy looms: 107 % on Italian pasta.",
      "Mamma mia.",
      "It started with the U.S. Commerce Department launching what it says was a routine antidumping review, based on allegations Italian pasta makers sold product into the US at below-market prices and undercut local competitors. That has led to a threat of 92% duties, which would come on top of the 15% tariff President Donald Trump\u2019s administration imposed on European exports generally.",
      "The news sent shockwaves through Italy, where 13 producers would be subject to the whopping one-two punch. They say sales in their second biggest export market would shrivel if prices to American consumers more than double. And while the measure would hardly prompt pasta shortages, it still has perplexed importers like Sal Auriemma, whose shop in Philadelphia\u2019s Italian market, Claudio Specialty Food, has been operating for over 60 years.",
      "\u201cPasta is a pretty small sector to pick on. I mean, there\u2019s a lot bigger things to pick on,\" said Auriemma, pointing to luxury items as an alternative.",
      "But pasta? \u201cIt\u2019s basic food,\u201d he said. \"Something\u2019s got to be sacred.\u201d",
      "Italy is a nation of avid pasta eaters. Less known is that most of the tortellini, spaghetti and rigatoni its factories churn out gets sent abroad. The U.S. accounts for about 15% of its \u20ac4 billion ($4.65 billion) in exports, making it Italy\u2019s largest market after Germany, data from farmers\u2019 association Coldiretti show.",
      "The punitive pasta premium has become a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre for Italy\u2019s politicians, executives and economists. Agriculture Minister Francesco Lollobrigida told lawmakers in mid-October that the government was working with the European Commission and engaging in diplomatic efforts, while supporting the companies\u2019 legal actions to oppose U.S. sanctions.",
      "EU Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic addressed reporters in Rome last month, stressing the lack of evidence backing the U.S. decision and calling the combined 107% levy \u201cunacceptable.\u201d",
      "Margherita Mastromauro, president of the pasta makers sector of Unione Italiana Food, told The Associated Press that prices for Italian pasta in the U.S. remain high, and certainly higher than American-made rivals \u2014 undermining any dumping claim.",
      "She said that the measures could deal a fatal blow to small- and medium-sized producers. Lucio Miranda, president of consultancy group Export USA, agreed.",
      "\u201cA duty rate of 107% would definitely kill this flow of export,\u201d Miranda, who is Italian, said by phone from New York. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be something that you can just dump on the consumer and move on, life continues. It will definitely be a deal killer.\u201d",
      "The Commerce Department\u2019s investigation started in 2024 after complaints from Missouri-based 8th Avenue Food & Provisions, which owns pasta brand Ronzoni, and Illinois-based Winland Foods, whose multiple brands include Prince, Mueller\u2019s and Wacky Mac.",
      "The office\u2019s review focused on La Molisana and Garofalo, chosen as primary respondents because they are Italy\u2019s two largest exporters, the Commerce Department said in an emailed statement. Any sale price below either producers\u2019 costs or the price they charge in the Italian market would be considered dumping, in line with numerous other reviews of Italian pasta since 1996, it said.",

      "La Molisana declined to comment when contacted by the AP. Garofalo didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.",
      "The sanctions would be applied not just to imports going forward, but also the 12 months through June 2024, according to the Commerce Department. It added that only 16% of total Italian pasta imports may be affected. Its final decision is scheduled for Jan. 2, which could be extended by 60 days.",

      "\u201cThese tariffs are completely senseless,\u201d Rummo said in a phone interview. \u201cThese are fast-moving consumer goods \u2026 Who would ever buy a pack of pasta that costs 10 dollars, the same price as a bottle of wine?\u201d",
      "He added that he has no intention to start producing pasta stateside, as some companies have done and so would be spared the prospective levy. That includes Barilla, which for decades has been the main Italian pasta brand in the U.S. and now has large-scale production facilities there.",

      "It took some 175 years before they spotted the sacred omen and established the city of Tenochtitlan in 1325 where Mexico City stands today.",
      "How the eagle, the cactus and the serpent became an emblem and endured through the European conquest is the focus of a new exhibition. \u201cA coat of arms, an emblem, a symbol of identity,\u201d runs through Dec. 15 at the Old City Hall in downtown Mexico City.",
      "The exhibit is among the government\u2019s activities marking the 700th anniversary of the founding of the Mexica capital.",
      "\u201cRecognizing Tenochtitlan doesn\u2019t mean recalling a dead past, but rather the living heartbeat that still beats beneath our city,\u201d President Claudia Sheinbaum said during an official ceremony in July. \u201cIt was the center of an Indigenous world that built its own model of civilization \u2014 one in harmony with the Earth, the stars, and its gods and goddesses.\u201d",
      "Fragments of that civilization lie underneath the Old City Hall, the current seat of Mexico City\u2019s government.",
      "Built by order of Spanish conqueror Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s in 1522, its construction used stones from ancient Mexica sacred sites. The building has been renewed over time, but its halls have witnessed centuries of governance and symbolism.",
      "\u201cHolding the exhibition in this City Hall, a place of decisions and memory, is a way to recognize the history of those who once inhabited it and how its transformations still echo in Mexico City\u2019s identity,\u201d said Mariana G\u00f3mez Godoy, Director of Mexico City\u2019s Cultural Heritage, during the exhibit\u2019s inauguration in November.",

      "Curated by researcher Guadalupe Lozada, it also displays images portraying how it was adopted by the religious orders in charge of converting the Indigenous people to Catholicism.",
      "While the eagle and cactus were already adopted by Europeans in the mid-16th century, the Jesuits introduced the serpent decades later. \u201cFrom then on, it would remain a symbol of the city\u2019s identity \u2014 one that would also spread throughout the rest of New Spain,\u201d Lozada said.",
      "According to her, plenty of monasteries dating back to the 17th century attest to how friars displayed the eagle and cactus in their sanctuaries. Even today, the emblem can still be seen above the fa\u00e7ade of Mexico City\u2019s cathedral and inside one of its chapels.",

      "KYIV, Ukraine -- Before the revelation of a multi-million dollar embezzlement and kickbacks scandal involving Ukraine's state nuclear energy company brought his name to the forefront, Tymur Mindich was a shadowy presence \u2014 navigating deals and moving behind the scenes with unseen influence, known to many, yet rarely spoken of.",
      "Mindich was linked to growing fears over his expanding influence within the country\u2019s lucrative industries, his access facilitated by his ties to President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The two were once business partners and Mindich\u2019s influence had expanded under Zelenskyy's tenure.",
      "The full extent of that influence was exposed this week when Ukraine\u2019s anti-corruption watchdogs released the findings of a 15-month investigation into a $100 million embezzlement scheme involving top officials and Ukraine\u2019s state nuclear power company, accusing Mindich of being the mastermind behind the plot.",
      "Mindich has fled the country, with any criminal proceedings against him likely to be carried out in absentia. Two top government ministers have resigned.",

      "\u201cWhat we were hearing only as rumors now has some evidence,\u201d said activist Tetiana Shevchuk, of Ukraine\u2019s Anti-Corruption Action Center. \u201cFor a long time we have heard that Tymur Mindich is a shadow controller of the energy sector.\u201d",
      "Until Zelenskyy\u2019s presidency, Mindich, 46, was just one among many wealthy Ukrainian entertainment industry entrepreneurs.",
      "Mindich was a co-owner of Zelenskyy's production company Kvartal 95, named for the comedy troupe that helped catapult the Ukrainian president to fame as a comedian before he entered politics. Zelenskyy transferred his stake in the company to his partners after he was elected.",
      "Despite expanding his business portfolio since Zelenskyy\u2019s election, Mindich maintained ties to the entertainment world. Until the corruption probe was exposed this week, he was a producer of the comedy show \u201cStadium Family\u201d on YouTube. In light of the scandal and his tarnished reputation, the show\u2019s owners shut it down this week.",
      "He is also a relative of Leonid Mindich, who was arrested by Ukraine\u2019s anti-corruption watchdogs in June when he was trying to flee the country, according to local reports; he was charged with embezzling $16 million from an electric power company.",
      "Zelenskyy and Mindich\u2019s close friendship is documented. The president used Mindich\u2019s armored car during the final stretch of his presidential campaign in 2019. In January 2021, Zelenskyy celebrated his birthday in Mindich's apartment during COVID. The two own apartments in the same building.",
      "After Zelenskyy\u2019s 2019 presidential win, Mindich's political ties grew.",
      "He was a close business associate of Ukrainian oligarch Ihor Kolomoysky, who backed Zelenskyy\u2019s presidential campaign. Zelenskyy later cut ties with the billionaire and in 2023 Kolomoysky was arrested by Ukrainian security services on fraud and money-laundering charges.",

      "The case against Mindich rests on 1,000 hours of wiretaps revealing his significant influence over Herman Haluschenko, Ukraine\u2019s energy minister from 2021-2025 until he was named justice minister in July. Haluschenko resigned that post after the investigation became public this week.",
      "While rarely named as a direct beneficiary in official documents, investigators cite extensive wire-tapping evidence they allege shows Mindich exerted control over a network of loyalists who pressured contractors for Energoatom, the state nuclear power company, demanding kickbacks of up to 15% to bypass bureaucratic obstacles and do business smoothly.",

      "NINOSHIMA, Japan -- Baumkuchen originated in Germany but has become a wildly popular sweet in Japan, where a prisoner of war on a small western island started making the treat that has thrived in its new homeland.",
      "Today, the confectionery known as \u201ctree cake\u201d because of the resemblance to a trunk with rings is considered a symbol of longevity and prosperity in Japan, where Baumkuchen festivals are regularly held.",
      "Japanese adaptations, including those using maccha and sweet potatoes, are popular gifts at weddings and birthdays. Baumkuchen is sold in gift boxes at luxury department stores and individually wrapped, smaller versions can be found at convenience stores.",
      "The sweet's early years, however, are associated with a catastrophic earthquake and two world wars.",
      "Making Baumkuchen is one of most popular activities on Ninoshima, just a 20-minute ferry ride from Hiroshima. But visitors also must learn the sleepy island\u2019s role in Japan\u2019s wartime history, according to Kazuaki Otani, head of the Juccheim Ninoshima Welcome Center.",
      "At the outdoor center built over the site of a prisoner of war camp, amateur bakers pour batter on a bamboo pole and roast the mixture over a charcoal fire. As the surface turns light brown, a new layer is poured, creating brown rings as the cake grows thicker and the sweet smell wafts through the picnic area.",
      "This is how a German confectioner named Karl Juchheim baked Baumkuchen while he was imprisoned on the island more than 100 years ago.",
      "During Japan\u2019s militarist expansion period beginning in the late 1890s, Ninoshima served as a military quarantine station as nearby Hiroshima developed into a major military hub. About 4,700 mostly German civilians and servicemembers were kept at 16 camps across Japan during World War I. The German prisoners at Ninoshima were given \u201ca certain degree of freedom\u201d and allowed to cook, Otani said.",
      "Juchheim was running a bakery in Qingdao, China, then a German territory, when he was captured by the Japanese in 1915. He arrived on Ninoshima in 1917 with some 500 German POWs and is believed to have tested his Baumkuchen recipe there, Otani said.",

In March 1919, Juchheim\u2019s Baumkuchen commercially debuted in Japan at the Hiroshima Prefectural Products Exhibition. His handmade cake was hugely popular and attracted a big crowd of Japanese visitors, historical documents show.",
      "The confectioner opened a pastry shop in Yokohama, near Tokyo, in 1922. The 1923 Great Kanto quake destroyed the business and forced Juchheim to move his family to the western port city of Kobe, where he opened a coffee shop serving Baumkuchen. That store was leveled by U.S. firebombings on Kobe two months before the end of World War II.",
      "Yet he remained and grew the business in Kobe, where Juchheim Co., Ltd., still operates as one of Japan\u2019s top confectioners with the help of his wife Elise and devoted Japanese staff.",
      "The atomic bomb dropped by the U.S. on Hiroshima on Aug. 6, 1945, and another on Nagasaki three days later killed more than 210,000 by the end of that year. In the aftermath, about 10,000 severely injured victims were shipped from Hiroshima to Ninoshima for treatment and temporary shelter. Most died there and many of their remains have yet to be found, experts say.",
      "Juchheim died of illness at a Kobe hotel on Aug. 14, 1945, the day before Japan announced its surrender.",
      "\u201cHis baking was an expression of his wish for peace,\u201d Otani said. \u201cBy sharing with visitors what things were like back then, I hope it gives people an opportunity to reflect on peace.\u201d",

      "Eduardo Bolsonaro, a lawmaker now in self-exile in the United States, called the charges against him baseless and described them as political persecution.",
      "A majority of three justices is needed for the trial against Eduardo Bolsonaro to go forward, and Friday's vote on a five-member panel of the Supreme Court means he is virtually assured of going on trial, at least in absentia. Technically, however, the voting remains open until Nov. 25 and any justice could change their vote before then, though that would be highly unusual.",

      "But this eruption of visceral rage at immigrants and incumbents took place in Santiago, Chile, at the final campaign event for Johannes Kaiser, a radical libertarian candidate gaining traction before Sunday's presidential election in Chile, where rising fears of uncontrolled migration have pushed everyone in this race \u2014 even the governing coalition's Communist candidate, Jeannette Jara \u2014 to the right.",
      "Kaiser is \u201cthe only one with a firm hand, the only one who can pull us out of the United Nations, close the borders to all the Venezuelan criminals and throw them in prison in El Salvador,\u201d said Claudia Belmonte, 50, peering out from beneath the brim of a red baseball cap emblazoned with Kaiser\u2019s promise to \u201cMake Chile Great Again.\u201d",

Neoliberalism is alive and well. Chile retains the 1980 constitution adopted by military dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet after Boric twice failed to change it.",
      "For critics, it's a reminder of the lawlessness that struck Chile, a stable prosperous nation that long distinguished itself from its more volatile neighbors.

    "story": [
      "By the end of next year, the state of Para is requiring all cattle to be tagged to trace where they came from in order to be sold legally",
      "BELEM, Brazil -- Maria Gorete, who just began ranching three years ago, is doing something new with her 76 head of cattle in the Brazilian countryside near the town of Novo Repartimento.",
      "She's piercing their ears.",
      "Their new jewelry \u2014 ear tags, actually \u2014 will track their movements throughout their lives as part of an initiative aimed at slowing deforestation in the Brazilian state of Para. Depending on how well it works, it's the kind of solution the world needs more of to slow climate change, the subject of annual United Nations talks just a few hours away in Belem.",
      "With about 20 million cattle in Para, it's a mammoth task. Some of them are on big farms closer to cities, but others are in remote areas where farmers have been cutting down Amazon rainforest to make room for their pastures. That\u2019s a problem for climate change because it means trees that absorb pollution are being replaced by cattle that emit methane, a powerful planet-warming gas.",
      "Brazil has lost about 339,685 square kilometers (131,153 square miles) of mature rainforest since 2001 \u2014 an area roughly the size of Germany \u2014 and more than a third of that loss was in Para, according to Global Forest Watch. Para alone accounts for about 14% of all rainforest loss recorded worldwide over the last 24 years.",
      "Gorete, with her small herd, said the tagging hasn't been much of a hassle. And she sees the program as a good thing. It will let her sell her beef to companies and countries whose consumers want to know where it came from.",
      "\u201cWith this identification, it opens doors to the world,\u201d said Gorete, who before cattle ranching cultivated acai and cacao. \u201cIt adds value to the animals.\u201d",
      "Cows can move to several farms in their lifetime \u2014 born on one pasture, sold to a different farmer, or two or three or more, until they\u2019ve grown to their full weight and are sold to a processor, said Marina Piatto, executive director of the Brazilian agriculture and conservation NGO Imaflora.",
      "Tracking those movements effectively can be a way to discourage deforestation. That's where the tagging comes in.",
      "Starting next year, all cattle being transported in Para have to be tagged. Each animal actually gets a tag in each ear. One is a written number that is registered with the government in an official database. The other is an electronic chip that links to the same information as the number registered to the cow \u2014 like when and where it was born, where it was raised, the owner, the breed and more. By 2027, all cattle in Para, including cattle born on ranches in the state, have to have tags.",
      "Once a tag is removed, it\u2019s broken and can\u2019t be put back, a measure to help avoid fraud.",
      "When the cattle moves, owners are required to report those movements and buyers are required to log the transaction. To be able to sell their animals, ranchers must have tags and a clean history. Locations registered with the government where the animals have been can be checked against satellite images to detect illegal deforestation, or against maps that show Indigenous territories that are supposed to be off-limits for cattle.",
      "\u201cThe only solution is individual cattle traceability because then you can know for each movement where that cattle has been and if it has been in a place that has been deforested in the past,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Otavio Passos, the Brazilian Amazon director with The Nature Conservancy.",
      "Mauro Lucio, 60, has 2,600 cattle on his farm in Paragominas about 290 kilometers (180 miles) south of Belem. He said the new tagging program was an easy transition for him because he's been tagging his cattle since 2000. He did it to track his own herd, but he sees the benefit of the government now being involved.",
      "\u201cFor me, this is the same tool,\" he said.",

      "The government will pay for the tags for farms with 100 head of cattle or fewer and ranchers with anything beyond that pay by themselves, said Passos, of The Nature Conservancy. Lucio said the last price he paid for tags was just under 9 Brazilian reals (US$1.70).",
      "JBS, the world\u2019s largest meatpacker, is donating 2 million tags to the effort. The company, which is among several that have been fined or faced lawsuits for buying cattle raised illegally on deforested land, said traceability of cattle can help address concerns about deforestation. JBS says it has a \u201czero-tolerance policy\u201d for illegal deforestation and takes several steps to ensure its supply chain doesn\u2019t contribute to deforestation.",
      "Passos said it's important to have industry players on board. \u201cWe have never had such a unique window of opportunity where you have all the sectors, the cattle ranchers, the meatpackers, the industry, the government, the NGOs, all hurtling around the same objective,\u201d he said.",
      "Even if meat producers are backing a legal system for cattle tracing, though, there will always be ways to get around laws, said Piatto, of Imaflora, because \u201cillegal is cheaper, it's easier.\u201d",
      "Christian Poirier, program director at Amazon Watch, an organization focused on rainforest protection, said land clearing is carried out \u201cin a sophisticated way by well-funded crime syndicates, not by small landholders in the majority by any means.\u201d",
      "He said it's been easy for those groups to get around current efforts to stop the clearing. He called the new tagging a step in the right direction, but said the most determined people may still be capable of getting around the new rules.",
      "The committee that has been coordinating between government, industry and producers has been working on ways to prevent fraud and use law enforcement most effectively, said Fernando Sampaio, sustainability director of the Brazilian Association of Meat Exporting Industries. For that, they have to know where to look; for instance, if a farm is selling more animals than its size would suggest, that might be a red flag.",

      "The Labor Department will release its numbers on September hiring and unemployment next Thursday, a month and a half late, marking the beginning of the end of a data drought caused by the 43-day federal government shutdown",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Labor Department will release its numbers on September hiring and unemployment next Thursday, a month and a half late, marking the beginning of the end of a data drought caused by the 43-day federal government shutdown.",
      "The statistical blackout meant that the Federal Reserve, businesses, policymakers and investors have largely been in the dark about inflation, job creation, GDP growth and other measures of the U.S. economic health since late summer.",
      "Thomas Simons and Michael Bacolas at Jefferies, a financial firm, wrote in a commentary Friday that over 30 reports from the Labor Department\u2019s Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis and Census Bureau were delayed by the political standoff.",
      "The Labor Department did not release its weekly report on the number of Americans signing up for unemployment benefits for seven straight weeks. That jobless claims report is seen as a potential early indicator of where the labor market is headed.",
      "The Labor Department did release its consumer price index for September \u2014 the most popular measurement of inflation \u2014 nine days late on Oct. 24. The government made an exception for that report because of its urgency: It is used to calculate the annual cost of living adjustment for tens of millions of Americans receiving Social Security and other federal benefits.",
      "The interruption of federal economic statistics came at an awkward time. President Donald Trump\u2019s policies \u2014 sweeping, ever-changing import taxes and massive deportations of people working in the United States illegally \u2014 are creating uncertainty about the economic outlook.",
      "And the economy has sent conflicting signals: Economic growth looked solid at midyear and unemployment has been low. But job growth has lost momentum, and inflation has remained stubbornly above the Federal Reserve\u2019s 2% target, partly because of the impact of Trump\u2019s tariffs.",
      "Jefferies' Simons expects the September employment report to show that employers added 65,000 jobs that month \u2014 unimpressive, but up from a meager 22,000 in August. He figures that unemployment remained at a low 4.3%.",
      "The data cutoff has caused consternation on Wall Street and deepened divisions among Fed officials over whether to cut interest rates for a third straight time at their next meeting in December.",
      "This week, some Fed policymakers have suggested that a lack of data is one reason they may support holding off on another rate cut.",
      "As a result, fresh reports on jobs and inflation in the coming weeks and months will carry huge weight at the Fed because new numbers could help resolve disagreements between those who support another interest rate reduction and those who are opposed.",

Earlier this week, Kevin Hassett, a top White House economist, said only a part of October\u2019s jobs report -- originally scheduled to be released Nov. 7 -- will eventually be released.",
      "The Bureau of Labor Statistics will likely have enough data from businesses to calculate how many jobs were gained or lost last month. Much of that is submitted electronically. But a separate survey of households, which is used to calculate the unemployment rate, didn\u2019t take place during the shutdown.",
      "As a result, for the first time in 77 years, the BLS may not calculate an unemployment rate for the month of October.",
      "Other White House officials have previously said there also won\u2019t be an October inflation report, because the data couldn\u2019t be gathered due to the government shutdown. That will pose a challenge for the Fed, which is seeking to determine whether inflation is headed back to 2%.",
      "The data interruption occurred just a couple of months after Trump fired the director of the BLS, Erika McEntarfer, after it produced employment figures Aug. 1 that he didn\u2019t like. They showed only modest job gains in July and sharply smaller increases in May and June than previously estimated.",
      "Still, economists said the upcoming reports should be free from bias. Currently, there are no political appointees at the agency, after Trump withdrew his nominee to head the BLS Sept. 30.",

      "The operator of the Keystone Pipeline says preliminary findings indicate a fatigue crack caused an oil spill in North Dakota in April",
      "BISMARCK, N.D. -- A fatigue crack in the Keystone Pipeline led to an oil spill in North Dakota earlier this year that released thousands of barrels of oil onto farmland, according to the pipeline operator.",
      "In a quarterly report released Thursday, South Bow said initial findings show, \u201cthe failure resulted from a fatigue crack that originated along the pipe\u2019s manufactured long-seam weld.\u201d A fatigue crack develops from stress over time. A mechanical and metallurgical analysis found the pipe and welds met industry standards, the company said.",
      "Spill-related costs total around $55 million, which the company said it expects to recover through insurance early next year. Through September, South Bow had received about $16 million in reimbursements from its insurance policies.",
      "The U.S. Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration ordered several corrective actions after the spill. The federal government shutdown delayed the release of a third-party \u201croot cause analysis,\u201d South Bow said.",

      "An estimated 3,500 barrels or 147,000 gallons of oil spilled in a field near Fort Ransom, a small town in a forested area with outdoor recreation and scenic views. South Bow sent vacuum trucks and more than 200 workers to aid the cleanup. The pipeline restarted after a six-day shutdown.",
      "State regulators inspected the site several times in the months after the spill, noting in September that \u201cthe vegetation is recovering well,\u201d and that it should be checked again in spring 2026, according to an incident report.",

    "story": [
      "Walmart CEO Doug McMillon is planning to retire early next year and his successor has been named",
      "NEW YORK -- Walmart CEO Doug McMillon, who turned America's largest retailer into a tech-powered giant and spearheaded a period of robust sales growth since becoming chief executive in 2014, plans to retire early next year, the company said Friday in a surprise announcement.",
      "John Furner, 51, the head of Walmart's U.S. operations, will take over on Feb. 1, the day after McMillon's retirement becomes effective, the company said. Although McMillon is set to spend a year advising his successor, Walmart shares fell 3% immediately in premarket trading after the news of the unexpected leadership change.",
      "Unlike Amazon's Jeff Bezos or Tesla's Elon Musk, McMillon isn't a household name, but he played a key role in the U.S. economy. Walmart's performance serves as a barometer of consumer spending given its size and vast customer base. The company maintains that 90% of U.S. households rely on Walmart for a range of products, and more than 150 million customers shop on its website or in its stores every week.",
      "Walmart also is the nation's largest private employer, with 1.6 million workers.",
      "The pending CEO switch comes at a challenging time for retail companies and other employers that have spent almost 11 months navigating an uncertain economic environment as President Donald Trump\u2019s administration adopted volatile policies on tariffs and initiated an immigration crackdown that threatened to shrink the supply of workers.",
      "McMillon started with Walmart in 1984 and became chief executive three decades later. During his tenure as CEO, he invested heavily in employees by increasing wages, expanding parental leave and launching a program for employees seeking advancement and education opportunities to earn certificates and degrees.",
      "Under his leadership, Walmart has been laser-focused on maintaining low prices while embracing new technology like artificial intelligence and robotics.",
      "\u201cOver more than a decade as CEO, Doug led a comprehensive transformation by investing in our associates, advancing our digital and e-commerce capabilities, and modernizing our supply chain,\" Walmart Chairman Greg Penner, the son-in-law of the late Walmart founder Sam Walton, said. \"He leaves Walmart stronger, more innovative, and better aligned with our purpose to help people save money and live better.\u201d",
      "Furner started at Walmart in 1993, working as an hourly store associate in Bentonville, Arkansas, where the company is based. He served as president and CEO of the U.S. division of Sam's Club, the membership warehouse-store chain that Walmart owns, before taking the same roles at Walmart U.S.",
      "Under McMillon, Walmart's annual revenue has grown from $485.7 billion to $681 billion in its latest fiscal year. Its stock was hovering around $25 per share when he came to the helm; now, it is over $102.",
      "When he became CEO, stores were messy and worker morale was low. McMillon thought the company needed to increase pay and create pathways for hourly workers to advance in their careers. In 2015, Walmart announced a three-year, $2.7 billion investment to increase wages and create new education and training opportunities.",

The company gradually regained investors' confidence with higher sales, new customers and greatly improved employee retention rates.",
      "Walmart also invested heavily in e-commerce and faster deliveries. The company said in August that roughly one-third of recent deliveries from its U.S. stores involved orders asking for goods to arrive in three hours or less, and 20% of those orders made it to customers in a half-hour or under.",
      "Walmart has also looked for new sources of revenue like advertising and launched a membership program called Walmart + to compete with Amazon Prime, its rival's free shipping program.",
      "During the coronavirus pandemic, Walmart powered through worldwide supply chain kinks and saw a sales surge as homebound consumers stocked up. Walmart used its clout with suppliers again to maintain low prices and attract more customers during the period of inflation that followed the pandemic.",
      "The company has said it is absorbing some of the extra import costs from Trump's tariffs on foreign goods but that customers would see some price increases.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re doing what we said we would do,\u201d McMillon told stock analysts in August. \u201cWe\u2019re keeping our prices as low as we can for as long as we can. Our merchants have been creative and acted with urgency to avoid what would have been additional pressure for our customers and members.\u201d",

      "Speaking on state radio, Orb\u00e1n accused the bloc of trying to sidestep his veto power over sanctions on Russian energy by using trade rules instead in its plan to phase out all imports of Russian oil and gas by the end of 2027.",
      "\u201cWe are turning to the European Court of Justice in this matter,\u201d Orb\u00e1n said Friday. \u201cThis is a flagrant violation of European law, the rule of law and European cooperation ... They will pay a very high price for this.\u201d",
      "Hungary remains heavily dependent on Russian fossil fuels and has sought exemptions and threatened to veto EU sanctions since Moscow\u2019s 2022 invasion of Ukraine. During a visit to Washington last week, Orb\u00e1n secured an exemption from U.S. sanctions on two Russian energy companies following a White House meeting with President Donald Trump.",
      "Numerous U.S. officials have said the waiver, which ensures Russian oil and gas will continue to flow to Hungary, will last one year, though Orb\u00e1n has insisted it is indefinite. On Friday, Orb\u00e1n credited his close personal relationship with Trump for receiving the exemption, and said it would remain in place as long as both he and the president remain in office.",

      "LONDON -- A London judge ruled Friday that global mining giant BHP Group is liable in Brazil\u2019s worst environmental disaster when a dam collapse 10 years ago unleashed tons of toxic waste into a major river, killing 19 people and devastating villages downstream.",
      "High Court Justice Finola O\u2019Farrell said Australia-based BHP was responsible despite not owning the dam at the time, finding its negligence or carelessness led to the collapse.",
      "Anglo-Australian BHP owns 50% of Samarco, the Brazilian company that operates the iron ore mine where the tailings dam ruptured on Nov. 5, 2015. Enough mine waste to fill 13,000 Olympic-size swimming pools poured into the Doce River in southeastern Brazil.",
      "Sludge from the burst dam destroyed the once-bustling village of Bento Rodrigues in Minas Gerais state and badly damaged other towns.",
      "The disaster also killed 14 tons of freshwater fish and damaged 600 kilometers (370 miles) of the Doce River, according to a study by the University of Ulster in the U.K. The river, which the Krenak Indigenous people revere as a deity, has yet to recover.",

      "\u201cThe risk of collapse of the dam was foreseeable,\u201d O'Farrell wrote in the 222-page decision. \"It is inconceivable that a decision would have been taken to continue raising the height of the dam in those circumstances and the collapse could have been averted.\"",

      "When families are evicted, kids' schooling is often disrupted",
      "ATLANTA -- It was the worst summer in years. Sechita McNair\u2019s family took no vacations. Her younger boys didn\u2019t go to camp. Her van was repossessed, and her family nearly got evicted \u2014 again.",
      "But she accomplished the one thing she wanted most. A few weeks before school started, McNair, an out-of-work film industry veteran barely getting by driving for Uber, signed a lease in the right Atlanta neighborhood so her eldest son could stay at his high school.",
      "As she pulled up outside the school on the first day, Elias, 15, stepped onto the curb in his new basketball shoes and cargo pants. She inspected his face, noticed wax in his ears and grabbed a package of baby wipes from her rental car. She wasn\u2019t about to let her eldest, with his young Denzel Washington looks, go to school looking \u201cgross.\u201d",
      "He grimaced and broke away.",
      "\u201cNo kiss? No hugs?\u201d she called out.",
      "Elias waved and kept walking. Just ahead of him, at least for the moment, sat something his mother had fought relentlessly for: a better education.",
      "Last year, McNair and her three kids were evicted from their beloved apartment in the rapidly gentrifying Old Fourth Ward neighborhood of Atlanta. Like many evicted families, they went from living in a school district that spends more money on students to one that spends less.",
      "Thanks to federal laws protecting homeless and evicted students, her kids were able to keep attending their Atlanta schools, even though the only housing available to them was in another county 40 minutes away. They also had the right to free transportation to those schools, but McNair says the district didn't tell her about that until the school year ended. Their eligibility to remain in those schools expired at the end of last school year.",
      "Still wounded by the death of his father and multiple housing displacements, Elias failed two classes last year, his freshman year. Switching schools now, McNair fears, would jeopardize any chance he has of recovering his academic life. \u201cI need this child to be stable,\u201d she says.",
      "With just one week before school started, McNair drove extra Uber hours, borrowed money, secured rental assistance and ignored concerns about the apartment to rent a three-bedroom in the Old Fourth Ward. At $2,200 a month, it was the only \u201csemi-affordable\u201d apartment in the rapidly gentrifying ward that would rent to a single mom with a fresh eviction on her record.",
      "On Zillow, the second-floor apartment, built in 2005, looked like a middle-class dream with its granite countertops, crown molding and polished wood floors. But up close, the apartment looked abused and held secrets McNair was only beginning to uncover.",
      "The first sign something was wrong came early. When she first toured the apartment, it felt rushed, like the agent didn\u2019t want her to look too closely. Then, even as they told her she was accepted, the landlord and real estate agent wouldn\u2019t send her a \u201cwelcome letter\u201d laying out the agreement, the rent and deposit she would pay. It seemed like they didn\u2019t want to put anything in writing.",
      "When the lease came, it was full of errors. She signed it anyway. \u201cWe\u2019re back in the neighborhood!\u201d she said. Elias could return to Midtown High School.",
      "But even in their triumph, no one in the family could relax. Too many things were uncertain. And it fell to McNair \u2014 and only McNair \u2014 to figure it out.",
      "Midtown is a high school so coveted that school administrators investigate student residency throughout the year to keep out kids from other parts of Atlanta and beyond. For McNair, the day Elias returned to the high school was a momentous one.",
      "\u201cFreedom!\u201d McNair declared after Elias disappeared into the building. Without child care over the summer, McNair had struggled to find time to work enough to make ends meet. Now that the kids were back in class, McNair could spend school hours making money and resolving some of the unsettled issues with her new apartment.",
      "McNair, the first person in her family to attend college, studied theater management. Her job rigging stage sets was lucrative until the writers' and actors' strike and other changes paralyzed the film industry in 2023. The scarcity of work on movie sets, combined with her tendency to take in family and non-family alike, wrecked her home economy.",
      "The family was evicted last fall when McNair fell behind on rent because of funeral expenses for her foster daughter. The teen girl died from an epileptic seizure while McNair and everyone else slept. Elias found her body.",
      "McNair attributes some of Elias\u2019s lack of motivation at school to personal trauma. His father died after a heart attack in 2023, on the sidelines of Elias\u2019s basketball practice.",
      "On his first day back at school this August, Elias appeared excited but tentative. He watched as the seniors swanned into school wearing gold cardboard crowns, a Midtown back-to-school tradition, and scanned the sidewalk for anyone familiar.",
      "If Elias had his way, his mom would homeschool him. She\u2019s done it before. But now that he\u2019s a teenager, it\u2019s harder to get Elias to follow her instructions. As the only breadwinner supporting three kids and her disabled uncle, she has to work.",
      "Elias hid from the crowds and called up a friend: \u201cWhere you at?\u201d The friend, another sophomore, was still en route. Over the phone, they compared outfits, traded gossip about who got a new hairdo or transferred. When Elias\u2019s friend declared this would be the year he\u2019d get a girlfriend, Elias laughed.",
      "When it was time to go in, Elias drifted toward the door with his head down as other students flooded past.",
      "Hours later, he emerged. Despite everything McNair had done to help it go well \u2014 securing the apartment, even spending hundreds of dollars on new clothes for him \u2014 Elias slumped into the backseat when she picked him up after class.",
      "\u201cSchool was so boring,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cWhat happened?\u201d McNair asked.",
      "\u201cNothing, bro. That was the problem,\u201d Elias said. \u201cI thought I was going to be happy when school started, since summer was so horrible.\u201d",
      "Of all of the classes he was taking \u2014 geometry, gym, French, world history, environmental science \u2014 only gym interested him. He wished he could take art classes, he said. Elias has acted in some commercials and television programs, but chose a science and math concentration, hoping to study finance someday.",
      "After dinner at Chick-fil-A, the family visited the city library one block from their new apartment. While McNair spoke to the librarian, the boys explored the children\u2019s section. Malachi, 6, watched a YouTube video on a library computer while Derrick, 7, flipped through a book. Elias sat in a corner, sharing video gaming tips with a stranger he met online.",
      "\u201cThose people are learning Japanese,\u201d said McNair, pointing to a group of adults sitting around a cluster of tables. \u201cAnd this library lets you check out museum passes. This is why we have to be back in the city. Resources!\u201d",
      "McNair wants her children to go to well-resourced schools. Atlanta spends nearly $20,000 per student a year, $7,000 more than the district they moved to after the eviction. More money in schools means smaller classrooms and more psychologists, guidance counselors and other support.",
      "But McNair, who grew up in New Jersey near New York City, also sees opportunities in the wider city of Atlanta. She wants to use its libraries, e-scooters, bike paths, hospitals, rental assistance agencies, Buy Nothing groups and food pantries.",
      "\u201cThese are all resources that make it possible to raise a family when you don\u2019t have support,\" she said. \"Wouldn\u2019t anyone want that?\u201d",
      "On the way home, the little boys fall asleep in the back seat. Elias asks, \u201cSo, is homeschooling off the table?\u201d",

      "McNair pulls into the driveway in Jonesboro, the suburb where the family landed after their eviction. Even though the family wants to live in Atlanta, their stuff is still here. It\u2019s a neighborhood of brick colonials and manicured lawns. She realizes it\u2019s the dream for some families, but not hers. \u201cIt\u2019s a support desert.\u201d",
      "As they get out of the car, Elias takes over as parent-in-charge. \u201cGet all of your things,\u201d he directs Malachi and Derrick, who scowl as Elias seems to relish bossing them around. \u201cPick up your car seats, your food, those markers. I don\u2019t want to see anything left behind.\u201d Elias would be responsible for making the boys burritos, showering them and putting them to sleep.",
      "McNair heads out to drive for Uber. That\u2019s what is necessary to pay $450 a week to rent the car and earn enough to pay her rent and bills.",
      "But while McNair is out, she can\u2019t monitor Elias. And a few days after he starts school, Elias\u2019s all-night gaming habit has already drawn teachers\u2019 attention.",
      "\u201cI wanted to check in regarding Elias,\u201d his geometry teacher writes during the first week of school. \u201cHe fell asleep multiple times during Geometry class this morning.\u201d",
      "Elias had told the teacher he went to bed around 4 a.m. the night before. \u201cI understand that there may be various reasons for this, and I\u2019d love to work together to support Elias so he can stay focused and successful in class.\u201d",
      "A few days later, McNair gets a similar email from his French teacher.",
      "That night, McNair drives around Atlanta, trying to pick up enough Uber trips to keep her account active. But she can\u2019t stop thinking about the emails. \u201cI should be home making sure Elias gets to bed on time,\u201d she says, crying. \u201cBut I have to work. I\u2019m the only one paying the bills.\u201d",
      "Ever since McNair rented the Atlanta apartment, her bills had doubled. She wasn't sure when she'd feel safe giving up the house she rents in Clayton County, given the problems with the Atlanta apartment. For starters, she was not even sure it was safe to spend the night there.",
      "A week after school started in August, McNair dropped by the apartment to check whether the landlords had made repairs. At the very least, she wanted more smoke detectors.",
      "She also wanted them to replace the door, which looked like someone had forced it open with a crowbar. She wanted a working fridge and oven. She wanted them to secure the back door to the adjoining empty apartment, which appeared to be open and made her wonder if there were pests or even people squatting there.",
      "But on this day, her keys didn\u2019t work.",
      "She called 911. Had her new landlords deliberately locked her out?",
      "When the police showed up outside the olive-green, Craftsman-style fourplex, McNair scrolled through her phone to find a copy of her lease. Then McNair and the officer eyed a man walking up to the property. \u201cThe building was sold in a short sale two weeks ago,\u201d he told McNair. The police officer directed the man to give the new keys to McNair.",
      "The next day, McNair started getting emails from an agent specializing in foreclosures, suggesting the new owners wanted McNair to leave. \u201cThe bank owns the property and now you are no longer a tenant of the previous owner,\u201d she wrote. The new owner \u201cmight\u201d offer relocation assistance if McNair agreed to leave.",
      "McNair consulted attorneys, who reassured her: It might be uncomfortable, but she could stay. She needed to try to pay rent, even if the new owner didn\u2019t accept it.",
      "So McNair messaged the agent, asking where she should send the rent, and requested the company make necessary repairs. Eventually, the real estate agent stopped responding.",
      "Finally, McNair moved her kids and a few items from the Jonesboro house to the Atlanta apartment. She didn\u2019t allow Elias to bring his video game console to Atlanta. He started going to bed around 11 p.m. most nights. But even as she solved that problem, others emerged.",
      "It was at Midtown\u2019s back-to-school night in September that McNair learned Elias was behind in most of his classes. Some teachers said maybe Midtown wasn't the right school for Elias.",
      "Perhaps they were right, McNair thought. She\u2019d heard similar things before.",
      "Elias also didn\u2019t want to go to school. He skipped one day, then another. McNair panicked. In Georgia, parents can be sent to jail for truancy when their kids miss five unexcused days.",
      "McNair started looking into a homeschooling program run by a mother she follows on Facebook. In the meantime, she emailed and called some Midtown staff for advice. She says she didn\u2019t get a response. Finally, seven weeks after the family\u2019s triumphant return to Midtown, McNair filed papers declaring her intention to homeschool Elias.",
      "It quickly proved challenging. Elias wouldn\u2019t do any schoolwork when he was home alone. And when the homeschooling group met twice a week, she discovered, they required parents to pick up their children afterward instead of allowing them to take public transit or e-scooters. That was untenable.",
      "Elias wanted to stay at home and offered to take care of McNair\u2019s uncle, who has dementia. \u201cThat was literally killing my soul the most,\u201d said McNair. \u201cThat\u2019s not a child\u2019s job.\u201d",
      "Hell, no, she told him \u2014 you only get one chance at high school.",
      "Then, one day, while she was loading the boys\u2019 clothes into the washing machine at the Atlanta apartment, she received a call from an unknown Atlanta number. It was the woman who heads Atlanta Public Schools\u2019 virtual program, telling her the roster was full.",
      "McNair asked the woman for her opinion on Elias\u2019s situation. Maybe she should abandon the Atlanta apartment and enroll him in the Jonesboro high school.",
      "Let me stop you right there, the woman said. Is your son an athlete? If he transfers too many times, it can affect his ability to play basketball. And he\u2019d probably lose credits and take longer to graduate. He needs to be in school \u2014 preferably Midtown \u2014 studying for midterms, she said. You need to put on your \u201cbig mama drawers\u201d and take him back, she told McNair.",
      "The next day, Elias and his mother pulled up to Midtown. Outside the school, Elias asked if he had to go inside. Yes, she told him. This is your fault as much as it\u2019s mine.",
      "Now, with Elias back in school every day, McNair can deliver food through Uber Eats without worrying about a police officer asking why her kid isn\u2019t in school. If only she had pushed harder, sooner, for help with Elias, she thought. \u201cI should have just gone down to the school and sat in their offices until they talked to me.\"",
      "But it was easy for her to explain why she hadn\u2019t. \u201cI was running around doing so many other things just so we have a place to live, or taking care of my uncle, that I didn\u2019t put enough of my energy there.\u201d",
      "She wishes she could pay more attention to Elias. But so many things are pulling at her. And as fall marches toward winter, her struggle continues. After failing to keep up with the Jonesboro rent, she's preparing to leave that house before the landlord sends people to haul her possessions to the curb.",
      "As an Uber driver, she has picked up a few traumatized mothers with their children after they got evicted. She helped them load the few things they could fit into her van. As they drove off, onlookers scavenged the leftovers.",
      "She has promised herself she\u2019d never let that happen to her kids.",

    "summary": "The company that makes OxyContin, members of the Sackler family who own it and many groups that sued over its role in the opioid crisis are asking a judge to approve a settlement plan",
    "story": [
      "The company that makes OxyContin, members of the Sackler family who own it and many groups that sued over its role in the opioid crisis are asking a judge to approve a settlement plan",
      "NEW YORK -- Lawyers representing OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma, branches of the Sackler family that own it, cities, states, counties, Native American tribes, people with addiction and others across the U.S. are expected to deliver a nearly unanimous message for a bankruptcy court judge Friday: Approve a plan to settle thousands of opioid-related lawsuits against the company.",
      "If U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Sean Lane abides, it will close a long chapter \u2014 and maybe the entire book \u2014 on a legal odyssey over efforts to hold the company to account for its role in an opioid crisis connected to 900,000 deaths in the U.S. since 1999, including deaths from heroin and illicit fentanyl.",
      "Closing arguments were expected Friday in the third day of a hearing over a bankruptcy plan for the company, which filed for protection six years ago as it faced lawsuits with claims that grew to trillions of dollars.",
      "The saga has been emotional and full of contentious arguments between the many groups that took Purdue to court, often exposing a possible mismatch between the quest for justice and the practical role of bankruptcy court.",
      "The U.S. Supreme Court rejected a previous deal because it said it was improper for Sackler family members to receive immunity from lawsuits over opioids. In the new arrangement, entities who don't opt into the settlement can sue them. Family members are collectively worth billions, but much of their assets are held in trusts in offshore accounts that would be hard to access through lawsuits.",
      "This time, the government groups involved have reached an even fuller consensus and there's been mostly subdued opposition from individuals. Out of more than 54,000 personal injury victims who voted on whether the plan should be accepted. just 218 said no. A larger number of people who are part of that group didn't vote.",
      "A handful of objectors spoke Thursday at the hearing, sometimes interrupting the judge. Some said that only the victims, not the states and other government entities, should receive the funds in the settlement. Others wanted the judge to find the members of the Sackler family criminally liable \u2014 something Lane said is beyond the scope of the bankruptcy court, but that the settlement doesn't bar prosecutors from pursuing.",
      "A Florida woman whose husband struggled with addiction after being given OxyContin following an accident told the court that the deal isn't enough.",
      "\u201cThe natural laws of karma suggest the Sacklers and Purdue Pharma should pay for what they have done,\u201d Pamela Bartz Halaschak said via video.",
      "A flood of lawsuits filed by government entities against Purdue and other drugmakers, drug wholesalers and pharmacy chains began about a decade ago.",
      "Most of the major ones have already settled for a total of about $50 billion, with most of the money going to fight the opioid crisis.",

      "The Purdue deal would rank among the largest of them. Members of the Sackler family would be required to pay up to $7 billion and give up ownership of the company. None have been on its board or received payments since 2018. Unlike a similar hearing four years ago, none were called to testify in this week's hearing.",
      "The company would get a name change and new overseers who would dedicate future profits to battling the opioid crisis.",
      "There are also some non-financial provisions. Certain members of the Sackler family would be required to give up involvement in companies that sell opioids in other countries.",
      "Family members would also be barred from having their names added to institutions in exchange for charitable contributions. The name has already been removed from museums and universities.",
      "And company documents, including many that would normally be subject to lawyer-client privilege, are to be made public.",
      "Unlike the other major opioid settlements, individuals harmed by Purdue\u2019s products would be in line for some money as part of the settlement. About $850 million would be set aside for them, with more than $100 million of that amount carved out to help children born dealing with opioid withdrawal.",
      "About 139,000 people have active claims for the money. Many of them, however, have not shown proof that they were prescribed Purdue\u2019s opioids and will receive nothing. Lawyers expect that those who had prescriptions for at least six months would receive about $16,000 each and those who had them more briefly would get around $8,000. Legal fees would reduce what people actually receive.",
      "One woman who had a family member suffer from opioid addiction told the court by video Thursday that the settlement doesn't help people with substance use disorder.",
      "\u201cTell me how you guys can sleep at night knowing people are going to get so little money they can\u2019t do anything with it,\u201d asked Laureen Ferrante of Staten Island, New York.",
      "Most of the money is to go to state and local governments to be used in their efforts to mitigate damage of the opioid epidemic. Overdose death numbers have been dropping in the past few years, a decline experts believe is partly due to the impact of settlement dollars.",

      "Rice farmer Hwang Seong-yeol and four other South Korean growers have sued the state utility Korea Electric Power Corp. and its power-generating subsidiaries, alleging their reliance on coal and other fossil fuels has accelerated climate change and dam...",
      "SEOSAN, South Korea -- Hwang Seong-yeol stood at the edge of a golden field, watching nervously as a combine harvester crawled through his rice, churning up mud and stalks. Its steady hum filled the damp autumn air as grain poured into a truck waiting at the other end of the muddy paddy.",
      "It was the final day of what Hwang said was one of his toughest seasons in three decades of farming. He and other farmers feel helpless against increasingly erratic weather that they link to climate change and damage to their crops. It has complicated their work and cast uncertainty over their futures.",
      "Hwang is one of five South Korean farmers who recently sued the state utility Korea Electric Power Corporation and its power-generating subsidiaries, alleging that their reliance on coal and other fossil fuels has accelerated climate change and damaged their crops.",
      "The lawsuit raises questions about whether power companies\u2019 role in driving climate change, and the resulting agricultural losses, can be quantified. It is the first of its kind in South Korea, said Yeny Kim, a lawyer with the Seoul-based nonprofit Solutions for Our Climate, who is handling the case.",
      "The case underscores the challenges South Korea, a manufacturing power that industrialized long after the Western nations now pressuring others to abandon fossil fuels, faces in transitioning to cleaner energy.",
      "Hwang's fields are on a reclaimed coastal plain along South Korea\u2019s western sea, where glimmering waterways crisscross dark, rich soil and flocks of migratory geese drift overhead, moving like a giant, living quilt.",
      "A remarkably rainy September and October followed a bitterly cold spring that stunted plant growth. Summer floods caused further damage before the wet autumn bred fungal disease.",
      "Hwang would have preferred to harvest in drier weather but had to do so sooner as relentless rains pushed rice stalks into the soil, causing the ripe grains to sprout. That day in late October was only the second dry day after 18 straight days of rain.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really unsettling \u2013 we know how much rice we should normally get from 30,000 pyeong (25 acres) of land, but the yield has been steadily declining every year,\u201d said Hwang, who expects this year\u2019s harvest to be 20% to 25% below normal.",
      "\u201cWe began to question why it\u2019s always the farmers \u2014 who haven\u2019t done anything wrong \u2014 that end up suffering the consequences of the climate crisis. Shouldn\u2019t we be demanding something from those who are actually causing it?\u201d",
      "Farmers are \u201cinherently vulnerable\" to climate change, said Kim, the lawyer.",
      "In an annual climate report in April, South Korea\u2019s government detailed how a year of extreme weather events in 2024, the country\u2019s hottest year ever, triggered a series of \u201cagricultural disasters\u201d of heavy summer rains that destroyed thousands of hectares (acres) of cropland, followed by weeks of intense heat that wrecked still more crops, mostly rice.",
      "Kim and her colleagues decided to file the lawsuit, which represents plaintiffs from across South Korea, after speaking with Hwang and others at farmers markets.",
      "They say KEPCO, which holds a monopoly on electricity transmission and fully owns its subsidiaries, should bear some blame for the destabilized weather, citing what they say are excessive carbon emissions and a lagging transition to renewable energy.",
      "From 2011-2022, the companies produced about 30% of South Korea\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions and roughly 0.4% of global emissions, based on Kim's analysis of publicly available data.",
      "\u201cTherefore, they should also bear 0.4% of the responsibility for the farmers\u2019 losses,\u201d Kim said.",

      "A confidant of Bill Pulte, the Trump administration\u2019s top housing regulator, provided confidential mortgage pricing data from Fannie Mae to a principal competitor",
      "WASHINGTON -- A confidant of Bill Pulte, the Trump administration's top housing regulator, provided confidential mortgage pricing data from Fannie Mae to a principal competitor, alarming senior officials of the government-backed lending giant who warned it could expose the company to claims that it was colluding with a rival to fix mortgage rates.",
      "Emails reviewed by The Associated Press show that Fannie Mae executives were unnerved about what one called the \u201cvery problematic\u201d disclosure of data by Lauren Smith, the company's head of marketing, who was acting on Pulte\u2019s behalf.",
      "\u201cLauren, the information that was provided to Freddie Mac in this email is a problem,\u201d Malloy Evans, senior vice president of Fannie Mae\u2019s single-family mortgage division, wrote in an Oct. 11 email. \u201cThat is confidential, competitive information.\u201d",
      "He also copied Fannie Mae\u2019s CEO, Priscilla Almodovar, on the email, which bore the subject line: \u201cAs Per Director Pulte\u2019s Ask.\u201d Evans asked Fannie Mae's top attorney \u201cto weigh in on what, if any, steps we need to take legally to protect ourselves now.\u201d",
      "While Smith still holds her position, the senior Fannie Mae officials who called her conduct into question were all forced out of their jobs late last month, along with internal ethics watchdogs who were investigating Pulte and his allies.",
      "The dismissals rattled the housing industry and drew condemnation from Democrats. It also gave Pulte's critics evidence to support claims that he has leveraged the nonpublic information available to him to further his own political aims.",
      "\u201cThis is another example of Bill Pulte weaponizing his role to do Donald Trump\u2019s bidding, instead of working to lower costs amidst a housing crisis,\u201d said Sen. Elizabeth Warren, of Massachusetts, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee. \u201cHis behavior raises significant questions, and he needs to be brought in front of Congress to answer them.\u201d",
      "The episode marks the latest example of Pulte using what is typically a low-profile position in the federal bureaucracy to enhance his own standing and gain the attention of President Trump. He's prompted mortgage fraud investigations of prominent Democrats who are some of the president\u2019s best known antagonists, including Sen. Adam Schiff of California, New York Attorney General Letitia James and California Rep. Eric Swalwell.",
      "In June, he ordered Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to prepare a proposal for the firms to accept cryptocurrency, another industry Trump has boosted, as part of the criteria for buying mortgages from banks. Last week, he persuaded Trump about the allure of a 50-year mortgage as a way to increase home buying and building \u2014 a proposal that was widely criticized because it would drastically increase the overall price of a loan.",
      "Pulte also has focused on large home construction companies, which have drawn Trump's ire. Pulte requested confidential Fannie Mae data and has publicly signaled that he is considering a crackdown if the companies do not increase construction volume.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m looking at the Fannie Mae builder data and with the top three homebuilders we buy EASILY over $20 billion in THEIR LOANS!\u201d he posted to X in early October.",
      "In a brief statement, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which Pulte leads, did not address questions from the AP, but said the agency \u201crequires its regulated entities to carry out their operations in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.\u201d",
      "Fannie Mae said it takes \u201ccompliance with the law very seriously and we have a rigorous program to ensure we follow all laws and regulations.\u201d",
      "Pulte and Smith did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Since his appointment to lead the FHFA, Pulte has sought to ingratiate himself with Trump. The 37-year-old scion of a homebuilding company fortune, Pulte has cultivated a reputation as a hyper-online millennial with a thirst for recognition and a desire to please the president. He and his wife also donated about $1 million to Trump's campaign, campaign finance disclosures show.",
      "When Trump sought to oust Federal Reserve chair Jay Powell, Pulte became a leading attacker, routinely taking to X, formerly Twitter, where he has over 3 million followers, to excoriate the central bank leader.",

She said the charges, which she denies, are politically motivated.",
      "Pulte's power over the mortgage lending industry is unusual. Not long after his Senate confirmation, he appointed himself chairman of both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which hold trillions of dollars in assets. The companies serve as a crucial backstop for the home lending industry by buying up mortgages from individual lenders, which are packaged together and sold to investors.",

      "\u201cOn it,\u201d Pulte posted in response on X.",
      "Pulte turned to Smith, who in her brief tenure at Fannie Mae had become a trusted Pulte ally whose work portfolio transcended the boundaries dividing Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the FHFA, according to two people who spoke on condition of anonymity out of fear of retribution.",
      "Soon, a team at Fannie Mae was overseeing an effort to pull together a tranche of mortgage data, according to emails reviewed by the AP. Smith played a central role and shared the confidential lender-level pricing information with Freddie Mac, which set off alarms at both companies, according to the emails. A spokesman for Freddie Mac declined comment.",
      "In the Oct. 11 message to Smith, Evans, the Fannie Mae mortgage executive, also added others to the email chain because they \u201cwere involved with this week's efforts to compile this information\u201d and he wanted to \u201cmake sure you do not exacerbate this issue.\u201d",
      "Danielle McCoy, Fannie Mae's general counsel, weighed in, adding that the information Smith provided to Freddie Mac should \u201cnever be shared\u201d and \u201ccould put the company at risk.\u201d",
      "Others who were part of the email chain included Almodovar, the CEO; chief operating officer Peter Akwaboah; Devang Doshi, a senior vice president for capital markets; and John Roscoe, a Pulte loyalist and former Trump White House aide, who served as Fannie Mae's executive vice president of public relations and operations.",
      "Days later, Almodovar, McCoy and Evans \u2014 who did not respond to requests for comment \u2014 were out of a job. Meanwhile, Roscoe was promoted to co-president of the company, while Akwaboah was named acting CEO.",

      "JUNEAU, Alaska -- The Trump administration said Thursday it is rescinding federal rules that were aimed at protecting from future oil and gas leasing vast swaths of a petroleum reserve in Alaska that provide key habitat for migrating birds, caribou and other wildlife.",
      "The U.S. Interior Department said the final rule would be published next week but announced it is repealing rules put in place last year. Those rules restricted future leasing and industrial development in areas within the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska designated as special for wildlife, subsistence or other values.",
      "Thursday's announcement is in line with an Alaska-specific executive order President Donald Trump signed upon his return to office. The order sought to unravel policies put in place by his predecessor, Democrat Joe Biden, that state political leaders complained had limited Alaska\u2019s ability to develop its vast energy resources, including oil and gas.",
      "The Biden-era rules also had called for the Interior Department to evaluate regularly whether to designate new special areas or to boost protections in those areas. They cited rapidly changing conditions in the Arctic \u2014 such as melting permafrost and changes in plant life and wildlife corridors \u2014 due to climate change. The agency under Biden said the rules would not affect existing leases or operations, including the large Willow oil project, but would \u201craise the bar\u201d for future development.",
      "Interior Secretary Doug Burgum in June said the Biden-era rules were at odds with a leasing program mandate for the petroleum reserve and prioritized \u201cobstruction over production.\u201d",
      "There has been longstanding debate over where oil and gas should be developed within the reserve. Supporters cite the petroleum reserve\u2019s name to underscore their point that it\u2019s a place for drilling. But opponents say federal law requires a balancing act for managing the reserve that includes environmental considerations and protections.",
      "The reserve, roughly the size of Indiana, was set aside more than a century ago as an emergency oil supply for the U.S. Navy. It\u2019s been overseen by the Interior Department since the 1970s.",

      "\u201cThe damage has been done in a lot of ways,\u201d Massachusetts Head Start Association Executive Director Michelle Haimowitz said. \u201cWe know that it\u2019s going to take some time to fill back up.\u201d",

      "\u201cThose delays have just been piling up since April, with no fault to the existing civil servants at the Office of Head Start,\u201d Haimowitz said. \u201cThey just have half the capacity that they had just a few months ago.\u201d",

      "The South Korean nationals detained in Georgia were largely engineers and other highly skilled workers who came to the U.S. temporarily to install equipment and perform other specialized work to get the battery plant up and running.",
      "It is unclear how many of the formerly detained workers are coming back. Jongwon Lee, an attorney in metro Atlanta, said he has firsthand knowledge of two Korean nationals who plan to return after the U.S. State Department confirmed that their B-1 business visitor visas were still valid.",
      "But Kihwan Kim, president of the Federation of Korean Associations for the Southeast U.S., said some of the workers snared in the raid are hesitant to return to the U.S.",
      "\u201cThey don\u2019t have to come to the United States to work after that kind of humiliation,\u201d Kim said. \u201cThey can go to other countries.\"",
      "South Korea's government demanded improvements to the U.S. visa system for skilled Korean workers. Last month, the South Korean Foreign Ministry announced that U.S. officials had agreed to allow South Korean workers on short-term visas or a visa waiver program to help build industrial sites in America",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump initially defended the immigration raid in Georgia, saying in September that the detained workers \u201cwere here illegally, \" When asked about those workers again during an October visit to Seoul, Trump said: \u201cI was opposed to getting them out.\u201d",

      "Cities and states in the U.S. are turning to AI to improve road safety",
      "As America\u2019s aging roads fall further behind on much-needed repairs, cities and states are turning to artificial intelligence to spot the worst hazards and decide which fixes should come first.",
      "Hawaii officials, for example, are giving away 1,000 dashboard cameras as they try to reverse a recent spike in traffic fatalities. The cameras will use AI to automate inspections of guardrails, road signs and pavement markings, instantly discerning between minor problems and emergencies that warrant sending a maintenance crew.",
      "\u201cThis is not something where it\u2019s looked at once a month and then they sit down and figure out where they\u2019re going to put their vans,\u201d said Richard Browning, chief commercial officer at Nextbase, which developed the dashcams and imagery platform for Hawaii.",
      "After San Jose, California, started mounting cameras on street sweepers, city staff confirmed the system correctly identified potholes 97% of the time. Now they're expanding the effort to parking enforcement vehicles.",
      "Texas, where there are more roadway lane miles than the next two states combined, is less than a year into a massive AI plan that uses cameras as well as cellphone data from drivers who enroll to improve safety.",
      "Other states use the technology to inspect street signs or build annual reports about road congestion.",
      "Hawaii drivers over the next few weeks will be able to sign up for a free dashcam valued at $499 under the \u201cEyes on the Road\u201d campaign, which was piloted on service vehicles in 2021 before being paused due to wildfires.",
      "Roger Chen, a University of Hawaii associate professor of engineering who is helping facilitate the program, said the state faces unique challenges in maintaining its outdated roadway infrastructure.",
      "\u201cEquipment has to be shipped to the island,\u201d Chen said. \u201cThere\u2019s a space constraint and a topography constraint they have to deal with, so it\u2019s not an easy problem.\u201d",
      "Although the program also monitors such things as street debris and faded paint on lane lines, the companies behind the technology particularly tout its ability to detect damaged guardrails.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re analyzing all guardrails in their state, every single day,\u201d said Mark Pittman, CEO of Blyncsy, which combines the dashboard feeds with mapping software to analyze road conditions.",
      "Hawaii transportation officials are well aware of the risks that can stem from broken guardrails. Last year, the state reached a $3.9 million settlement with the family of a driver who was killed in 2020 after slamming into a guardrail that had been damaged in a crash 18 months earlier but never repaired.",
      "In October, Hawaii recorded its 106th traffic fatality of 2025 \u2014 more than all of 2024. It's unclear how many of the deaths were related to road problems, but Chen said the grim trend underscores the timeliness of the dashboard program.",
      "San Jose has reported strong early success in identifying potholes and road debris just by mounting cameras on a few street sweepers and parking enforcement vehicles.",

      "But Mayor Matt Mahan, a Democrat who founded two tech startups before entering politics, said the effort will be much more effective if cities contribute their images to a shared AI database. The system can recognize a road problem that it has seen before \u2014 even if it happened somewhere else, Mahan said.",
      "\u201cIt sees, \u2018Oh, that actually is a cardboard box wedged between those two parked vehicles, and that counts as debris on a roadway,\u2019\u201d Mahan said. \u201cWe could wait five years for that to happen here, or maybe we have it at our fingertips.\u201d",
      "San Jose officials helped establish the GovAI Coalition, which went public in March 2024 for governments to share best practices and eventually data. Other local governments in California, Minnesota, Oregon, Texas and Washington, as well as the state of Colorado, are members.",
      "Not all AI approaches to improving road safety require cameras.",
      "Massachusetts-based Cambridge Mobile Telematics launched a system called StreetVision that uses cellphone data to identify risky driving behavior. The company works with state transportation departments to pinpoint where specific road conditions are fueling those dangers.",
      "Ryan McMahon, the company's senior vice president of strategy & corporate development, was attending a conference in Washington, D.C., when he noticed the StreetVision software was showing a massive number of vehicles braking aggressively on a nearby road.",
      "The reason: a bush was obstructing a stop sign, which drivers weren't seeing until the last second.",
      "\u201cWhat we\u2019re looking at is the accumulation of events,\u201d McMahon said. \u201cThat brought me to an infrastructure problem, and the solution to the infrastructure problem was a pair of garden shears.\"",
      "Texas officials have been using StreetVision and various other AI tools to address safety concerns. The approach was particularly helpful recently when they scanned 250,000 lane miles (402,000 kilometers) to identify old street signs long overdue for replacement.",
      "\u201cIf something was installed 10 or 15 years ago and the work order was on paper, God help you trying to find that in the digits somewhere,\u201d said Jim Markham, who deals with crash data for the Texas Department of Transportation. \u201cHaving AI that can go through and screen for that is a force multiplier that basically allows us to look wider and further much faster than we could just driving stuff around.\u201d",
      "Experts in AI-based road safety techniques say what's being done now is largely just a stepping stone for a time when a large proportion of vehicles on the road will be driverless.",
      "Pittman, the Blyncsy CEO who has worked on the Hawaii dashcam program, predicts that within eight years almost every new vehicle \u2014 with or without a driver \u2014 will come with a camera.",
      "\u201cHow do we see our roadways today from the perspective of grandma in a Buick but also Elon and his Tesla?\u201d Pittman said. \u201cThis is really important nuance for departments of transportation and city agencies. They're now building infrastructure for humans and automated drivers alike, and they need to start bridging that divide.\u201d",

      "Utilities are producing eye-popping forecasts about the amount of electricity they'll need to power massive new data centers that are feeding the fast-growing AI economy",
      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- The forecasts are eye-popping: utilities saying they'll need two or three times more electricity within a few years to power massive new data centers that are feeding a fast-growing AI economy.",
      "But the challenges \u2014 some say the impossibility \u2014 of building new power plants to meet that demand so quickly has set off alarm bells for lawmakers, policymakers and regulators who wonder if those utility forecasts can be trusted.",
      "One burning question is whether the forecasts are based on data center projects that may never get built \u2014 eliciting concern that regular ratepayers could be stuck with the bill to build unnecessary power plants and grid infrastructure at a cost of billions of dollars.",
      "The scrutiny comes as analysts warn of the risk of an artificial intelligence investment bubble that's ballooned tech stock prices and could burst.",
      "Meanwhile, consumer advocates are finding that ratepayers in some areas \u2014 such as the mid-Atlantic electricity grid, which encompasses all or parts of 13 states stretching from New Jersey to Illinois, as well as Washington, D.C. \u2014 are already underwriting the cost to supply power to data centers, some of them built, some not.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s speculation in there,\u201d said Joe Bowring, who heads Monitoring Analytics, the independent market watchdog in the mid-Atlantic grid territory. \u201cNobody really knows. Nobody has been looking carefully enough at the forecast to know what\u2019s speculative, what\u2019s double-counting, what\u2019s real, what\u2019s not.\u201d",
      "There is no standard practice across grids or for utilities to vet such massive projects, and figuring out a solution has become a hot topic, utilities and grid operators say.",
      "Uncertainty around forecasts is typically traced to a couple of things.",
      "One concerns developers seeking a grid connection, but whose plans aren't set in stone or lack the heft \u2014 clients, financing or otherwise \u2014 to bring the project to completion, industry and regulatory officials say.",
      "Another is data center developers submitting grid connection requests in various separate utility territories, PJM Interconnection, which operates the mid-Atlantic grid, and Texas lawmakers have found.",
      "Often, developers, for competitive reasons, won't tell utilities if or where they've submitted other requests for electricity, PJM said. That means a single project could inflate the energy forecasts of multiple utilities.",
      "The effort to improve forecasts got a high-profile boost in September, when a Federal Energy Regulatory Commission member asked the nation\u2019s grid operators for information on how they determine that a project is not only viable, but will use the electricity it says it needs.",
      "\u201cBetter data, better decision-making, better and faster decisions mean we can get all these projects, all this infrastructure built,\u201d the commissioner, David Rosner, said in an interview.",
      "The Edison Electric Institute, a trade association of for-profit electric utilities, said it welcomed efforts to improve demand forecasting.",
      "The Data Center Coalition, which represents tech giants like Google and Meta and data center developers, has urged regulators to request more information from utilities on their forecasts and to develop a set of best practices to determine the commercial viability of a data center project.",
      "The coalition's vice president of energy, Aaron Tinjum, said improving the accuracy and transparency of forecasts is a \u201cfundamental first step of really meeting this moment\u201d of energy growth.",

      "States also are trying to do more to find out what\u2019s in utility forecasts and weed out speculative or duplicative projects.",
      "In Texas, which is attracting large data center projects, lawmakers still haunted by a blackout during a deadly 2021 winter storm were shocked when told in 2024 by the grid operator, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, that its peak demand could nearly double by 2030.",
      "They found that state utility regulators lacked the tools to determine whether that was realistic.",
      "Texas state Sen. Phil King told a hearing earlier this year that the grid operator, utility regulators and utilities weren\u2019t sure if the power requests \u201care real or just speculative or somewhere in between.\u201d",
      "Lawmakers passed legislation sponsored by King, now law, that requires data center developers to disclose whether they have requests for electricity elsewhere in Texas and to set standards for developers to show that they have a substantial financial commitment to a site.",

      "The data center projects counted in the forecast are backed by contracts with financial commitments often reaching tens of millions of dollars, PPL said.",

      "Researchers at an artificial intelligence firm say they've found the first reported case of foreign hackers using AI to automate portions of cyberattacks",
      "WASHINGTON -- A team of researchers has uncovered what they say is the first reported use of artificial intelligence to direct a hacking campaign in a largely automated fashion.",
      "The AI company Anthropic said this week that it disrupted a cyber operation that its researchers linked to the Chinese government. The operation involved the use of an artificial intelligence system to direct the hacking campaigns, which researchers called a disturbing development that could greatly expand the reach of AI-equipped hackers.",
      "While concerns about the use of AI to drive cyber operations are not new, what is concerning about the new operation is the degree to which AI was able to automate some of the work, the researchers said.",
      "\u201cWhile we predicted these capabilities would continue to evolve, what has stood out to us is how quickly they have done so at scale,\" they wrote in their report.",
      "The operation was modest in scope and only targeted about 30 individuals who worked at tech companies, financial institutions, chemical companies and government agencies. Anthropic noticed the operation in September and took steps to shut it down and notify the affected parties.",
      "The hackers only \u201csucceeded in a small number of cases,\u201d according to Anthropic, which noted that while AI systems are increasingly being used in a variety of settings for work and leisure, they can also be weaponized by hacking groups working for foreign adversaries. Anthropic, maker of the generative AI chatbot Claude, is one of many tech companies pitching AI \u201cagents\u201d that go beyond a chatbot's capability to access computer tools and take actions on a person's behalf.",

      "Scientists are trying a revolutionary new approach to treat rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, lupus and other devastating autoimmune diseases \u2014 by reprogramming patients\u2019 out-of-whack immune systems.",
      "When your body\u2019s immune cells attack you instead of protecting you, today\u2019s treatments tamp down the friendly fire but they don\u2019t fix what\u2019s causing it. Patients face a lifetime of pricey pills, shots or infusions with some serious side effects \u2014 and too often the drugs aren\u2019t enough to keep their disease in check.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re entering a new era,\u201d said Dr. Maximilian Konig, a rheumatologist at Johns Hopkins University who\u2019s studying some of the possible new treatments. They offer \u201cthe chance to control disease in a way we\u2019ve never seen before.\u201d",
      "How? Researchers are altering dysfunctional immune systems, not just suppressing them, in a variety of ways that aim to be more potent and more precise than current therapies.",
      "They\u2019re highly experimental and, because of potential side effects, so far largely restricted to patients who\u2019ve exhausted today\u2019s treatments. But people entering early-stage studies are grasping for hope.",
      "\u201cWhat the heck is wrong with my body?\u201d Mileydy Gonzalez, 35, of New York remembers crying, frustrated that nothing was helping her daily lupus pain.",
      "Diagnosed at 24, her disease was worsening, attacking her lungs and kidneys. Gonzalez had trouble breathing, needed help to stand and walk and couldn\u2019t pick up her 3-year-old son when last July, her doctor at NYU Langone Health suggested the hospital\u2019s study using a treatment adapted from cancer.",
      "Gonzalez had never heard of that CAR-T therapy but decided, \u201cI\u2019m going to trust you.\u201d Over several months, she slowly regained energy and strength.",
      "\u201cI can actually run, I can chase my kid,\u201d said Gonzalez, who now is pain- and pill-free. \u201cI had forgotten what it was to be me.\u201d",
      "CAR-T was developed to wipe out hard-to-treat blood cancers. But the cells that go bad in leukemias and lymphomas \u2014 immune cells called B cells \u2014 go awry in a different way in many autoimmune diseases.",
      "Some U.S. studies in mice suggested CAR-T therapy might help those diseases. Then in Germany, Dr. Georg Schett at the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg tried it with a severely ill young woman who had failed other lupus treatment. After one infusion, she\u2019s been in remission \u2014 with no other medicine \u2014 since March 2021.",
      "Last month, Schett told a meeting of the American College of Rheumatology how his team gradually treated a few dozen more patients, with additional diseases such as myositis and scleroderma \u2014 and few relapses so far.",
      "Those early results were \u201cshocking,\u201d Hopkins\u2019 Konig recalled.",
      "They led to an explosion of clinical trials testing CAR-T therapy in the U.S. and abroad for a growing list of autoimmune diseases.",
      "How it works: Immune soldiers called T cells are filtered out of a patient\u2019s blood and sent to a lab, where they\u2019re programmed to destroy their B cell relatives. After some chemotherapy to wipe out additional immune cells, millions of copies of those \u201cliving drugs\u201d are infused back into the patient.",
      "While autoimmune drugs can target certain B cells, experts say they can\u2019t get rid of those hidden deep in the body. CAR-T therapy targets both the problem B cells and healthy ones that might eventually run amok. Schett theorizes that the deep depletion reboots the immune system so when new B cells eventually form, they\u2019re healthy.",
      "CAR-T is grueling, time consuming and costly, in part because it is customized. A CAR-T cancer treatment can cost $500,000. Now some companies are testing off-the-shelf versions, made in advance using cells from healthy donors.",
      "Another approach uses \u201cpeacekeeper\u201d cells at the center of this year\u2019s Nobel Prize. Regulatory T cells are a rare subset of T cells that tamp down inflammation and help hold back other cells that mistakenly attack healthy tissue. Some biotech companies are engineering cells from patients with rheumatoid arthritis and other diseases not to attack, like CAR-T does, but to calm autoimmune reactions.",
      "Scientists also are repurposing another cancer treatment, drugs called T cell engagers, that don\u2019t require custom engineering. These lab-made antibodies act like a matchmaker. They redirect the body's existing T cells to target antibody-producing B cells, said Erlangen's Dr. Ricardo Grieshaber-Bouyer, who works with Schett and also studies possible alternatives to CAR-T.",

      "Rather than wiping out swaths of the immune system, Hopkins\u2019 Konig aims to get more precise, targeting \u201conly that very small population of rogue cells that really causes the damage.\u201d",
      "B cells have identifiers, like biological barcodes, showing they can produce faulty antibodies, Konig said. Researchers in his lab are trying to engineer T cell engagers that would only mark \u201cbad\u201d B cells for destruction, leaving healthy ones in place to fight infection.",
      "Nearby in another Hopkins lab, biomedical engineer Jordan Green is crafting a way for the immune system to reprogram itself with the help of instructions delivered by messenger RNA, or mRNA, the genetic code used in COVID-19 vaccines.",
      "In Green's lab, a computer screen shines with brightly colored dots that resemble a galaxy. It\u2019s a biological map that shows insulin-producing cells in the pancreas of a mouse. Red marks rogue T cells that destroy insulin production. Yellow indicates those peacemaker regulatory T cells \u2014 and they're outnumbered.",
      "Green's team aims to use that mRNA to instruct certain immune \u201cgenerals\u201d to curb the bad T cells and send in more peacemakers. They package the mRNA in biodegradable nanoparticles that can be injected like a drug. When the right immune cells get the messages, the hope is they'd \u201cdivide, divide, divide and make a whole army of healthy cells that then help treat the disease,\" Green said.",

      "A drug for Type 1 diabetes \u201cis forging the path,\u201d said Dr. Kevin Deane at the University of Colorado Anshutz.",

      "Deane studies rheumatoid arthritis and hopes to find a similar way to block the joint-destroying disease.",
      "About 30% of people with a certain self-reactive antibody in their blood will eventually develop RA. A new study tracked some of those people for seven years, mapping immune changes leading to the disease long before joints become swollen or painful.",
      "Those changes are potential drug targets, Deane said. While researchers hunt possible compounds to test, he\u2019s leading another study called StopRA: National to find and learn from more at-risk people.",
      "On all these fronts, there\u2019s a tremendous amount of research left to do \u2014 and no guarantees. There are questions about CAR-T's safety and how long its effects last, but it is furthest along in testing.",
      "Allie Rubin, 60, of Boca Raton, Florida, spent three decades battling lupus, including scary hospitalizations when it attacked her spinal cord. But she qualified for CAR-T when she also developed lymphoma \u2014 and while a serious side effect delayed her recovery, next month will mark two years without a sign of either cancer or lupus.",
      "\u201cI just remember I woke up one day and thought, \u2018Oh my god, I don\u2019t feel sick anymore,\u2019\u201d she said.",
      "That kind of result has researchers optimistic.",
      "\"We\u2019ve never been closer to getting to \u2014 and we don\u2019t like to say it \u2014 a potential cure,\u201d said Hopkins' Konig. \u201cI think the next 10 years will dramatically change our field forever.\u201d",

      "Amazon Background: Trump was once highly critical of company founder Jeff Bezos, who also owns The Washington Post, but has been much less so lately. Amazon donated $1 million to Trump's inauguration, an event attended by Bezos. Its video streaming service paid $40 million to license a documentary about first lady Melania Trump. Its cloud-based computing operation, Amazon Web Services, is a major government contractor.",
      "Apple Background: After an up-and-down relationship during Trump's first term, CEO Tim Cook has sought to improve his standing with the president this time. Before returning to the White House, Trump hosted Cook at his Palm Beach estate, Mar-a-Lago, and said he had spoken with Cook about the company\u2019s long-running tax battles with the European Union. Cook also donated $1 million to Trump\u2019s inauguration fund. In the spring, Trump threatened the computing giant with tariffs after Apple announced plans to build manufacturing facilities in India. In August, Cook presented the president with a customized glass plaque with a gold base as the CEO announced plans to bring Apple's total investment commitment in U.S. manufacturing over four years to $600 billion.",
      "Google Background: During his first term, Trump\u2019s administration sued Google for antitrust violations. While a candidate last year, Trump suggested he might seek to break up the search engine behemoth. Once Trump won the election, Google donated $1 million to his inauguration, and its CEO, Sundar Pichai, joined other major tech executives in attending the ceremony. Google's subsidiary, YouTube, agreed in September to pay $24.5 million to settle a lawsuit with Trump after it suspended his account following the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol. According to court filings, $22 million of that went to the Trust for the National Mall, which can help pay for ballroom construction.",

      "Global leaders have descended upon Brazil for COP30, and with the conference often comes a lot of negative news that evokes climate anxiety and dread",
      "Every autumn, news feeds get flooded with stories about climate change. That's because around this time each year, global leaders gather to discuss collective efforts to limit our emissions of planet-warming gases, released primarily from oil, gas and coal.",
      "Some of the information coming out of the COP30 conference is bleak. But it's not just COP. Climate stories can be difficult to consume year-round, whether it's about natural disasters, victims of heat waves or sea level rise or new studies about global warming impacts.",
      "\u201cWhen you throw a ton of scary facts and information at people, their nervous system shuts down. It\u2019s a coping mechanism,\u201d said Sarah Newman, founder and executive director of the Climate Mental Health Network.",

While Generalized Anxiety Disorder often involves the part of the brain that handles fear, threat and emotion, climate anxiety activates parts of the brain that help with high cognition, willpower and tenacity.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an ongoing larger problem that I need to attend to over time and that is largely out of my control,\u201d climate psychologist Thomas Doherty said. \u201dI can\u2019t just flip a switch around climate change.\u201d",
      "The anxiety is more complex than a stove left on, because climate change is a more complex problem. The threat is indefinite, it\u2019s largely out of each person\u2019s control and addressing it requires repeated and variable action.",
      "Doherty, who wrote a book about coping with climate anxiety, said that it isn't inherently negative. It's a natural reaction to a threat, and it's the first step in a cyclical relationship with climate change.",
      "\u201cThe rest of the cycle is ultimately taking some action to resolve the threat as best that we can,\u201d he said.",

Another one is the 5-4-3-2-1 technique, where you identify five things you can see, four things you can touch, three things you can hear, two things you can smell and one thing you can taste.",

      "China has a new visa scheme that is creating job opportunities for foreign professionals, part of its effort to attract global talent and gain an edge in global technology",
      "HONG KONG -- Vaishnavi Srinivasagopalan, a skilled Indian IT professional who has worked in both India and the U.S., has been looking for work in China. Beijing's new K-visa program targeting science and technology workers could turn that dream into a reality.",
      "The K-visa rolled out by Beijing last month is part of China\u2019s widening effort to catch up with the U.S. in the race for global talent and cutting edge technology. It coincides with uncertainties over the U.S.'s H-1B program under tightened immigrations policies implemented by President Donald Trump.",
      "\u201c(The) K-visa for China (is) an equivalent to the H-1B for the U.S.,\u201d said Srinivasagopalan, who is intrigued by China\u2019s working environment and culture after her father worked at a Chinese university a few years back. \u201cIt is a good option for people like me to work abroad.\u201d",
      "The K-visa supplements China's existing visa schemes including the R-visa for foreign professionals, but with loosened requirements, such as not requiring an applicant to have a job offer before applying.",
      "Stricter U.S. policies toward foreign students and scholars under Trump, including the raising of fees for the H-1B visa for foreign skilled workers to $100,000 for new applicants, are leading some non-American professionals and students to consider going elsewhere.",
      "\u201cStudents studying in the U.S. hoped for an (H-1B) visa, but currently this is an issue,\u201d said Bikash Kali Das, an Indian masters student of international relations at Sichuan University in China.",
      "China is striking while the iron is hot.",
      "The ruling Communist Party has made global leadership in advanced technologies a top priority, paying massive government subsidies to support research and development of areas such as artificial intelligence, semiconductors and robotics.",
      "\u201cBeijing perceives the tightening of immigration policies in the U.S. as an opportunity to position itself globally as welcoming foreign talent and investment more broadly,\u201d said Barbara Kelemen, associate director and head of Asia at security intelligence firm Dragonfly.",
      "Unemployment among Chinese graduates remains high, and competition is intense for jobs in scientific and technical fields. But there is a skills gap China's leadership is eager to fill. For decades, China has been losing top talent to developed countries as many stayed and worked in the U.S. and Europe after they finished studies there.",
      "The brain drain has not fully reversed.",
      "Many Chinese parents still see Western education as advanced and are eager to send their children abroad, said Alfred Wu, an associate professor at the National University of Singapore.",
      "Still, in recent years, a growing number of professionals including AI experts, scientists and engineers have moved to China from the U.S., including Chinese-Americans. Fei Su, a chip architect at Intel, and Ming Zhou, a leading engineer at U.S.-based software firm Altair, were among those who have taken teaching jobs in China this year.",
      "Many skilled workers in India and Southeast Asia have already expressed interest about the K-visa, said Edward Hu, a Shanghai-based immigration director at the consultancy Newland Chase.",
      "With the jobless rate for Chinese aged 16-24 excluding students at nearly 18%, the campaign to attract more foreign professionals is raising questions.",
      "\u201cThe current job market is already under fierce competition,\u201d said Zhou Xinying, a 24-year-old postgraduate student in behavioral science at eastern China's Zhejiang University.",

      "Kyle Huang, a 26-year-old software engineer based in the southern city of Guangzhou, said his peers in the science and technology fields fear the new visa scheme \u201cmight threaten local job opportunities\u201d.",
      "A recent commentary published by a state-backed news outlet, the Shanghai Observer, downplayed such concerns, saying that bringing in such foreign professionals will benefit the economy. As China advances in areas such as AI and cutting-edge semiconductors, there is a \u201cgap and mismatch\u201d between qualified jobseekers and the demand for skilled workers, it said.",
      "\u201cThe more complex the global environment, the more China will open its arms,\u201d it said.",
      "\u201cBeijing will need to emphasize how select foreign talent can create, not take, local jobs,\u201d said Michael Feller, chief strategist at consultancy Geopolitical Strategy. \u201cBut even Washington has shown that this is politically a hard argument to make, despite decades of evidence.\u201d",
      "Recruitment and immigration specialists say foreign workers face various hurdles in China. One is the language barrier. The ruling Communist Party's internet censorship, known as the \u201cGreat Firewall,\u201d is another drawback.",
      "A country of about 1.4 billion, China had only an estimated 711,000 foreign workers residing in the country as of 2023.",
      "The U.S. still leads in research and has the advantage of using English widely. There's also still a relatively clearer pathway to residency for many, said David Stepat, country director for Singapore at the consultancy Dezan Shira & Associates.",
      "Nikhil Swaminathan, an Indian H1-B visa holder working for a U.S. non-profit organization after finishing graduate school there, is interested in China\u2019s K-visa but skeptical. \u201cI would\u2019ve considered it. China\u2019s a great place to work in tech, if not for the difficult relationship between India and China,\u201d he said.",
      "Given a choice, many jobseekers still are likely to aim for jobs in leading global companies outside China.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. is probably more at risk of losing would-be H-1B applicants to other Western economies, including the UK and European Union, than to China,\u201d said Feller at Geopolitical Strategy.",
      "\"The U.S. may be sabotaging itself, but it\u2019s doing so from a far more competitive position in terms of its attractiveness to talent,\u201d Feller said. \u201cChina will need to do far more than offer convenient visa pathways to attract the best.\u201d",

In her review, Jocelyn Noveck writes, \u201cThe chief weakness of \u2018Freakier Friday\u2019 \u2014 an amiable, often joyful and certainly chaotic reunion \u2014 is that while it hews overly closely to the structure, storyline and even dialogue of the original, it tries too hard to up the ante.

      "A program in New Mexico highlights the contributions of women through historical markers",
      "SANTA FE, N.M. -- On a recent field trip to view historical markers in New Mexico\u2019s capital city of Santa Fe, seventh grader Raffi Paglayan noted the range of careers and contributions made by the women featured on them.",
      "Paglayan\u2019s favorite was Katherine Stinson Otero, a skywriter who was one of the first women to obtain a pilot\u2019s license in the U.S. After Stinson Otero contracted tuberculosis while driving ambulances in World War I, she moved to New Mexico and started a second career as a renowned architect.",
      "\u201cShe seems pretty cool,\u201d Paglayan said with a smile.",
      "Introducing New Mexicans to women from the state's history is the goal of a decades-long program that has put up nearly 100 roadside markers featuring the significant contributions of women from or with ties to New Mexico. Now the New Mexico Historic Women Marker Program is branching out to create a curriculum for schools based on its research.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just so essential that all students, not just female students, but every student has the ability to recognize and see the significance of the people that have done so much work to create what we have,\u201d said Lisa Nordstrum, the education director and middle school teacher who took Paglayan and her classmates on the field trip.",
      "The road marker efforts started decades ago. Pat French, a founding member of the International Women's Forum - New Mexico, a leadership and networking group, noticed in the 1980s that there were hardly any women mentioned in any of the state's historic roadside markers. In 2006, the group secured state funding to work with the New Mexico Department of Transportation to change that.",
      "Over the years, the group visited individual counties and Native American communities, asking for stories about important women in their history. The research compiled biographies of dozens of women from precolonial times through the Spanish and Mexican territory periods, and into the time when New Mexico became a state.",
      "Now those women's stories are displayed on 6-foot signs across the state and in an online database. While some honor well-known historical figures such as American modernist painter Georgia O\u2019Keeffe and New Mexico's first female Secretary of State Soledad Ch\u00e1vez de Chac\u00f3n, many others feature local women whose stories have not been widely told.",
      "For example, Evelyn Vigil and Juanita Toledo are remembered for reviving the Pecos Pueblo style of pottery in the 1970s, after the indigenous Pecos Pueblo population was decimated by years of disease and war by the 1890s, and the pottery techniques were lost.",
      "\u201cThere is just a sense of justice about it,\u201d said program director Kris Pettersen. \u201cThese women put all this effort in and made all these contributions, and they were unrecognized, and that\u2019s just wrong.\u201d",
      "Other markers are dedicated to groups of women, such as healers and the state's female military veterans. The collection notes that the history of the state cannot be told without recognizing the conflict that came with colonialization and the wars fought over the territory.",
      "\u201cThey are not, however, the first women to take up arms and defend their homes and society in our region,\u201d the veterans' online blurb notes. \u201cNew Mexico is a state of culturally diverse people who have protected themselves over many centuries.\u201d",

These are the strictest abortion prohibitions and punishments in the nation being considered by South Carolina lawmakers, even as opponents of the procedure are divided over how far to go.",
      "The bill faces a long legislative path and uncertain prospects, even if it clears the state Senate subcommittee that's reviewing it.",
      "But the measure up for a second hearing Tuesday would go further than any considered since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, as abortion remains an unsettled issue in conservative states.",
      "The proposal would ban all abortions unless the woman's life is at risk and eliminates exceptions for rape and incest victims up to 12 weeks. Current law blocks abortions after cardiac activity is detected, which is typically six weeks into a pregnancy, before many women know they are pregnant.",
      "The proposal would also go further than any other U.S. state. Women who get an abortion and anyone who helps them could face up to 30 years in prison. It appears to ban any contraception that prevents a fertilized egg from implanting. That would ban IUDs and could strictly limit in-vitro fertilization.",
      "Providing information about abortions would be illegal, leaving doctors worried they couldn't suggest legal abortion elsewhere.",
      "OB-GYN Natalie Gregory said passing a bill like this would make so many discussions in her practice \u2014 from contraceptives to losing a pregnancy to in-vitro fertilization options \u2014 a \u201clegal minefield\" that could have her risking decades in prison.",
      "\"It constitutes a unconstitutional reach that threatens the very fabric of health care in our state,\u201d she said during an eight-hour public hearing on the bill last month, adding that the proposal is both a waste of time and public money.",
      "The proposal has even split groups that oppose abortion and once celebrated together when South Carolina passed the six-week ban in 2021, a trigger law set to take effect if Roe v. Wade was overturned.",
      "South Carolina Citizens for Life, one of the state\u2019s largest and oldest opponents of abortion, issued a statement the day of last month's hearing saying it can\u2019t support the bill because women who get abortions are victims too and shouldn\u2019t be punished.",
      "On the other side, at least for this bill, are groups like Equal Protection South Carolina. \u201cAbortion is murder and should be treated as such,\u201d the group\u2019s founder Mark Corral said.",

They also have enough influence to get lawmakers to listen.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not going to go away. The trajectory keeps shifting and the abolitionists have more influence,\u201d Ziegler said.",
      "As the nation's social and political discussions lurch to the right, with debates over whether same-sex marriage should be made illegal again or whether women should work outside the home, Ziegler said it has become easier to push for restrictions that might have never been brought before legislatures before.",
      "\"There is more breathing room for abolitionists now,\" she said.",
      "A similar House bill last year got a public hearing but went no further. As the subcommittee met, Republican House leaders issued a statement that they were happy with the current state law and that bill went nowhere.",

Three of them unseated the Senate\u2019s only Republican women, a trio who called themselves the Sister Senators after helping block a stricter abortion ban after Roe v. Wade was overturned.",

      "The shooting occurred around 10:30 a.m. Three Osage County sheriff\u2019s deputies and one Kansas Highway Patrol trooper were shot, the KBI\u2019s director and the patrol\u2019s superintendent said.",
      "Two deputies underwent surgery at a Topeka hospital and were in good condition, the KBI said, and the third deputy was discharged. The trooper was transferred from the same hospital to the University of Kansas Medical Center in Kansas City, Kansas.",
      "\u201cAfter being on scene less than 10 minutes, gunfire erupted,\u201d patrol Superintendent Erik Smith said during a news conference at the Carbondale City Library.",
      "Carbondale is a town of about 1,300 people about 16 miles (26 kilometers) south of Topeka, the state capital, off Interstate 75.",
      "The shooting stunned neighbors John and Heather Roberts, who live about a mile north of where it occurred on the same two-lane road. They never sensed any problem in any of the family members, such as drugs, alcohol abuse or violence, and they said the suspect's grandmother gave Christian books to area children she knew.",
      "They said it is not uncommon to see law enforcement vehicles on the road outside their home because they live at the line between Osage County, home to Carbondale, and Shawnee County, home to Topeka, and vehicles turn around there or the counties exchange prisoners.",
      "John Roberts said he was putting siding on his barn when two law enforcement vehicles flew down the road in the morning.",

      "Daniel Edwin Wilson of Louisville, Kentucky, was under investigation for his role in the riot when authorities found six guns and roughly 4,800 rounds of ammunition in his home. Because of prior felony convictions, it was illegal for him to possess firearms.",
      "The charges became part of a legal debate over whether Trump's pardons for Jan. 6 rioters applied to other crimes discovered during the sprawling federal dragnet that began after the attack on the Capitol. The Trump-appointed federal judge who oversaw Wilson\u2019s case criticized the Justice Department earlier this year for arguing that the president\u2019s Jan. 6 pardons applied to Wilson\u2019s gun offense.",
      "Wilson, who had been scheduled to remain in prison until 2028, was released Friday evening following the pardon, his lawyer said on Saturday.",

      "The Georgia election interference case against Donald Trump and others is now in the hands of a new prosecutor",
      "ATLANTA -- The fate of the Georgia election interference case against President Donald Trump and others is now in the hands of a new prosecutor who has to decide how he is going to move forward with the sprawling indictment.",
      "After courts removed Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis over an \u201cappearance of impropriety\u201d created by a romantic relationship with the special prosecutor she had chosen to lead the case, it was up to the Prosecuting Attorneys' Council to someone to take over. Council Executive Director Pete Skandalakis said Friday that he would handle the case himself after he was unable to find anyone else willing to do it.",
      "The indictment against Trump and 18 others was returned by a grand jury in August 2023 and uses the state\u2019s anti-racketeering law to allege a wide-ranging conspiracy to illegally overturn Trump\u2019s narrow loss to Democrat Joe Biden in Georgia.",
      "Here are some things to know about Skandalakis and what might come next for this prosecution.",
      "When a prosecutor recuses or is removed from a case in Georgia, the executive director of the nonpartisan Prosecuting Attorneys' Council steps in to appoint a substitute prosecutor. Skandalakis, who has led the agency since January 2018, said in an e-mailed statement that he contacted several prosecutors about taking over the election interference case and they all declined.",
      "The judge overseeing the case had said that if a new prosecutor wasn't appointed by Friday, he would dismiss the case. Skandalakis said that while he could easily have let the judge's deadline pass without appointing anyone and allowed the case to be dismissed, he \u201cdid not believe that to be the right course of action.\u201d",
      "He acknowledged that he had not had a chance to fully review the case, having only recently received from Willis' office 101 boxes of documents and an eight-terabyte hard drive with the full investigative file. Appointing himself to the case, he said, \u201cwill allow me to complete a comprehensive review and make an informed decision regarding how best to proceed.\u201d",
      "Prior to his time at the council, Skandalakis spent about 25 years as the elected Republican district attorney for the Coweta Judicial Circuit, southwest of Atlanta. But former Gwinnett County District Attorney Danny Porter, who has known Skandalakis for more than 40 years, said they shared a philosophy that the district attorney's office should be nonpartisan.",
      "\u201cI wouldn\u2019t put too much weight on the fact that he ran as a Republican,\u201d Porter said. \u201cI feel certain that he\u2019s going to do what he said he\u2019s going to do and give it a fair and transparent review and come to conclusions based on the law and the facts.\u201d",
      "Skandalakis is no stranger to sensitive high-profile cases. He took on the investigation into the June 2020 shooting death of Rayshard Brooks, a Black man, by a white police officer after Willis recused her office from the case. He ultimately decided that the two officers involved had acted reasonably, and he declined to pursue charges.",
      "Skandalakis will continue to review the case file to decide how he wants to proceed. The judge has set a Dec. 1 status hearing and said the prosecution should be prepared to say at that time whether it intends to seek a new indictment in the case.",

But Porter, who has served as a substitute prosecutor, said the first step is generally to get the case filed, which Skandalakis has done. Then, Porter said, it is not improper to have a discussion with the removed prosecutor about their summary of the case, but that should be the last contact between the two prosecution teams about the case.",
      "Then the substitute prosecutor would start from scratch, figuring out how the case is organized, determining the budget and resources needed to handle it and figuring out how to handle it.",
      "The size of this case makes all that a \u201cnearly impossible task for one person to do,\u201d Porter said. While Skandalakis has a \u201cgreat staff\u201d with some really talented prosecutors, they all have other cases on their plates.",
      "The Prosecuting Attorneys' Council has a tight budget, and the state legislature is dominated by Republicans, many loyal to Trump, who are unlikely to grant any special appropriations for this prosecution. But Skandalakis could look for money elsewhere to hire contract attorneys and cover other expenses, Porter said.",
      "Then Skandalakis will have to decide whether he wants to continue on the course that Willis had charted, pursue only some of the charges or dismiss the case.",
      "\u201cI think the case as it's indicted is completely untryable,\u201d Porter said, adding that he would try to slim it down, either by seeking a new indictment or asking the judge to sever some counts to break it down into smaller cases, Porter said.",
      "The indictment includes charges related to a Jan. 2, 2021, phone call between Trump and Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger during which Trump urged the state\u2019s top elections official to help him \u201cfind\u201d the votes he needed to win. Other charges have to do with a getting a slate of Republican electors to falsely declare that Trump won the state, allegations of harassment of a Georgia election worker and a breach of election equipment in a rural south Georgia county.",
      "Four of the 19 people charged pleaded guilty after reaching deals with prosecutors in the months following their indictment. Trump and the other 14 people charged have all pleaded not guilty. It seems unlikely that any action against Trump could proceed while he is in office, but the others do not have that shield.",

      "\u201cTen \u2014 how do you say 10 in Yup'ik?\u201d the teacher asked.",
      "\u201cQula!\u201d the students answered in unison.",
      "Martin and her family were among hundreds of people airlifted to Anchorage, the state's largest city, after the remnants of Typhoon Halong inundated their small coastal villages along the Bering Sea last month, dislodging dozens of homes and floating them away \u2014 many with people inside. The floods left nearly 700 homes destroyed or heavily damaged. One person died, two remain missing.",
      "As the residents grapple with uprooted lives very different from the traditional ones they left, some of the children are finding a measure of familiarity in a school-based immersion program that focuses on their Yup\u2019ik language and culture \u2014 one of two such programs in the state.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m learning more Yup\u2019ik,\u201d said Martin, who added that she's using the language to communicate with her mother, teachers and classmates. \u201cI usually speak more Yup\u2019ik in villages, but mostly more English in cities.\u201d",
      "There are more than 100 languages spoken in the homes of Anchorage School District students. Yup\u2019ik, which is spoken by about 10,000 people in the state, is the fifth most common. The district adopted its first language immersion program \u2014 Japanese \u2014 in 1989, and subsequently added Spanish, Mandarin Chinese, German, French and Russian.",
      "After many requests from parents, the district obtained a federal grant and added a K-12 Yup'ik immersion program about nine years ago. The students in the first class are now eighth-graders. The program is based at College Gate Elementary and Wendler Middle School.",
      "The principal at College Gate Elementary, Darrell Berntsen, is himself Alaska Native \u2014 Sugpiaq, from Kodiak Island, south of Anchorage. His mother was 12 years old in 1964 when the magnitude-9.2 Great Alaska Earthquake and an ensuing tsunami devastated her village of Old Harbor. He recalls her stories of joining other villagers at high ground and watching as the surge of water carried homes out to sea.",
      "His mother and her family evacuated to a shelter in Anchorage, but returned to Kodiak Island when Old Harbor was rebuilt. Berntsen grew up living a subsistence life \u2014 \u201cthe greatest time of my life was being able to go out duck hunting, go out deer hunting,\" he said \u2014 and he understands what the evacuees from Kipnuk, Kwigillingok and other damaged villages have left behind.",
      "He has also long had an interest in preserving Alaska Native culture and languages. His ex-wife\u2019s grandmother, Marie Smith Jones, was the last fluent speaker of Eyak, an indigenous language from south-central Alaska, when she died in 2008. His uncles had their hands slapped when they spoke their indigenous Alutiiq language at school.",
      "As the evacuees arrived in Anchorage in the days after last month's flooding, Berntsen greeted them at an arena where the Red Cross had set up a shelter. He invited families to enroll their children in the Yup'ik immersion program. Many of the parents showed him photos of the duck, goose, moose, seal or other traditional foods they had saved for the winter \u2014 stockpiles that washed away or spoiled in the flood.",
      "\u201cListening is a big part of our culture \u2014 hearing their stories, letting them know that, \u2018Hey, I live here in Anchorage, I\u2019m running one of my schools, the Yup\u2019ik immersion program, you guys are welcome at our school,\u2019\u201d Berntsen said. \"Do everything we can to make them feel comfortable in the most uncomfortable situation that they\u2019ve ever been through.\u201d",

      "Aliralria likes the immersion program and learning more phrases, even though the Yup\u2019ik dialect being spoken is a bit different from the one she knows.",

      "Berntsen is planning to help the new students acclimate by holding activities such as gym nights or Olympic-style events, featuring activities that mimic Alaska Native hunting and fishing techniques. One example: the seal hop, in which participants assume a plank position and shuffle across the floor to emulate how hunters sneak up on seals napping on the ice.",
      "The Yup'ik immersion program is helping undo some of the damage Western culture did to Alaska Native language and traditions, he said. It's also bridging the gap of two lost generations: In some cases, the children's parents or grandparents never learned Yup'ik, but the students can now speak with their great-grandparents, Locke said.",
      "\u201cI took this as a great opportunity for us to give back some of what the trauma had taken from our Indigenous people,\u201d Berntsen said.",

But he was told that if he followed the rules and stayed out of trouble, after some years he could apply. As a U.S. citizen, he would have protection.",
      "It\u2019s what made him decide to apply: the premise \u2014 and the promise \u2014 that when he became a naturalized American citizen, it would create a bond between him and his new home. He would have rights as well as responsibilities, like voting, that, as he was making a commitment to the country, the country was making one to him.",
      "\u201cWhen I raised my hand and took the oath of allegiance, I did believe that moment the promise that I belonged,\u201d said Sesay, 44, who first arrived in Louisiana more than 15 years ago and now works as an advocate for refugees and their integration into American society.",
      "But in recent months, as President Donald Trump reshapes immigration and the country's relationship with immigrants, that belief has been shaken for Sesay and other naturalized citizens. There's now fear that the push to drastically increase deportations and shift who can claim America as home, through things like trying to end birthright citizenship, is having a ripple effect.",
      "What they thought was the bedrock protection of naturalization now feels more like quicksand.",
      "Some are worried that if they leave the country, they will have difficulties when trying to return, fearful because of accounts of naturalized citizens being questioned or detained by U.S. border agents. They wonder: Do they need to lock down their phones to protect their privacy? Others are hesitant about moving around within the country, after stories like that of a U.S. citizen accused of being here illegally and detained even after his mother produced his birth certificate.",
      "Sesay said he doesn't travel domestically anymore without his passport, despite having a REAL ID with its federally mandated, stringent identity requirements.",
      "Immigration enforcement roundups, often conducted by masked, unidentifiable federal agents in places including Chicago and New York City, have at times included American citizens in their dragnets. One U.S. citizen who says he was detained by immigration agents twice has filed a federal lawsuit.",
      "Adding to the worries, the Justice Department issued a memo this summer saying it would ramp up efforts to denaturalize immigrants who\u2019ve committed crimes or are deemed to present a national security risk. At one point during the summer, Trump threatened the citizenship of Zohran Mamdani, the 34-year-old democratic socialist mayor-elect of New York City, who naturalized as a young adult.",
      "The atmosphere makes some worried to speak about it publicly, for fear of drawing negative attention to themselves. Requests for comment through several community organizations and other connections found no takers willing to go on the record other than Sesay.",
      "In New Mexico, state Sen. Cindy Nava says she's familiar with the fear, having grown up undocumented before getting DACA \u2014 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, the Obama-era program that protected people brought to the U.S. as children from being deported \u2014 and gaining citizenship through her marriage. But she hadn't expected to see so much fear among naturalized citizens.",

      "What citizenship has meant, and who was included, has expanded and contracted over the course of American history, said Stephen Kantrowitz, professor of history at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. He said while the word \u201ccitizen\u201d is in the original Constitution, it is not defined.",
      "\u201cWhen the Constitution is written, nobody knows what citizenship means,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a term of art, it comes out of the French revolutionary tradition. It sort of suggests an equality of the members of a political community, and it has some implications for the right to be a member of that political community. But it is ... so undefined.\u201d",
      "The first naturalization law passed in 1790 by the new country\u2019s Congress said citizenship was for any \u201cfree white person\u201d of good character. Those of African descent or nativity were added as a specific category to federal immigration law after the ravages of the Civil War in the 19th century, which was also when the 14th Amendment was added to the Constitution to establish birthright citizenship.",
      "In the last years of the 19th century and into the 20th century, laws were put on the books limiting immigration and, by extension, naturalization. The Immigration Act of 1924 effectively barred people from Asia because they were ineligible for naturalization, being neither white nor Black. That didn't change until 1952, when an immigration law removed racial restrictions on who could be naturalized. The 1965 Immigration and Naturalization Act replaced the previous immigration system with one that portioned out visas equally among nations.",
      "American history also includes times when those who had citizenship had it taken away, like after the 1923 Supreme Court ruling in U.S. vs. Bhagat Singh Thind. That ruling said that Indians couldn't be naturalized because they did not qualify as white and led to several dozen denaturalizations. At other times, it was ignored, as in World War II, when Japanese Americans were forced into internment camps.",
      "\u201cPolitical power will sometimes simply decide that a group of people, or a person or a family isn\u2019t entitled to citizenship,\u201d Kantrowitz said.",
      "In this moment, Sesay says, it feels like betrayal.",
      "\u201cThe United States of America \u2014 that\u2019s what I took that oath of allegiance, that\u2019s what I make commitment to,\u201d Sesay said. \u201cNow, inside my home country, and I\u2019m seeing a shift. ... Honestly, that is not the America I believe in when I put my hand over my heart.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- The Justice Department posted pardons online bearing identical copies of President Donald Trump\u2019s signature before quietly correcting them this week after what the agency called a \u201ctechnical error.\u201d",
      "The replacements came after online commenters seized on striking similarities in the president's signature across a series of pardons dated Nov. 7, including those granted to former New York Mets player Darryl Strawberry, former Tennessee House speaker Glen Casada and former New York police sergeant Michael McMahon. In fact, the signatures on several pardons initially uploaded to the Justice Department's website were identical, two forensic document experts confirmed to The Associated Press.",
      "Within hours of the online speculation, the administration replaced copies of the pardons with new ones that did not feature identical signatures. It insisted Trump, who mercilessly mocked his predecessor\u2019s use of an autopen, had originally signed all the Nov. 7 pardons himself and blamed \u201ctechnical\u201d and staffing issues for the error, which has no bearing on the validity of the clemency actions.",

      "\u201cA basic axiom of handwriting identification science is that no two signatures are going to bear the exact same design features in every aspect,\u201d said Tom Vastrick, a Florida-based handwriting expert who is president of the American Society of Questioned Document Examiners.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very straightforward,\u201d said Vastrick, who compared the apparently identical images, now only visible through the online Internet Archive, with the replacements at AP\u2019s request.",
      "Chad Gilmartin, a Justice Department spokesperson, said the \u201cwebsite was updated after a technical error where one of the signatures President Trump personally signed was mistakenly uploaded multiple times due to staffing issues caused by the Democrat shutdown.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere is no story here other than the fact that President Trump signed seven pardons by hand and DOJ posted those same seven pardons with seven unique signatures to our website,\u201d Gilmartin said in a statement to AP, referring to the latest wave of clemency Trump has granted in recent weeks.",

His Republican allies in Congress last month released a blistering critique of Biden's alleged \u201cdiminished faculties\u201d and mental state during his term that ranked the Democrat\u2019s use of the autopen among \u201cthe greatest scandals in U.S. history.\u201d",

      "New data the Agriculture Department released Friday created serious doubts about whether China will really buy millions of bushels of American soybeans like the Trump administration touted last month",
      "OMAHA, Neb. -- New data the Agriculture Department released Friday created serious doubts about whether China will really buy millions of bushels of American soybeans like the Trump administration touted last month after a high-stakes meeting between President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping.",
      "The USDA report released after the government reopened showed only two Chinese purchases of American soybeans since the summit in South Korea that totaled 332,000 metric tons. That's well short of the 12 million metric tons that Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said China agreed to purchase by January and nowhere near the 25 million metric tons she said they would buy in each of the next three years.",
      "American farmers were hopeful that their biggest customer would resume buying their crops. But CoBank's Tanner Ehmke, who is its lead economist for grains and oilseed, said there isn't much incentive for China to buy from America right now because they have plenty of soybeans on hand that they have bought from Brazil and other South American countries this year, and the remaining tariffs ensure that U.S. soybeans remain more expensive than Brazilian beans.",
      "\u201cWe are still not even close to what has been advertised from the U.S. in terms of what the agreement would have been,\u201d Ehmke said.",
      "Beijing has yet to confirm any detailed soybean purchase agreement but only that the two sides have reached \u201cconsensus\u201d on expanding trade in farm products. Ehmke said that even if China did promise to buy American soybeans it may have only agreed to buy them if the price was attractive.",
      "Trump said his team spoke with Chinese officials today and they assured the White House they would be purchasing more soybeans, but he didn't offer any details of how much.",
      "\u201cThey're in the process of doing not only a little bit but they'll be doing a lot of soybean purchases,\u201d he told reporters.",
      "The Chinese tariff on American beans remains high at about 24%, despite a 10-percentage-point reduction following the summit.",
      "Soybean prices fell sharply by 23 cents to $11.24 per bushel Friday. Ehmke said \u201cthat\u2019s the market being shocked by the lack of Chinese demand that was confirmed in USDA data today.\u201d Prices are still higher than they were before the agreement when they were selling for $10.60 per bushel, but the price may continue to drop unless there are significant new purchases.",
      "Before the trade agreement, Trump had promised farmers would receive an aid package to help them survive the trade war with China. That was put on hold during the shutdown, and now it's not clear whether the administration will offer farmers aid like Trump did in his first administration.",
      "American farmers have been through this before after Trump's first trade war with China. The trade agreement China signed with the United States in 2020 promised massive purchases of U.S. crops. But the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted trade between the two nations just as the agreement went into effect. In 2022, U.S. farm exports to China hit a record, but then fell.",

      "But farmers are dealing with the soaring cost of fertilizer, seed, equipment and labor this year, and that is hurting their profits. The Kentucky farmer who is president of the American Soybean Association, Caleb Ragland, has said he worries that thousands of farmers could go out of business this year without significant Chinese purchases or government aid.",
      "Ragland said he's still optimistic that China will follow through on the purchases, but it's hard to be confident in that right now with so few sales reported.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t want to assume they won\u2019t. But it\u2019s going to be a wonderful day when we actually deliver those soybeans, and when there\u2019s my money in hand and so forth and the transaction's complete,\u201d Ragland said.",
      "China is the world\u2019s largest buyer of soybeans. China bought more than $12.5 billion worth of the nearly $24.5 billion worth of U.S. soybeans that were exported last year.",
      "But China quit buying American soybeans this year after Trump imposed his tariffs and continued to shift more of their purchases over to South America. Even before the trade war, Brazilian beans accounted for more than 70% of China\u2019s imports last year, while the U.S. share fell to 21%, World Bank data shows.",
      "Ragland said that every vender he talks to has told him they are increasing their prices for next year, which will continue to put pressure on farmers.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re still looking at sharp losses and the red ink as we figure budgets for 26 is still very much in play,\u201d he said.",

      "President Donald Trump's administration has appealed a ruling that bars it from deploying the National Guard to Portland, Oregon",
      "PORTLAND, Ore. -- President Donald Trump\u2019s administration on Friday appealed a ruling from a federal judge in Oregon that barred it from deploying the National Guard to Portland.",
      "The ruling last week from U.S. District Court Judge Karin Immergut, a Trump appointee, followed a three-day trial in which both sides argued over whether protests at the city\u2019s U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement building met the conditions for using the military domestically under federal law. The city and state filed the lawsuit in September to block the deployment.",
      "In a 106-page opinion, Immergut found that even though the president is entitled to \u201cgreat deference\u201d in his decision on whether to call up the Guard, he did not have a legal basis for doing so because he did not establish that there was a rebellion or danger of rebellion, or that he was unable to enforce the law with regular forces.",
      "The administration criticized the decision and said the troops were needed to protect federal personnel and property in a city that Trump has described as \u201cwar ravaged.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe district court\u2019s ruling made it clear that this administration must be accountable to the truth and to the rule of law,\u201d Oregon Attorney General Dan Rayfield said in an emailed statement Friday in response to the administration's appeal. \u201cWe will keep defending Oregon values and standing up for our state\u2019s authority to make decisions grounded in evidence and common sense.\u201d",

The first order blocked Trump from deploying 200 members of the Oregon National Guard; the second, issued a day later, blocked him from deploying members of any state\u2019s National Guard to Oregon, after he tried to evade the first order by sending California troops instead.",
      "The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has already ordered that troops not be deployed pending further action by the appeals court.",
      "Democratic cities targeted by Trump for military involvement \u2014 including Chicago, which filed a separate lawsuit on the issue that is now before the U.S. Supreme Court \u2014 have been pushing back.

      "A federal prosecutor in Wyoming pledges to \u201crigorously\u201d prosecute people for small amounts of marijuana in national parks and on other public lands",
      "FORT COLLINS, Colo. -- Getting high around a campfire in a national park, especially in Wyoming, is likelier to get you prosecuted under a new Justice Department policy cracking down on minor marijuana offenses on federal land.",
      "The new guidance for marijuana on federal land reverses a policy from the end of Joe Biden's presidency that \u201csignificantly curtailed\u201d federal prosecution of misdemeanor marijuana offenses, according to U.S. Attorney for Wyoming Darin Smith.",
      "\u201cI want to make it clear for all of our law enforcement partners and everybody out there that we are, we have been, and will continue to enforce these laws,\u201d Smith said Thursday.",
      "Smith has been implementing the new Justice Department marijuana policy since it came out in late September, he said. His office and the Justice Department in Washington, D.C., declined to provide the document or the previous policy to The Associated Press.",
      "Wyoming is home to two busy national parks, Yellowstone and Grand Teton, and like many Western states has thousands of square miles (kilometers) of federal land where the policy applies.",
      "How many citations for marijuana are issued among the two parks' more than 8 million visitors each year wasn't readily available. Smith, who was sworn in as Wyoming's U.S. attorney in August, said his office handles thousands of cases and hasn\u2019t tracked recent minor marijuana prosecutions.",
      "Under state law, marijuana has remained illegal in Wyoming for either recreational or medical use. Marijuana is legal for medical use in most states and legal for recreational use in about half of states.",
      "But marijuana on federal land \u2014 be it a national park, national forest, or U.S. Bureau of Land Management area overseen on a day-to-day basis by federal law enforcement \u2014 is another matter. Federal law still classifies marijuana alongside substances such as heroin and LSD as a Schedule I drug considered to have high potential for abuse and no accepted medical benefit.",
      "The Interior Department, which oversees national parks through the National Park Service and federal law enforcement on tribal lands through the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs, declined by email to comment on the new policy other than saying it continued to enforce controlled substance laws.",
      "The federal change comes as President Donald Trump's administration seeks to reduce prosecution of some minor offenses in national parks. On Monday, for example, Trump pardoned a runner who left a trail during a record ascent and descent of Grand Teton, the highest peak in Wyoming's Teton Range.",
      "The new marijuana policy's practical effect will remain dictated by resources \u2014 namely how many law enforcement officers are available \u2014 to investigate marijuana offenses, said Laurie Levenson, a Loyola Marymount University professor and former federal prosecutor.",
      "\u201cWhat it means, though, is it gives a lot of discretion back to the federal law enforcement and rangers to decide if they want to bring charges,\u201d Levenson said.",

      "Read an excerpt below, in which Schwartz finds the inspiration of what will become his most successful musical production to date, when he discovers Gregory Maguire's prequel to L. Frank Baum's \"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\" \u2013 the genesis of the long-running Broadway musical \"Wicked.\"",

      "\"It's time to trust my instincts, close my eyes and leap!\" \u2014Wicked",
      "At the start of 1996, Stephen Schwartz never imagined he would end the year envisioning his next Broadway musical, Wicked. Movie songwriting seemed to be his future, especially after one eventful evening in March. He donned his newly-purchased black tuxedo and white silk dress shirt, strode across the red carpet, and met up with his Pocahontas writing partner Alan Menken at Los Angeles' Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. For forty-eight-year-old Schwartz, being nominated for an Academy Award was a welcome twist on his childhood dream of writing musicals for the stage. With his parents and wife in the audience, he waited for the announcement.",
      "\"And the Oscar for Best Original Musical or Comedy Score goes to\u2026\" An expectant silence settled in the hall while presenter Quincy Jones opened the envelope.",
      "\"Alan Menken, musical and orchestral score, and Stephen Schwartz, lyrics, for Pocahontas.\" Applause burst out while the pair made their way to the stage. As Menken thanked their Pocahontas music team, Schwartz clutched his golden statuette and smiled, looking down at Mel Gibson in the front row making funny faces at him and soaking in the acknowledgment from Hollywood. That evening he and Menken also stepped up to accept the award for Best Original Song, \"Colors of the Wind.\"",
      "Back home in Connecticut, he placed his gold-plated statuettes beside his Grammy gramophones in a trophy case converted from an aquarium that his kids no longer used.",
      "The rest of the year was a busy one, with the premiere of The Hunchback of Notre Dame and early work on The Prince of Egypt involving meetings with the DreamWorks team and the writing and demo-ing of songs. He was also working on an early production of a revue musical Snapshots in Seattle, confident that when finally finished, the show would go direct to stock and amateur licensing rather than to a commercial production. The one thing he was emphatically not doing was planning anything new for Broadway.",
      "Then towards the end of the year, a phone call came that would change everything. He was in Los Angeles finishing some work on The Prince of Egypt when his long-time buddy, songwriter John Bucchino, called him from the island of Maui in Hawaii. Singer-songwriter Holly Near had hired Bucchino as a piano accompanist for her performances at a conference at the tropical getaway. Once on Maui, Bucchino decided it was too good not to share. His room included an extra bed, and he had a car and free food. \"If you can cash in some frequent flyer miles and come for the weekend, you'll have a free vacation in Hawaii,\" Bucchino offered.",
      "\"Why not?\" thought Schwartz. He had the weekend free, and after all, it was Hawaii. \"I am so there,\" came Schwartz's answer from LA, and by December 16th, he was.",
      "When Bucchino and Near had a block of time away from the stage, they organized a snorkeling adventure with Schwartz and Near's friend, Pat Hunt. A small boat sped them over to Molikini, a mostly submerged volcanic crater popular for its rainbow spread of sea creatures that delight snorkelers.",
      "On the trip back, Holly casually mentioned to Stephen, \"I'm reading this really interesting book called Wicked, by Gregory Maguire.\"",
      "The novel's title sounded intriguing. \"I think I've heard of it. What's it about?\" he inquired.",
      "\"It's the Oz story from the Wicked Witch of the West's point of view.\"",
      "In an instant, Schwartz's imagination flashed through the implications of a backstory for The Wizard of Oz told from the perspective of the unpopular witch. His reaction was visceral: \"All the hairs on my arms stood on end,\" he recalls. \"I thought it was the best idea for a musical I had ever heard.\"",
      "As soon as he returned to his LA apartment, he called his attorney in New York, inquiring about Maguire's 1995 novel Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West. \"Okay, this book has been out for a while, so somebody has the rights. I need you to find out who has them. Meanwhile, I'm going to get the book and read it, because I think I have to do this.\"",
      "There was no way around it. This was a Broadway concept not suited to a small-budget theater company. And he knew it was a highly theatrical idea, not one meant for film or television. Although he had firmly decided, indeed pledged, never to work on Broadway again, his instincts didn't leave him a choice.",
      "But with such a popular novel, surely someone in Hollywood was converting it to the silver screen. Schwartz would have to stop them, and somehow inspire the rights holders to consider instead the risky, expensive, and time-consuming venture of producing a musical in New York City.",
      "While his attorney, Nancy Rose, followed clues on the rights trail, Wicked's prospective composer-lyricist read the novel and confirmed that his hunch had been right: musicalizing the Wicked Witch's story seemed \"quintessentially an idea for me,\" meaningful enough to be worth the potential struggle.",
      "For one thing, he loved looking at traditional stories from a new angle. When he was in college he saw Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead, Tom Stoppard's play in which two minor characters in Shakespeare's Hamlet are made the central characters. \"It was a revelation to me,\" he recalls. \"From that point on, the idea of looking at familiar material from an unfamiliar point of view became a goal for my own work.\" Godspell had approached the New Testament in a fresh way, Children of Eden reworked Genesis for a new take on family life, and The Prince of Egypt explored the Exodus story from the standpoint of the brother relationship between Moses and Ramses. But Gregory Maguire's twist on The Wizard of Oz was a chance to do something more directly like the Rosencrantz and Guildenstern concept. \"I recognized immediately that this was a genius idea and that it was an idea for me: the way it took a familiar subject and spun it,\" Schwartz recalls.",
      "Wicked also felt inherently musical to him. \"Elphaba is a very musical character with big emotions. She is fantastical. The world is fantastical. Glinda is very musical.\" To him it was clear that the world of musical theater was where the story belonged.",
      "And then there was the character Maguire's vision had moved to the center of the story: Elphaba, the quirky and misunderstood green girl who becomes the Wicked Witch of the West. Maguire named her after L. Frank Baum, who penned The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, when he pondered the sound of the author's initials \"eL\" \"Fa\" \"Ba.\" Elphaba's story seemed close to Schwartz's own emotional experience. He knew what it felt like to be \"green\" and what inner resources are needed to carry on with life. \"The idea of the story created a sympathetic resonance in me,\" Schwartz affirms, \"and I know that I'm not alone. Anyone who is an artist in our society is going to identify with Elphaba. Anyone who is of an ethnic minority, who is black or Jewish or gay, or a woman feeling she grew up in a man's world, or anyone who grew up feeling a dissonance between who they are inside and the world around them, will identify with Elphaba. Since that's so many of us, I think there will be a lot of people who will.\"",
      "\"There were things that I knew right away. I knew how it was going to begin, I knew how it was going to end, I knew who Elphaba was, and I knew why\u2014 on some strange level\u2014this was autobiographical even though it was about a green girl in Oz.\" \u2014Stephen Schwartz",
      "Schwartz bought a spiral notebook in which he would capture all his story and lyric ideas\u2014snatches of inspiration, research notes, lists of rhyming words, first drafts of lyric lines, and later drafts. On the black cover, the manufacturer's slogan, \"Five Star\u2014In a Class By Itself,\" hinted at what would become of the musical that began as penciled scrawls on the lined pages.",
      "Maguire had created, as the author himself described it, a dense, almost nineteenth-century-type novel that takes place over thirty-eight years and has thirty-eight speaking parts. Could any group of musical collaborators successfully distill these ingredients into a viable evening of theater?",

    "summary": "When the \"Star Trek\" actor and America's favorite astrophysicist share the stage, sparks can fly on an astronomical level. They talk about their bromance built on an appreciation of science and curiosity.",
    "story": [
      "Not long ago in Seattle, an astronomical event of sorts happened: Two superstars collided. William Shatner, of \"Star Trek\" fame, and Neil deGrasse Tyson, America's favorite astrophysicist, took to the stage to explore the nature of exploration. Think of it as sort of Martin & Lewis, but with more quantum mechanics.",
      "\"It's a bromance,\" said Tyson. \"I think what Bill Shatner and I have together should be the textbook definition of the bromance.\"",
      "\"If we have a bromance,\" said Shatner, \"I'd be very privileged.\"",
      "The two grew close last year on an upscale cruise to Antarctica, where they ended up being the after-dinner entertainment. \"The organizer said, 'Why don't we put the two of you on this mini-stage that they have on the ship, and we just chew the fat?'\" said Tyson. \"And then the organizer said, 'Why don't you guys take this on the road?'\"",
      "Their first port of call? Seattle, where they debuted a wide-ranging, sometimes meandering, but always intriguing stage show they're calling \"The Universe Is Absurd!\"",
      "When Shatner asked his partner for a sound bite, deGrasse Tyson solicited a suggestion from the audience: \"Pick anything out of the universe. Go. Anything. Doesn't matter.\"",
      "\"Pluto!\" yelled one enthusiastic audience member.",
      "DeGrasse Tyson obliged: \"More than half of Pluto is made of ice, so that, if it were where Earth is right now, heat from the Sun would evaporate that ice and it would grow a tail. And that is no kind of behavior for a planet!\" Mic drop. \"That's a sound bite!\"",
      "For deGrasse Tyson, director of New York City's Hayden Planetarium, and an authority on just about everything we know about the universe, it's a chance to get inside the insatiably curious mind of the 94-year-old Shatner. \"What kind of magic potion is he drinking?\" deGrasse Tyson laughed. \"By the way, you can do the math, he's been alive for three billion seconds, okay? I did the math, you don't have to. So when Bill Shatner speaks, it's coming from a place way deeper than any of the rest of us can possibly match.\"",
      "And for Shatner, who never formally studied astrophysics, it's a chance to make up for what he sees as lost time. \"I feel bad about it, because that knowledge of what constitutes the construction of nature, we know so little, but the little we know is so awesome, it's so spellbinding,\" he said. \"The fact that I wasn't conscious of how spellbinding it is as a youth, I could have been much more educated about it.\"",
      "Four years ago, Shatner became the oldest person ever to go into space, and he's been globetrotting ever since.",
      "Shatner asked deGrasse Tyson, \"Do you still scratch your head in awe?\"",
      "\"Every night I look up,\" he replied.",
      "So, is this the dynamic between the two \u2013 Shatner with questions, deGrasse Tyson with answers? \"Unfortunately, that's the way it is,\" Shatner replied.",
      "\"No, but he's got wisdom and life experience that I value, and I respect,\" deGrasse Tyson added. \"So, I'm here to grab some of that.\"",
      "As for Shatner's take on deGrasse Tyson, \"He has access, both because of his mentality, and the books and the studies, so he's into modern-day mysticism, which is the study of the stars and how it works and what goes on.\"",
      "\"You call that modern-day mysticism?\" deGrasse Tyson asked.",
      "\"Because you don't know for sure that what you're saying is absolutely truth until more experimentation.\"",
      "\"That's the frontier. We're scratching our heads.\"",
      "\"Exactly,\" said Shatner. \"So, he is an explorer. He is an explorer. He is on that verge. He teaches that. And it is mystical in every sense of the word.\"",
      "I asked, \"This is where I think you are politely and respectfully in disagreement, because Dr. deGrasse Tyson will say something like, 'We know what the speed of light is and what the fastest things can move is.' And you say, 'Well, we'll see about that!'\"",
      "\"Yeah, we've had that argument,\" said Shatner.",
      "DeGrasse Tyson seems just fine not knowing everything \u2013 for example, what was going on before the Big Bang, and the profound idea of somethingness coming from nothingness. \"We don't know. Next question!\" he said. \"No, as a scientist, you need to be comfortable in the presence of a question that does not yet have an answer.\"",
      "Of course, the ultimate question, the one we really don't know definitively, is where we go when we die, something that Shatner, as he loses friends and colleagues, finds himself considering more often. \"You know, I vary between the fear of death, my fear,\" he said. But, \"I have so much love around me. I have a wife, and children, and grandchildren. I even have two great-grandchildren. And I have two great dogs. I've had dogs all my life, all my adult life.

    "summary": "The composer and lyricist behind such hits as \"Godspell,\" \"Pippin\" and \"Wicked\" talks about the price of his early success, and why he almost left composing Broadway musicals for good.",
    "story": [
      "When songwriter Stephen Schwartz sits at the piano, he feels the music. \"When I was a kid and playing my Beethoven \u2026 I would play that bar over and over again, and cry. It's very embarrassing! Beethoven, living in a world that has nothing to do with ours, but he writes, and it speaks to us across the centuries.\"",
      "Schwartz knows a little something about speaking to audiences. He's the composer and lyricist of \"Wicked,\" the blockbuster stage musical-turned-two-part movie musical. Part two, \"Wicked: For Good,\" opens Nov. 21.",
      "The prequel to the classic \"Wizard of Oz,\" \"Wicked\" tells the story of Elphaba (played by Cynthia Erivo), who grows up to be the Wicked Witch of the West. The bubbly Glinda (played by Ariana Grande) becomes the Good Witch of the North.",
      "Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo perform \"Popular,\" from \"Wicked\":",
      "Schwartz has been telling stories through song for over five decades. \"My sort of glib joke where people say, like, how do you write a song? I just say, tell the truth and make it rhyme,\" he said. \"And if I can be honest enough, then that'll speak to other people.\"",
      "\"Wicked\" opened 22 years ago, making it the fourth-longest-running Broadway show in history.",
      "And where was Schwartz on the night of Oct. 30, 2003? \"Well, that was the opening night of 'Wicked' on Broadway, and therefore, I was not at the Gershwin Theatre, because I don't go to my own openings,\" he said. \"It's too nerve-wracking for me. I don't like the opening night parties where everybody is just waiting to hear what reviews come in.\"",
      "Kristin Chenoweth originated the role of Glinda on Broadway. She and Schwartz have reunited for the recently-opened new musical, \"The Queen of Versailles.\" \"I'm working with my Rodgers and Hammerstein; it's just packed into one person,\" she said of Schwartz. \"There's not five of him. There's one. He's original. He's singular. And there's nobody else like him.\"",
      "Schwartz grew up on New York's Long Island. A prodigy, he attended the prestigious Juilliard School as a high schooler. Just after college, he collaborated on the musical that became his first big hit, \"Godspell.\" The musical features a ragtag group who help Jesus tell various parables.",
      "I asked, \"It's a musical with Jesus as a central character. You're a Jewish guy. Did you think, well, alright, I'll give it a go?\"",
      "Schwartz replied, \"I think one of the things that made 'Godspell' work was the fact that I didn't know a lot of those stories. So, I think I came to it with a kind of fresh eye about not preaching to the converted, so to speak.\"",
      "In 1972, Schwartz brought that fresh eye to the story of \"Pippin,\" a young man searching for the meaning of life in the Middle Ages. Hit #3, 1974's \"The Magic Show,\" starred magician Doug Henning. Schwartz was 3-for-3, with all three playing simultaneously on Broadway when he was just 27 \u2013 a theatrical trifecta that Schwartz described as \"very dizzying.\"",
      "\"The truth is, when you are very young and unprepared for a success, it can be difficult to handle,\" he said. \"It was difficult for me to handle. I think I got very, quite full of myself. I got kind of difficult to deal with. I kept thinking, well, why isn't everybody just doing exactly what I say? I lost somewhat the ability to collaborate. You know, it took some failures to kind of learn how to deal with both success and failure.\"",
      "The failures came in short order, a \"four-fecta\" of flops\": \"Working\" (which closed after a month), and 'Rags\" (which closed after four performances), while \"The Baker's Wife\" and \"Children of Eden\" never made it to Broadway.",
      "I noted, \"You haven't always been critic's choice.\"",
      "\"I'm almost never a critic's choice,\" Schwartz said.",
      "Why? \"I have no idea,\" he said. \"I'll be frank about it, you know, I wish I got Steve Sondheim's reviews.\"",
      "\"But listen, as great as he was, his shows didn't run the way yours have.\"",
      "\"Yeah, the grass is always greener,\" Schwartz replied.",
      "In the early 1990s Schwartz stepped away from the piano. Had he quit Broadway? \"Absolutely, a hundred percent,\" he said.",
      "\"Did you worry that you were out of juice?\" I asked.",
      "\"Totally, yeah. And in the '90s, I actually went back to school. I was pursuing a degree in psychology. I was gonna become a therapist.\"",
      "Studying to become a therapist turned out to be quite therapeutic. \"I think that time away reminded me of how to behave myself and how to collaborate and how to deal with other people, and not just come in like a bull in a china shop,\" he said.",
      "When he returned to songwriting, it was not for Broadway, though, but for Hollywood, writing songs for \"Pocahontas,\" \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame,\" \"Enchanted,\" and music and lyrics for \"The Prince of Egypt.\" He picked up three Academy Awards along the way.",
      "\"The Colors of the Wind,\" from \"Pocahontas\":",
      "But Stephen Schwartz's home will always be the stage. \"I feel so blessed and so fortunate that work I've done has this ongoing life that I know is gonna keep going when I'm not here on this planet anymore,\" he said. \"Listen, I'm 77 years old, and they still let me do this!\"",

      "Miami Beach Police announced that the 22-year-old was taken into custody early Saturday on multiple charges, including possessing amphetamine and marijuana, along with resisting an officer without violence.",
      "\"The Miami Beach Police Department remains steadfast in its commitment to maintain public safety and order throughout the city\u2014regardless of celebrity status,\" the agency said. \"The Department will continue to take proactive enforcement action against behavior that endangers residents, visitors, or officers and will hold all individuals accountable under the law.\"",
      "According to his bio on Delka Talents, his talent agency, Doherty has over 3.2 million YouTube subscribers and over 500 million YouTube views.

      "CBS News Miami has reached out to Doherty's representatives for comment on his arrest.",
      "An influencer blocks traffic for the sake of \"content\"",
      "Around 3:12 a.m. Saturday, Miami Beach Police officers were conducting a high-visibility detail along the 700 block of Washington Avenue within the city's Entertainment District, when a group of individuals entered the roadway from the east sidewalk into the northbound lanes. A man from the group -- later identified as Doherty -- separated from them and attempted to engage officers to \"create video content, positioning himself in the middle of the roadway with passing vehicular traffic and creating a significant safety hazard,\" according to arrest documents obtained by CBS News Miami.",
      "Miami Beach Police officers began issuing multiple commands to direct Doherty to exit the roadway, but he refused. Even after his group urged him to comply, he continued refusing officers' commands.",
      "Officers continued, warning Doherty that failure to comply would result in his arrest. Still, the influencer continued to refuse commands and told them, \"Once I'm done with this bet,\" the arrest documents said. At this moment, Miami Beach Police safely apprehended Doherty in the middle of the road due to his \"deliberate refusal to follow lawful orders and continued to obstruct traffic.\"",
      "According to arrest documents, while officers searched Doherty's person, they found \"half of an orange oval-shaped pill with 3 imprinted on it, consistent with a Schedule II amphetamine, as well as a black plastic container holding three hand-rolled suspected cannabis cigarettes weighing approximately 4.0 grams combined.\"",
      "After a records check that showed no active warrants, officers took Doherty to Miami Beach Police's holding facility for booking and contacted an after-hours attorney for charging guidance.",

      "\"It articulates the questions that dwell within us, and sometimes, even provokes tears that we did not know we needed to express,\" Leo said.",
      "The first U.S.-born pope also acknowledged the financial difficulties facing movie theaters. He said institutions should not give up, but \"cooperate in affirming the social and cultural value\" of theaters, drawing applause from the audience.",

      "Tighe said the large group of filmmakers and actors was pulled together during the last three months. Vatican officials used contacts in Hollywood, including Martin Scorsese, to help craft the list of attendees. The hardest part, Tighe said, was convincing Hollywood agents that the invitation wasn't a hoax. Tighe told CBS Saturday Morning that he hopes the event shows that the Church embraces the arts, instead of just tolerating them.",

      "Deezer said more than half of the respondents felt uncomfortable at not being able to tell the difference.",

      "Cleto Escobedo III, longtime bandleader of the \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" show, has died, Jimmy Kimmel announced on Tuesday. He was 59 years old.",
      "The late-night talk show host\u00a0mourned the death of one of his oldest friends \u2014 whom he met when he was 9 years old \u2014 writing on Instagram that \"[t]o say that we are heartbroken is an understatement.\"",
      "\"The fact that we got to work together every day is a dream neither of us could ever have imagined would come true. Cherish your friends and please keep Cleto's wife, children and parents in your prayers,\" Kimmel wrote.",
      "Escobedo and Kimmel met as children in Las Vegas, where they grew up across the street from each other. Kimmel wrote on Tuesday that they were \"inseparable.\"",
      "\"We just met one day on the street, and there were a few kids on the street, and him and I just became really close friends, and we kind of had the same sense of humor. We just became pals, and we've been pals ever since,\" Escobedo said in a 2022 interview for Texas Tech University's Southwest Collection oral history archive, disclosing that he and Kimmel were huge fans of David Letterman as kids.",
      "Escobedo would grow up to become a professional musician, specializing in the saxophone, and touring with Earth, Wind and Fire's Phillip Bailey and Paula Abdul. He recorded with Marc Anthony, Tom Scott and Take Six. When Kimmel got his own ABC late-night talk show in 2003, he lobbied for Escobedo to lead the house band on \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\"",
      "\"Of course I wanted great musicians, but I wanted somebody I had chemistry with,\" Kimmel told WABC in 2015. \"And there's nobody in my life I have better chemistry with than him.\"",
      "In 2016, on Escobedo's 50th birthday, Kimmel dedicated a segment to his friend, recalling pranks with a BB gun or mooning people from the back of his mom's car.",
      "\"Cleto had a bicycle with a sidecar attached to it. We called it the side hack. I would get in the sidecar and then Cleto would drive me directly into garbage cans and bushes,\" Kimmel recalled.",
      "News of Escobedo's death comes after Thursday's episode of \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" was abruptly canceled. David Duchovny, Joe Keery and Madison Beer were set as the show's guests. The date and cause of Escobedo's death weren't immediately known.",
      "Escobedo's father is also a member of the Kimmel house band and plays tenor and alto saxophones. In January 2022, the father-son duo celebrated nearly two decades of performing on-screen together.",
      "\"Jimmy asked me, 'Who are we going to get in the band?' I said, 'Well, my normal guys,' and he knew my guys because he had been coming to see us and stuff before he was famous, just to come support me and whatever. I'd invite him to gigs, and if he didn't have anything to do he'd come check it out, so he knew my guys,\" Escobedo recounted in the 2022 interview. \"Then he just said, 'Hey, man, what about your dad? Wouldn't that be kind of cool?' I was like, 'That would be way cool.'\"",
      "In the 2022 interview, Escobedo said the bandleader job had one major benefit: family time.",
      "\"Touring and all that stuff is fun, but it's more of a young man's game. Touring, also, too, is not really conducive for family life. I've learned over the years, being on the road and watching how hard it is, leaving your kids for so long. Sometimes they're babies; you come back and then they're talking, it's like, 'What?'\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "Sally Kirkland, a onetime model who turned to acting and was best known for sharing the screen with Paul Newman and Robert Redford in \"The Sting\" and her Oscar-nominated title role in the 1987 movie \"Anna,\" has died, her representative confirmed to the Associated Press. She was 84.",
      "Her representative, Michael Greene, told the AP that Kirkland died Tuesday morning at a Palm Springs hospice.",
      "Friends established a\u00a0GoFundMe\u00a0account this fall for her medical care. They said she had fractured four bones in her neck, right wrist and left hip. While recovering, she also developed infections, requiring hospitalization and rehab.",
      "Kirkland acted in such films as \"The Way We Were\" with Barbra Streisand, \"Revenge\" with Kevin Costner, \"Cold Feet\" with Keith Carradine and Tom Waits, Ron Howard's \"EDtv,\" Oliver Stone's \"JFK,\" \"Heatwave\" with Cicely Tyson, \"High Stakes\" with Kathy Bates, \"Bruce Almighty\" with Jim Carrey and the 1991 TV movie \"The Haunted,\" about a family dealing with paranormal activity. She had a cameo in Mel Brooks' \"Blazing Saddles.\"",
      "Her biggest role was in 1987's \"Anna\" as a fading Czech movie star remaking her life in the United States and mentoring a younger actor, Paulina Porizkova. Kirkland won a Golden Globe and earned an Oscar nomination along with Cher in \"Moonstruck,\" Glenn Close in \"Fatal Attraction,\" Holly Hunter in \"Broadcast News\" and Meryl Streep in \"Ironweed.\" (The Oscar went to Cher.)",
      "\"Kirkland is one of those performers whose talent has been an open secret to her fellow actors but something of a mystery to the general public,\" a Los Angeles Times critic wrote in\u00a0her review for \"Anna.\" \"There should be no confusion about her identity after this blazing comet of a performance.\"",
      "Kirkland's small-screen acting credits include stints on \"Criminal Minds,\" \"Roseanne,\" \"Head Case\" and she was a series regular on the TV shows \"Valley of the Dolls\" and \"Charlie's Angels.\"",
      "Born in New York City, Kirkland's mother was a fashion editor at Vogue and Life magazine who encouraged her daughter to start modeling at age 5. Kirkland graduated from the American Academy of Dramatic Arts and studied with Philip Burton, Richard Burton's mentor, and Lee Strasberg, the master of the Method school of acting. An early breakout was appearing in Andy Warhol's \"13 Most Beautiful Women\" in 1964. She appeared naked as a kidnapped rape victim in Terrence McNally's off-Broadway \"Sweet Eros.\"",
      "Some of her early roles were Shakespeare, including the lovesick Helena in \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" for New York Shakespeare Festival producer Joseph Papp and Miranda in an off-Broadway production of \"The Tempest.\"",
      "\"I don't think any actor can really call him or herself an actor unless he or she puts in time with Shakespeare,\" she told\u00a0the Los Angeles Times in 1991. \"It shows up, it always shows up in the work, at some point, whether it's just not being able to have breath control, or not being able to appreciate language as poetry and music, or not having the power that Shakespeare automatically instills you with when you take on one of his characters.\"",
      "Kirkland was a member of several New Age groups, taught Insight Transformational Seminars and was a longtime member of the affiliated Church of the Movement of Spiritual Inner Awareness, whose followers believe in soul transcendence.",
      "She reached a career nadir while riding nude on a pig in the 1969 film \"Futz,\" which\u00a0a Guardian reviewer\u00a0dubbed the worst film he had ever seen. \"It was about a man who fell in love with a pig, and even by the dismal standards of the era, it was dismal,\" he wrote.",
      "Kirkland was also known for disrobing for so many other roles and social causes that Time magazine dubbed her\u00a0\"the latter-day Isadora Duncan of nudothespianism.\"",
      "Kirkland volunteered for people who had AIDS, cancer and heart disease, fed homeless people via the American Red Cross, participated in telethons for hospices and was an advocate for inmates, especially young people.",

      "In 2007 LaRue, who starred in \"CSI: Miami,\" and her young daughter, Kaya, first started getting threatening phone calls and letters from an anonymous person. Her story is told in a new two-part documentary called \"My Nightmare Stalker: The Eva LaRue Story.\"",
      "\"What is crazy is we, on 'CSI: Miami,' we were solving cases in 43 minutes, not including commercials. In real life we did not have the technology we were pretending to have on the show,\" LaRue said.",
      "The Emmy Award-winning actress said she and her daughter had to move twice. At one point, her stalker found her daughter's high school and pretended to be her father, \"and told her to stand out in front of the school and he was going to pick her up.\"",
      "The stalking went on for more than a decade and affected her physically, causing hair loss and hives.",
      "\"There was no place to hide because you don't know where he could be, so you are really in a prison of your own making because you are trying to be four steps ahead of what he could do and those possibilities are endless,\" she said.",
      "\"Take my life back\"",
      "LaRue described a moment of an epiphany when a friend invited her and her daughter to Italy while \"CSI: Miami\" wasn't filming.",
      "\"We weren't there 36 hours, in the middle of the night, it's like 3 in the morning and I have jet lag and I'm kind of awake and rolling around. The bedroom door opens up and it is lit from the back,\" she said, explaining she couldn't see the individual's face at the door, but thought it was her friend.",
      "The next morning, she found out it was a break-in \u2014 but not her stalker.",
      "\"All I had done was pray all day and all night for months at that point for some sort of guidance. I really felt like it was my answer that God literally said in that moment, 'If I wanted you dead, I'll follow you to Italy,'\" she said.",
      "\"So I felt in that moment, oddly enough, this weird sense of peace. That was the first time I could kind of take my life back.\"",
      "Stalker arrest and moving forward",
      "LaRue's stalker was caught in 2019 through DNA, 12 years after the threats began.",
      "James David Rogers of Ohio was sentenced to 40 months in prison in 2022 \u2014 but is now out.",
      "Asked if she feels safe, LaRue said, \"I don't think we'll ever feel safe.\"",

    "story": [
      "As a public figure with a massive social media following, Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy is no stranger to threats and abuse online. But recently, the entrepreneur says he's become \"far more aware\" of how he could face these threats in everyday life.",
      "\"You know, you start getting into these yahoos on social media, and there's, like, yahoos,\" Portnoy told \"CBS Mornings\" co-host Tony Dokoupil in an interview airing on \"CBS Sunday Morning\" this weekend. \"I don't even know what they're saying. But they start talking about me, trying to get my name probably used because they're just in this endless cycle of needing to stay in the news.\"",
      "Conversations about him can quickly spiral online and \"open the floodgates on just lunatics,\" Portnoy said. In response, the businessman and social media personality said he has installed round-the-clock security at his house. \"It only takes one,\" Portnoy added.",
      "Recently, a man was overheard on video shouting an antisemitic comment and throwing coins toward Portnoy while he was recording his famous \"One Bite\" pizza review outside of a Mississippi restaurant. Starkville Police on Monday arrested the alleged heckler, identified as 20-year-old Patrick McClintock, on a misdemeanor charge of disturbing the peace.",
      "\"Every person has the right to feel safe and respected in our community. Offensive words alone are protected, but when behavior disrupts a public event or risks violence, the Starkville Police Department will take steps to help maintain safety and security,\" the police said in a statement to CBS News, adding that the state could impose enhanced penalties if a violation meets the criteria for bias-motivated or discriminatory reason. The incident remains under investigation.",
      "\"Imagine hating somebody just because of their religion in this f---ing country,\" Portnoy said in a social media video posted after the incident.",
      "Antisemitic incidents have increased almost 900% in the past 10 years, according to the Anti-Defamation League, in many cases involving violence.",
      "Even before that recent incident, there had been a \"definitive shift\" toward antisemitism, Portnoy told Dokoupil, adding that it was a form of hate that he experiences on a daily basis.",
      "\"For me, being a Jewish person, like, you got to step up,\" he said. \"You're kind of someone people look up to in the Jewish community. You have to be, like, 'All right, this is not normal ha-ha with the guys. People are coming up with real hate.'\"",

      "The man died in September 2024, but\u00a0researchers just recently linked the death to the allergy, known as alpha-gal syndrome, or AGS.",
      "According to experts, the bite of a Lone Star tick can lead an individual to develop a sensitivity or allergy to alpha galactose, a carbohydrate found in red meat and dairy products. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says AGS\u00a0can cause hives, nausea, stomach pain, breathing issues and swelling.",
      "Man died several hours after eating hamburger at barbecue",
      "According to researchers, a 47-year-old New Jersey man went on a camping trip with his wife and children in summer 2024, and after spending the day outdoors, they had beef steak for dinner. About four hours later, researchers say the man experienced severe abdominal discomfort, diarrhea and vomiting that lasted about two hours.",
      "The man apparently felt better the following morning, but when discussing what had happened with his family, he allegedly said, \"I thought I was going to die.\" However, he decided not to consult a doctor about the symptoms, researchers say.",
      "About two weeks later, researchers say the man attended a barbecue where he ate a hamburger. About four hours after eating, the man was found unconscious on the bathroom floor with vomit around him. He was taken to a local hospital, where he was pronounced dead several hours later.",
      "The man's name was not released, nor was the location he went camping.",
      "Postmortem blood test reveals allergic reaction to alpha-gal",
      "The man's death was ruled a \"sudden unexplained death,\" but his wife asked a friend in the medical field to review the autopsy report. The doctor contacted researchers in Virginia to look into the possible role of AGS.",
      "Earlier this year, the man's blood was tested, and researchers say it was determined he had suffered an allergic reaction to alpha-gal consistent with fatal anaphylaxis.",
      "The man's wife said that earlier in the summer, he had gotten about a dozen bug bites around his ankles believed to be from Lone Star tick larvae.",
      "According to researchers, this is \"the first documented anaphylactic death related to AGS where the symptoms started several hours after consuming mammalian meat.\"",
      "Doctors want to raise awareness of alpha-gal syndrome",
      "The researchers argue more public education on AGS is necessary, considering the increased presence of Lone Star ticks in northern states and the fact that abdominal pain is not widely recognized as a possible symptom of an allergic reaction.",
      "\"Although this is very, very uncommon\u2013 what happened to him is not likely to happen to other people. I'm not afraid of that,\" said Dr. Thomas Platts-Mills with UVA Health. \"But they should know about it.\"",
      "\"If they start noticing they're developing abdominal pain, rashes after eating red meat, they should talk to their physicians about the possibility that they've been sensitized to this specific carbohydrate within red meat,\" said Dr. Suraj Saggar, chief of infectious disease at Holy Name Medical Center in Teaneck, \"and understand that if they continue to eat it, there is at least the potential for having a very serious and even fatal reaction.\"",
      "Experts say people who live in areas where Lone Star ticks are common, like New York and New Jersey, should do what they can to avoid tick bites.",
      "\"With the changing seasons, the warming of our climate, these ticks are increasing in their numbers. The potential exposures are increasing,\" Saggar said. \"People should take all the precautions they can to protect [from] tick bites.\"",

      "Like many of her Democratic colleagues, GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia is urging Congress to act quickly to address the spiraling cost of health care for millions of Americans who could soon see huge spikes in their insurance premiums.",
      "\"Now that the [Affordable Care Act] tax credits are expiring, which the Democrats did put in place \u2014 and they set the expiration date for this year \u2014 I see a financial crisis for Americans,\" Greene told \"CBS Mornings\" in an exclusive interview Friday. \"And so on this issue, I don't see political party lines.\"",
      "About 22 million lower- and middle-income Americans rely on the tax credits to reduce their health insurance costs when they buy policies through the Affordable Care Act's marketplaces. During the longest government shutdown in history, Democrats pushed Republicans to extend the subsidies as a condition for reopening the government, but the shutdown ultimately ended Wednesday without a deal to extend the tax credits. Democrats were promised, however, that a vote on the tax credits will be held next month.",
      "But House Democrats took notice of Greene's views on health care. House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries, asked by \"CBS Evening News\" co-anchor John Dickerson if he had found any Republican allies during the 43-day impasse, replied,\"Three words \u2014 Marjorie Taylor Greene.\"",
      "\"She's been very clear that this health care crisis is not made up, it's real, Republicans have no health care plan, and that Democrats are correct in fighting to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits,\" Jeffries continued.",
      "And top Republicans noticed, too. Earlier this week, President Trump said of Greene after she criticized him for focusing on foreign policy, rather than high prices at home, \"I don't know what happened to Marjorie \u2014 nice woman, but I don't know what happened. She's lost her way, I think.\"",
      "\"I haven't lost my way \u2014 I'm for the American people only,\" Greene told \"CBS Mornings.\" \"I am America first and I make no apologies about that to anyone.\" But she added that the rapidly rising health insurance costs had affected her personally.",
      "\"As far as health insurance is concern it hurt my own family. Back in 2010, the Democrats passed Obamacare, and in 2014 when it went into effect my family's health insurance went from $800 to over $2,400 a month, and we've seen the health insurance industry prices just go up and up,\" Greene said.",
      "\"I see simply that the American people have been done wrong, and I want my party to produce a solution and a plan that fixes this mess once and for all,\" Greene said. \"And so that is what I've been urging here in Washington, and I really hope to see Republicans and Democrats both work together to come up with a very good solution with health care for the American people.\"",

      "\"Vizz and the drug that has come before it, Vuity, have both worked on the same structural function; they cause your iris, or the colored part of your eye, to get smaller and smaller,\" Dr. Johnson explained. \"As your pupil gets smaller, it becomes apparent that it is like looking through a pinhole, and your depth of focus therefore increases.\"",

      "Dr. Johnson cautions that while these new eye drops may help some, they are not a cure-all for presbyopia, but rather, they are just another good tool in the fight against age-related blurry vision.",
      "\"It will work much better for the younger, 40, 50, 55-year-old patients than it will for the 60, 65, 70-year-old patients,\" Dr. Johnson said. \"Because they have less of a need to focus. By the time you get to be my age, your natural ability to focus is all gone. Therefore, the pupil would have to be made obsessively smaller and smaller. And if that pupil becomes too small, we begin to lose the amount of light that gets into the eye, and now you are going to have a 70-year-old who can read, but who can't drive when the sun goes down.\"",

      "New Delhi - Authorities in India's capital have urged elementary schools to hold classes online, banned construction and urged people to work from home as the annual plague of air pollution hit the \"severe\" category in a health warning system for the first time this season. For the first time, the toxic air has drawn protests against the government, and a warning for people with health issues to simply leave Delhi if they can.",
      "The severe designation indicates potentially serious health impacts for people with impaired immune systems, and negative affects even for healthy people, according to India's Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).",
      "The emergency measures were announced after Delhi's average Air Quality Index (AQI) sharply rose to 425. An AQI between 400 and 450 is categorized as \"severe\" and, as a norm, requires authorities to implement emergency measures under the government's graded pollution response plan.",
      "Air quality in India's capital deteriorates sharply every year around this time due to a number of factors, including farm waste being burned off and seasonal climatic conditions \u2013 but activists say authorities have not done enough to contain the air pollution.",
      "In a first, hundreds of people protested against the bad air quality at Delhi's India Gate over the weekend.",
      "Several protesters wore gas masks as a symbolic act of protest and held up banners, including one that read: \"I miss breathing.\"",
      "Earlier this month, one of the city's top pulmonologists, Dr. Gopi Chand Khilnani, urged people with health problems who can afford to temporarily leave Delhi to do so.",
      "\"Everybody cannot afford to leave Delhi, because it is not simple, Khilnani told The Indian Express. \"But those who have chronic lung disease or chronic heart disease, those who are on oxygen, and those who have the opportunity and ability to go abroad or to less polluted places, I very safely advise them to leave Delhi for 6-8 weeks from now, so as to protect themselves from the distress of breathlessness, the requirement of oxygen, and so on and so forth.\"",
      "The toxic air is affecting the health of people of the city regardless of underlying health problems, with many Delhi residents complaining of breathing problems and eye irritation this week.",
      "\"Every breath in Delhi NCR [National Capital Region] today comes with a major health cost \u2014 we're seeing more patients struggling with breathlessness, asthma, and heart problems, especially among children, the elderly, and those with chronic diseases,\" Dr. Harshal Ramesh Salve, at the Centre for Community Medicine at the prestigious All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), told a group of journalists on Monday.",
      "A recent report by the Lancet medical journal - Countdown on Health and Climate Change 2025 \u2013 carried a grim warning for India: The country recorded around 1.72 million deaths from outdoor air pollution in 2022, a staggering 38 percent rise since 2010.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fda-hormone-therapy-marty-makary-interview/",
    "published": "Mon, 10 Nov 2025 08:48:09 -0500",
    "summary": "In an interview with CBS News, FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary explains what went into the decision to drop the most serious warnings on hormone therapy for menopause.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration will remove the \"black box\" warning labels on many hormone therapy drugs used for menopause and perimenopause symptoms \u2014 a major turnaround that's likely to encourage more women to seek treatment. FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary said in an exclusive CBS News interview that the change ends a decades-long \"fear machine,\" and he called the demonization of menopause hormone therapy, also known as hormone replacement therapy (HRT), \"an American tragedy.\"",
      "\"With the exception of vaccines or antibiotics, there's no medication that can improve the health of women on a population level more than hormone replacement therapy,\" Makary told senior correspondent Norah O'Donnell, explaining that studies show that menopause hormone therapy can reduce the risk of heart attacks, the leading cause of death in women.",
      "The products affected by this change include medicines containing both estrogen and progesterone, systemic estrogen and topical estrogen.",
      "The \"black box\" warning labels were based on what many experts now consider flawed research on HRT from more than 20 years ago. Part of the criticism is that back in 2002, researchers on the Women's Health Initiative study overstated the risks of breast cancer because the data focused on older women.",
      "More recent studies have shown the benefits outweigh the risk for many women if hormone therapy is used in the early years of menopause, before the age of 60.",
      "\"We now have a more nuanced understanding, and we want to put that fear machine in its proper context and let people know that there are tremendous long-term health benefits,\" Makary said.",
      "In addition to heart health, those benefits include lowering the risk of cognitive decline or Alzheimer's and preventing osteoporosis, a major factor in hip fractures.",
      "Hormone therapy can help ease menopause symptoms, which can be debilitating, taking both a mental and physical toll. There are a wide range of symptoms, including hot flashes, insomnia, night sweats, mood swings, joint pain, weight gain and more \u2014 with some experiencing more intense effects than others.",
      "Menopause typically occurs in a woman's late 40s or early 50s, when the ovaries produce less estrogen and menstruation stops. Perimenopause refers to the transitional years leading up to it.",
      "What studies say now",
      "Over the past two decades, fears about breast cancer led doctors to steer millions of women away from hormone therapy.",
      "\"It's an American tragedy. I do think it's one of the biggest mistakes in modern medicine,\" Makary said, denouncing the \"groupthink\" among doctors in the wake of the 2002 study.",
      "As a result, he told CBS News, \"50 to 70 million women over the last 23 years have been denied the incredible, life-changing, life-saving benefits of hormone replacement therapy because of the dogma.\"",
      "Those millions, he said, included his own mother.",
      "\"She had gone through perimenopause right around that time, but [was] never offered this therapy,\" even though she was a good candidate for it. \"Well, she went on to have two different falls recently where she had bone fractures. \u2026 And I can't help but think if her bones had been stronger from hormone replacement therapy, she wouldn't have gone through that.\"",
      "Menopause significantly speeds bone loss and increases the risk of osteoporosis, according to the Endocrine Society, an international medical organization. The group says 1 in 2 postmenopausal women will have osteoporosis, and most will suffer a bone fracture during their lifetime, which can lead to a cascade of other health problems.",
      "Markary added he knows breast cancer is a sensitive topic that needs to be treated very carefully, but said no clinical trial has ever shown that hormone therapy increases a woman's risk of dying from breast cancer.",
      "One of the things scientists have learned, he said, is that hormone therapy is best started soon after a woman's body stops producing estrogen.",
      "\"Hormone replacement therapy for postmenopausal women needs to be started within 10 years of the onset of menopause or perimenopause, and generally, the rule of thumb is not to start it after age 60,\" Makary said. After around 60, aging and lack of estrogen mean blood vessels have begun to harden and narrow, raising the risk of stroke and heart attack; taking estrogen earlier can help prevent that.",
      "Women should discuss the best options with their doctor.",
      "\"Look, I'm a regulator. I don't want to tell people what to take. And I'm not prescribing anything,\" Makary said. \"But we want people to have the right information. And part of that is addressing this fear machine that has been going on for 23 years, that has been magnified by the FDA's 'black box' warning on estrogen products for perimenopausal women.\"",
      "Non-hormonal therapy treatments",
      "While hormone therapy is the most effective treatment for hot flashes and night sweats, it is not suitable for everyone, especially women with a history of breast cancer.",
      "Earlier this month, the FDA approved a new, non-hormonal option called Lynkuet, known generically as elinzanetant. The drug is the second medication to directly target the brain pathways involved in body temperature control. The first, called Veozah, was approved in 2023.",
      "Despite how common menopause is, research funding to study it has historically been limited.",
      "Even medical education on the topic has been limited, Markary said.",
      "\"The general philosophy was, why are we teaching about this, about menopause? Because there's nothing we can do for it,\" he said. \"Well, that dogma, unfortunately, resulted in a lot of omission of menopause in medical education.\"",
      "But, with more women in the field, that's starting to change.",
      "\"It's been a male-dominated culture in the medical establishment, historically. Now, roughly half of our medical students at Johns Hopkins were women, and that's a trend nationwide,\" Markary said. \"And they're starting to say, 'Hey, wait a minute, this is something where women are coming to their doctors and they're not getting the right answer.'\"",

    "published": "Sun, 16 Nov 2025 09:15:21 -0500",
    "summary": "Prediction markets, like Kalshi, which allow people to place wagers on everything from elections and sports to the anticipated bridesmaids at Taylor Swift's wedding, are booming. But this burgeoning business model is coming under scrutiny.",
    "story": [
      "Joel Holsinger just quit his day job to bet on the words that famous people, like White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, might say in public. \"I thought there was a very high likelihood she would bring up 'Thanksgiving' in relation to the shutdown,\" he said.",
      "From his computer, the 26-year-old makes about $3,000 a week trading on the prediction market Kalshi.",
      "\"She did not say Thanksgiving, so we were out $700 yesterday,\" Holsinger said.",
      "That hurts, right? \"Surprisingly for me, doesn't hurt really much,\" Holsinger replied. \"I have had times where I've lost, for example, like, $6,000 on a bad trade, but also the inverse of that; I've made $11,000 on a trade, and so, you know, it's just ups-and-downs.\"",
      "The live streaming influencer is one of millions of people flocking to prediction markets like Kalshi, PredictIt and Polymarket where you can wager on just about anything.",
      "Tarek Mansour and Luana Lopes Lara are former Wall Street traders-turned-co-founders of Kalshi. \"A prediction market is like the stock market, but instead of buying and selling companies, you're buying 'yes' and 'no' on whether something is going to happen or not,\" Mansour said. \"So, it could be whether Mamdani was going to win the last New York mayor's race, or there's going to be a hurricane in Florida next month.\"",
      "Lopes Lara said, \"People can make money on what they know, actually monetize their knowledge, monetize their hobby, because everyone is an expert on something.\"",
      "Kalshi made a name for itself in the 2024 election. The presidential race looked close, unless you were keeping an eye on Kalshi, which called the race well before the TV networks did. \"It was like Kalshi, then Fox, then CNN,\" said Mansour. \"It was crazy.\"",
      "Twelve months later, Kalshi was the talk of another election: The New York City mayor's race. As Democratic candidate Zohran Mamdani told the crowd on Oct. 26, \"You see the Kalshi odds that have our chances of victory in the 90s.\"",
      "Kalshi's numbers are not polling data; they represent what people think is going to happen. \"It's people putting money on what they think is going to happen, and then the wisdom of the crowds in the markets come up with the probabilities of who is going to win,\" said Lopes Lara.",
      "And you can bet on (or Kalshi says \"invest in\") more than 3,500 markets on the company's platform, like who will be a bridesmaid in Taylor Swift's wedding.",
      "I asked, \"How do I know that someone close to Taylor Swift, or Taylor Swift herself, isn't participating in a way that will make her outcome more favorable and let her, you know, take home a little extra cash?\"",
      "Lopes Lara replied, \"Kalshi is a federally-regulated, fully-compliant exchange, and we have systems in place to monitor for any suspicious or unusual activity. We also have a lot of trading prohibitions in place.\"",
      "According to Mansour, \"There really hasn't been any issues.\"",
      "Prediction markets are booming. The owner of the New York Stock Exchange is investing $2 billion in Polymarket, and the sports betting platform FanDuel will launch its own prediction market next month.",
      "In fact, when it's not an election, the majority of the money traded on Kalshi is not on politics or culture \u2013 it's on sports. Jonathan Cohen, author of \"Losing Big,\" has chronicled the rise of sports betting in the U.S. Regarding Kalshi, he said, \"You can bet on things that a traditional Sportsbook would offer you.\"",
      "\"Kalshi says this is an investment. You don't buy that?\"",
      "\"No,\" said Cohen. \"The New England Patriots are not more likely to win their game because I bought a contract for them to win the game. It is a speculative instrument purely for my own use and my own entertainment, which to me qualifies it as gambling rather than investing.\"",
      "But Kalshi is not regulated like gambling. Online sports betting is only legal in 31 states; Kalshi is available in all 50. \u00a0The Biden administration tried to prevent Kalshi from offering sports markets. Then, when President Trump returned to the White House, his administration vowed to break with \"past hostility\" \u2013 and earlier this year, the president's son, Donald Jr, became a strategic advisor to both Kalshi and its main rival, Polymarket.",
      "Asked why Kalshi made Donald Trump Jr. a strategic advisor, Mansour replied, \"We have a lot of advisors, um, and they span across the board, across different functions. But really, this is all about growing this industry, the prediction market industry, that a lot of people really believe in.\"",
      "I asked, \"What kind of advice does he give you?\"",
      "\"So, it really is, again, about growing prediction markets,\" Mansour said. \"You know, he believes in prediction markets. We believe in prediction markets. A lot of people believe in prediction markets, and it's really about go-to-market and expansion plans.\"",
      "\"Does he come to meetings? How much do you pay him? What's his role? I mean, this is the son of the president.\"",
      "\"We, again, I mean, we have a lot of advisors,\" Mansour replied. \"And whether it's our investors, whether it's, uh, people that we really trust and respect, whether \u2013 \"",
      "\"But he's not just any advisor; he has a direct line to the White House,\" I said.",
      "\"We have a lot of advisors,\" said Mansour.",
      "Kalshi is embroiled in legal battles with several states, like Massachusetts, that say Kalshi's sports markets amount to \"unlawful sports wagering.\"",
      "Are the states wrong? \"We are confident in what we're doing,\" said Mansour. \"We're confident in our position from the law, and we're also confident in the fact that, you know, customers are actually finding a lot of value in basically what we're offering. So, I would say yes.\"",
      "But for now, if you are over the age of 18, you can bet on just about anything, anywhere, any time.",
      "Cohen said, \"It's not enough to, like, like Taylor Swift anymore. You have to use your knowledge of Taylor Swift to, like, try to make money off of how many streams she's going to get in a month. Or it's not enough to, I don't know, even like politics anymore; you have to gamble on politics. You have to make money on politics.",
      "\"That, to me, it seems like sort of the canary in the coal mine of like a 'gamblification' of American culture that I think is sort of still on the rise,\" he said, \"and we might not like what that looks like when it fully arrives.\"",

    "summary": "Disney and YouTube TV reached a new deal to bring channels like ABC and ESPN back to the Google-owned live streaming platform Friday.",
    "story": [
      "Disney and YouTube TV reached a new deal to bring channels like ABC and ESPN back to the Google-owned live streaming platform Friday, ending a blackout for customers that dragged on for about two weeks.",
      "\"As part of the new deal, Disney's full suite of networks and stations \u2013 including ESPN and ABC \u2013 have already begun to be restored to YouTube TV subscribers,\" The Walt Disney Co. said in a statement. \"We are pleased that our networks have been restored in time for fans to enjoy the many great programming options this weekend, including college football.\"",
      "Disney content had gone dark on YouTube TV the night of Oct. 30, after the two sides failed to reach a new licensing deal. In the days that followed, YouTube TV subscribers were left without Disney channels on the platform \u2014 notably disrupting coverage of top U.S. college football matchups and professional sports games, among other news and entertainment offerings.",
      "Beyond ESPN and ABC, other Disney-owned content removed from YouTube TV during the impasse included channels like NatGeo, FX, Freeform, SEC Network, ACC Network and more.",
      "At the time the carriage dispute reached its boiling point, YouTube TV said that Disney was proposing terms that would be too costly, resulting in higher prices and fewer choices for its subscribers. And the platform accused Disney of using the blackout \"as a negotiating tactic\" \u2014 claiming that the move also benefited Disney's own streaming products like Hulu + Live TV and Fubo.",
      "Disney, meanwhile, said that YouTube TV had refused to pay fair rates for its channels. The California entertainment giant also accused Google of \"using its market dominance to eliminate competition.\" And executives blasted the platform for pulling content \"prior to the midnight expiration\" of their deal last month.",
      "On Nov. 3, Disney also asked YouTube TV to restore ABC programming for Election Day on Nov. 4 to put \"the public interest first.\" But YouTube TV said this temporary reprieve would confuse customers \u2014 and instead proposed that the entertainment giant agree to restore both its ABC and ESPN channels while the two sides continued negotiations.",
      "The blackout marked the latest in a growing list of licensing disputes in today's streaming world. And consumers often pay the price.",
      "From sports events to awards shows, live programming that was once reserved for broadcast has increasingly made its way into the streaming world over the years, as more and more consumers ditch traditional cable or satellite TV subscriptions for content they can get online. But amid growing competition, renewing carriage agreements can also mean tense contract negotiations \u2014 and at times service disruptions.",
      "YouTube TV and Disney have been down this road before. In 2021, YouTube TV subscribers also briefly lost access to all Disney content on the platform after a similar contract breakdown between the two companies. That outage lasted less than two days, with the companies eventually reaching an agreement.",
      "Meanwhile, YouTube TV has removed other networks from its platform after expired agreements. Spanish-language broadcaster Univision has been unavailable on YouTube TV since Sept. 30, for example. At the time, its parent company TelevisaUnivision decried Google's move \u2014 noting it would strip \"millions of Hispanic viewers of the Spanish-language news, sports, and entertainment they rely on every day\" and called on the platform to reverse course.",
      "YouTube TV's base subscription plan costs $82.99 per month \u2014 which, beyond Disney content, currently includes live TV offerings from networks like NBC, CBS, Fox, PBS and more. The platform previously said it would give subscribers a $20 credit if its dispute with Disney lasted \"an extended period of time\" \u2014 which it reportedly allowed customers to start claiming on Nov. 9.",
      "Disney also doles out live TV through both traditional broadcasting and its own lineup of streaming platforms. ESPN launched its own streamer earlier this year, starting at $29.99 a month.

    "story": [
      "President Trump exempted foods like beef, coffee and bananas from his sweeping country-by-country tariffs on Friday, as his administration grapples with cost-of-living frustrations and\u00a0quickly rising prices for some types of food.",
      "The new exemption covers a range of tropical products that are often imported to the United States, including coffee, tea, bananas, mangoes, avocados, coconuts, pineapples, cocoa and spices such as nutmeg, according to an executive order. It also covers beef, oranges and tomatoes.",
      "The White House said Mr. Trump decided to exempt the products on Friday because he's made \"substantial progress\" in negotiating trade deals with other countries. A day earlier, Mr. Trump announced trade frameworks with four Latin American countries \u2014 Argentina, Guatemala, El Salvador and Ecuador \u2014 that included relief for food that isn't widely produced in the U.S.",
      "The food products will no longer be covered by the \"reciprocal\" tariffs that Mr. Trump has imposed on most U.S. trading partners, which range from 10% to 40% or more. Some types of food could still be impacted by other forms of tariffs.",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters Friday the tariff exemptions should cause prices to go down, and they mostly applied to food that is \"not competitive in this country,\" like bananas.",
      "\"We don't make them in this country, so there's no protection of our industries or our food products,\" he said aboard Air Force One.",
      "The moves come as polls show that voters remain nervous about inflation and wary of Mr. Trump's approach to the issue, which helped propel him back to the White House last year.",
      "Food prices rose 3.1% in the yearlong period ending in September, well below its peak of 11.4% in 2022, according to federal data. But certain types of food have surged: Beef prices were up 12.9% year-over-year in September, banana prices were up 6.9% and roasted coffee 18.9%.",
      "Mr. Trump has insisted\u00a0costs are actually down since he took over from former President Joe Biden, and has long denied that higher tariffs could push up consumer prices \u2014 a persistent fear raised by economists.",
      "But rising beef prices have alarmed Mr. Trump, who accused foreign-owned meat packing companies earlier this month of \"driving up the price of Beef through Illicit Collusion, Price Fixing, and Price Manipulation.\"",
      "Last month, Mr. Trump said he's considering importing more beef from Argentina to help get prices down. It's a delicate issue, though, because boosting beef imports could upset U.S.-based ranchers, who are typically supportive of the president. Trade groups like the National Cattlemen's Beef Association publicly criticized the idea.",
      "Mr. Trump responded on Truth Social that ranchers \"have to get their prices down.\"",
      "\"The Cattle Ranchers, who I love, don't understand that the only reason they are doing so well, for the first time in decades, is because I put Tariffs on cattle coming into the United States,\" he wrote. \"If it weren't for me, they would be doing just as they've done for the past 20 years \u2014 Terrible!\"",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is\u00a0scrapping a proposed Biden-era rule\u00a0that would have made airlines pay customers for long waits when their flights were delayed, according to a document from the U.S. Department of Transportation.",
      "The Transportation Department on Friday\u00a0published a notice that it is officially withdrawing the proposed rule, introduced in 2024 under President Biden and then-Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. The regulation would have required airlines to pay passengers $200 to $300 for domestic delays lasting at least three hours, and up to $775 for flight delays lasting at least nine hours.",
      "The agency, which announced in September that it planned to abandon the proposal, said the notice will be published in the Federal Register on Monday. The passenger protection measure would have created \"unnecessary regulatory burdens,\" the Transportation Department said Friday.",
      "In October, a group of Democratic senators defended the regulation in a letter to the Trump administration, calling it a \"common-sense proposal\" that would have held airlines accountable for their mistakes. They noted that delays can place a financial strain on families when they are forced to rebook flights or secure overnight accommodations.",
      "Customers in the U.S. are entitled to refunds for canceled flights, but no similar protections are in place for delays.",
      "The agency on Friday explained its rationale for ditching the measure, saying the move would \"allow airlines to compete on the services and compensation that they provide to passengers rather than imposing new minimum requirements for these services and compensation through regulation, which would impose significant costs on airlines.\"",
      "When reached for comment Friday, the Transportation Department told CBS News that the \"Biden-Buttigieg proposal was just that \u2014 a proposal.\"",
      "\"It was dropped after the election in the waning days of the administration. It was never enacted, and does not reflect the compensation consumers are currently entitled to with respect to delays and cancellations,\" an agency spokesperson said.",

      "Sen. Bill Cassidy, the chairman of the Senate health committee, says \"we're absolutely in communication with the White House\" about a plan to bring down the cost of health care for Americans.",
      "He told \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" in an interview airing Sunday he's aiming to have a proposal ready for a vote that is set to take place in mid-December.",
      "Tax credits for about 22 million Americans who buy their health insurance through the Affordable Care Act's marketplace were at the center of the government shutdown that ended Wednesday. A Biden-era expansion of those subsidies is expiring at the end of the year, so unless they're extended, many consumers will likely face far higher insurance premiums.",
      "Democrats pushed Republicans to extend the subsidies as a condition for reopening the government, but they eventually settled for the promise of a vote next month on extending the enhanced tax credits.",
      "Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican, said of any plan to extend the subsidies, \"Let's recognize what you're doing just gives money to insurance companies.\"",
      "Instead, he's asking Republican and Democratic colleagues to collaborate on lowering health insurance premiums and directly giving Americans money to help them offset high deductibles that are often a feature of the lower-cost policies under the ACA.",
      "\"We can do it better with lower premiums and with money and accounts to pay deductibles,\" Cassidy told Brennan. He said he's telling Democrats, \"Let's not be Democrats and Republicans \u2014 let's be Americans, representing all of Americans.\"",
      "President Trump offered a similar idea last weekend, writing on Truth Social the money that's spent on health insurance subsidies should be \"SENT DIRECTLY TO THE PEOPLE SO THAT THEY CAN PURCHASE THEIR OWN, MUCH BETTER, HEALTHCARE.\"",
      "Brennan pressed Cassidy on extending the expanded tax credits, which were created in 2021 and are set to expire at the end of the year.",
      "Noting the approximately 293,000 Louisianans currently enrolled in Obamacare, Brennan asked, \"Are you telling those hundreds of thousands of Louisianans that that tax credit is going away no matter what, that they should make plans no for higher prices?\"",
      "Cassidy countered that the problem with the plans was that many of them have high deductibles, with some reaching $6,000 in out-of-pocket costs. The lower-premium \"bronze\" plans on the ACA's marketplaces often have high deductibles.",
      "\"Margaret, I'm a doctor,\" Cassidy said. \"I would talk to people when they'd come to see me, and they would tell me, 'I can't afford that. My deductible is too high.' That's reality, and that reality is being lost in this discussion.\"",

      "But a tinge of fear is starting to shadow that exuberance as investors worry the AI boom could go bust.",
      "The startling run-up in AI-related stocks is prompting comparisons to the dot-com era of the late 1990s, when many internet companies saw their stock prices skyrocket despite suffering vast financial losses. When that bubble burst in the early 2000s, it took down former high-fliers like Pets.com, torched investor portfolios and triggered a recession.",
      "Bubbles occur when stocks surge on inflated growth expectations that ultimately prove to be disconnected from a company's underlying fundamentals, a painful reality check that typically ends with overhyped shares falling back to Earth.",
      "Thursday's stock market tumble \u2014 when high-flying AI stocks such as Nvidia and CoreWeave led the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite to see its biggest drop in months \u2014 fueled further anxiety this week about another bubble.",
      "Beyond the stock market, economists are also questioning whether AI will turn out to be as transformative for businesses as proponents of the technology insist. Advocates say AI will spur a productivity boom, leading to stronger corporate growth and profitability.",
      "\"The stock market is a giant bet on AI right now. It's really 10 companies that are driving all of it,\" Rebecca Homkes, an economist and lecturer at the London Business School, told CBS News.",
      "In other words, this year's 15% gain in the S&P 500 \u00a0is largely due to a handful of tech giants that are heavily investing in AI. The combined market capitalization of the so-called \"Magnificent 7\" \u2014 Google-owner Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla \u2014 today represents a record 37% of the S&P 500's total value, according to Morningstar.",
      "Irrational exuberance?",
      "That may give pause to the millions of Americans who are saving for retirement in 401(k) and other plans. If the market's gains lean so heavily on a few dominant companies, as during the dot-com bubble, the fallout could be severe if investors suddenly sour on AI.",
      "\"No one wants to be caught dancing after the music has stopped,\" Aaron Schaechterle, portfolio manager at Janus Henderson, said in an email.",
      "Still, today's stock valuations aren't nearly as stretched as they were in the late 1990s, Goldman Sachs analysts note. The investment bank's analysis of the Magnificent 7's median price-to-earnings ratio \u2014 a measure of a company's share price compared to its profits \u2014 found it is \"roughly half\" that of the largest seven companies in the late 1990s.",
      "\"So it is true that valuations are high but, in our view, generally not at levels that are as high as are typically seen at the height of a financial bubble,\" they noted.",
      "Why this time may be different",
      "The question of whether AI is fueling a bubble akin to the late 1990s was even posed to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell at the central bank's Oct. 29 meeting.",
      "\"This is different in the sense that these companies \u2014 the companies that are so highly valued \u2014 actually have earnings and stuff like that,\" Powell said. \"So you go back to the '90s and the dot-com [period]... these were ideas rather than companies.\"",
      "Nvidia, for example, the AI boom's poster child, has seen its revenue more than double to $130 billion in its last fiscal year, while its profit surged 145%.",
      "Although the stock market may not be in imminent danger of a bubble-bursting crash, economists are increasingly questioning whether AI companies can live up to the hype, as well as justify the trillions in capital spending on the data centers and other infrastructure required to power the AI revolution.",
      "For these bets to pay off, AI will need to transform U.S. businesses by spurring a productivity boom that translates into stronger corporate growth and profitability, experts say.",
      "\"We want to understand whether this is storytelling or actual tangible gains,\" Homkes of the London Business School told CBS News.",
      "For tech evangelists like Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives, the AI boom will lead to a \"4th industrial revolution\" that could supercharge economic growth. \"This is an AI Arms Race, and what is fueling this next chapter of growth is Big Tech spending and that is NOT slowing down into 2026,\" he wrote this week in a research note.",
      "\"The doubters need to come on board and recognize this is a transformational technology,\" Homkes agreed, while noting that such a shift is likely to take much longer than some AI boosters currently envision.",

      "Lisa Cheng Smith, founder of Yun Hai Taiwanese Pantry, a New York City-based retailer that imports products from businesses and farms in Taiwan, said her costs have jumped 20% to 50% this year from 2024 because of U.S. tariffs on imports from Taiwan and other Asian countries.",
      "In past years, Yun Hai has offered a 15% Black Friday discount as a way to drive holiday purchases, with Cheng Smith telling CBS News that the annual promotion \"is a really important thing for us.\" This year, however, she's unsure how much of a discount she can afford to offer, given her higher operational costs resulting from tariffs.",
      "\"It's complicated because of tariffs and how the retail math works,\" Cheng Smith said. \"Do we offer less of a discount and try to preserve margins, or do we use the same promotion language and structures that customers have come to expect?\"",
      "For small business owners, such calculations can make all the difference, she added. \"What we do from October through December is equal to the whole rest of the year in terms of sales, so every day is more high stakes,\" she noted.",
      "Retail experts said higher tariff costs for retailers and other businesses could mean fewer, and paltrier, Black Friday discounts this year.",
      "\"There will be discounts and deals \u2014 that's what Black Friday is about. Very few retailers will want to shun that completely, but I think they will be more surgical and selective in the discounting,\" Neil Saunders, managing director and retail analyst at GlobalData, told CBS News. \"They will perhaps discount fewer items, and some discounts will be less generous in terms of the amount of money off.\"",
      "Dan Peskorse, whose company, Upstream Brands, sells a range of merchandise under different labels on Amazon and other e-commerce sites, also said higher tariff costs are forcing him to rethink his Black Friday strategy this year.",
      "For previous Black Fridays, Peskorse said Upstream Brands typically offered discounts of up to 30% on products sold under the company's flagship brands, including ThinkFit, which makes meal-prep bags and containers, and Ash Harbor, a maker of small home goods.",
      "Not this year. \"This is the first year that we are not offering across-the-board discounts on products,\" he said, noting that the decision was \"100%\" related to tariffs.",
      "Peskorse has taken steps to mitigate the impact of tariffs, including raising prices and absorbing the extra costs that come with importing goods from China and India. The only tool he has left to control costs and preserve his business's profits is to scrap discounts, he said.",
      "The average U.S. tariff rate has increased sevenfold this year, to 16.6%, according to EY-Parthenon chief economist Gregory Daco. Those higher duties are pushing up the prices of imported goods as retailers pass on a portion of the\u00a0costs to shoppers, he noted.",
      "\"It's going to be a strange season\"",
      "Squeezed by tariff costs, many businesses are also grappling with a slowdown in holiday spending by lower-income consumers still feeling the\u00a0impact of persistent inflation.",
      "\"I think the rubber is going to hit the road when we get into Black Friday,\" said Sonia Lapinsky, a retail analyst at management consulting firm AlixPartners. \"Consumers are telling us they are pulling back on holiday spending this year, holding on to their dollars and putting their money in critical places, not in discretionary buckets.\"",
      "Discounts are a powerful tool for incentivizing consumers to spend money, she added.",
      "\"It's the only way retailers will get them in the door, because they can't stomach this,\" Lapinsky said. \"So it's going to be a strange season. If retailers get it wrong, they're risking the biggest selling season they have.\"",

    "summary": "State-sponsored cybercriminals used Anthropic's tech to target tech companies, financial institutions and other organizations, AI company alleges.",
    "story": [
      "Anthropic said Thursday that Chinese hackers used its artificial intelligence technology in what the company believes is the first cyberespionage operation largely carried out using AI.",
      "Anthropic said the cybercriminals used its popular chatbot, Claude, to target roughly 30 technology companies, financial institutions, chemical manufacturers and government agencies. The hackers used the AI platform to gather usernames and passwords from the companies' databases that they then exploited to steal private data, Anthropic said, while noting that only a \"small number\" of these attacks succeeded.",
      "\"We believe this is the first documented case of a large-scale cyberattack executed without substantial human intervention,\" Anthropic said in a statement.",
      "The San Francisco-based company shared its findings with CBS News but did not offer additional comment. The news was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.",
      "Anthropic said it began detecting suspicious activity in mid-September. A subsequent investigation by the company revealed that the activity stemmed from an espionage campaign that Anthropic said was likely carried out by a state-sponsored group based in China.",
      "According to the investigation, hackers allegedly duped Claude into thinking it was an employee of a legitimate cybersecurity firm and that it was being used for defensive testing. Anthropic also said the cybercriminals sought to hide their tracks by breaking down the attack into small tasks.",
      "Unlike conventional cyberattacks, the operation required minimal human intervention, according to the company. \"The AI made thousands of requests per second, an attack speed that would have been, for human hackers, simply impossible to match,\" Anthropic said.",
      "Anthropic said it expects AI cyberattacks to grow in scale and sophistication as so-called agents become more widely used for a range of services. AI agents are cheaper than professional hackers and can operate quickly at a larger scale, making them particularly attractive to cybercriminals, MIT Technology Review\u00a0has pointed out.",
      "Chris Krebs, the former head of the federal government's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, told CBS Mornings on Friday that this attack is a sign of what's to come.",

    "summary": "A growing number of Americans, squeezed by inflation and elevated interest rates, face the risk of losing their home in foreclosure.",
    "story": [
      "Kimberly Draxler was in shock when she called her mortgage lender in April and was told her four-bedroom home in Hillview, Kentucky, would be sold out from under her in a matter of days.",
      "Though she had been alerted that something might be wrong by a letter in the mail from an attorney offering assistance in warding off foreclosure, she said her lender never informed her that she was about to lose her home.",
      "\"They never called me and told me they were just going to rip my house right underneath me,\" Draxler told CBS News.",
      "Draxler's lender said it notifies all borrowers of a possible foreclosure by mail and by phone throughout the process, in compliance with federal debt collection rules.",
      "Before learning that her home was entering foreclosure, Draxler, who is 57 and on disability, said she stayed afloat financially by relying on her son, who contributed $600 a month to help take care of household expenses. But after he moved out in 2024, her bills began to pile up, she told CBS News. Draxler soon fell behind on her mortgage.",
      "The financial pressures bearing down on Draxler highlight the struggles of homeowners still grappling with the rising cost of everything from housing and\u00a0groceries to\u00a0energy bills\u00a0and insurance coverage. With many households stretched thin, unexpected events such as job loss, unplanned medical expense or even simple car problems can cause people to fall behind on their mortgages.",
      "\"I just couldn't do it anymore\"",
      "Although foreclosures \u2014 which include default notices, scheduled auctions or bank repossessions \u2014 remain well below their pre-pandemic levels, they are on the rise.",
      "As of August, foreclosure filings had risen six straights months year-over-year and were up 18% from the same period in 2024, according to property data firm ATTOM. Through June, roughly 188,000 properties had foreclosure filings, putting the U.S. on track to surpass the roughly 322,000 U.S. properties that went into foreclosure in 2024.",
      "\"Paying for the house, the car, the necessity bills \u2014 I just couldn't do it anymore,\" said Draxler, who had come close to losing her home in foreclosure on three previous occasions over the last decade.",
      "Roughly 94% of mortgage defaults occur after a homeowner loses income to extenuating circumstances,\u00a0according\u00a0to The Urban Institute, citing\u00a0data\u00a0from the National Bureau of Economic Research.",
      "Rising homeownership costs",
      "A key factor behind the rise in foreclosure rates is the growing cost home insurance, utilities, property taxes, repairs and other homeownership expenses. For example, single-family homeowners with a mortgage today pay an average of\u00a0$2,370 a year for property coverage\u00a0\u2014 up nearly 70% from five years ago, according to data from ICE Mortgage Technology.",
      "In addition to rising homeowners insurance costs, many households are also contending with exorbitant property taxes as well as elevated interest rates.",
      "\"All of these rising costs associated with holding a home, you have increasing pressure on existing homeowners to continue to be able to afford and pay for their mortgages,\" Geoff Smith, executive director of the Institute for Housing Studies at DePaul University, told CBS News.",
      "Todd Teta, chief product and technology officer at ATTOM, also cited the recent slowdown in hiring as a factor behind rising mortgage delinquencies, noting that job loss often drives foreclosures.",
      "A high interest rate environment can be particularly challenging for homeowners with variable-rate loans, which reset at certain intervals in part based on market conditions. That means a homeowner might see a major jump in their monthly mortgage payment if their reset occurs when interest rates are elevated.",
      "A narrow escape",
      "More such loans are now hitting their reset periods, Teta noted, a trend he expects to continue. \"While there has been a small dip in interest rates, they remain significantly higher than just a few years ago, so borrowers with upcoming resets are still likely to see sizable payment increases.\"",
      "As for Draxler, she managed to keep her home by filing for Chapter 13 bankruptcy, which allows debtors to hold onto their property and pay off debt over time, usually within three to five years. But coming so close to losing her home of more than 30 years continues to weigh on her.",
      "\"I did not want to lose my house,\" Draxler said. \"I wouldn't have no place to go.\"",

      "McMillon, 59, will step down as CEO on Jan. 31 but remain on the retailer's board of directors until its annual shareholders' meeting. John Furner, who has served as president and CEO of Walmart U.S. since 2019, will take over as chief executive on Feb. 1.",
      "McMillon oversaw an expansion of tech-based initiatives at Walmart, such as investing in e-commerce and artificial intelligence, while also increasing wages and benefits for Walmart's 2.1 million workers. Under his tenure, Walmart's shares surged more than 300%, buoyed by rising sales and profitability.",
      "\"McMillon is very highly regarded by investors and helped the company navigate a volatile retail landscape over the last ~12 years as CEO,\" Adam Crisafulli, an analyst with Vital Knowledge, said in a research note, adding that his retirement is \"somewhat surprising.\"",

      "\"People thought he would stay on longer given how well the company is performing and his relatively young age,\" Crisafulli noted.",
      "McMillon had told the Wall Street Journal in March 2023 that he pledged to remain in his role for another three years as the company searched for a successor. McMillon has spent his entire career at Walmart, starting in 1984 as an associate who picked orders and unloaded trailers in a warehouse, according to his company bio.",
      "Furner, 51, has proved to be a \"strong leader\" as he managed Walmart's U.S. business, said GlobalData managing director Neil Saunders in a research note. But, he added, McMillon's retirement \"will send a small shockwave through Walmart, simply because he has been an excellent leader and steward of the company, he said.",

His curiosity and digital acumen combined with a deep commitment to our people and culture will enable him to take us to the next level,\" McMillon said in the statement.",

    "published": "Thu, 13 Nov 2025 19:59:00 -0500",
    "summary": "An extension of enhanced ACA tax credits appears unlikely, experts say, leaving millions of Americans facing potentially higher health plan costs in 2026.",
    "story": [
      "The cost of health care remains in limbo for roughly 22 million Americans after the U.S. government reopened late Wednesday without a deal to extend an expiring federal tax credit that offsets the cost of some Affordable Care Act plans.",
      "The fate of the enhanced premium tax credit had been at the center of the longest government shutdown in U.S. history as Democrats pushed Republicans to extend the subsidy in order to reopen the government.",
      "The Senate\u00a0voted late Sunday\u00a0on a deal to end the shutdown that did not resolve the future of the tax credit \u2014 a central demand of Democrats during the government funding fight. On Wednesday, the House approved the Senate-passed funding package to end the 43-day shutdown. President Trump signed the legislation shortly after.",
      "To secure the Democratic votes needed to reopen the government, Senate Republicans\u00a0agreed to hold a separate vote\u00a0on extending the ACA tax credits by mid-December. But a vote isn't guaranteed to succeed, and even if the legislation makes it out of the Senate, House GOP leaders have not committed to holding a vote in the lower chamber.",
      "Americans are now choosing their 2026 health plans on the ACA's online marketplaces, and without congressional action, the tax credits will expire Dec. 31.",
      "\"A lot of people are sort of in this limbo state where they have to buy their insurance for next year, but they really don't know how this is going to shake out at the federal level,\" Emma Wager, a senior policy analyst at nonprofit health policy site KFF, told CBS News.",
      "What happens without an extension?",
      "The subsidies were introduced in 2021 through the pandemic-era American Rescue Plan Act, and then extended for three more years in the Inflation Reduction Act. Without any action on Congress's part, the enhanced premium tax credits will disappear at the end of 2025.",
      "That means low- and middle-income households that previously qualified for the tax credits would likely see their ACA premiums more than double next year, rising from an average of $888 in 2025 to $1,904 in 2026, according to a KFF analysis.",
      "Faced with higher costs for ACA insurance, about 4 million people are likely to drop their health coverage, the Congressional Budget Office has estimated.",
      "\"Americans are really just seeing how expensive health care is in this country, and it's just completely unaffordable for a lot of people to pay their own entire health insurance premium,\" Wager said.",
      "Currently, the enhanced ACA premium tax credit is available for people who earn between 100% to 400% of the poverty level, which sets the upper threshold at $62,000 for an individual, according to KFF. However, some Americans who earn above that 400% benchmark can qualify for the tax credit if their insurance rates exceed 8.5% of their income.",
      "Three-quarters of Americans favor renewing the subsidies, according to recent KFF polling. That includes 94% of Democrats and about half of Republicans.",
      "If Congress renews the subsidies, federal and state marketplaces would need to retool the 2026 plans already available to consumers. It's possible a new plan could be made retroactive to January 2026, even if it's passed later in the year, Wager said.",
      "\"At that point, people are sort of locked in on whatever plan they chose, but they can retroactively receive the tax credit,\" she noted.",
      "Are there other options from Congress?",
      "Congress could pursue other ways to make health coverage more affordable. On Saturday, President Trump called for sending the money saved by not extending the tax subsidies \"directly to the people.\" On his Truth Social platform, he criticized the ACA and said Americans should be able to use the savings to purchase other kinds of insurance.",
      "\"In other words, take from the BIG, BAD Insurance Companies, give it to the people, and terminate, per Dollar spent, the worst Healthcare anywhere in the World, ObamaCare,\" he wrote.",
      "Wager said it remains to be seen if Mr. Trump's plan is feasible, saying \"we haven't seen a concrete enough proposal at this point.\"",
      "Some lawmakers have offered similar proposals, such as Senate Health Committee Chair Bill Cassidy, a Republican from Louisiana. In a floor speech last week, he said eligible Americans could be sent \"a pre-funded federal flexible spending account\" to use for health expenses, from dental care to prescription drugs and preventive services.",
      "In the meantime, as 2026 approaches and the future of the enhanced premium tax credit remains unclear, enrollees should consider speaking with a health insurance expert to get advice on their options, Wager advised.",
      "\"The most important thing that you can do is talk to somebody \u2014 an agent, broker or a navigator \u2014 who can help you make sure that you really understand what your options are and that you get the best plan for your financial situation and your health care situation,\" she said.",

    "story": [
      "The parents of at least two babies sickened in an infantile botulism outbreak are suing the makers of the ByHeart baby formula at the heart of a nationwide recall.",
      "Stephen and Yurany Dexter, of Flagstaff, Arizona, said their 4-month-old daughter, Rose, had to be flown by air ambulance to a children's hospital two hours from home and treated for several weeks this summer.",
      "Michael and Hanna Everett, of Richmond, Kentucky, said their daughter, Piper, also 4 months, was rushed to a hospital Nov. 8 with worsening symptoms of the rare and potentially deadly disease.",
      "\"It was just absolutely terrifying,\" Hanna Everett told CBS News in an interview Thursday. \"You know, we just kind of felt like we failed as a parent in some ways.\"",
      "Everett said they were unaware of the recall prior to her daughter consuming the ByHeart formula.",
      "\"She had finished that entire can, literally, the day before the recall,\" Everett said.",
      "The lawsuits, filed in federal courts in two states, allege that the ByHeart formula the babies consumed was defective and that the company was negligent in selling it. They seek financial payment for medical bills, emotional distress and other harm.",
      "\"My hopes right now is that they're able to catch it before their children get too sick, before they have to be on ventilators,\" Everett said.",
      "Both families said they bought the organic formula to provide what they viewed as a natural, healthier alternative to traditional baby formulas, and that they were shocked and angered by the suffering their children endured.",
      "\"I wouldn't guess that a product designed for a helpless, developing human in the United States could cause something this severe,\" said Stephen Dexter, 44.",
      "\"She's so little and you're just helplessly watching this,\" Hanna previously told the Associated Press. \"It was awful.\"",
      "Rose Dexter and Piper Everett are among at least 15 infants in a dozen states who have been sickened in the outbreak that began in August, according to federal and state health officials. No deaths have been reported.",
      "Both received the sole treatment available for botulism in children less than a year old: an IV medication called BabyBIG, made from the blood plasma of people immunized against the neurotoxins that cause the illness.",
      "Investigations into more potential botulism cases are pending after ByHeart, the New York-based formula manufacturer, recalled all of its formula nationwide on Tuesday. At least 84 U.S. babies have been treated for infantile botulism since August, including those in the outbreak, California officials said.",
      "It can take up to 30 days for signs of infantile botulism infection to appear, medical experts said. The symptoms can include drooping eyelids, diminished suck and gag reflexes, and a weak and altered cry, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Children suspected of being sick with infant botulism should get medical attention as soon as possible, the CDC says.",
      "ByHeart sells about 200,000 cans of formula per month. FDA commissioner Marty Makary told CBS News that the company sells about 1% of the baby formula purchased in the U.S., and that there is no risk of a formula shortage due to the recall.",
      "California officials confirmed that a sample from an open can of ByHeart formula fed to an infant who fell ill contained the type of bacteria that can lead to illness.",
      "The lawsuits filed Wednesday could be the first of many legal actions against ByHeart, said Bill Marler, a Seattle food safety lawyer who represents Dexter.",
      "\"This company potentially faces an existential crisis,\" he said.",
      "ByHeart officials didn't respond to questions about the new lawsuits but said they would \"address any legal claims in due course.\"",
      "\"We remain focused on ensuring that families using ByHeart products are aware of the recall and have factual information about steps they should take,\" the company said in a statement.",
      "In a separate statement provided to CBS News Thursday, the company said, \"We express our deepest sympathy to the families currently impacted by the cases of infant botulism.\"",
      "In Rose Dexter's case, she received ByHeart formula within days of her birth in July after breast milk was insufficient, her father said. Stephen Dexter said he went to Whole Foods to find a \"natural option.\"",
      "\"I'm a little concerned with things that are in food that may cause problems,\" he said. \"We do our best to buy something that says it's organic.\"",
      "But Rose, who was healthy at birth, didn't thrive on the formula. She had trouble feeding and was fussy and fretful as she got sicker. On Aug. 31, when she was 8 weeks old, her parents couldn't wake her.",
      "Rose was flown by air ambulance to Phoenix Children's Hospital, where she stayed for nearly two weeks.",
      "Hanna Everett told the AP she used ByHeart to supplement breastfeeding starting when Piper was 6 weeks old.",
      "\"It's supposed to be similar to breast milk,\" she said.",
      "Last weekend, Piper started showing signs of illness. Everett said she became more worried when a friend told her ByHeart had recalled two lots of its Whole Nutrition Infant Formula. When a family member checked the empty cans, they matched the recalled lots.",
      "\"I was like, 'Oh my god, we need to go to the ER,\" Everett recalled to the AP.",
      "At Kentucky Children's Hospital, Piper's condition worsened rapidly. Her pupils stopped dilating correctly and she lost her gag reflex. Her head and arms became limp and floppy.",
      "Doctors immediately ordered doses of the BabyBIG medication, which had to be shipped from California, Hanna said. In the meantime, Piper had to have a feeding tube and IV lines inserted.",
      "In both cases, the babies improved after receiving treatment. Rose went home in September and she no longer requires a feeding tube. Piper went home this week.",

However, you'll have to stand out from your job-seeking peers, which these days requires more than simply polishing your resume and sharpening your LinkedIn profile.",

      "\"A lot of times a company already has a person in mind before it's public information, or there's a lot of weight on the scales for a particular person. A lot of hiring, whether we like it or not, is done this way,\" career coach Cynthia Pong told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "This makes professional networking even more crucial.",
      "When applying for a job can be as easy as clicking a button, recruiters find themselves inundated with digital applications they have to weed through, according to Pong. She said a personal recommendation can be tremendously helpful in getting a hiring manager's attention.",
      "\"If we're smart about leveraging our network, it goes a long way in  cutting through the noise that is the pile of digital or paper resumes  on [the] other person's side,\" she said.",
      "How do you network?",
      "Pong says she often works with job seekers who don't trust that the people they know can be helpful in their job searches.",
      "\"A lot of people say they have no network, their community doesn't know anyone. I am used to hearing that preliminary objection. I press people and say, you do know people, and those people also know people \u2014 and that's a network,\" she said.",
      "She encourages job seekers to spend 70% to 80% of their time networking, versus blasting out resumes and cold applying to posted openings.",
      "Start by making a list of people you know in broad categories, such as through family, high school, college and graduate school, and from past jobs and internships. One way to identify contacts from your past is to go through your own resume or LinkedIn profile.",

      "Next, organize your contacts into a list or spreadsheet and set performance goals for yourself.",
      "\"Each week say, 'I'm going to reach out to x number of people on this list. In a couple weeks, you'll have made progress,\" Pong said.",
      "Once you connect, end every conversation by asking your contact who else they recommend you reach out to in order to grow your network.",

      "Optimize your online presence",
      "It's easy for recruiters to search for a candidate online and access reams of personal and professional information about them.",
      "This is why one's online presence is increasingly important.",
      "\"Think about what someone who Googles your name sees,\" Pong said. \"Do they even see me if I have a common name? If they do see me, is something coming up that is not just my LinkedIn profile? What's better is if it's that plus other things that demonstrate in the first couple of hits what you stand for, what your value add is and what are you passionate about.\"",
      "That can be achieved by building a personal website highlighting past work, for example.",

      "To save time and meet more people, Auerbach signed up for paid versions of a handful of dating apps and found himself spending around $1,000 per month on paid features. That allowed him to view roughly 100 profiles, which he'd whittle down to a date or two.",
      "\"If you're not paying, you're not getting dates,\" Auerbach said. He compared these features such as \"boosts\" that raise your profile's visibility to \"going into a casino where you buy a bunch of chips, throw them in a slot machine where the wheels spin, and you hope you see someone attractive.",
      "Notably, he also conceded that he's spent \"a lot of money\" on dating apps, and ultimately hasn't found them that useful.",

      "The pay schedule was laid out in an agency-by-agency projection by the White House's Office of Management and Budget. The memo was first reported by Semafor, and an OMB official confirmed its contents to CBS News.",
      "Hundreds of thousands of essential employees continued working during the shutdown without pay, while nonessential employees were furloughed. Both groups are entitled to back pay for the paychecks they missed while the government was closed.",
      "The administration has a goal of completing its list of backlogged payments by Nov. 19.",
      "Differing dates among agencies are due to different pay schedules and payroll providers, an OMB official said. The official added that the original projected pay dates were supposed to be later, but the White House urged agencies to get checks out \"expeditiously and accurately to not leave anyone waiting longer than necessary.\"",
      "Most of the first post-shutdown paychecks to employees will only include pay from Oct. 1 to Nov. 1. They will be limited to base pay, meaning no bonuses, overtime or benefits. Pay for days after Nov. 1, as well as for overtime or bonuses, will be issued in the next pay period.",
      "Up first are Army and non-Army civilian employees at the Defense Department, as well as staffers at the Departments of Veterans Affairs, Energy and Health and Human Services. Their paychecks are projected to be processed on Sunday, Nov. 16. The checks will include base pay and payments for overtime and hazard pay.",

These checks cover the entire period of the shutdown, including from Nov. 1 to Nov. 13.",
      "Federal employees going without pay became a major pain point during the Senate's fight over funding the government, and was one of several factors that ultimately pushed eight Senate Democrats to join Republicans to end the stalemate.

      "Unionized Starbucks workers are walking off the job on Thursday after their labor group authorized a strike as they push to secure a first labor contract.",
      "Starbucks Workers United is calling the strike the \"red cup rebellion,\" since it coincides with the coffee chain's annual Red Cup Day promotion, when it gives away free reusable holiday cups at its retail locations. Starbucks Workers United, which represents more than 9,500 baristas across 550 Starbucks cafes, is asking for better pay, increased staffing and a resolution of labor disputes.",
      "The strike will start with more than 65 stores in over 40 cities across the country, the union said, noting that the labor action has no prescribed end date.",
      "\"There are already stores that have been shut down for the day, and we anticipate there to be dozens more that have to shut down today as well,\" Starbucks Workers United spokesperson Michelle Eisen, who has worked as a barista at Starbucks for 15 years, said during a press call Thursday morning.",
      "Workers United said it is prepared to escalate the strike if Starbucks does not deliver a contract and \"resolve unfair labor practice charges.\"",
      "\"If Starbucks keeps stonewalling a fair contract and refusing to end union-busting, they'll see their business grind to a halt,\" Eisen said in a statement. \"No contract, no coffee is more than a tagline \u2014 it's a pledge to interrupt Starbucks operations and profits until a fair union contract and an end to unfair labor practices are won.\"",
      "Starbucks describes strike impact as \"minimal\"",
      "Starbucks spokesperson Jaci Anderson said the company is seeing \"minimal impacts\" on Thursday morning across its more than 17,000 U.S. coffeehouses. Less than 1% of the company's stores are impacted by the strike, she noted.",
      "In October,\u00a0Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol told \"CBS Mornings\" that the company has \"the best benefits\" and \"the best wages\" in the industry.",
      "\"What their requests to date have been, has been unreasonable,\" Niccol said. \"We're willing to, you know, negotiate and have 'em come back to the table and find a solution.\"",
      "Starbucks said it offers the equivalent of $30 an hour in pay and employee benefits. However, Workers United claims that many workers aren't getting enough hours to qualify for benefits. The union told CBS News that the starting wage for baristas is $15.25 in a majority of states.",
      "\"The reality is I make $17 an hour, and I live paycheck to paycheck,\" said Starbucks barista and Chicago resident Diego Franco. \"I can't sustain myself on that. I can't sustain my mom's medical bills.\"",
      "Starbucks Workers United announced last week that its members had\u00a0voted to authorize a strike, with 92% of members backing a work stoppage.",
      "\"We are disappointed that Workers United, who only represents around 4% of our partners, has voted to authorize a strike instead of returning to the bargaining table,\" Anderson told CBS News in a statement at the time. \"When they're ready to come back, we're ready to talk.\"",
      "Contract talks between Starbucks and Workers United began in April 2024 but fell apart in December. The union says it has secured 33 tentative agreements from Starbucks, but maintains that the vast majority are non-economic proposals.",
      "Sharon Block, a professor at Harvard Law School, told CBS News the fitful contract negotiations between Starbucks and its organized workforce highlight the weakness of federal labor law in bringing employers to the bargaining table.",
      "\"The law just seems to be incapable of ensuring a fair playing field for these workers who take big risks,\" added Block, a former official in the federal Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs during the Biden administration.",
      "The strike marks the union's third national work stoppage in the past year. Workers United last protested in May over Starbucks' new dress code, and thousands also walked off the job in December 2024.",

      "After weeks of uncertainty, millions of Americans will soon start receiving federal nutrition assistance benefits again, after President Trump on Wednesday night signed a bill passed by Congress to end the longest\u00a0government shutdown\u00a0in U.S. history.",
      "The legislation funds Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, benefits through September 2026. It also reimburses the program's contingency reserves to account for expenditures during the government shutdown.",
      "The U.S. Department of Agriculture told states last month that it would not fund SNAP, also known as food stamps, for November if the shutdown continued. Nearly 42 million Americans receive SNAP benefits to help pay for groceries.",
      "An agency spokesperson told CBS News on Wednesday that SNAP recipients in most states will get their benefits \"within 24 hours\" after the government shutdown ends. The Office of Management and Budget did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Experts told CBS News they expect the flow of benefits to start relatively quickly once the shutdown ends, but noted that the exact timeline could differ by state.",

      "At least 19 states, plus the District of Columbia, issued full benefits to at least some recipients last week, according to The Associated Press.

      "In addition, 16 states have loaded the EBT cards used in SNAP with partial benefits, the AP reported.",
      "Although federal agencies could soon be set to reopen, experts said the interruption in nutrition aid has already hurt many Americans who lean on SNAP to put food on the table.",
      "\"You can't eat retroactively when your SNAP was delayed,\" Victoria Negus, a senior economic justice advocate at the nonprofit Massachusetts Law Reform Institute, told CBS News. \"Getting your [delayed] benefits is better than never getting them at all, but it doesn't help the harm that you experienced in the past.\"",

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Sen. Bill Cassidy, Republican of Louisiana, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Nov. 16, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to Face the Nation. \u00a0On Friday, we spoke with the Chairman of one of the Senate committees responsible for crafting health care legislation, Louisiana's Bill Cassidy, who is also a doctor. We began by showing him what the President is thinking of for a healthcare fix.",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I'm calling today for insurance companies not to be paid, but for the money, this massive amount of money to be paid directly to the people of our country so that they can buy their own health care, which will be far better and far less expensive than the disaster known as Obamacare.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So are you, Senator, coordinating with the White House on this proposal?",
      "SEN. BILL CASSIDY: So we're absolutely in communication with the White House and with the administration, because there's a lot of stuff that you have to work out to do that. But let me give a little meat on the bones of what the President's speaking about. If you look at an Obamacare policy now, there's a $6,000 deductible. Democrats are fighting to lower the premiums. You lower a premium on something which has $6,000 deductible, it's basically a catastrophic policy. Now, I like to speak of the cost of being insured, not just the cost of the health insurance. The President is proposing that we take the $26 billion that would be going to insurance companies if we just do a straight out extension, and by the way, 20 percent of that $26 billion, 20 percent will go for profit and administrative overhead, give it directly to the American people in an account in which 100 percent of the money is used for them to purchase health care on their own terms. Now- now, that makes them an informed consumer. It also helps address the need to have coverage for that deductible, and if they get that policy with a higher deductible, they can actually lower their premium. It's a sweet spot, lower premiums, help with the deductible, making the patient the informed consumer, the President and I are united. We should all be united about that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the President's economic adviser, Kevin Hassett, was on this program last Sunday. He said the president was just brainstorming, things aren't formally put together among Republican senators yet, but I just want to clarify what you are coordinating with the President on here, because, is it to buy your own insurance policy, which is kind of complicated, or is it to use this flexible spending account you've talked about for related health care needs? Like, are there restrictions on how you can use that money?",
      "SEN. CASSIDY: So first, there's two types of premium tax credits. There's the baseline premium tax credit, which was part of Obamacare, that would stay in effect, and people would still buy a policy. For example, they get in a car wreck, something disastrous. They need somebody negotiating on their behalf with all the providers. That stays the same. What we're talking about the shutdown was over the enhanced premium tax credits. Policies have become so expensive under Obamacare that under Joe Biden, Democrats passed another subsidy on top of the first subsidy. That's what we're fighting about and what Republicans are saying, and I like to hope Democrats will too. Hey, wait a second, if we can have lower premiums and help people with their deductible by giving the money directly to the patient. By the way, 20 percent doesn't go for insurance company profit and overhead. 100percent goes for health care. Why don't we unite Republican and Democrats in doing that? That's where the President is. You got to figure some things out. But we're a lot further along than you might imagine.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So do you want to fix Obamacare, or do you want to eliminate Obamacare?",
      "SEN. CASSIDY: First, you have to, like, we're going into 2026. That's like a month and a half from now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SEN. CASSIDY: And so you've got to work with what you have. But on the other hand, Obamacare was a top heavy, administratively heavy type system in which a lot of money is a lot of money, and responsibility is taken from individuals and given to insurance companies. As one example, I'm a doctor. I work for 20 years in a hospital for the uninsured. I found that if you give the patient the power, good things happen that's supported, by the way, by the medical literature, if the patient is engaged in her health care and the health care of her family. She's going to be a wise shopper, wise for her health and wise for her pocketbook. We need to have a new model, and that model is to engage the patient in her own health care. Doing so is good for her, good for us all.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, but you said we need to work with what we have. That is, as you just said, you have a short amount of time before the end of the year. Do you think you need to extend the health care tax subsidies that are currently in place until you figure out all the rest of this complicated policy making?",
      "SEN. CASSIDY: Let me back you up just a little bit, Margaret. I'll just say, everybody assumes it's easy just to extend the premium tax credits, the enhanced premium tax credits. It's not that easy. 50 percent of the states did not plan on them being extended, and they don't have rates as if they were to be extended. So that means if we pass this mid December, they've got to recalculate rates in time for, wait a second, by that time, we're already into 2026 it's not an easy matter. And by the way, did I mention the policies that people want to lower the premiums for have $6,000 deductibles. It is basically something for insurance companies to make money off of and for the individual to wade through $6,000 of debt before they can finally access it. Now, the kind of proposal I am proposing Republicans are, and I hope Democrats will join, is, let's take that money, and we have a mechanism to do so. We give it to the patient. By giving her that money, she could choose a bronze level plan, which is to say lower premiums. So now her premiums are down, but she has money in an account to help with the deductible, and I think we can figure that out about as easily as we can figure out what we would do if we just did a straight out extension.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you want to do all this, though, by the second week of December, when the Democrats have been promised they'll have a vote on an ACA bill of their choice.",
      "SEN. CASSIDY: Yes, and I tell my Democratic colleagues first, let's not be Democrats and Republicans. Let's be Americans, representing all of Americans. Let's recognize what you're doing just gives money to insurance companies, but we can do it better with lower premiums and with money and accounts to pay deductibles. And then why don't we come together? There can be a Democratic bill and a Republican bill, and both fail. Let's do an American bill where the American people benefit and this work together, collaborate to lower those premiums and help them with that first dollar coverage in the- in the deductible.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So we looked and there are about 293,000 Louisianans, your state, enrolled in Obamacare currently, six weeks from now, those extent expanded tax credits that you've been talking about will go away for individuals making $62,000 or above. Individuals making less than that amount will see their tax credit shrink. So are you telling those hundreds of thousands of Louisianans that that tax credit is going away no matter what, that- that they should make plans\u2013",
      "SEN. CASSIDY: No.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013 for higher prices?",
      "SEN. CASSIDY: I'm telling them that we're I'm telling them that we are working to make it work better for them. And they would tell you, by the way, wait a second, I got a $6,000 deductible that does not work for me. Margaret, I'm a doctor. I would talk to people when they'd come to see me, and they would tell me, I can't afford that. My deductible is too high. That's reality, and that reality is being lost in this discussion. We've got to do something about sky high deductibles. Maybe you can afford the premium. You can't afford the policy. Let's lower the cost of having health insurance, focusing by not just on the premium, but the deductible. And I think we can do both.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, even in the private market, health care costs have gone up up six to 9 percent when you look at the projections. But I want to ask you about your oversight role. Secretary Kennedy has this hand picked panel of vaccine advisors. You know them at ACIP. They're going to meet in a few days and potentially vote on changing the hepatitis B vaccine schedule for infants. That same vaccine advisory group is also considering the safety of vaccine ingredients like aluminum, which would impact a number of childhood shots. This should matter for American parents. Are you comfortable with what they are about to put to a vote?",
      "SEN. CASSIDY: I'm very concerned about this. As it turns out, my medical practice focused on hepatitis B, and so we know that because of a recommended dose at birth of hepatitis B vaccine, recommended, not mandated, the number of children born contracting hepatitis B at birth, or shortly thereafter, has decreased from about 20,000, 20 years ago to like 200 now. That's 20- effectively a clerical error. We have decreased incidence of chronic hepatitis B by 20,000 people over the last two decades with this kind of recommendation. And by the way, if you're infected at birth, you're more likely- you're 95 percent likely to become a chronic carrier. The vaccine is safe. It has been established, and these ingredients they're speaking of have been shown to be safe. This is policy by people who don't understand the epidemiology of hepatitis B, or who have grown comfortable with the fact that we've been so successful with our recommendation that now the incidence of hepatitis B is so low, they feel like we can rest on our laurels. I'm a doctor. I have seen people die from vaccine-preventable disease. I want people to be healthy. I want to make America healthy, and you don't start by stopping recommendations that have made us substantially healthier.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the president of the United States also told American women not to take Tylenol. Or give it to their kids. This is based on a theory that it causes autism somehow. And he also in a social media post, the same one, called for the measles, mumps and rubella shot to be broken up into three different shots. That was then endorsed by the acting CDC director. Are you concerned by this kind of suggestive linkage at the top of the CDC and from the White House?",
      "SEN. CASSIDY: Again, I'm a doctor, and so I'm going to go where the evidence takes me. And the best evidence is a study out of Sweden with 2 million children that found no- no causality, no association, if you will, between taking Tylenol in pregnancy and getting autism. And of course, that concerns me, because there's going to be a mom out there \u2014again, I'm a doctor, I talk to I talk to patients\u2014 in a room, and her child has autism. She took Tylenol for a high fever during pregnancy and now she blames herself. That's just the way mamas think, and that's wrong. We don't want her to think that. The best evidence is that there is no relationship, by the way, if you have a high fever during pregnancy, that may be a risk for autism. Now, of course, if you're pregnant, talk to your physician before you take anything, but point being, the best evidence is that there is no relationship between the two. And I don't want women putting themselves on a guilt trip when the best evidence shows not. By the way, the President has spoken out strongly in favor of immunizations in other cases, and I noted, when he got his physical, he got the flu and COVID shots. So the President has demonstrated that he believes in immunization.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But that's why clarifying the statements, I think, is important, since you interpret them differently. I wonder, do you regret your confirmation vote for Secretary Kennedy?",
      "SEN. CASSIDY: I smile because every reporter asks me that--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, because these questions run right into a pledge that you extracted from him not to tinker with some of the structures that were set in place to have oversight of these vaccines and this process.",
      "SEN. CASSIDY: So you live life forward, again, you just do, let the day's own troubles be sufficient for the day. And I'll credit the secretary. He's brought attention to things like ultra-processed food that has, frankly, never received this sort of attention before, and people praise him for that. So he and I have publicly disagreed on some matters, but I strongly agree with him on others, and so, so that's how I'll answer your question.",
      "if this is your final year in office, sir, will you make overhauling health care your top priority?",
      "SEN. CASSIDY: Well, I sure hope it's not my final year in office, but, but I've been thinking about healthcare for 30 years, because when I worked in a public hospital for the uninsured, I saw the burden it could be on middle-income families who had middle income but couldn't afford the insurance or couldn't assure afford the healthcare. And so it's been my priority for 30 years, and I will continue to do that. And if there is a silver lining, if there is a silver lining in the shutdown, we just had, the silver lining is now we are focused on how do we make health care more affordable for the American people. That should be our goal, not to be partisan one way or the other. How do we make it more affordable for fellow Americans? If we can accomplish that, I will feel like I've done my job.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator, thank you for your time.",
      "SEN. CASSIDY: Thank you Margaret.",

In September, the panel voted to table a vote on whether to change the pediatric vaccine schedule for hepatitis B to a later date.",

      "President Trump has issued a second pardon to a January 6 defendant who remained imprisoned on separate gun offenses, leading to his release on Friday.",
      "Dan Wilson was one of the supporters of Mr. Trump who breached the Capitol on January 6, 2021. The Justice Department said in a 2024 news release that Wilson was a militia member who entered the building in a gas mask.",
      "He pleaded guilty to a charge of conspiracy to impede or injure a federal officer in May 2024 and was sentenced to five years in prison.",
      "He was pardoned on that charge in January 2025 when Mr. Trump granted clemency for about 1,500 January 6 defendants.",
      "Despite the pardon, Wilson remained incarcerated. Authorities had searched his home in June 2022 as part of their investigation into his presence at the Capitol.",
      "They recovered \"numerous firearms and ammunition,\" the Justice Department said, which he was forbidden from possessing because of previous felony convictions.",
      "Wilson pled guilty to a charge of possession of a firearm by a prohibited person and a charge of possession of an unregistered firearm, and was set to remain in prison until 2028.",
      "A White House official told CBS News that Mr. Trump was pardoning Wilson because the home search that led to the discovery of the firearms was part of the investigation into Wilson's January 6 charges.",
      "Wilson's pardon, reviewed by CBS News, was dated to Friday. He was released from prison on Friday evening, his lawyer George Pallas told the Associated Press.",
      "\"For too long, my client has been held as a political prisoner by a government that criminalized dissent,\" Pallas said in a statement to CBS News. \"President Trump's pardon rights this wrong and sends a clear message that peaceful Americans will not be persecuted for their beliefs. Mr. Wilson is innocent, he has always been innocent, and this pardon proves it.\"",
      "A sprawling legal battle",
      "Wilson's case became part of a legal debate over whether Mr. Trump's pardon of January 6-related crimes applied to other offenses discovered in investigations related to those charges. Mr. Trump has downplayed the events of the attack and referred to those jailed in connection with it as \"hostages.\"",
      "Wilson planned to participate in the riot at the Capitol for weeks, according to the Justice Department's 2024 news release, and occasionally discussed bringing firearms. He ultimately arrived unarmed.",
      "Throughout the day, he provided information in messaging channels about where people needed support as they worked to enter the Capitol, the Justice Department said. He also spoke to other members of far-right groups, including the Oath Keepers.",
      "The Justice Department initially argued that Trump's pardons did not extend to Wilson's gun charges, but later changed its position, saying that it had received \"further clarity on the intent of the Presidential Pardon.\"",
      "U.S. District Judge Dabney Friedrich, who oversaw Wilson's case and was nominated by Mr. Trump during his first term, criticized the move and called efforts to extend the pardon to cover offenses discovered in the course of the investigations \"extraordinary,\" according to the Associated Press.",
      "Mr. Trump also pardoned Suzanne Kaye, a Florida woman who was sentenced to 18 months in prison for threatening to shoot FBI agents. Kaye was questioned by FBI agents after saying online that she had been at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, according to CBS Miami. When contacted by agents, Kaye denied she had been there, but still agreed to speak with them, CBS Miami reported.",
      "In her video, posted to multiple platforms after that conversation but before her interview, Kaye said she would not talk to the FBI without a lawyer and that she would \"my second amendment right to shoot your f------ ass if you come here,\" according to CBIS Miami. A White House official described Kaye's comments as \"voicing her displeasure with the FBI using curt language,\" and said that it was \"clearly a case of disfavored First Amendment political speech being prosecuted and an excessive sentence.\"",

      "Hundreds of National Guard troops that were dispatched to Portland, Oregon, and Chicago, Illinois, from California and Texas in response to protests over the Trump administration's immigration crackdown will return to their home states, a Defense Department official confirmed to CBS News Saturday.",
      "Last month, about 200 federalized California National Guard soldiers were sent to Portland, while another 200 federalized Texas National Guard soldiers were sent to Chicago. All those soldiers will return, the official said.",
      "In both cases, the White House had argued that the troops were being sent to \"protect federal assets and personnel,\" with the president invoking Title 10 of the federal code, which allows for its use if the president deems that \"there is a rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of the government of the United States.\"",
      "Federal judges, however \u2014 in response to lawsuits brought by city and state officials \u2014 had\u00a0so far blocked\u00a0federalized National Guard soldiers from actually being deployed on the streets of Portland and Chicago, keeping them in a kind of holding pattern while they awaited the legal wrangling of their cases to play out.",
      "The Trump administration on Friday appealed a ruling\u00a0to the Supreme Court which permanently barred the deployment of National Guard troops in Portland.",
      "The defense official also told CBS News that the number of federalized Oregon National Guard members will be reduced from 200 to 100. The approximately 300 Illinois National Guard members that were previously federalized as part of the operation will remain under federal control, the official added.",
      "This comes after U.S. Northern Command issued a statement Friday which said that the Department of War, the Trump administration's preferred name for the Defense Department, would \"be shifting and/or rightsizing our Title 10 footprint in Portland, Los Angeles, and Chicago to ensure a constant, enduring, and long-term presence in each city.\"",
      "Portland and Chicago have seen months-long demonstrations at U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities. Mr. Trump's controversial decision to attempt to deploy federal troops in response has prompted heavy pushback from local and state officials, who criticize the moves as an unnecessary escalation.",

      "\"Aggressive rhetoric attacking me has historically led to death threats and multiple convictions of men who were radicalized by the same type rhetoric being directed at me right now,\" Greene wrote in a lengthy social media post. \"This time by the President of the United States. As a woman I take threats from men seriously. I now have a small understanding of the fear and pressure the women, who are victims of Jeffrey Epstein and his cabal, must feel.\"",
      "She did not detail the exact nature of the threats. Greene's home has been the target of multiple swatting calls in the past.",

      "In an email to CBS News, a spokesperson for the group added that many of them have gotten death threats, adding it's \"part of the price of speaking out.\"",
      "In a bombshell Friday night, Mr. Trump took to Truth Social to write that he was \"withdrawing\" his \"support and Endorsement\" of Greene, indicating that he might even back an effort to primary her. He also accused her of going \"far Left.\"",

      "Greene responded on social media by saying \"President Trump just attacked me and lied about me. I haven't called him at all, but I did send these text messages today. Apparently this is what sent him over the edge.\"",
      "The two continue to exchange barbs on Saturday, with the president doubling-down, writing that \"Marjorie 'Traitor' Green is a disgrace to our GREAT REPUBLICAN PARTY!\"",
      "Greene was among one of just four House Republicans that joined all Democrats last week in signing a discharge petition to force a House vote that, if also approved by the Senate, would require the Justice Department to release all materials related to Epstein.",
      "\"It really makes you wonder what is in those files and who and what country is putting so much pressure on him?\" Green\u00a0wrote\u00a0Saturday of the president.",
      "The House Oversight Committee\u00a0on Wednesday released\u00a0more than 20,000 pages of documents related to Epstein, and some House Democrats said the contents raise questions about what Mr. Trump knew of Epstein's activities.",
      "In an exclusive interview with \"CBS Mornings\" Friday, Greene called Mr. Trump's opposition to the release of the Epstein files a \"huge miscalculation,\" arguing that the president has not been accused of misconduct in relation to Epstein.",
      "\"I truly just stand with the women, and I think they deserve to be the ones that we're fighting for,\" she said.",
      "Greene has also appeared to side with Democratic lawmakers who are calling on Congress to extend the expiring Affordable Care Act tax credits. The standoff over those credits sparked the 43-day government shutdown, which finally ended this week when eight Democratic senators crossed the aisle and reached a deal with their Republican counterparts.",
      "\"Now that the [Affordable Care Act] tax credits are expiring, which the Democrats did put in place \u2014 and they set the expiration date for this year \u2014 I see a financial crisis for Americans,\" Greene told \"CBS Morning.\" \"And so on this issue, I don't see political party lines.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump had threatened to sue the BBC for $1 billion over a program it aired in 2024 about the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol.",
    "story": [
      "The BBC has issued an apology to President Trump over\u00a0editing of a speech he gave on Jan. 6, 2021, that aired in its documentary \"Trump: A Second Chance.\" Mr. Trump had threatened to sue the British broadcaster for $1 billion over the program about the Capitol riot, and the BBC noted in a statement Thursday that it \"strongly disagree[s]\" that there's a basis for a defamation claim.",
      "BBC lawyers wrote to Mr. Trump's legal team in response to a letter they received Sunday, the BBC Press Office said. In that letter, lawyers working for Mr. Trump alleged that the Oct. 28, 2024, episode of the network's \"Panorama\" documentary program, which was produced by an external production company, sought to mislead viewers by editing together three separate sections of the speech made by Mr. Trump.",
      "\"BBC Chair Samir Shah has separately sent a personal letter to the White House making clear to President Trump that he and the Corporation are sorry for the edit of the President's speech on 6 January 2021, which featured in the programme,\" the BBC Press Office said in its statement Thursday. \"The BBC has no plans to rebroadcast the documentary 'Trump: A Second Chance?' on any BBC platforms.\"",
      "\"While the BBC sincerely regrets the manner in which the video clip was edited, we strongly disagree there is a basis for a defamation claim,\" the press office added.",
      "The White House did not immediately comment on the BBC's apology. Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One Friday night, Mr. Trump said, \"We'll sue them for anywhere between a billion and $5 billion, probably sometime next week.\"",
      "The BBC's response to Mr. Trump's legal team laid out five main arguments why the organization believes there is no legitimate case against it, BBC News reported. CBS News has not seen the letter sent by the BBC in reply to Mr. Trump's legal team.",
      "According to BBC News' report, those arguments include that the episode in question did not air in the U.S.; that it did not cause Mr. Trump harm, as he won the election a week later; and that the edits made were intended to shorten a long speech rather than to mislead. It also said that the clip was not meant to be taken in isolation, and that matters of public concern and political speech are protected under U.S. law.",
      "An expert on international media law told CBS News that the BBC's response appears to be \"careful and considered.\"",
      "\"President Trump was clearly owed a fulsome apology and he's had that,\" U.K.-based attorney Mark Stephens told CBS News. \"I don't think he was entitled to damages, and so as a consequence, they've rightly hung tough on that particular issue. But, of course, this has been a massive PR victory for the president. He can now call the BBC 'fake news' ... pointing to some credible background for that.\"",
      "The letter over the weekend from Mr. Trump's lawyers claimed that the program \"has caused President Trump to suffer overwhelming financial and reputational harm,\" and that it was defamatory under Florida law. It outlined demands by Mr. Trump that the BBC retract the documentary, issue an apology and \"appropriately compensate President Trump for the harm caused.\"",
      "The letter did not clarify what would be considered appropriate compensation, but it warned that if the BBC failed to comply with Mr. Trump's demands by Friday at 5 p.m. ET, Mr. Trump would file \"legal action for no less than $1,000,000,000 (One Billion Dollars) in damages.\"",
      "Stephens told CBS News that while it would be possible for Mr. Trump to pursue a lawsuit against the BBC in the U.S., \"it's got a number of legal impediments and tripwires.\"",
      "First, Stephens said, was that the program which included the clip was not shown in the U.S.",
      "\"You can't be lowered in the estimation of right-thinking people by a program that wasn't seen by an American audience. So you can't sue, there's no jurisdiction to sue, in America,\" he said.",
      "He also said that because Mr. Trump is \"the president, the ultimate public figure,\" criticism of him would likely be protected under the First Amendment.",
      "Even if the case got past those hurdles, which he doubted, Stephens said, \"lawyers would be looking at whether or not the sting of this was true.

    "story": [
      "President Trump said he will no longer support Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, calling her \"wacky\" and a \"traitor\" to the GOP, making a dramatic break with a longtime loyalist who has increasingly criticized the president and her party's leadership in recent weeks.",
      "In an almost 300-word missive on\u00a0Truth Social\u00a0Friday night, the president said Greene \"has gone Far Left,\" and wrote that \"all I see 'Wacky' Marjorie do is COMPLAIN, COMPLAIN, COMPLAIN!\"",
      "\"She has told many people that she is upset that I don't return her phone calls anymore, but with 219 Congressmen/women, 53 U.S. Senators, 24 Cabinet Members, almost 200 Countries, and an otherwise normal life to lead, I can't take a ranting Lunatic's call every day,\" he wrote.",
      "The president said he's withdrawing his endorsement of Greene and will support a primary challenge against her \"if the right person runs\" in her deep-red northern Georgia district.",
      "Greene, on Saturday, said in a\u00a0post on X\u00a0that she never thought that \"fighting to release the Epstein files, defending women who were victims of rape, and fighting to expose the web of rich powerful elites would have caused this, but here we are.\"",
      "\"And it truly speaks for itself,\" she wrote, in part. \"There needs to be a new way forward. The toxic political industrial complex thrives on ripping us all apart but never delivers anything good for the American people, whom I love.\"",
      "The congresswoman also said later Saturday that she has been receiving threats since Mr. Trump began openly criticizing her.",
      "\"Aggressive rhetoric attacking me has historically led to death threats and multiple convictions of men who were radicalized by the same type rhetoric being directed at me right now,\" Greene said. \"This time by the President of the United States.\"",
      "In her back-and-forth with Mr. Trump which began Friday, Greene said that she \"will continue to pray this administration will be successful\" despite the fact that the president \"just attacked me and lied about me.\"",
      "\"I have supported President Trump with too much of my precious time, too much of my own money, and fought harder for him even when almost all other Republicans turned their back and denounced him,\" she wrote on X. \"But I don't worship or serve Donald Trump. I worship God, Jesus is my savior, and I serve my district GA14 and the American people.\"",
      "Mr. Trump escalated his attacks on Greene on Saturday, saying in a Truth Social post: \"Marjorie 'Traitor' Greene is a disgrace to our GREAT REPUBLICAN PARTY!\"",
      "\"Lightweight Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Brown (Green grass turns Brown when it begins to ROT!), betrayed the entire Republican Party when she turned Left, performed poorly on the pathetic View, and became the RINO that we all know she always was,\" the president said in part in\u00a0another post on Saturday.",
      "A group of more than two dozen people that identify as Epstein survivors, or family members of survivors, released a joint statement Saturday in support of Greene.",
      "\"Thank you for standing up against the intimidation, silencing, and abuse that Epstein survivors have endured for decades,\" the statement read. \"...You have our full support.\"",
      "A spokesperson for the group added that many of them have gotten death threats, adding it's \"part of the price of speaking out.\"",
      "First arriving in Congress in 2021, Greene aligned herself closely with Mr. Trump for years,\u00a0defending the then-former president\u00a0as he faced a\u00a0slew of criminal investigations.",
      "\"I didn't intentionally style myself after President Trump, but I can see how people draw those similarities,\" the often pugnacious and sharp-elbowed\u00a0congresswoman told\u00a0\"60 Minutes\" in a 2023 interview. \"We both come from the same industry, construction. I also have pretty much a plain speaking style, and so does he.\"",
      "In recent weeks, however, Greene has regularly criticized Republican congressional leaders. She's accused them of not paying enough attention to the cost of living and\u00a0failing to grapple\u00a0with rising\u00a0health insurance premiums\u00a0\u2014 drawing\u00a0rare plaudits from Democrats, who made health care a core part of their message in the government shutdown fight that ended this week.",
      "And she's clashed with Mr. Trump. She was\u00a0one of four\u00a0House Republicans to sign a petition that will force a vote on a bill to release Justice Department records on the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, helping to\u00a0breathe new life\u00a0into an issue that Mr. Trump has\u00a0repeatedly urged Republicans to drop.",
      "In an interview Friday\u00a0with \"CBS Mornings,\" Greene called the president's opposition to releasing the files a \"huge miscalculation,\" arguing he has nothing to hide.",
      "In her\u00a0post on X\u00a0after the president withdrew his support for her, Greene accused Mr. Trump of trying to \"make an example\" out of her and \"scare all the other Republicans\" ahead of a vote on releasing the Epstein records\u00a0that is expected to take place\u00a0next week. She posted a screenshot of a text that she said she sent Mr. Trump earlier Friday, encouraging him to \"lean into\" the Epstein controversy.",
      "She also recently accused the president of spending too much time on foreign policy, leading Mr. Trump\u00a0to say\u00a0Monday that she's \"lost her way.\" In her \"CBS Mornings\"\u00a0interview, she responded: \"I haven't lost my way \u2014 I'm for the American people only.\"",
      "\"I am America first and I make no apologies about that to anyone,\" she said.",
      "In Friday's Truth Social post breaking with the congresswoman, the president suggested next year's Georgia Senate race might be another sore point between him and Greene.",
      "She\u00a0announced in May\u00a0that she will not run for Senate because the chamber's Republican caucus \"refuses to win.\" On Friday, Mr. Trump claimed that he played a role in discouraging her from joining the fray and trying to unseat Democratic Sen. Jon Ossoff, in what's expected to be one of the most hotly contested races of the 2026 midterms.",
      "\"It seemed to all begin when I sent her a Poll stating that she should not run for Senator, or Governor, she was at 12%, and didn't have a chance (unless, of course, she had my Endorsement \u2014 which she wasn't about to get!),\" Mr. Trump wrote.",

      "The Trump administration is planning to dispatch scores of Border Patrol agents to Charlotte and New Orleans to oversee immigration enforcement operations that could involve armored vehicles and special operations teams, according to internal government documents and U.S. officials.",
      "Internal DHS preparations reviewed by CBS News listed Charlotte and New Orleans as the next targets of President Trump's mass deportation campaign. Like in\u00a0Chicago\u00a0and\u00a0Los Angeles\u00a0\u2014 which have seen highly visible and often controversial federal immigration arrests in recent months \u2014 green-uniformed Border Patrol agents are expected to play a lead role in the operations in Charlotte and New Orleans.",
      "The planned Border Patrol operation in Charlotte, where an operations center is being stood up, is expected to start soon, as early as next week, two sources familiar with the plans told CBS News.",
      "Garry McFadden, the sheriff of Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, said Thursday he had been \"contacted by two separate federal o\ufb03cials confirming US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) personnel will be arriving in the Charlotte area as early as this Saturday or the beginning of next week.\"",
      "Border Patrol's focus is then expected to shift to New Orleans, where as many as 200 CBP agents could be deployed, according to the sources and internal DHS documents.",
      "Armored vehicles, including so-called \"BearCats,\" have been requested for both Charlotte and New Orleans, alongside special operations agents, the internal documents show. Internally, officials have dubbed the plans \"Charlotte Web\" and \"Catahoula Crunch,\" references to the children's novel and the official state dog of Louisiana, respectively.",
      "Many of the Border Patrol agents deployed to the Chicago region earlier this fall, including outspoken commander Gregory Bovino, are expected to participate in the upcoming operations in Charlotte and New Orleans, two U.S. officials said. CBS News was\u00a0first to report\u00a0last week that Bovino and most Border Patrol agents would be leaving Chicago, and that they could be redirected to locations like Charlotte.",
      "In a statement to CBS News Saturday, the Department of Homeland Security confirmed it is \"surging\" agents to Charlotte.",
      "\"We are surging DHS law enforcement to Charlotte to ensure Americans are safe and public safety threats are removed,\" DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said. \"There have been too many victims of criminal illegal aliens, and President Trump and Secretary Noem will step up to protect Americans when sanctuary politicians won't.\"",
      "In a statement Friday, North Carolina Gov. Josh Stein, a Democrat, said, \"Public safety is the top priority for all of us in government \u2014 that means fighting crime, not stoking fear or causing division.\"",
      "\"We should all focus on arresting violent criminals and drug traffickers. Unfortunately, that's not always what we have seen with ICE and Border Patrol Agents in Chicago and elsewhere around the country,\" Stein said, noting that many of those detained there had\u00a0no criminal convictions.",
      "He urged North Carolinians \"to remember our values,\" follow the law and remain peaceful. And he added, \"If you see any inappropriate behavior, use your phones to record and notify local law enforcement.\"",
      "Charlotte Mayor Vi Lyles said Saturday in a joint statement with other local officials, the expected Border Patrol operations are \"causing unnecessary fear and uncertainty\" in the community, as\u00a0previous operations in other cities like Chicago\u00a0\"have resulted in people without criminal records being detained and violent protests being the result of unwarranted actions.\"",
      "The latest plans illustrate the Trump administration's continued reliance on Border Patrol agents to carry out its sweeping, nationwide crackdown on illegal immigration.",
      "While Immigration and Customs Enforcement is the federal agency charged with enforcing U.S. immigration laws in the interior of the country, the Trump administration has deployed teams of Border Patrol agents to Chicago, Los Angeles and other places far away from the U.S.-Mexico border, where illegal crossings plunged to a 55-year low in fiscal year 2025.",
      "In both Chicago and Los Angeles, the operations by Border Patrol agents, in many cases personally led by Bovino, have come under scrutiny, sparking protests and tense confrontations with local residents who have denounced the agency's actions as overly aggressive.",
      "ICE officers and Border Patrol agents are all federal immigration officials with the same legal authority to arrest people suspected of being in the country illegally. But their operations typically differ in style and nature.",
      "While ICE has also aggressively expanded immigration enforcement across the country under Mr. Trump, its arrests continue to be, to a large extent, targeted operations driven by intelligence gathering and prior surveillance that typically target people in the U.S. illegally who also have committed crimes.",
      "In Chicago and Los Angeles, on the other hand, Border Patrol agents have conducted \"roving\" operations that are more indiscriminate in nature, targeting places like Home Depot parking lots and worksites that they believe are frequented by people who don't have legal permission to be in the U.S.",
      "The use of force that Border Patrol has employed against protesters has also come under withering criticism, including from a federal judge in Chicago who imposed drastic limits on the ability for agents to deploy tear gas and crowd control tactics. Trump administration officials maintain agents have used the necessary force, citing instances of civilians interfering with operations or turning to violence.",
      "\"The use of force that I've seen has been exemplary \u2014 the least amount of force necessary to accomplish the mission,\" Bovino\u00a0told CBS News\u00a0last month.",

      "Washington \u2014 President Trump on Friday asked the Justice Department and FBI to investigate convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein's involvement with prominent Democrats, including former President Bill Clinton, and major financial institutions.",
      "In a post on Truth Social, Mr. Trump accused Democrats of focusing on what he calls the \"Epstein hoax\" to deflect blame for the government shutdown, which ended Wednesday and was the longest in U.S. history.",
      "\"I will be asking A.G. Pam Bondi, and the Department of Justice, together with our great patriots at the FBI, to investigate Jeffrey Epstein's involvement and relationship with Bill Clinton, Larry Summers, Reid Hoffman, J.P. Morgan, Chase, and many other people and institutions, to determine what was going on with them, and him,\" the president wrote. \"This is another Russia, Russia, Russia Scam, with all arrows pointing to the Democrats. Records show that these men, and many others, spent large portions of their life with Epstein, and on his 'Island.' Stay tuned!!!\"",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi soon said she had asked Jay Clayton, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, to lead the investigation. Clayton's office covers matters from Manhattan and the Bronx, as well as the counties north of New York City.",
      "\"As with all matters, the Department will pursue this with urgency and integrity to deliver answers to the American people,\" she wrote on X.",
      "The announcement comes four months after the Justice Department and FBI\u00a0said in a July memo\u00a0that they had conducted an \"exhaustive review\" of material related to Epstein and \"did not uncover evidence that could predicate an investigation against uncharged third parties.\" They also said there was no \"client list\" or \"credible evidence\" that Epstein blackmailed prominent figures.",
      "Mr. Trump's announcement comes as the House is expected to vote next week on a bill that would force the Justice Department to release files from its investigation into Epstein. The president opposes the release of that material and has accused Republicans who backed the effort to force a vote on the proposal of being \"soft and foolish.\" GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia told \"CBS Mornings\" on Friday that she believes the president's stance on the Epstein files is a \"huge miscalculation.\"",
      "When asked about the vote on Saturday, Mr. Trump said, \"I don't care about it released or not.\"",
      "\"What I think you should do if you're going to do it, then you have to go into Epstein's friends,\" he told reporters aboard Air Force One.",
      "The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, which is conducting its own investigation into the federal government's handling of its probe into Epstein, released earlier this week more than 20,000 pages of material it obtained from Epstein's estate.",
      "Among the records are emails and messages exchanged with Epstein that mention Mr. Trump. In one email from Epstein to author Michael Wolff in January 2019, Epstein wrote, \"Of course he knew about the girls as he asked ghislaine to stop,\" referencing Mr. Trump and Ghislaine Maxwell, a longtime associate of Epstein's. It's unclear what Epstein was referring to.",
      "Maxwell was convicted in 2021 and is serving a 20-year prison sentence for her role in helping Epstein recruit, groom and abuse underage girls.",
      "In another email from Epstein to Maxwell in April 2011, he wrote, \"I want you to realize that that dog that hasn't barked is trump.. virginia spent hours at my house with him ,, he has never once been mentioned.\"",
      "The president has not been accused of wrongdoing. While he and Epstein ran in the same social circles in New York and Palm Beach, Florida, from the late 1980s to early 2000s, Mr. Trump has said the two had a falling out around 2004 and had not spoken in the years leading up to Epstein's 2019 death.",
      "He died by suicide at a Manhattan correctional facility after he was indicted on federal sex-trafficking charges.",
      "The latest release from the Oversight Committee also shows that Epstein corresponded regularly with Summers, who was treasury secretary during Clinton's presidency and led the National Economic Council under former President Barack Obama.",
      "The Wall Street Journal reported in 2023 on Epstein's contacts with Summers. A spokesperson for Summers said at the time that he \"deeply regrets being in contact with Epstein after his conviction.\" Epstein was investigated with federal and state officials between 2005 and 2006. Under a deal reached with federal prosecutors in 2007, Epstein agreed to plead guilty to two state prostitution charges and serve an 18-month sentence to avoid federal charges. He served less than 13 months and was released in 2009.",
      "As part of its review, the House Oversight panel issued a subpoena to Clinton in August for testimony because of his past ties to Epstein and Maxwell in the early 2000s.",
      "A spokesperson for Clinton said in 2019 after Epstein was indicted that the former president took four trips on Epstein's plane in 2002 and 2003, traveling to Europe, Asia and Africa. Angel Ure\u00f1a, the spokesperson, said the trips included stops in connection with the Clinton Foundation, and staff, foundation supporters and Clinton's Secret Service detail were on every leg of every trip. Clinton also had a meeting with Epstein in 2002 and made \"one brief visit\" to Epstein's apartment with a staff member and his security detail, Ure\u00f1a said.",
      "In a post on X late Friday, Ure\u00f1a wrote: \"These emails prove Bill Clinton did nothing and knew nothing.\"",
      "Trish Wexler, a spokesperson for JPMorganChase, said Friday that the federal government \"had damaging information\" about Epstein's crimes and failed to share it with JPMorganChase or other financial institutions.",

Hoffman said in an email to the news outlet that his last interaction with Epstein had been in 2015.",

      "The conclusions from the Trump administration sparked immense backlash against Mr. Trump and Bondi from some of the president's supporters, many of whom were skeptical of the Justice Department's claim that there was nothing further to be released.",
      "Meanwhile, the Oversight Committee has continued to release records as part of its investigation, including court filings, flight records, videos and messages. In September, the panel made public pages from a book compiled by Maxwell for Epstein's 50th birthday in 2003, which includes a letter allegedly signed by Mr. Trump and a drawing that appears to be the outline of a woman's body. The president has denied penning the message.",
      "Documents released by the committee show Mr. Trump and Clinton's names are listed under the \"friends\" subheading in the book's table of contents. Clinton appears to have written a handwritten note that reads, in part, \"It's reassuring isn't it, to have lasted as long, across all the years of learning and knowing \u2026 and also to have your childlike curiosity, the drive to make a difference and the solace of friends.\"",

      "President Trump's administration on Friday appealed a ruling from a federal judge in Oregon that barred it from deploying the National Guard to Portland.",
      "The ruling last week from U.S. District Court Judge Karin Immergut, a Trump appointee, followed a three-day trial in which both sides argued over whether protests at the city's U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement building met the conditions for using the military domestically under federal law. The city and state filed the lawsuit in September to block the deployment.",
      "In a 106-page opinion, Immergut found that even though the president is entitled to \"great deference\" in his decision on whether to call up the Guard, he did not have a legal basis for doing so because he did not establish that there was a rebellion or danger of rebellion, or that he was unable to enforce the law with regular forces.",
      "The administration criticized the decision and said the troops were needed to protect federal personnel and property in a city that Trump has described as \"war ravaged.\"",

      "Immergut issued two temporary restraining orders in early October that had blocked the deployment of the troops leading up to the trial. The first order blocked Trump from deploying 200 members of the Oregon National Guard; the second, issued a day later, blocked him from deploying members of any state's National Guard to Oregon, after he tried to evade the first order by sending California troops instead.",

      "The new exemption covers a range of tropical products that are often imported to the United States, including coffee, tea, bananas, mangoes, avocados, coconuts, pineapples, cocoa and spices such as nutmeg, according to an executive order. It also covers beef, oranges and tomatoes.",
      "The White House said Mr. Trump decided to exempt the products on Friday because he's made \"substantial progress\" in negotiating trade deals with other countries. A day earlier, Mr. Trump announced trade frameworks with four Latin American countries \u2014 Argentina, Guatemala, El Salvador and Ecuador \u2014 that included relief for food that isn't widely produced in the U.S.",
      "The food products will no longer be covered by the \"reciprocal\" tariffs that Mr. Trump has imposed on most U.S. trading partners, which range from 10% to 40% or more. Some types of food could still be impacted by other forms of tariffs.",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters Friday the tariff exemptions should cause prices to go down, and they mostly applied to food that is \"not competitive in this country,\" like bananas.",
      "\"We don't make them in this country, so there's no protection of our industries or our food products,\" he said aboard Air Force One.",
      "The moves come as polls show that voters remain nervous about inflation and wary of Mr. Trump's approach to the issue, which helped propel him back to the White House last year.",
      "Food prices rose 3.1% in the yearlong period ending in September, well below its peak of 11.4% in 2022, according to federal data. But certain types of food have surged: Beef prices were up 12.9% year-over-year in September, banana prices were up 6.9% and roasted coffee 18.9%.",
      "Mr. Trump has insisted\u00a0costs are actually down since he took over from former President Joe Biden, and has long denied that higher tariffs could push up consumer prices \u2014 a persistent fear raised by economists.",
      "But rising beef prices have alarmed Mr. Trump, who accused foreign-owned meat packing companies earlier this month of \"driving up the price of Beef through Illicit Collusion, Price Fixing, and Price Manipulation.\"",
      "Last month, Mr. Trump said he's considering importing more beef from Argentina to help get prices down. It's a delicate issue, though, because boosting beef imports could upset U.S.-based ranchers, who are typically supportive of the president. Trade groups like the National Cattlemen's Beef Association publicly criticized the idea.",
      "Mr. Trump responded on Truth Social that ranchers \"have to get their prices down.\"",
      "\"The Cattle Ranchers, who I love, don't understand that the only reason they are doing so well, for the first time in decades, is because I put Tariffs on cattle coming into the United States,\" he wrote. \"If it weren't for me, they would be doing just as they've done for the past 20 years \u2014 Terrible!\"",

      "Even with the counts removed, 32 remain, including an overarching racketeering charge brought against the remaining 15 defendants.",

      "\"The public has a legitimate interest in the outcome of this case,\" he wrote. \"Accordingly, it is important that someone make an informed and transparent determination about how best to proceed.\"",

This week, the U.S. Department of Defense confirmed the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier USS Gerald Ford and other warships had entered the Southern Command's area of responsibility, which includes the Caribbean. The USS Ford is the largest aircraft carrier in the world, and the U.S. Navy's most advanced.",

      "A photographer captured images on Friday that show a demolition site in place of the White House's East Wing, which was torn down last month and is set to be replaced by a 90,000-square-foot ballroom championed by President Trump.",
      "The photos \u2014 taken by Andrew Leyden at the top of the Washington Monument, which recently reopened after the government shutdown ended \u2014 show the site that once housed the East Wing is now mostly clear of debris, which was hauled away starting last month.",
      "The East Wing was first built in 1902 and renovated in 1942. Its sudden demolition has drawn controversy, with critics arguing it was done without enough public input and questioning the design plans for the $300 million, donor-funded ballroom. Mr. Trump had initially said the ballroom project \"won't interfere with the current building.\"",
      "The Trump administration has defended the move and called the criticism \"manufactured outrage,\" pointing out that other presidents have modified the White House complex and arguing that the ballroom will be a useful addition to a building with few large event spaces.",
      "A White House official said last month\u00a0that the administration will submit plans for the ballroom to the National Capital Planning Commission, a board that oversees federal construction in the D.C. area. But the official noted the commission usually isn't involved in demolitions.",

    "story": [
      "Like many of her Democratic colleagues, GOP Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia is urging Congress to act quickly to address the spiraling cost of health care for millions of Americans who could soon see huge spikes in their insurance premiums.",
      "\"Now that the [Affordable Care Act] tax credits are expiring, which the Democrats did put in place \u2014 and they set the expiration date for this year \u2014 I see a financial crisis for Americans,\" Greene told \"CBS Mornings\" in an exclusive interview Friday. \"And so on this issue, I don't see political party lines.\"",
      "About 22 million lower- and middle-income Americans rely on the tax credits to reduce their health insurance costs when they buy policies through the Affordable Care Act's marketplaces. During the longest government shutdown in history, Democrats pushed Republicans to extend the subsidies as a condition for reopening the government, but the shutdown ultimately ended Wednesday without a deal to extend the tax credits. Democrats were promised, however, that a vote on the tax credits will be held next month.",
      "But House Democrats took notice of Greene's views on health care. House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries, asked by \"CBS Evening News\" co-anchor John Dickerson if he had found any Republican allies during the 43-day impasse, replied,\"Three words \u2014 Marjorie Taylor Greene.\"",
      "\"She's been very clear that this health care crisis is not made up, it's real, Republicans have no health care plan, and that Democrats are correct in fighting to extend the Affordable Care Act tax credits,\" Jeffries continued.",
      "And top Republicans noticed, too. Earlier this week, President Trump said of Greene after she criticized him for focusing on foreign policy, rather than high prices at home, \"I don't know what happened to Marjorie \u2014 nice woman, but I don't know what happened. She's lost her way, I think.\"",
      "\"I haven't lost my way \u2014 I'm for the American people only,\" Greene told \"CBS Mornings.\" \"I am America first and I make no apologies about that to anyone.\" But she added that the rapidly rising health insurance costs had affected her personally.",
      "\"As far as health insurance is concern it hurt my own family. Back in 2010, the Democrats passed Obamacare, and in 2014 when it went into effect my family's health insurance went from $800 to over $2,400 a month, and we've seen the health insurance industry prices just go up and up,\" Greene said.",
      "\"I see simply that the American people have been done wrong, and I want my party to produce a solution and a plan that fixes this mess once and for all,\" Greene said. \"And so that is what I've been urging here in Washington, and I really hope to see Republicans and Democrats both work together to come up with a very good solution with health care for the American people.\"",

Marjorie Taylor Greene said Friday that President Trump's opposition to releasing files from the federal investigation into convicted sex offender\u00a0Jeffrey Epstein is a \"huge miscalculation.\" In an exclusive interview on \"CBS Mornings,\" Greene said she doesn't believe the president has anything to hide, noting that some of Epstein's victims have said Mr. Trump \"has done nothing wrong.\"",
      "Greene, of Georgia, was among the four House Republicans who joined all Democrats in signing on to a discharge petition that forces a vote in the House on a measure compelling the Justice Department to release materials related to its probe into Epstein. The vote is expected next week.",
      "Mr. Trump has slammed the focus on Epstein as a \"hoax\" pushed by Democrats to deflect the blame for the government shutdown, which was the longest in U.S. history and ended Wednesday.",
      "\"Some Weak Republicans have fallen into their clutches because they are soft and foolish,\" he wrote on Truth Social on Friday. \"Epstein was a Democrat, and he is the Democrat's problem, not the Republican's problem! Ask Bill Clinton, Reid Hoffman, and Larry Sommers about Epstein, they know all about him, don't waste your time with Trump. I have a Country to run!\"",
      "A few hours later, he posted again, calling for the Justice Department and FBI to investigate Epstein's ties to prominent Democrats and financial institutions.",
      "But Greene told \"CBS Mornings\" she doesn't understand Mr. Trump's opposition to releasing the material related to Epstein.",
      "\"I think it's a huge miscalculation, and I truly just stand with the women, and I think they deserve to be the ones that we're fighting for,\" she said.",
      "Greene said she has spoken with many of Epstein's victims, and the president has not been accused of any wrongdoing.",
      "\"I believe the women and the women have said over and over again that Donald Trump did nothing wrong,\" she said. \"Even Virginia Giuffre said it under oath and she wrote it in her book. And so if we listen to the women, they say Donald Trump has done nothing wrong.\"",
      "Giuffre, the most high-profile of Epstein's accusers, died by suicide in April. She said she was approached by Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell and hired to give Epstein massages in 2000, just before she turned 17. At the time, Giuffre was\u00a0working at the spa at Mar-a-Lago, Mr. Trump's South Florida club. Giuffre wrote in her memoir that she met Mr. Trump once at Mar-a-Lago, and said he \"couldn't have been friendlier.\"",
      "Separate from the effort to push the Justice Department to release its files on Epstein, the GOP-led House Oversight and Reform Committee has been investigating the federal government's handling of the investigation into Epstein and\u00a0Maxwell.",
      "This week the panel released more than 20,000 pages of records it received from Epstein's estate, which include text and email exchanges with the disgraced financier that reference Mr. Trump.",
      "In one email from Epstein to author Michael Wolff in January 2019, Epstein wrote, \"Of course he knew about the girls as he asked ghislaine to stop,\" referencing Mr. Trump.",
      "In another email from Epstein to Maxwell in April 2011, he wrote, \"I want you to realize that that dog that hasn't barked is trump.. virginia spent hours at my house with him ,, he has never once been mentioned.\"",
      "The emails and text messages released by the Oversight panel, on which Greene sits, provide a look into Epstein's contacts with high-profile people. Among them are Steve Bannon, a former adviser to Mr. Trump; Kathryn Ruemmler, a top executive at Goldman Sachs who served as White House counsel to former President Barack Obama; and an array of figures in business, entertainment and academia.",
      "Green said the documents offer the public a \"very interesting view into a world that most of us have never seen.\"",
      "\"It's kind of like a web of global affairs, business connections, very high and powerful people, foreign leaders,\" she said. \"And it's just an interesting world. And even the Intel community.\"",
      "Mr. Trump and Epstein ran in the same social circles in New York and Florida from the late 1980s to the early 2000s. But the president said they had a falling out around 2004.",
      "State and federal authorities investigated Epstein between 2005 and 2006. In late 2007, federal prosecutors reached a deal with Epstein that allowed him to avoid federal charges in exchange for pleading guilty to two state prostitution charges and serving an 18-month prison sentence. He ended up serving less than 13 months and was released in 2009.",
      "Epstein was later indicted by a federal grand jury in New York in 2019 on sex trafficking charges. He died by suicide in a Manhattan correctional facility while awaiting trial.",

    "story": [
      "Not long ago in Seattle, an astronomical event of sorts happened: Two superstars collided. William Shatner, of \"Star Trek\" fame, and Neil deGrasse Tyson, America's favorite astrophysicist, took to the stage to explore the nature of exploration. Think of it as sort of Martin & Lewis, but with more quantum mechanics.",
      "\"It's a bromance,\" said Tyson. \"I think what Bill Shatner and I have together should be the textbook definition of the bromance.\"",
      "\"If we have a bromance,\" said Shatner, \"I'd be very privileged.\"",
      "The two grew close last year on an upscale cruise to Antarctica, where they ended up being the after-dinner entertainment. \"The organizer said, 'Why don't we put the two of you on this mini-stage that they have on the ship, and we just chew the fat?'\" said Tyson. \"And then the organizer said, 'Why don't you guys take this on the road?'\"",
      "Their first port of call? Seattle, where they debuted a wide-ranging, sometimes meandering, but always intriguing stage show they're calling \"The Universe Is Absurd!\"",
      "When Shatner asked his partner for a sound bite, deGrasse Tyson solicited a suggestion from the audience: \"Pick anything out of the universe. Go. Anything. Doesn't matter.\"",
      "\"Pluto!\" yelled one enthusiastic audience member.",
      "DeGrasse Tyson obliged: \"More than half of Pluto is made of ice, so that, if it were where Earth is right now, heat from the Sun would evaporate that ice and it would grow a tail. And that is no kind of behavior for a planet!\" Mic drop. \"That's a sound bite!\"",
      "For deGrasse Tyson, director of New York City's Hayden Planetarium, and an authority on just about everything we know about the universe, it's a chance to get inside the insatiably curious mind of the 94-year-old Shatner. \"What kind of magic potion is he drinking?\" deGrasse Tyson laughed. \"By the way, you can do the math, he's been alive for three billion seconds, okay? I did the math, you don't have to. So when Bill Shatner speaks, it's coming from a place way deeper than any of the rest of us can possibly match.\"",
      "And for Shatner, who never formally studied astrophysics, it's a chance to make up for what he sees as lost time. \"I feel bad about it, because that knowledge of what constitutes the construction of nature, we know so little, but the little we know is so awesome, it's so spellbinding,\" he said. \"The fact that I wasn't conscious of how spellbinding it is as a youth, I could have been much more educated about it.\"",
      "Four years ago, Shatner became the oldest person ever to go into space, and he's been globetrotting ever since.",
      "Shatner asked deGrasse Tyson, \"Do you still scratch your head in awe?\"",
      "\"Every night I look up,\" he replied.",
      "So, is this the dynamic between the two \u2013 Shatner with questions, deGrasse Tyson with answers? \"Unfortunately, that's the way it is,\" Shatner replied.",
      "\"No, but he's got wisdom and life experience that I value, and I respect,\" deGrasse Tyson added. \"So, I'm here to grab some of that.\"",
      "As for Shatner's take on deGrasse Tyson, \"He has access, both because of his mentality, and the books and the studies, so he's into modern-day mysticism, which is the study of the stars and how it works and what goes on.\"",
      "\"You call that modern-day mysticism?\" deGrasse Tyson asked.",
      "\"Because you don't know for sure that what you're saying is absolutely truth until more experimentation.\"",
      "\"That's the frontier. We're scratching our heads.\"",
      "\"Exactly,\" said Shatner. \"So, he is an explorer. He is an explorer. He is on that verge. He teaches that. And it is mystical in every sense of the word.\"",
      "I asked, \"This is where I think you are politely and respectfully in disagreement, because Dr. deGrasse Tyson will say something like, 'We know what the speed of light is and what the fastest things can move is.' And you say, 'Well, we'll see about that!'\"",
      "\"Yeah, we've had that argument,\" said Shatner.",
      "DeGrasse Tyson seems just fine not knowing everything \u2013 for example, what was going on before the Big Bang, and the profound idea of somethingness coming from nothingness. \"We don't know. Next question!\" he said. \"No, as a scientist, you need to be comfortable in the presence of a question that does not yet have an answer.\"",
      "Of course, the ultimate question, the one we really don't know definitively, is where we go when we die, something that Shatner, as he loses friends and colleagues, finds himself considering more often. \"You know, I vary between the fear of death, my fear,\" he said. But, \"I have so much love around me. I have a wife, and children, and grandchildren. I even have two great-grandchildren. And I have two great dogs. I've had dogs all my life, all my adult life. And so, all my life is fertile, is vibrant. And I don't want to leave it. And that's the sadness. I don't want to go.\"",
      "\"Are you curious, though, about what you will find out?\" I asked.",
      "\"Not enough to die!\" he laughed.",
      "\"Even your curiosity has a limit?\"",
      "\"Right. It stops right there!\"",
      "So, William Shatner's famous curiosity bumps up against the edge of his universe. And as the show wrapped up in Seattle, Shatner closed things out with one of his unique spoken-word songs, accompanied by trumpeter Keyon Harrold.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/breast-cancer-birth-control-study-science/",
    "published": "Sat, 15 Nov 2025 07:00:01 -0500",
    "summary": "The study sought to answer questions about how breast cancer risk differs by type of hormonal contraceptive. Doctors say the results won't change how they counsel patients.",
    "story": [
      "As misinformation about women's health spreads faster than ever, doctors say new research on the risks of hormonal birth control underscores the challenge of communicating nuance in the social media age.",
      "The massive study, which was conducted in Sweden and tracked more than two million teenage girls and women under age 50 for more than a decade, found that hormonal contraception remains safe overall, but also found small differences in breast cancer risk based on the hormones used in the formulation. In addition, the researchers observed a small, short-term rise in breast cancer diagnoses among current or recent users. Those findings are consistent with prior large studies, including a 2017 Danish registry analysis and a 2023 meta-analysis.",
      "It was published online Oct. 30 in JAMA Oncology.",
      "Doctors say these study results won't change how they advise patients and that women should not stop using their birth control.",
      "Still, TikTok is flooded with factually incomplete warnings that contraceptives cause cancer and are as dangerous as smoking. Reproductive health advocates warn that studies like this can easily be taken out of context online and be reduced to a single alarming number.",
      "Case in point: The study reported that women who had used hormonal birth control had about a 24% higher rate of breast cancer than women who hadn't. But because breast cancer is still uncommon in younger women, that works out to an increase from roughly 54 to 67 breast cancer cases per 100,000 women per year \u2014 about 13 extra cases per 100,000 women, or about one extra case per 7,800 users of hormonal contraceptives per year.",
      "Co-authors \u00c5sa Johansson and Dr. Fatemeh Hadizadeh, epidemiologists at Uppsala University, said the rise is modest and short-term, with risk highest during current use and fading within five to 10 years after stopping.",
      "Rachel Fey \u2014 interim co-CEO of Power to Decide, a group whose mission is to provide accurate information on sexual health and contraceptive methods \u2014 said that kind of nuance is exactly what tends to disappear on social media. \"I get really angry at this because it's designed to scare people like me away from birth control, which has made my life so much better in so many ways,\" she said. \"It's really frustrating \u2026 especially when it's given without context. And then in this era of social media, it can just take off without anybody who knows what they're talking about providing that context.\"",
      "The researchers also found the risk was slightly higher with certain progestins such as desogestrel \u2014 found in combined oral contraceptives like Cyred EQ, Reclipsen, Azurette, and Pimtrea \u2014 but did not increase with others, such as medroxyprogesterone acetate injections, sold under the brand name Depo\u2011Provera.",
      "How to interpret the findings",
      "Some experts say the results should be viewed with care because the study counted both invasive breast cancers and early, noninvasive lesions known as in situ tumors, growths that may never become life-threatening. Including these precancerous cases could make the overall risk of clinically significant disease appear higher than it is.",
      "\"A substantial proportion of the 'cases' would never have progressed to invasive breast cancer,\" said Lina S. M\u00f8rch, a senior researcher and team leader at the Danish Cancer Institute. M\u00f8rch was not associated with the Swedish study. She added that experts should wait for more data separating early-stage and advanced cancers before making new rules or warnings about specific hormones.",
      "The doctor-patient conversation",
      "Even as scientists debate how to interpret the finer points of the data, physicians emphasize that for most patients, the study reinforces what they already discuss in the exam room: that hormonal birth control is broadly safe, and decisions should be tailored to each woman's needs and values.",
      "Dr. Katharine White, chief of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Boston Medical Center, said this study won't change how she talks to her patients.",
      "\"When counseling patients about their contraceptive options, I focus on their past experiences with birth control, their medical history, and what's important to them about their birth control method and pregnancy planning (if applicable),\" White wrote in an email. \"Side effects and risks of methods are already a key part of my counseling about both hormonal and non-hormonal methods.\"",
      "Other doctors noted there are other contraceptive options.",
      "Dr. Eleanor Bimla Schwarz, chief of General Internal Medicine at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital, said, \"For those who prefer hormone-free contraception, the copper IUD offers safe, convenient, highly effective contraception for over a decade after placement, and is rapidly reversible when pregnancy is desired,\" referring to a type of long-acting intrauterine device.",
      "Dr. Mary Rosser, director of Integrated Women's Health at Columbia University Irving Medical Center, said this was a large, high-quality study that looked at many types of hormones over many years. But she added that doctors shouldn't change their advice yet.",
      "Johansson and Hadizadeh stressed that the results should guide shared decision-making, not cause alarm. \"It may be reasonable to consider formulations associated with lower observed risk in our data,\" they said. They noted that products containing medroxyprogesterone acetate, drospirenone, or levonorgestrel were linked to lower risk, while long-term use of desogestrel-only contraceptives might be best avoided when other options fit.",
      "Keeping the risk in perspective",
      "Hormonal birth control provides many health benefits beyond pregnancy prevention. It can lighten heavy periods, ease pain from endometriosis, and lower the risk of ovarian and uterine cancers for years after stopping. M\u00f8rch noted that even small risks are worth discussing but said decisions should be guided by women's \"values and preferences.\"",
      "White said it's important to see the big picture. \"The risk of an unintended pregnancy is 85% for people who do not use contraception\u2014so any risks of birth control need to be weighed against the risk of an unexpected pregnancy,\" she wrote.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/largest-spider-web-discovered-cave-greece-albania-border/",
    "published": "Fri, 14 Nov 2025 14:12:09 -0500",
    "summary": "The behavior, which had never been observed before, stunned scientists as, typically, the larger house spider would prey on its smaller neighbor.",
    "story": [
      "What is thought to be the world's largest-known spider's web, housing tens of thousands of arachnids, has been discovered in a cave on the Albanian-Greek border.",
      "After researchers published their findings of two different spider species peacefully cohabiting in a giant colony nestled in a pitch-black, sulfur-rich cave, evolutionary biologist Lena Grinsted likened the \"extremely rare\" occurrence to humans living in an apartment block.",
      "\"When I saw this study, I was very excited because \u2026 group living is really rare in spiders,\" Grinsted, a senior lecturer at the U.K.'s University of Portsmouth, told The Associated Press. \"The fact that there was this massive colony of spiders living in a place that nobody had really noticed before \u2014 I find extremely exciting.\"",
      "The results of the study, published last month in the journal Subterranean Biology, spread rapidly online due to the striking images of the giant 1,140-square-foot spider's web, a carpet-thick sprawl stretching along a narrow passage wall inside Sulfur Cave, which extends into Albania from its entrance in Greece.",
      "This arachnophobe's worst nightmare was quickly labelled the \"world's largest spiderweb.\"",
      "But the most surprising thing about the spider colony \u2014 which boasts an estimated 110,000 spiders \u2014 had less to do with its size and more to do with what scientists found inside the huge mass of funnel-shaped webs.",
      "Two different spider species \u2014 about 69,000 Tegenaria domestica, or common house spider, and 42,000 Prinerigone vagans \u2014 were living side by side and thriving. The behavior, which had never been observed before, stunned scientists as, typically, the larger house spider would prey on its smaller neighbor.",
      "\"So often if you have spiders in close vicinity, they will fight and end up eating each other,\" said Grinsted, who was not part of the cave study but has extensively researched spiders. \"We can sometimes see that if there's an abundance of food that they sort of become a bit less aggressive.\"",
      "In addition to spiders, the terrestrial fauna in the cave include centipedes, terrestrial isopods, scorpions and beetles, the researchers said.",
      "\"In the stream passage located close to the cave entrance, a dense swarm of adult chironomid flies fills the air in the immediate vicinity of the sulfidic stream, and a large portion of the cave wall is covered by a massive colonial spider web,\" the study's authors write.",
      "Abundant food source",
      "Scientists are keen to understand how and why the two species came to coexist peacefully in a \"permanently dark zone\" about 160 feet from the entrance of the cave, carved out by the waters of the Sarandaporo River to form the Vromoner Canyon. (The study's authors note that Vromoner means \"smelly water\" in Greek.)",
      "Part of the answer, the research suggests, may lie in the combination of the estimated 2.4 million midge flies that buzz around the spider colony \u2014 an \"unusually dense swarm\" that provides a constant food source in an otherwise predator-scarce environment. The scientists also speculate that the friendly living arrangement could be a result of darkness impairing the spiders' vision.",
      "However, Grinsted says it is more likely that the larger spiders evolved or simply grew accustomed to responding to vibratory cues when the small flies land on their silken web \u2014 and maybe don't attack otherwise.",
      "\"Spiders, in general, are not particularly good at seeing stuff ... and that includes these two species,\" she said. She added that the two species might cooperate \"to some extent in building the web \u2026 but I think it's highly unlikely that they cooperate in anything else like prey capture, in brood care, or looking after each other's babies.\"",
      "Grinsted draws parallels between the cohabiting spiders and how humans tend to coexist in apartment blocks.",
      "\"You're very happy to share the stairs, the lift,\" she said. \"But if anybody comes into your living room and you haven't invited them, you'll be aggressive towards them.\"",
      "She added that while many spiders are \"typically solitary, very aggressive\" toward other critters, the cohabitation of two species is \"relatively common\" once spiders have evolved the ability to live in groups.",
      "\"But again, because these two species have never been found to live together and never been found to live in groups, it makes it particularly exciting,\" she said.",
      "\"The web is dense \u2014 like a blanket\"",
      "Blerina Vrenozi, a biologist and zoologist at the University of Tirana, in Albania, who co-authored the research paper, told the AP that the expeditions this year helped understand \"how this mystery existed in there.\"",
      "\"The DNA is interesting because they revealed that the species which live inside the cave is different from the one which lives outside the cave,\" she said. \"So it's the same species, but different DNA.\"",
      "The cave colony's giant web was first observed in 2021 by a team of Czech speleologists led by Marek Audy. A year later, the Czech team expanded to include scientists from multiple universities, which led to the recently published scientific paper.",
      "\"The web is dense; it's more like a blanket, and when there's danger, the female crawls back and hides, and no creature of a higher order can dig her out of there,\" Audy said. \"Spiders in the cave lay about a third of the eggs compared to spiders that live outdoors. Because it's certain that they will raise their offspring there \u2026 so they can afford to lay fewer eggs.\"",
      "Audy added that the cave, which is also home to large bat colonies, also thrive on the abundance of midges inside the humid, dark space. \"They are constantly having a party there, both the spiders and the bats,\" he said.",
      "Seemingly ideal environment",
      "The study noted that the methodology used might \"slightly overestimate\" the total population count of spiders in the colony, as some funnel webs may be abandoned or unoccupied. However, other experts agree that the team's exciting new research could offer broader evolutionary clues and deserves deeper study.",
      "Sara Goodacre, professor of evolutionary biology and genetics at the School of Life Sciences, at the U.K.'s University of Nottingham, says these kinds of research projects help pave the way for more studies that could prove \"fundamental to our understanding of what forces shape the world around us \u2014 spidery or not.\"",
      "\"Natural selection will favor the 'best' strategies \u2026 the 'winning strategy,' whatever this is,\" she said. \"My guess is that the benefits of being part of this community far outweigh the costs.\"",
      "She added that if the dynamics in the seemingly ideal environment of abundant food and relative safety were to change, \"then 'freeloading' will emerge and it will all break down.\"",
      "The politics of coexistence will hopefully not prove trickier above ground. Audy said that Albania has already asked which side the newly famous spiders lie.",
      "\"From a conservation point of view, we did something interesting there and marked out a border,\" he said. \"I just looked into it \u2014 and the spider web is on the Greek side.\"",
      "The discovery of the massive web comes just months after Australian scientists discovered a new species of the deadly funnel-web spider that is bigger and more venomous than its relatives, nicknaming it \"Big Boy.\"",

    "story": [
      "Blue Origin launched its second heavy-lift New Glenn rocket Thursday, putting two small NASA satellites onto a long, looping course to Mars to learn more about how the sun has slowly blown away the red planet's once-thick atmosphere.",
      "The centerpiece of Amazon and Blue Origin founder Jeff Bezos' space ambitions, the towering 321-foot-tall New Glenn rocket's seven methane-burning main engines ignited at 3:55 p.m. ET, majestically pushing the booster skyward atop 3.8 million pounds of thrust.",
      "The launch came three days late due to stormy weather on Earth and in space, where a powerful solar storm buffeted Earth's atmosphere with a torrent of high-energy radiation that could have caused electrical problems with the rocket or its payloads.",
      "The storm had abated by launch time Wednesday, and Blue Origin employees, looking on from viewing sites several miles from the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station launch pad, cheered and applauded as the booster climbed skyward, followed moments later by the booming roar of its engines sweeping across the Space Coast.",
      "The New Glenn's maiden flight last January successfully boosted a  Blue Origin payload into orbit, but the reusable first stage failed in  its attempt to reach an offshore landing ship, named after Bezos'  mother, Jacklyn.",
      "The 188-foot-tall first stage launched Wednesday,  nicknamed \"Never Tell Me The Odds,\" featured a variety of upgrades to  improve performance. This time around, the big rocket flew itself to an  on-target touchdown, prompting more cheers and applause from Blue Origin  workers.",
      "Much like returning SpaceX Falcon 9 rockets, the larger New Glenn booster will be hauled back to Port Canaveral and, depending on its condition, be refurbished and readied for use on an upcoming New Glenn flight.",
      "The second stage, meanwhile, pressed ahead, carrying out two firings of its twin engines to reach the planned Earth-escape trajectory. Thirty-three minutes after liftoff, the ESCAPADE satellites were released to fly on their own.",
      "The NASA-sponsored payload, managed by the University of California, Berkeley Space Sciences Laboratory, is made up of two small, low-budget satellites known as Blue and Gold that make up the heart of the ESCAPADE mission. The acronym stands for Escape, Plasma Acceleration and Dynamics Explorers.",
      "The probes were built for UC Berkeley by Rocketlab under a NASA program intended to develop lower-cost, fast-track planetary missions.",
      "ESCAPADE cost $107.4 million, a bargain compared to the cost of more traditional, more sophisticated planetary spacecraft that can cost hundreds of millions to well over a billion dollars each.",
      "The ESCAPADE probes were originally expected to hitch a ride to Mars a few years ago with NASA's Psyche asteroid probe. But for a variety of reasons, the Mars satellites mission ultimately ended up on New Glenn's second flight.",
      "Mars launch windows typically open every two years when Earth and the red planet reach favorable positions in their orbits to permit direct flights using current rockets. The next such window opens in 2026.",
      "To make Wednesday's New Glenn launch work in 2025, mission planners with Advanced Space LLC came up with an innovative flight plan, one that will take Blue and Gold longer to reach Mars but will enable more flexible trajectories for future missions.",
      "The probes were deployed on a trajectory that will carry them a million miles out, well past the moon's orbit, where they will loiter for the next 11 months before heading back toward Earth.",
      "Passing within 600 miles of Earth in November 2027, the ESCAPADE probes will make velocity-boosting gravity assist flybys, augmented by onboard propulsion, to finally head for Mars.",
      "In all, the twin spacecraft will spend a full year in that initial kidney bean-shaped orbit out past the moon and back, and another 10 months in transit to Mars. The probes won't reach the red planet until September 2027.",
      "\"We are using a very flexible ... approach where we go into a loiter orbit around Earth in order to sort of wait until Earth and Mars are lined up correctly in November of next year to go to Mars,\" said Robert Lillis, the principal investigator.",
      "\"This is an exciting, flexible way to get to Mars because in the future ... we could potentially queue up spacecraft using the approach that ESCAPADE is pioneering\" without having to wait for a planetary launch window to open, Lillis said.",
      "While the ESCAPADE mission is modest compared to Mars rovers and more sophisticated orbiters, the probes are designed to answer key questions about the evolution of the Martian atmosphere.",
      "Mars once had a global magnetic field like Earth, but its molten core, which powered that field, mostly froze in place long ago, leaving only patchy, isolated remnants of that once-protective field in magnetized deposits.",
      "Without a protective global field like Earth's, the Martian atmosphere faces a constant barrage of high-speed electrons and protons blown away from the sun and from dense clouds of charged particles erupting from powerful solar storms.",
      "Working in tandem, first in the same orbit at different distances from each other and then from different altitudes, Blue and Gold will measure how the solar wind and energetic electrons and protons from solar storms interact with the Martian atmosphere.",
      "Data from earlier Mars satellites showed the planet's atmosphere is constantly being stripped by those interactions, but exactly how that happens over time is not fully understood.",
      "\"We really, really want to understand the interaction of the solar wind with Mars better than we do now,\" Lillis said. \"We know that atmospheric escape from Mars is a major driver for the evolution of the Martian climate. We know that Mars at least was episodically warm and wet for a couple billion years, but hasn't been so for about 2 billion years or so. And we think atmospheric escape is a major reason for that.\"",
      "Blue and Gold will provide what amounts to a stereo view of those processes.",
      "\"If you only have one spacecraft, you can either measure what the sun is throwing at Mars, the so-called space weather environment upstream of Mars, or you can measure the conditions close to Mars in its upper atmosphere, where the atmosphere is escaping,\" Lillis said.",
      "\"You can't be in two places at once. But we can, because we have two spacecraft to do this. So we can really get that cause-and-effect at the same time. We've never had that before, and that's really exciting,\" Lillis said.",

    "story": [
      "A severe geomagnetic storm is forecast to hit Earth's magnetic field on Wednesday, which could cause widespread disruption to infrastructure technology and make northern lights visible for much of the northern half of the U.S.",
      "The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration on Tuesday issued a G4, or severe, geomagnetic storm watch in response to recent coronal mass ejections, or CMEs, from the sun. CMEs are huge bubbles of coronal plasma that the sun occasionally ejects, NASA says. The highest geomagnetic storm level is G5, which is considered extreme.",
      "The latest CME was the \"most energetic and fastest of the CMEs\" that erupted in the past few days, NOAA said. It was also associated with one of the strongest solar flares of the current solar cycle. The flare\u00a0peaked around 5 a.m. ET Tuesday and was classified as an R3 or \"strong\" flare, meaning it has the potential to cause major disruptions to high-frequency radio on the sunlit side of Earth and cause low-frequency navigation signal issues.",
      "The severe storm is expected to impact Earth around midday Wednesday, the Space Weather Prediction Center said, although it noted the forecast is \"tough\" and it only had a \"moderate level of certainty\" on the timing.",
      "Another G3, or strong, geomagnetic storm was expected to affect Earth on Thursday, NOAA said.",
      "Northern lights forecast",
      "While the potential geomagnetic storms can cause disruptions to critical communication infrastructure, they could also make the aurora visible as far south as Alabama and in Northern California beginning Tuesday night, NOAA said.",
      "The University of Alaska and Space Weather Prediction Center forecasts say the best chance of seeing the northern lights starts as early as 10 p.m. ET Tuesday and will last until around 1 a.m. Wednesday.",
      "During that time, \"highly active auroral displays\" might be visible in places like Portland, Oregon; Cheyenne, Wyoming, and New York City, the University of Alaska said. The northern lights might also be visible close to the horizon as far south as Oklahoma City and Raleigh, North Carolina, the university said.",
      "In May 2024, a\u00a0powerful coronal mass ejection\u00a0brought the strongest\u00a0geomagnetic storm\u00a0in more than 20 years to Earth. During the CME, multiple X-class solar flares\u00a0were recorded. That storm caused some radio blackouts.",

    "published": "Fri, 14 Nov 2025 16:31:18 -0500",
    "summary": "The stock market has stumbled on concerns that the surge in artificial intelligence stocks could echo the dot-com bubble.",
    "story": [
      "Artificial intelligence has fired the stock market to record highs this year, with companies eager to tout their AI prowess and investor darlings like AI chipmaker Nvidia soaring\u00a0on expectations of runaway growth.",
      "But a tinge of fear is starting to shadow that exuberance as investors worry the AI boom could go bust.",
      "The startling run-up in AI-related stocks is prompting comparisons to the dot-com era of the late 1990s, when many internet companies saw their stock prices skyrocket despite suffering vast financial losses. When that bubble burst in the early 2000s, it took down former high-fliers like Pets.com, torched investor portfolios and triggered a recession.",
      "Bubbles occur when stocks surge on inflated growth expectations that ultimately prove to be disconnected from a company's underlying fundamentals, a painful reality check that typically ends with overhyped shares falling back to Earth.",
      "Thursday's stock market tumble \u2014 when high-flying AI stocks such as Nvidia and CoreWeave led the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite to see its biggest drop in months \u2014 fueled further anxiety this week about another bubble.",
      "Beyond the stock market, economists are also questioning whether AI will turn out to be as transformative for businesses as proponents of the technology insist. Advocates say AI will spur a productivity boom, leading to stronger corporate growth and profitability.",
      "\"The stock market is a giant bet on AI right now. It's really 10 companies that are driving all of it,\" Rebecca Homkes, an economist and lecturer at the London Business School, told CBS News.",
      "In other words, this year's 15% gain in the S&P 500 \u00a0is largely due to a handful of tech giants that are heavily investing in AI. The combined market capitalization of the so-called \"Magnificent 7\" \u2014 Google-owner Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla \u2014 today represents a record 37% of the S&P 500's total value, according to Morningstar.",
      "Irrational exuberance?",
      "That may give pause to the millions of Americans who are saving for retirement in 401(k) and other plans. If the market's gains lean so heavily on a few dominant companies, as during the dot-com bubble, the fallout could be severe if investors suddenly sour on AI.",
      "\"No one wants to be caught dancing after the music has stopped,\" Aaron Schaechterle, portfolio manager at Janus Henderson, said in an email.",
      "Still, today's stock valuations aren't nearly as stretched as they were in the late 1990s, Goldman Sachs analysts note. The investment bank's analysis of the Magnificent 7's median price-to-earnings ratio \u2014 a measure of a company's share price compared to its profits \u2014 found it is \"roughly half\" that of the largest seven companies in the late 1990s.",
      "\"So it is true that valuations are high but, in our view, generally not at levels that are as high as are typically seen at the height of a financial bubble,\" they noted.",
      "Why this time may be different",
      "The question of whether AI is fueling a bubble akin to the late 1990s was even posed to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell at the central bank's Oct. 29 meeting.",
      "\"This is different in the sense that these companies \u2014 the companies that are so highly valued \u2014 actually have earnings and stuff like that,\" Powell said. \"So you go back to the '90s and the dot-com [period]... these were ideas rather than companies.\"",
      "Nvidia, for example, the AI boom's poster child, has seen its revenue more than double to $130 billion in its last fiscal year, while its profit surged 145%.",
      "Although the stock market may not be in imminent danger of a bubble-bursting crash, economists are increasingly questioning whether AI companies can live up to the hype, as well as justify the trillions in capital spending on the data centers and other infrastructure required to power the AI revolution.",
      "For these bets to pay off, AI will need to transform U.S. businesses by spurring a productivity boom that translates into stronger corporate growth and profitability, experts say.",
      "\"We want to understand whether this is storytelling or actual tangible gains,\" Homkes of the London Business School told CBS News.",
      "For tech evangelists like Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives, the AI boom will lead to a \"4th industrial revolution\" that could supercharge economic growth. \"This is an AI Arms Race, and what is fueling this next chapter of growth is Big Tech spending and that is NOT slowing down into 2026,\" he wrote this week in a research note.",
      "\"The doubters need to come on board and recognize this is a transformational technology,\" Homkes agreed, while noting that such a shift is likely to take much longer than some AI boosters currently envision.",

      "Anthropic said the cybercriminals used its popular chatbot, Claude, to target roughly 30 technology companies, financial institutions, chemical manufacturers and government agencies. The hackers used the AI platform to gather usernames and passwords from the companies' databases that they then exploited to steal private data, Anthropic said, while noting that only a \"small number\" of these attacks succeeded.",

      "The San Francisco-based company shared its findings with CBS News but did not offer additional comment. The news was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.",
      "Anthropic said it began detecting suspicious activity in mid-September. A subsequent investigation by the company revealed that the activity stemmed from an espionage campaign that Anthropic said was likely carried out by a state-sponsored group based in China.",
      "According to the investigation, hackers allegedly duped Claude into thinking it was an employee of a legitimate cybersecurity firm and that it was being used for defensive testing. Anthropic also said the cybercriminals sought to hide their tracks by breaking down the attack into small tasks.",
      "Unlike conventional cyberattacks, the operation required minimal human intervention, according to the company. \"The AI made thousands of requests per second, an attack speed that would have been, for human hackers, simply impossible to match,\" Anthropic said.",
      "Anthropic said it expects AI cyberattacks to grow in scale and sophistication as so-called agents become more widely used for a range of services. AI agents are cheaper than professional hackers and can operate quickly at a larger scale, making them particularly attractive to cybercriminals, MIT Technology Review\u00a0has pointed out.",

    "summary": "Google said the fake messages are part of a massive criminal network called \"Lighthouse\" that has stolen information through phishing and smishing scams.",
    "story": [
      "Google is filing a federal lawsuit against a network of foreign cybercriminals based in China that is accused of launching massive text-message phishing attacks, the tech giant told CBS News in an exclusive interview.",
      "Google said the messages are part of a criminal network called \"Lighthouse.\" The texts look legitimate, often warning recipients of a \"stuck package\" or an \"unpaid toll,\" but they're actually phishing or what's called smishing \u2014 a type of phishing scam that uses text messages to try to trick recipients into revealing personal and sensitive information, such as passwords and credit card numbers, which are then stolen.",
      "\"These scammers ended up compromising anywhere from 15 [million] to 100 million potential credit cards within the U.S. and impacted, at our current estimates, over a million victims,\" Google's general counsel,   Halimah DeLaine Prado, told CBS News.",
      "DeLaine Prado said Google has filed what it calls a first-of-its-kind lawsuit under the RICO Act, which is typically used to take down organized crime rings.",
      "The case targets unknown operators \u2014 listed as John Does 1 through 25 \u2014 who allegedly built a \"phishing-as-a-service\" platform to power mass text attacks.",
      "DeLaine Prado said the lawsuit is not meant specifically to help victims recover any losses, but rather to serve as a \"deterrent for future criminals to create similar enterprises.\"",
      "Google said it found more than 100 fake sites using its logo to trick people into handing over passwords or credit card numbers. According to its complaint, it estimates the group has stolen sensitive information linked to tens of millions of credit cards in the U.S. alone.",
      "Kevin Gosschalk, the CEO of cybersecurity firm Arkose Labs, said that while recovering lost money is a challenge, lawsuits like Google's could help disrupt scammers' operations.",
      "\"It has an impact on the ecosystem,\" Gosschalk told CBS News. He said that if there are three major players and you go after the big one and take it down, \"then the other two start second-guessing, 'Hey, should we be in this business, or should we get out of this business?'\"",
      "Google's move appears aimed as much at setting a legal precedent as at seeking punishment \u2014 testing whether a 1970s racketeering law can be applied to a 21st-century digital crime.",
      "Gosschalk said it will be very hard for Google to go after cybercriminals overseas since a lot of them also operate in countries like Cambodia, where there are limited extradition laws.",
      "\"But it does mean the individuals behind those things will not be able to travel to the U.S. in the future, so it does add extra risk,\" Gosschalk said.",
      "Users can avoid text scams by not clicking links or replying to unknown messages. On an iPhone, users can turn on \"Filter Unknown Senders\" and \"Filter Junk.\" On Android, enable Spam Protection and forward scam texts to 7726 (SPAM).",
      "Note that those filters can also catch legitimate messages from numbers that are not in the phone's contact list, so be sure to check the unknown senders or spam folder once in a while.",

    "summary": "Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, a physician whose medical practice focused on hepatitis B, said he's \"very concerned\" about a potential change to the hepatitis B vaccine schedule for infants.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican who chairs the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, said he's \"very concerned\" about a potential change to the hepatitis B vaccine schedule for infants, with a key advisory panel set to meet in the coming weeks.",
      "\"I'm a doctor. I have seen people die from vaccine-preventable disease,\" Cassidy told \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\" \"I want to make America healthy, and you don't start by stopping recommendations that have made us substantially healthier.\"",
      "Cassidy, a physician whose medical practice focused on hepatitis B, noted that because of the recommended hepatitis B vaccine dose at birth, \"we have decreased incidence of chronic hepatitis B by 20,000 people over the last two decades.\"",
      "\"The vaccine is safe. It has been established,\" Cassidy said. \"This is policy by people who don't understand the epidemiology of hepatitis B, or who have grown comfortable with the fact that we've been so successful with our recommendation that now the incidence of hepatitis B is so low, they feel like we can rest on our laurels.\"",
      "The Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices, a panel of experts who advise and vote on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's vaccine recommendations, is set to meet next month. The draft agenda for the Dec. 4-5 meeting includes discussions of the hepatitis B vaccine, and the meeting could entail votes on recommendations. In September, the panel voted to table a vote on whether to change the pediatric vaccine schedule for hepatitis B to a later date.",
      "Cassidy has previously weighed in on the panel. In June, the Louisiana Republican called for a postponement of the vaccine meeting after Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said he was \"retiring\" all 17 members of the panel, before replacing the committee members with his own picks. And in August, Cassidy likewise called for the panel to postpone its September vaccine advisory committee meeting amid a slew of departures from the CDC.",
      "The moves represented breaks with Kennedy, who was confirmed as the nation's top health official only after winning support from Cassidy.",
      "In February, Cassidy delivered the key vote to advance the nomination out of committee after he had expressed misgivings over Kennedy's nomination because of the doubts he had raised about vaccines. But Cassidy ultimately supported Kennedy's nomination, citing \"serious commitments\" he said he'd received from the administration.",
      "Asked by Brennan whether he regrets his vote to confirm Kennedy, Cassidy said \"every reporter asks me that.\"",
      "\"You live life forward,\" Cassidy added. \"Let the day's own troubles be sufficient for the day. And I'll credit the secretary. He's brought attention to things like ultra-processed food that has, frankly, never received this sort of attention before, and people praise him for that. So he and I have publicly disagreed on some matters, but I strongly agree with him on others, and so, so that's how I'll answer your question.\""

    "story": [
      "We may receive an affiliate commission from anything you buy from this article.",
      "Journalist Brian Goldstone, who has written for The New York Times, Harper's Magazine, The New Republic and others, spent about six years examining why so many people who work full-time jobs with low wages are homeless. His new book, \"There is No Place for Us\" (Crown), explores the challenges faced by millions of the working poor.",
      "In the excerpt below, Celeste (a pseudonym given by Goldstone) describes the bureaucracy she must endure when trying to obtain housing in Atlanta.",
      "Don't miss Ted Koppel's interviews with Brian Goldstone and Celeste on \"CBS Sunday Morning\" November 16!",
      "\"There Is No Place For Us\" by Brian Goldstone",
      "Prefer to listen?\u00a0Audible\u00a0has a 30-day free trial available right now.",
      "When Celeste parked her vehicle down the street from Gateway at 6:00 a.m., a long line was snaking down the sidewalk outside of the building. She'd been told that since homeless assessments were conducted on a first-come, first-served basis, people often began lining up in the middle of the night. Still, she was surprised to find such a large crowd already gathered. The doors wouldn't be opening for another two hours. Celeste joined the queue, stepping gingerly around handcarts and baby strollers and small clusters of men and women wrapped in blankets, their belongings stacked beside them on the concrete. Having forced herself to eat a lukewarm Cup Noodles for breakfast, she felt woozy \u2014 and a little frightened too. A noticeably unwell man was cursing loudly and harassing another person nearby. She considered leaving but decided to stick it out, clutching a manila folder filled with documents while trying to avoid making eye contact with those around her. Six weeks earlier, when Celeste started her cancer treatment, any notion of securing long-term housing on her own had quickly vanished \u2014 and with it her resistance to seeking outside assistance. A fear of getting trapped indefinitely at Efficiency now outweighed the embarrassment of pleading for help; pride and dignity were luxuries she could no longer afford. And so, one morning during a work break, she'd gone out to her Durango and fished out the Homeless Resource List given to her by the social worker at Micah's school. Some phone numbers on the list were disconnected; others prompted her to leave a voicemail. But she was able to get through to a few service providers, and each of them, after Celeste described what she was looking for \u2014 help finding a landlord who would rent to her despite the eviction, and maybe some financial support to cover a security deposit \u2014 told her the same thing: To receive such aid, she'd first need to undergo an assessment through Gateway's \"coordinated entry\" system. And it had to be done in person.",
      "Celeste told Mason's mom, Christina, her neighbor a couple of doors down, that she was planning on going to Gateway soon. \"Good luck with that,\" the mother of six scoffed. Her own trek out to Gateway had been fruitless. Celeste thought: Yeah, well, you're not me. If anyone could navigate this system, it was her. She wasn't going to be undone by a little paperwork.",
      "It was almost nine-thirty when she finally entered the building. The interior was spacious and clean, if not quite welcoming. An airport-style metal detector opened onto an intake counter, a security guard station, and a few dozen chairs, occupied by people dozing or staring ahead or attempting to console their crying baby while waiting for their name to be called. In a corner of the lobby, alongside a clinic operated by Mercy Care, a community health center, a hallway led to public showers and a clothing bank; in the opposite corner, there was a large room that, on the coldest nights of winter, was used as a warming center for kids and their mothers. (Since 2013, Gateway's overnight facilities had been designated exclusively for men, but women with children were permitted to sleep in this glass-enclosed space \u2014 with no furnishings, no privacy \u2014 whenever outside temperatures fell below freezing.) Celeste checked in at the counter, located an unoccupied chair, and waited another hour and a half to be seen.",
      "A petite caseworker conducted Celeste's assessment in a bare, windowless office. As the woman settled in behind a computer, Celeste placed a stack of documents on her desk \u2014 hotel receipts, a police report from the arson, paystubs \u2014 and then launched into the story of how she and her kids had ended up without a home, which she'd been rehearsing in her head all morning. Adept at code-switching, she spoke in a clipped, professional manner \u2014 what she thought of as her \"talking to white people voice.\" The caseworker politely stopped her. In order to determine how best to assist her, she said, it was important that she first ask Celeste a series of questions. \"Oh, of course. No problem,\" Celeste replied.",
      "After a scripted preamble in which the woman explained that only \"yes,\" \"no,\" or one-word answers were acceptable and that any question could be skipped or refused, the assessment began. How many months had it been since Celeste had lived in permanent stable housing? Had she ever been diagnosed with a behavioral health disorder? What about HIV or AIDS? Since becoming homeless, had she been arrested? Or tried to harm herself in any way? Or been beaten up? How often did she drink or use drugs? Did she ever exchange sex for money? Or share needles with others?",
      "Celeste was perplexed. She wondered how all this was relevant to her situation. At one point, she gravely mentioned the cancer diagnosis; at another, she interjected to insist that she wasn't lazy, that she had been working nonstop since she was a teenager. The caseworker tapped away at her keyboard. And where was she living now? the woman asked. Celeste told her about the extended-stay.",
      "The assessment was over in a matter of minutes. The caseworker looked up and sighed. The purpose of these questions, she said, was to figure out who most urgently needed help. Based on the answers Celeste provided, it was clear that her vulnerability score, as the woman called it, would be very low \u2014 too low to qualify for housing assistance. The score had been calculated using the Vulnerability Index \u2014 Service Prioritization Decision Assistance Tool, or the VI-SPDAT. Created in 2013 by OrgCode Consulting, the VI-SPDAT was quickly adopted nationwide, as local communities sought to meet a new federal regulation that made funding for homeless services contingent on the implementation of a standardized intake and assessment process. The stated objective of the VI-SPDAT was to identify homeless individuals who were most at risk of dying or being sent to a jail or hospital, and to parcel out limited resources accordingly. In cities and counties across the United States, this technical-sounding survey had become a key instrument in efforts to address homelessness: a mechanism for determining who would \u2014 and would not \u2014 be eligible for support.",
      "\"But what about the cancer?\" Celeste asked, her tone changing. It felt demeaning to have to ask such a question. She had begun to realize that all the things she had been so proud of, such as her work ethic, were making it more, not less, likely that she would leave Gateway empty-handed. \"Doesn't that count for anything?\"",
      "\"Yes,\" the caseworker said, seeming to choose her words carefully. The illness did make Celeste more at risk. The real obstacle, however, was that she and her children did not fit the criteria for \"literal homelessness\" as set out by HUD. \"In order to get housing aid,\" she continued, \"you have to be considered literally homeless, which means you're in a shelter or on the street. Unfortunately, other circumstances don't qualify.\"",
      "Celeste's predicament was increasingly common. The existing support system ignored scores of homeless families who did not fit the government's definition of \"homeless.\" Advocacy groups had been fighting to expand the definition, refuting the myth that families with children living in extended-stays and doubled-up arrangements were somehow less vulnerable than other homeless populations; they argued that these conditions could be just as detrimental to a child's education, mental and physical health, and long-term development. Indeed, the U.S. Department of Education counted as homeless anyone who lacked \"a fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime residence\" \u2014 which explicitly included those in hotels, motels, and living temporarily with others. That year, 2019, the Department of Education reported 35,538 homeless children and youth enrolled in Georgia public schools, an increase of 34 percent from a decade earlier. But the state's HUD-administered total \u2014 not only for children and youth but Georgia's entire homeless population \u2014 was 10,433. Politicians cited the smaller number when discussing homelessness in the state, claiming it was on the decline. This figure also helped determine the amount of money allocated to homeless services the following year. Meanwhile, the parents of those 35,538 students were caught between two parallel definitions. At their child's school, they were considered homeless. At places like Gateway, they were not.",
      "\"So let me get this straight,\" Celeste said. \"If I want y'all's help getting a home for me and my kids, I need to be considered \u2014 what did you call it \u2014 literally homeless?\"",
      "\"Yes, that's correct.\"",
      "\"And to be considered literally homeless, we've gotta be in a shelter?\"",
      "\"That's right. Or somewhere not meant for human habitation.\"",
      "\"All right then,\" Celeste said. \"So how do we get into a shelter?\"",
      "The caseworker took a deep breath. \"You said your son recently turned fifteen?\"",
      "\"Yes.\"",
      "\"I hate to say it, but I don't know of any family shelters that allow boys over the age of thirteen. Usually older boys have to go to a men's shelter.\"",
      "\"No way,\" Celeste said. \"Absolutely not. I'm not going to let my family be separated.\"",
      "\"I wish I had more to offer,\" the woman said. \"I'm sorry.\"",
      "When Celeste left the building, the line outside Gateway was just as long as it had been that morning.",

    "title": "When the employed are pushed into homelessness",
    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/when-the-employed-are-pushed-into-homelessness/",
    "published": "Sun, 16 Nov 2025 10:36:36 -0500",
    "summary": "Despite working full-time, many families are locked out of the rental housing market, due to low wages, soaring rents and poor credit, and have been pushed into homelessness.",
    "story": [
      "In Atlanta, journalist Brian Goldstone introduces us to the intersection of Memorial Drive and Candler Road \u2013 the threshold of two neighborhoods. On one side: a liberal arts college and caf\u00e9s. \"And you cross over, and it's dialysis centers, it's liquor stores, it's payday lenders,\" he said. \"Other areas of Atlanta are booming, but this area sort of stayed stuck in this period of decline. \u2026 The poor are out here on these peripheral areas.\"",
      "Goldstone has devoted his book, \"There Is No Place for Us: Working and Homeless in America,\" to describing the challenges faced by literally millions of the working poor looking for a place to live. He has spent the better part of six years trying to understand why so many people who work full-time jobs with low wages are homeless.",
      "\"The story we as a nation have told ourselves, that hard work is the key to success, that work is an exit from poverty, not having a home, being homeless \u2013 what these people show us is that there's something profoundly not true about that story anymore,\" he said.",
      "In the course of his reporting, Goldstone met Celeste (he changed her name for her privacy). Celeste has been known to work two and three jobs at a time to support her eight children. (All but one are now adults.) She's inspected boxes at a warehouse, worked at a fast-food restaurant, even sold plates of food from her room. She's resourceful. \"I was working in a corner store from the time I was ten years old,\" she said. \"It always gave me, like, a sense of pride to do a good job at whatever I'm doing.\"",
      "If she doesn't have a car, she'll walk to work. Sometimes that boils down to cleaning and tidying up a convenience shop.",
      "Just surviving is a constant struggle. For one month, she slept in her car with the kids.",
      "What Celeste does not have is a passing credit score. \"I could have the most money, but if my credit score isn't a 700, then you don't want me in your property,\" she said.",
      "What totally destroyed her credit score was when an ex-boyfriend set fire to the home that she and her children were renting. \"Walking into that house was like walking into a black hole,\" Celeste said. \"We had nothing.\"",
      "Goldstone said, \"What pushed her and her children into homelessness was the fact that this home was owned by a private equity firm who demanded that she pay rent for the current month's rent and an additional month as well, and she wouldn't get her security deposit back. This was to break the lease on this home that had burned down.\"",
      "The sheriff put an eviction notice in the mailbox of the uninhabitable house. By the time Celeste found the notice, the judge had handed down a default judgment. \"And by that point her credit score had been destroyed,\" Goldstone said.",
      "\"Come for a night, stay for a while\"",
      "Which is what brought Celeste \u2013 what brings so many desperate people \u2013 to what's called an \"extended-stay hotel.\" Celeste lived there with two of her youngest children for about three months. To stay there, she had to pay $520 a week, about $75 a day. \"And that's only if you book online now,\" she said. \"If you don't book online and you have to pay them cash at the window, then you're paying the $80 a day.\"",
      "Over the years, Celeste has lived in about half a dozen extended-stays. \"That's how they advertise it, too,\" Celeste said. \"It actually says, 'Come for a night, stay for a while.'\"",
      "But the slogan, she says, is a trap: \"A lot of these places are substandard. One of the places where I stayed, there was, you know you put the mats down in the bathtub to cover supposedly slipping or falling or anything? Well, I pulled my mat up and there was a big hole in the tub. A lot of places have mold or mildew; they cause health problems. If you don't have them already, you will develop them.\"",
      "Celeste was still living in an extended-stay when things went from bad to a whole lot worse. She found out she had breast and ovarian cancer.",
      "I asked, \"Why didn't you go to the doctor?\"",
      "\"Life was lifing,\" she replied. \"People who are the primary breadwinners in a low-income family, you can't take the time off to go to the doctor. Because me missing a ten-hour shift at work, that's the difference of me paying for my room that day. So, of course, I want to keep a roof over my head. So, sick and all, I'm still going to go to work.\"",
      "\"What struck me over and over again is just how incredibly resilient you were, even after the cancer,\" I said. \"How? Why?\"",
      "\"Because that's the face you have to show the world,\" Celeste said. \"There were many nights that I just was on my hands and knees, praying and believing that God made me a promise, and I was going to do my part, because I knew He was going to do His.\"",
      "Taking advantage of desperation",
      "Many of these stories are variations on a similar theme, and disproportionately, they seem to impact people of color.",
      "Rhea, for example, has four children. In the last two years, she has lived with her kids in friends' apartments, in her car and, most recently, in extended-stay hotel rooms.",
      "The room she shares with her children has no closets, and a single small bathroom. Three of the kids sleep in bed with her; the oldest sleeps on an air mattress. \"I try to get one of them to sleep with him, but they don't want to. They all want to be piled in the bed with mama,\" she laughed.",
      "Rhea has been on her own with the kids since she left a domestic violence situation with the father of her children. Rhea says he never abused the kids, but \"he put his hands on me a couple of times,\" she said.",
      "Rhea eventually got a temporary protective order. No more abuse, but also no more child support. \"He's not allowed to be around me or the kids for two years,\" she said. \"So, I can't talk to him, his family, no one. So, everything is basically on me.\"",
      "Rhea's 20-year-old son helps where he can working some overnight shifts at Amazon, but she also has a seven-year-old son with major medical issues. \"He was born with congestive heart failure and he has severe asthma,\" she said. \"I've been in and out of hospital with him three or four times a month. I'm in and out of ICU with him.\"",
      "And that makes it all but impossible to keep a full-time job. Rhea struggles to pay $375 a week just for that extended-stay room working a patchwork of part-time jobs, including driving for Uber.",
      "Goldstone said, \"I think what was so shocking is that this kind of living situation is not cheaper than an apartment. It is often double, or even triple, what an apartment down the street would cost.\"",
      "What explains that? \"When people are desperate, and those who own these properties know that they are people who are desperate, they will take advantage of that desperation,\" Goldstone said.",
      "The big business of homelessness",
      "Extended-stay hotels are often the last resort for low-income families with poor credit who have become homeless \u2013 and, Goldstone said, homelessness has become big business. \"These hotels, they don't look like much, but there is a lot of money being made off of them,\" he said.",
      "It's happening in a lot of our cities, but especially here in Atlanta: Urban renewal, the renovation and improvement of mostly low-income neighborhoods, restoration, gentrification \u2013 it's all good, unless you're one of the families being squeezed out.",
      "\"It's the same Wall Street investors who are leading families and individuals to become homeless to begin with, because they buy up the rental housing and then, if you're even one day late on your rent, you have an eviction automatically filed against you,\" Goldstone said. \"Before you know it, you're out, and you don't have a home anymore.\"",
      "These days, things are much better for Maurice and Natalia (not their real names). They have an apartment; life is manageable. But only five years ago, they were on the brink of disaster.",
      "Maurice worked for a rental car agency, and Natalia for an insurance company. But when Natalia gave birth to their third child, her salary stopped.",
      "\"That threw everything off,\" Natalia said. \"I didn't get income for, like, a point in time. And then next thing you know, you're out in the street with a baby.\"",
      "Because? \"We were late,\" she said. \"I remember I begged her. She was like, 'Do you have it now? Can you get it now?' And all we needed was to get to Payday. It was crazy because, like, my mindset was, like, it was raining. The sheriff let me sit in his car.\"",
      "\"That still gives me anxiety,\" Maurice said. \"Just getting the call from work, and having to leave work in a hurry, and you come home and you see that, kind of does something to you as a man. \u2026 It transforms you. It breaks you. And it will continue to break you if you'll allow it.\"",
      "Natalia said, \"When we get to storage, there's another family there, too, and it's like, we don't say anything to each other, but we know that look, and all you know is, just nod. It's gonna be okay. Put your stuff in there, let's try to figure out somewhere to go.\"",
      "\"When you see a family at a bus stop with, you know, luggage, you know they're not going to the airport,\" Maurice said.",
      "Natalia said what haunts her most is the black trash bags: \"When you get evicted, all your stuff \u2026 well, it was black, but now it's clear bags.\"",
      "I asked, \"When did you first realize that you really were homeless?\"",
      "\"I was, like, filling out that paperwork and you would hesitate,\" Natalia said. \"They'll ask you where you are living specifically \u2013 are you renting? Are you a homeowner? Or are you homeless? You sit there and you struggle for a minute. You're like, 'Well, I have a roof over my head, but it's not mine, and it's temporary, and I could actually literally be booted out tomorrow.' So, you check the box homeless. That's what we are.\"",
      "\"An expensive prison\"",
      "It was 2020, during the pandemic, and the family of five was living in an extended-stay hotel room. Natalia was working remotely answering customer service calls. \"I got flagged because of the noise,\" she said. \"And they were asking me if I could go to a quieter spot. So, I sent them a picture of where I'm at, because I'm telling them I'm in a hotel, and they were like, 'Oh, we travel to hotels all the time. You could just go over to this \u2026' 'Ma'am, my bed is right here! The kitchen is right here! And that's where I'm working from. Please help me find this quiet space. I'm trying my best, you know?\"",
      "Maurice said, \"I remember just realizing this is like an expensive prison. I was just looking at the bill. My kids can't go outside, there's no playground. We've got to keep the curtain closed because people walk through the hotel, they're going to look into your room, so there is no privacy.\"",
      "In eight months, they spent $17,000 on the extended-stay room, nearly twice as much as they had paid on their old apartment.",
      "Goldstone said, \"I think it's really important that we not talk about all of these families and individuals as if they're falling into homelessness; they are being pushed. This is an engineered neglect, and at every turn there are entire business models that are set up to capitalize on their predicament.\"",
      "Asked if she was embarrassed about what happened, Natalia replied, \"If I could be honest, yes, 'cause remember, it's not supposed to happen to people like us. We do everything that we were supposed to be doing. We tried our best. But you know, you still end up in a hole, in a hell hole.\"",
      "\"Why isn't it supposed to happen to people like you?\" I asked. \"You're educated?\"",
      "\"Yes,\" she said.",
      "\"You're hard working?\"",
      "\"Yes. And we tried our best. You follow all the rules of life.\"",
      "As does Rhea, the single mother of four who pays $375 a week for that small extended-stay room.",
      "A car is her livelihood right now, but she no longer has one of her own. The car she's renting costs her $60 a day; she'll have to drive for Uber two or three hours after work just to pay the car off.",
      "The car already has 187,000 miles on it, and the tires, she says, are \"horrible.\"",
      "I asked, \"When you lie awake at night, what are you thinking about?\"",
      "\"Sometimes I want to give up,\" Rhea said.",
      "\"I can understand that. But you've got children, so you can't, right?\"",
      "\"Yeah, my kids keep me going,\" she said. \"It's so hard right now, I don't even know.\"",
      "Sometimes when things are at their darkest, help comes in the person of someone who's known hard times herself, someone like Sherri McCoy, who has a nonprofit for the homeless called Blessing Bags of Warmth. Rhea calls Sherri \"her angel.\"",
      "\"I wake up every day with a goal to help at least one person,\" said McCoy. \"We are a mutual aid organization, so I reach out to our generous community, and oftentimes people donate. Sometimes they don't, and that's when we dip into the reserves of good old credit cards, my own personal ones.\"",
      "To keep her family going \u2013 between the room, the car, and other expenses \u2013 Rhea has to make $1,200 a week. \"I'm constantly driving from 2:00 in the morning, and sometimes I won't sit down 'til 8:00 at night,\" she said.",
      "I asked, \"Could you work any harder?\"",
      "\"If I could, I would,\" Rhea smiled.",

    "story": [
      "With just months to go before the 250th birthday of the United States, thoughts this morning from bestselling biographer Walter Isaacson:",
      "We've got a big birthday coming up next year \u2013 our 250th. Here's my wish: Let's not blow this opportunity.",
      "We're so polarized these days that we may not be in the mood for a party. Everything seems to divide us.",
      "But perhaps we can use this opportunity to celebrate what unites us, rather than stoke the things that divide us, just like we did for our Bicentennial after the fraught years of Vietnam and Watergate.",
      "One way to do it is by reflecting on our shared creed, proclaimed in the Declaration of Independence sentence that begins: \"We hold these truths to be self-evident...\"",
      "I've just written a little book about how the drafting committee, which included Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin and John Adams, went through four versions of this sentence.",
      "\"We hold these truths to be sacred ... \" Jefferson wrote in the first draft. Franklin crossed out \"sacred\" and wrote in \"self-evident.\" The declaration they were writing was intended to herald a new type of nation, one in which our rights are based on reason, not the dictates of religion.",
      "But then the sentence invokes the \"Creator.\" Jefferson wrote that people \"derive rights,\" and Adams changed it to \"they are endowed by their Creator\" with rights.",
      "Thus we see our Founders balancing the role of divine providence and that of reason in determining our rights. They understood how to balance competing ideals, a talent we should relearn these days.",
      "At the signing of the Declaration, John Hancock wrote his name with his famous flourish. \"We must all hang together,\" they said that he insisted. Franklin replied, alluding to what would happen if their revolution failed, \"Yes, we must, indeed, all hang together, or most assuredly we'll all hang separately.\"",
      "As Franklin pointed out, our life-or-death challenge as a nation is this: When there are so many forces dedicated to dividing us, how can we best hang together?",
      "One way to do it is by reflecting on our fundamental principles, the ones proclaimed in the Declaration's great sentence.",
      "Happy birthday!",

      "President Trump has issued a second pardon to a January 6 defendant who remained imprisoned on separate gun offenses, leading to his release on Friday.",
      "Dan Wilson was one of the supporters of Mr. Trump who breached the Capitol on January 6, 2021. The Justice Department said in a 2024 news release that Wilson was a militia member who entered the building in a gas mask.",
      "He pleaded guilty to a charge of conspiracy to impede or injure a federal officer in May 2024 and was sentenced to five years in prison.",
      "He was pardoned on that charge in January 2025 when Mr. Trump granted clemency for about 1,500 January 6 defendants.",
      "Despite the pardon, Wilson remained incarcerated. Authorities had searched his home in June 2022 as part of their investigation into his presence at the Capitol.",
      "They recovered \"numerous firearms and ammunition,\" the Justice Department said, which he was forbidden from possessing because of previous felony convictions.",
      "Wilson pled guilty to a charge of possession of a firearm by a prohibited person and a charge of possession of an unregistered firearm, and was set to remain in prison until 2028.",
      "A White House official told CBS News that Mr. Trump was pardoning Wilson because the home search that led to the discovery of the firearms was part of the investigation into Wilson's January 6 charges.",
      "Wilson's pardon, reviewed by CBS News, was dated to Friday. He was released from prison on Friday evening, his lawyer George Pallas told the Associated Press.",
      "\"For too long, my client has been held as a political prisoner by a government that criminalized dissent,\" Pallas said in a statement to CBS News. \"President Trump's pardon rights this wrong and sends a clear message that peaceful Americans will not be persecuted for their beliefs. Mr. Wilson is innocent, he has always been innocent, and this pardon proves it.\"",
      "A sprawling legal battle",
      "Wilson's case became part of a legal debate over whether Mr. Trump's pardon of January 6-related crimes applied to other offenses discovered in investigations related to those charges. Mr. Trump has downplayed the events of the attack and referred to those jailed in connection with it as \"hostages.\"",
      "Wilson planned to participate in the riot at the Capitol for weeks, according to the Justice Department's 2024 news release, and occasionally discussed bringing firearms. He ultimately arrived unarmed.",
      "Throughout the day, he provided information in messaging channels about where people needed support as they worked to enter the Capitol, the Justice Department said. He also spoke to other members of far-right groups, including the Oath Keepers.",
      "The Justice Department initially argued that Trump's pardons did not extend to Wilson's gun charges, but later changed its position, saying that it had received \"further clarity on the intent of the Presidential Pardon.\"",
      "U.S. District Judge Dabney Friedrich, who oversaw Wilson's case and was nominated by Mr. Trump during his first term, criticized the move and called efforts to extend the pardon to cover offenses discovered in the course of the investigations \"extraordinary,\" according to the Associated Press.",
      "Mr. Trump also pardoned Suzanne Kaye, a Florida woman who was sentenced to 18 months in prison for threatening to shoot FBI agents. Kaye was questioned by FBI agents after saying online that she had been at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, according to CBS Miami. When contacted by agents, Kaye denied she had been there, but still agreed to speak with them, CBS Miami reported.",
      "In her video, posted to multiple platforms after that conversation but before her interview, Kaye said she would not talk to the FBI without a lawyer and that she would \"my second amendment right to shoot your f------ ass if you come here,\" according to CBIS Miami. A White House official described Kaye's comments as \"voicing her displeasure with the FBI using curt language,\" and said that it was \"clearly a case of disfavored First Amendment political speech being prosecuted and an excessive sentence.\"",

    "summary": "Dave Portnoy talks about his digital empire catering to a young, mostly-male audience that he calls \"normal guys,\" and about blowback from some of his site's \"locker-room\"-style content.",
    "story": [
      "Welcome to Barstool Sports, a digital-age company that is a force in American culture. The headquarters resembles a frat house, and the boss' office is a mess. \"The worst,\" said Barstool's president Dave Portnoy, a reigning king of content and controversy.",
      "Portnoy says he doesn't like a fight, and won't \"go out of my way\" for one, \"but if you are going to pick a fight with me, I will do anything I can to ruin you.\"",
      "What was once a free weekly newspaper of gambling tips founded out of his mom's basement in 2003 is now an online empire worth hundreds of millions of dollars.",
      "Asked to explain what Barstool is, Portnoy said, \"You're sitting at a bar, watching a game with your buddies. Anything you would talk about, that's what we're recording, how people interact with each other normally.\"",
      "And that's really what it is, podcasts and streaming shows of exactly that \u2013 people talking about pretty much anything: football, trivia, movies, and food, like Portnoy's own \"One Bite Pizza Reviews.\"",
      "Dave Portnoy's top pizza scores:",
      "\"We have a bunch of (hopefully) creative, funny, talented people, and we let 'em just run wild,\" Portnoy said. His job is \"managing that ship.\"",
      "As for managing himself, well, he doesn't hold back. \"I feel like I have a good moral compass,\" he said. \"So, I don't care what people say. I never have.\"",
      "Over the years, that's led to outrage and accusations that Portnoy is just another online troll \u2013 sexist, racist, and, as alleged by a 2021 article about his sex life, \"rough and demeaning\" in bed, allegations he flat out denies, and which have never led to charges.",
      "He objects to media outlets, like The New York Times, framing him as \"Dave Portnoy, who has a history of racist and sexist remarks\u2026\" \"I object strenuously to that,\" he said. \"And I hate them. They're the ones who have said it, or people who don't like me. I feel like virtually every single criticism (and some of 'em are brutal) have context around them that a fair-minded person, if they looked at the evidence, would be like, 'What they're saying about him's just not true.' But once it's said, it will never go away.\"",
      "\"People are coming up with real hate\"",
      "Raised in a liberal Jewish home outside of Boston, Portnoy now represents a movement in conservative politics \u2013 a young, mostly-male fan base who turned away from Democrats and voted for Donald Trump.",
      "I asked Portnoy, \"What happened to the Democrats? Why did they lose so many young men?\"",
      "\"People often think I have the answer,\" he replied. \"My nutshell is generally they were very anti-normal guys.\"",
      "\"What do you mean, 'normal guys'? Are you saying there's only one way to be a guy?\"",
      "\"It's okay to be like, if that girl's hot, 'Hey, that girl's hot. I want to drink, I want to party, I like frat parties\u2026' That was all bad,\" Portnoy said. \"And to be honest, the White guy ... was the bad guy, became the bad guy. And there's a lot of, you know, White dudes who are like, 'Well, I'm not the bad guy. Like, what are you getting mad at me for? I wasn't here for colonialism or any of the stuff that you guys are complaining about 200 years ago. Like, what did I do?'",
      "\"And even with the Trump stuff, he won the election,\" he said. \"You had a candidate basically calling you a deplorable or, you know, you're a Nazi if you vote for Trump. I don't know if they used that exact word, but it felt like that.\"",
      "Lately, though, Portnoy has been in the headlines, not for crossing a line, but for his efforts to draw one on antisemitism. He said, \"I've seen in my own experience, just being at Barstool, the difference between how much hate I get \u2013 I never, I mean, occasionally you get, 'Hey, kike' or 'Jew' or whatever. It's every day now. Like, there's a definitive shift in what's going on. So yeah, now, for me being a Jewish person, you have to step up. You're kind of someone people look up to in the Jewish community. You have to go, 'All right, this is not normal, ha-ha with the guys. People are coming up with real hate.'\"",
      "I asked, \"How do you explain that line to people?\"",
      "\"It's a tough one,\" Portnoy replied, \"and sometimes they don't get it.\"",
      "Just last week, a man was arrested for shouting antisemitic abuse at Portnoy while he was taping a video in Mississippi.",
      "I asked, \"The success of Barstool and yourself is based on not being afraid to offend, right? Speech is speech; a joke is a joke. Do you see a connection between what you unleashed and what you now have to deal with?\"",
      "\"No,\" Portnoy said. \"Because I think Barstool, and myself, has always had a pretty good moral compass. So, we've never stood for hate or anything of that ilk. I mean, do I think that feminists should complain about a Diet Coke can being skinny, and that somehow is, like, leading to an eating disorder by Diet Coke having a skinny can? That I think's crazy. And there are things that I think people get far too worked up [about], like he/she, verbs \u2013 like, crazy to me. Making jokes that you are trying to hurt people's feelings and are based in hate? That's never flown with us.\"",
      "He's voted for Trump three times. Still, Portnoy, who supports abortion rights, says these days he's disgusted by politics. \"I mean, who the heck would want to get into politics anyways?\" he said. \"People always ask me that. It's like, what are you, crazy? You can get more done as a private citizen. Everyone just hates your guts. And I don't know why half these people \u2013 I feel like it gets the worst candidates, period. Ninety-nine percent of politicians are scumbags. But, you know, look at what happened to Charlie Kirk. Serious stuff. Like, I don't want that in my life.\"",
      "Referring to acts of political violence that have been inflicted upon Kirk, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, President Trump, and Nancy Pelosi's husband, Portnoy said, \"I mean, I like my life.\"",
      "Portnoy is legally separated and has no plans for kids. He does give back, boosting small businesses all over the country with his pizza reviews, and with the tens of millions of dollars he raised for them during the pandemic. But at 48, he doesn't trust much of anything, including the media.",
      "Which made me wonder: Why did he say yes to an interview like this?",
      "\"It was primarily because I love the show,\" Portnoy replied. \"And even on the way over here I'm like, you know, if this turns into a hit piece on me (which happens a lot with reporters and it's like, 'Oh, that stunk'), I think it would still be worth it to be on 'CBS Sunday Morning.\" It's just part of, I mean, if you love a show, you wanna be part of it. Now, if it turns ugly, I'll probably hate the show after! But at least I'll be on it!",

    "summary": "Prediction markets, like Kalshi, which allow people to place wagers on everything from elections and sports to the anticipated bridesmaids at Taylor Swift's wedding, are booming. But this burgeoning business model is coming under scrutiny.",
    "story": [
      "Joel Holsinger just quit his day job to bet on the words that famous people, like White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, might say in public. \"I thought there was a very high likelihood she would bring up 'Thanksgiving' in relation to the shutdown,\" he said.",
      "From his computer, the 26-year-old makes about $3,000 a week trading on the prediction market Kalshi.",
      "\"She did not say Thanksgiving, so we were out $700 yesterday,\" Holsinger said.",
      "That hurts, right? \"Surprisingly for me, doesn't hurt really much,\" Holsinger replied. \"I have had times where I've lost, for example, like, $6,000 on a bad trade, but also the inverse of that; I've made $11,000 on a trade, and so, you know, it's just ups-and-downs.\"",
      "The live streaming influencer is one of millions of people flocking to prediction markets like Kalshi, PredictIt and Polymarket where you can wager on just about anything.",
      "Tarek Mansour and Luana Lopes Lara are former Wall Street traders-turned-co-founders of Kalshi. \"A prediction market is like the stock market, but instead of buying and selling companies, you're buying 'yes' and 'no' on whether something is going to happen or not,\" Mansour said. \"So, it could be whether Mamdani was going to win the last New York mayor's race, or there's going to be a hurricane in Florida next month.\"",
      "Lopes Lara said, \"People can make money on what they know, actually monetize their knowledge, monetize their hobby, because everyone is an expert on something.\"",
      "Kalshi made a name for itself in the 2024 election. The presidential race looked close, unless you were keeping an eye on Kalshi, which called the race well before the TV networks did. \"It was like Kalshi, then Fox, then CNN,\" said Mansour. \"It was crazy.\"",
      "Twelve months later, Kalshi was the talk of another election: The New York City mayor's race. As Democratic candidate Zohran Mamdani told the crowd on Oct. 26, \"You see the Kalshi odds that have our chances of victory in the 90s.\"",
      "Kalshi's numbers are not polling data; they represent what people think is going to happen. \"It's people putting money on what they think is going to happen, and then the wisdom of the crowds in the markets come up with the probabilities of who is going to win,\" said Lopes Lara.",
      "And you can bet on (or Kalshi says \"invest in\") more than 3,500 markets on the company's platform, like who will be a bridesmaid in Taylor Swift's wedding.",
      "I asked, \"How do I know that someone close to Taylor Swift, or Taylor Swift herself, isn't participating in a way that will make her outcome more favorable and let her, you know, take home a little extra cash?\"",
      "Lopes Lara replied, \"Kalshi is a federally-regulated, fully-compliant exchange, and we have systems in place to monitor for any suspicious or unusual activity. We also have a lot of trading prohibitions in place.\"",
      "According to Mansour, \"There really hasn't been any issues.\"",
      "Prediction markets are booming. The owner of the New York Stock Exchange is investing $2 billion in Polymarket, and the sports betting platform FanDuel will launch its own prediction market next month.",
      "In fact, when it's not an election, the majority of the money traded on Kalshi is not on politics or culture \u2013 it's on sports. Jonathan Cohen, author of \"Losing Big,\" has chronicled the rise of sports betting in the U.S. Regarding Kalshi, he said, \"You can bet on things that a traditional Sportsbook would offer you.\"",
      "\"Kalshi says this is an investment. You don't buy that?\"",
      "\"No,\" said Cohen. \"The New England Patriots are not more likely to win their game because I bought a contract for them to win the game. It is a speculative instrument purely for my own use and my own entertainment, which to me qualifies it as gambling rather than investing.\"",
      "But Kalshi is not regulated like gambling. Online sports betting is only legal in 31 states; Kalshi is available in all 50. \u00a0The Biden administration tried to prevent Kalshi from offering sports markets. Then, when President Trump returned to the White House, his administration vowed to break with \"past hostility\" \u2013 and earlier this year, the president's son, Donald Jr, became a strategic advisor to both Kalshi and its main rival, Polymarket.",
      "Asked why Kalshi made Donald Trump Jr. a strategic advisor, Mansour replied, \"We have a lot of advisors, um, and they span across the board, across different functions. But really, this is all about growing this industry, the prediction market industry, that a lot of people really believe in.\"",
      "I asked, \"What kind of advice does he give you?\"",
      "\"So, it really is, again, about growing prediction markets,\" Mansour said. \"You know, he believes in prediction markets. We believe in prediction markets. A lot of people believe in prediction markets, and it's really about go-to-market and expansion plans.\"",
      "\"Does he come to meetings? How much do you pay him? What's his role? I mean, this is the son of the president.\"",
      "\"We, again, I mean, we have a lot of advisors,\" Mansour replied. \"And whether it's our investors, whether it's, uh, people that we really trust and respect, whether \u2013 \"",
      "\"But he's not just any advisor; he has a direct line to the White House,\" I said.",
      "\"We have a lot of advisors,\" said Mansour.",
      "Kalshi is embroiled in legal battles with several states, like Massachusetts, that say Kalshi's sports markets amount to \"unlawful sports wagering.\"",
      "Are the states wrong? \"We are confident in what we're doing,\" said Mansour. \"We're confident in our position from the law, and we're also confident in the fact that, you know, customers are actually finding a lot of value in basically what we're offering. So, I would say yes.\"",
      "But for now, if you are over the age of 18, you can bet on just about anything, anywhere, any time.",
      "Cohen said, \"It's not enough to, like, like Taylor Swift anymore. You have to use your knowledge of Taylor Swift to, like, try to make money off of how many streams she's going to get in a month. Or it's not enough to, I don't know, even like politics anymore; you have to gamble on politics. You have to make money on politics.",
      "\"That, to me, it seems like sort of the canary in the coal mine of like a 'gamblification' of American culture that I think is sort of still on the rise,\" he said, \"and we might not like what that looks like when it fully arrives.\"",

      "Andria Meave: It wasn't like, oh, my God, my wife is missing. He never seemed like concerned about that. He seemed more concerned about himself.",

      "DET. BLACK: Did you ask her about the date before she left?",
      "FRANK BYERS: Yes, I did. And uh, she told me it was none of my business. Same thing as if I went on a date, it's none of her business.",
      "DET. BLACK: OK, so she never said a name or anything?",
      "FRANK BYERS: No. She \u2014",
      "DET. BLACK: How she met him, how she knew him?",
      "FRANK BYERS: No\u2026",
      "After answering questions for two-and-a-half hours, Black let him go home. The search for Makayla continued. Harper remembers crawling through brush wearing snake protectors when she says she had a premonition.",

      "Harper frantically started looking for tinhorns \u2014 pipes or culverts used to divert water under roads \u2014 but there was no sign of Makayla. Then came the call to 911 on day five that would prove her mother's intuition was right.",

      "Earlier that day, a cousin and her friend had been out searching about half a mile from Makayla's house when they were stopped in their tracks by a strong, sickening odor. The friend followed the intense smell down a ditch to a tinhorn. He saw something sticking out. It was a hand.",
      "911 CALLER: \u2026 I was searching with my friend for my cousin that's missing, Makayla Meave.",

      "Just as Barbara Harper had imagined, Makayla was in a large drainage pipe beneath the road.",
      "Lt. Dakota Black: She had been drug into the middle area and she was wrapped in a carpet. \u2026 Uh, she had one sock on her foot that had teddy bears on it and her shirt was actually pulled up over her face to cover it. .. I mean it was hard. It was really hard.",
      "Detective Black wouldn't leave Makayla's side. The two women had been born one day apart in the same year. But that wasn't their only bond.",
      "Lt. Dakota Black: I did feel a connection with Makayla\u2026 I have a history also. \u2026 you know I've been in bad relationships \u2026 It could have been me. (emotional) \u2026 On more than one occasion. \u2026 I just got lucky \u2026",
      "While the detectives were working the scene, Makayla's family gathered just up the road.",

      "The two investigators had already begun building a strong circumstantial case against Frank Byers \u2014 the bullet casings in her home, his unlikely story that Makayla agreed to an open marriage and left with a bald man in a white truck.",
      "FRANK BYERS (bodycam): Uh, she embraced the guy in a hug, and then they got in the truck and left \u2026",
      "Peter Van Sant: When you ask Makayla's family about this open relationship \u2026 what'd they say?",
      "Lt. Dakota Black: Absolutely not. They said there was absolutely no possible way that Makayla would've ever done that \u2026",
      "Investigators learned from interviews and from Frank Byers' own social media accounts that he was the one who was cheating.",

      "But Makayla's love for the little girls kept drawing her back, says Andria Meave.",
      "Makayla went back to the 10-acre property, but not to Byers. She temporarily moved into that little structure behind his to stay close to the girls.

      "Many in the community tuned in to watch Byers' interview, including Lt. Dakota Black.",
      "Peter Van Sant: Did it make you angry?",
      "Lt. Dakota Black: It did make me angry. It was sickening to see that a beautiful woman was gone from the world, and that while he's on TV, professing his innocence, he's \u2026 still in communication with other women, trying to have intimate relationships with them.",
      "Black tracked down scores of these women. Crystal Cantrell was Byers' girlfriend before he met Makayla.",

      "Crystal Cantrell: I love kids. You know, I have kids of my own. So, I just felt really bad for them.",
      "Shortly after they moved in together, Cantrell says Byers started to show his true colors. He isolated her from friends and family and controlled her every move. They fought. One night, she woke up to see him looming over her clutching a pair of handcuffs.",
      "Crystal Cantrell: I closed them so he couldn't use them on me. And then \u2026 after that he just got on my back and was choking me. He had wrapped his arms around me and had his hand on my throat and he just didn't let go.",
      "Cantrell was able to get away but was too afraid to report the incident to the police.\u00a0 She left Byers for good but says it could have been her in that ditch.",
      "Crystal Cantrell: He would've killed me.",
      "If Byers ever harmed Makayla, she never told her mom and sister.\u00a0 Sometimes they saw bruises, but Makayla always said they were just from rough housing with the kids.",
      "Andria Meave: I think if I think about it too much is where I will go down a dark hole and not come out because I did see the bruises and I just chose to believe and not question. And then maybe if I would've questioned, it would come out differently.",
      "Bit by bit, Black and her team built a profile of a murderer.",
      "Lt. Dakota Black: So, this photo was taken at Walmart ...",
      "Using the date on a Walmart receipt found on Frank's property, the detective was able to track down a security camera photo.",
      "Peter Van Sant: What's in the cart?",
      "Lt. Dakota Black: There is bleach, ammonia, and a mop.",
      "Peter Van Sant: And mop, ammonia, and bleach equals what in your mind as an investigator?",

      "NEIGHBOR: Yes\u2026",
      "Lt. Dakota Black: Frank took the carpet that was given to him by the neighbor and used that to roll Makayla's body in.",
      "They believe Byers killed Makayla around 4 p.m. and left her body in her home. He then picked up his girls after school and drove them around, returning home about 8 p.m. That's when, the detectives believe, he started to move her body.",

      "Lt. Dakota Black: We believe that the tire tracks actually came from a vehicle backing up to load her body, to take it to where she was located.",
      "The detectives believe Byers drove Makayla's body to the edge of the ditch, pulled her out, and then let her body topple the 12 to 15 feet to the creek bed. They believe Byers then climbed down and dragged her into that pipe underneath the roadway.",

      "But investigators did have an explanation. Makayla had two phones \u2013 an iPhone and a Moto G phone. Byers had both of them.",
      "Lt. Dakota Black: The Moto G phone was an old phone of Makayla's that she hadn't been using for quite some time.",
      "Byers knew how to get into that old phone. so he switched the SIM card from her iPhone.",
      "Peter Van Sant: Why does he do that?",
      "Det. Marcus May: To gain full access to \u2026 all of her accounts.",
      "Det. Marcus May: That's how he was texting himself \u2026 pretending to be Makayla \u2026And in fact, it was him the entire time.",

      "In both cases, the White House had argued that the troops were being sent to \"protect federal assets and personnel,\" with the president invoking Title 10 of the federal code, which allows for its use if the president deems that \"there is a rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of the government of the United States.\"",
      "Federal judges, however \u2014 in response to lawsuits brought by city and state officials \u2014 had\u00a0so far blocked\u00a0federalized National Guard soldiers from actually being deployed on the streets of Portland and Chicago, keeping them in a kind of holding pattern while they awaited the legal wrangling of their cases to play out.",
      "The Trump administration on Friday appealed a ruling\u00a0to the Supreme Court which permanently barred the deployment of National Guard troops in Portland.",
      "The defense official also told CBS News that the number of federalized Oregon National Guard members will be reduced from 200 to 100. The approximately 300 Illinois National Guard members that were previously federalized as part of the operation will remain under federal control, the official added.",
      "This comes after U.S. Northern Command issued a statement Friday which said that the Department of War, the Trump administration's preferred name for the Defense Department, would \"be shifting and/or rightsizing our Title 10 footprint in Portland, Los Angeles, and Chicago to ensure a constant, enduring, and long-term presence in each city.\"",
      "Portland and Chicago have seen months-long demonstrations at U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities. Mr. Trump's controversial decision to attempt to deploy federal troops in response has prompted heavy pushback from local and state officials, who criticize the moves as an unnecessary escalation.",

    "story": [
      "Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia on Saturday said she is receiving threats, one day after President Trump announced he is ending his support for his former longtime ally.",
      "Greene has been one of Mr. Trump's most ardent supporters going back to his first term, but seemingly broke with the president on several key issues over the past few weeks, including the political divide over health care funding, which lead to the longest government shutdown in U.S. history, and the controversy over the release of files related to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "\"Aggressive rhetoric attacking me has historically led to death threats and multiple convictions of men who were radicalized by the same type rhetoric being directed at me right now,\" Greene wrote in a lengthy social media post. \"This time by the President of the United States. As a woman I take threats from men seriously. I now have a small understanding of the fear and pressure the women, who are victims of Jeffrey Epstein and his cabal, must feel.\"",
      "She did not detail the exact nature of the threats. Greene's home has been the target of multiple swatting calls in the past.",
      "A group of more than two dozen people that identify as Epstein survivors, or family members of survivors, released a joint statement Saturday in support of Greene.",
      "\"Thank you for standing up against the intimidation, silencing, and abuse that Epstein survivors have endured for decades,\" the statement read. \"...You have our full support.\"",
      "In an email to CBS News, a spokesperson for the group added that many of them have gotten death threats, adding it's \"part of the price of speaking out.\"",
      "In a bombshell Friday night, Mr. Trump took to Truth Social to write that he was \"withdrawing\" his \"support and Endorsement\" of Greene, indicating that he might even back an effort to primary her. He also accused her of going \"far Left.\"",

      "Greene responded on social media by saying \"President Trump just attacked me and lied about me. I haven't called him at all, but I did send these text messages today. Apparently this is what sent him over the edge.\"",

      "\"I truly just stand with the women, and I think they deserve to be the ones that we're fighting for,\" she said.",
      "Greene has also appeared to side with Democratic lawmakers who are calling on Congress to extend the expiring Affordable Care Act tax credits. The standoff over those credits sparked the 43-day government shutdown, which finally ended this week when eight Democratic senators crossed the aisle and reached a deal with their Republican counterparts.",
      "\"Now that the [Affordable Care Act] tax credits are expiring, which the Democrats did put in place \u2014 and they set the expiration date for this year \u2014 I see a financial crisis for Americans,\" Greene told \"CBS Morning.\" \"And so on this issue, I don't see political party lines.\"",

      "Highlands, North Carolina\u00a0\u2014 In the North Carolina town of Highlands, about 20 feet below ground in a goldmine from the 1800s, there is a race against time to save a bat population whose numbers are being decimated by a disease known as white-nose syndrome.",
      "North Carolina's tricolored bats are unstable, among several species of bats quickly dying off in the dark. The bats eat the same bugs that kill crops, meaning they play a critical role in the ecosystem.",
      "\"As bat populations are declining, we see that there's a greater need for use of pesticides,\" said Rada Petrick, a bat expert and research assistant professor of biology at the University of North Carolina who also serves as director of the UNC Institute for the Environment Highlands Field Site.\u00a0\u00a0These flying creatures may look scary, but the real monster in this cold and damp deathtrap is a highly infectious, bat flesh-decomposing fungus that will gnaw their wings right down to the bone.",
      "Lindsey Zarecky, vice president of conservation of research at the Greensboro Science Center, and Olivia Munzer, conservation coordinator for the North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission, are among the biologists working to save the bats.",
      "\"Today we're just getting a count to see what is here, and how many of them are there,\" Zarecky said inside the old goldmine.\u00a0And there's only a handful of bats left in the cave. But it's not the fungus that is killing them. During winter hibernation, their white noses start to itch, waking them up and sending them looking for food that isn't there.",
      "They end up wasting precious calories looking for bugs that aren't in season, and they starve.",
      "So, biologists have turned to a new method that seeks to increase the fat stores of bats before they enter hibernation. It involves placing a bright bug-attracting light about a tennis court away from bat caves.\u00a0\u00a0\"How about if we fatten the bats enough, right before they go into hibernation, that it increases the likelihood of them surviving the winter,\" Petrick explains.\u00a0Adds Munzer, \"There's a bit of patience, and definitely a glimmer of hope to watch these animals learn how to survive through this fungus in the winters.\"",
      "According to\u00a0the National Park Service, white-nose syndrome was first detected in North America in the early 2000s. Through 2018, it has caused the populations of three species \u2014 little brown bats, northern long-eared bats and tricolored bats \u2014 to decline by more than 90% in North America,\u00a0according to a 2021 study.",

      "An influencer blocks traffic for the sake of \"content\"",
      "Around 3:12 a.m. Saturday, Miami Beach Police officers were conducting a high-visibility detail along the 700 block of Washington Avenue within the city's Entertainment District, when a group of individuals entered the roadway from the east sidewalk into the northbound lanes. A man from the group -- later identified as Doherty -- separated from them and attempted to engage officers to \"create video content, positioning himself in the middle of the roadway with passing vehicular traffic and creating a significant safety hazard,\" according to arrest documents obtained by CBS News Miami.",

      "Officers continued, warning Doherty that failure to comply would result in his arrest. Still, the influencer continued to refuse commands and told them, \"Once I'm done with this bet,\" the arrest documents said.

    "summary": "Stephen Bryant, 44, was executed for killing a man in his home and writing \"catch me if u can\" on the wall with the victim's blood.",
    "story": [
      "A South Carolina man convicted of killing three people over five days more than 20 years ago was executed by a firing squad on Friday evening.",
      "Stephen Bryant, 44, was executed for killing a man in his home and writing \"catch me if u can\" on the wall with the victim's blood. He was pronounced dead at 6:05 p.m. following a firing squad. Three prison employees, all with live ammunition, volunteered to carry out the execution. Bryant is the third man this year to die by South Carolina's newest execution method.",
      "Bryant chose to die by firing squad instead of lethal injection or the electric chair. Bryant made no final statement. He briefly glanced at the 10 witnesses before the hood was placed on his head.",
      "The shots rang out about 55 seconds later. Bryant made no noise. The red bullseye target that marks the location of his heart flew forward off his chest. He had a few shallow breaths and then a final spasm a little over a minute later. A doctor checked him with a stethoscope for before he pronounced Bryant dead.",
      "Lawyers for Bryant filed a last-minute appeal, arguing the sentencing judge never considered the severe brain damage he suffered due to his mother's drug and alcohol use during pregnancy. The Supreme Court\u00a0declined\u00a0in October to review Bryant's death sentence.",
      "Bryant was convicted in the 2004 killing of a man in his home, and investigators said he burned Willard \"TJ\" Tietjen's eyes with cigarettes after shooting him and painting on the wall with the victim's blood.",
      "Prosecutors said he also shot and killed two other men he was giving rides to as they were relieving themselves on the side of the road during a few weeks that terrorized Sumter County in October 2004.",
      "In March, South Carolina carried out the nation's first execution by firing squad in 15 years. The state has used a firing squad to put to death three of five inmates this year.",
      "Bryant is the seventh person put to death by South Carolina in 14 months after the state had a 13-year pause in executions when it couldn't obtain lethal injection drugs.",
      "South Carolina\u00a0turned to the firing squad\u00a0as it struggled to find alternative methods to execute condemned inmates. By the early 2010s, the state had run out of lethal injection drugs, and no manufacturer would sell more without anonymity, a condition the law didn't permit. Judges refused to schedule executions if electrocution was the only option. As a result, executions halted for 13 years, and death row cases began to stack up.",
      "No South Carolina governor has offered clemency since the death penalty resumed in the United States in 1976.",
      "Death row executions in the U.S. are on the rise, after creeping upward since the pandemic, when the country's use of the\u00a0death penalty\u00a0reached a historic low.",
      "Forty-three executions have been carried out so far in 2025 and three were scheduled for this week, but only two took place: one in Florida and Bryant's in\u00a0South Carolina. An execution was scheduled in\u00a0Oklahoma\u00a0on Thursday, but Oklahoma's governor\u00a0commuted the sentence\u00a0of the inmate condemned in his state. At least 14 others are scheduled to be put to death during the remainder of 2025 and next year.",

      "Iran on Saturday confirmed the seizure of a Marshall Islands-flagged oil tanker as it traveled through the narrow Strait of Hormuz over violations, including carrying an illegal consignment, state media reported.",

      "It said the seizure came following a court order and the operation was aimed at \"protecting Iran's national interests and resources.\" It identified the oil tanker as the Talara and said it was carrying 30,000 tons of petrochemical products.",
      "The seizure happened on Friday. Tehran has been increasingly warning it could strike back after a 12-day war with Israel in June that saw the U.S. strike Iranian nuclear sites.",
      "It said the ship had been en route to Singapore when Iranian forces intercepted. A private security firm, Ambrey, described the assault as involving three small boats.",
      "U.S. Central Command forces also acknowledged the incident, saying in a statement on Sunday that the M/V Talara was seized after being boarded by Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps forces via helicopter.",
      "\"IRGC operatives then steered the tanker to Iran's territorial waters where the ship remains,\" the statement said. \"Iran's use of military forces to conduct an armed boarding and seizure of a commercial vessel in international waters constitutes a blatant violation of international law, undermining freedom of navigation and the free flow of commerce. We call on Iran to articulate to the international community the legal basis for its actions.\"",
      "A U.S. Navy MQ-4C Triton drone had been circling above the area where the Talara was for hours on Friday, observing the seizure, flight-tracking data analyzed by The Associated Press showed.",

      "Iran has been blamed for a series of limpet mine attacks on vessels that damaged tankers in 2019, as well as for a drone attack on an Israeli-linked oil tanker that killed two European crew members in 2021. Those attacks began after President Trump, in his first term in office, unilaterally withdrew from Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers.",

      "The following is the transcript of the interview with Sen. Bill Cassidy, Republican of Louisiana, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Nov. 16, 2025.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to Face the Nation. \u00a0On Friday, we spoke with the Chairman of one of the Senate committees responsible for crafting health care legislation, Louisiana's Bill Cassidy, who is also a doctor. We began by showing him what the President is thinking of for a healthcare fix.",
      "PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I'm calling today for insurance companies not to be paid, but for the money, this massive amount of money to be paid directly to the people of our country so that they can buy their own health care, which will be far better and far less expensive than the disaster known as Obamacare.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So are you, Senator, coordinating with the White House on this proposal?",
      "SEN. BILL CASSIDY: So we're absolutely in communication with the White House and with the administration, because there's a lot of stuff that you have to work out to do that. But let me give a little meat on the bones of what the President's speaking about. If you look at an Obamacare policy now, there's a $6,000 deductible. Democrats are fighting to lower the premiums. You lower a premium on something which has $6,000 deductible, it's basically a catastrophic policy. Now, I like to speak of the cost of being insured, not just the cost of the health insurance. The President is proposing that we take the $26 billion that would be going to insurance companies if we just do a straight out extension, and by the way, 20 percent of that $26 billion, 20 percent will go for profit and administrative overhead, give it directly to the American people in an account in which 100 percent of the money is used for them to purchase health care on their own terms. Now- now, that makes them an informed consumer. It also helps address the need to have coverage for that deductible, and if they get that policy with a higher deductible, they can actually lower their premium. It's a sweet spot, lower premiums, help with the deductible, making the patient the informed consumer, the President and I are united. We should all be united about that.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the President's economic adviser, Kevin Hassett, was on this program last Sunday. He said the president was just brainstorming, things aren't formally put together among Republican senators yet, but I just want to clarify what you are coordinating with the President on here, because, is it to buy your own insurance policy, which is kind of complicated, or is it to use this flexible spending account you've talked about for related health care needs? Like, are there restrictions on how you can use that money?",
      "SEN. CASSIDY: So first, there's two types of premium tax credits. There's the baseline premium tax credit, which was part of Obamacare, that would stay in effect, and people would still buy a policy. For example, they get in a car wreck, something disastrous. They need somebody negotiating on their behalf with all the providers. That stays the same. What we're talking about the shutdown was over the enhanced premium tax credits. Policies have become so expensive under Obamacare that under Joe Biden, Democrats passed another subsidy on top of the first subsidy. That's what we're fighting about and what Republicans are saying, and I like to hope Democrats will too. Hey, wait a second, if we can have lower premiums and help people with their deductible by giving the money directly to the patient. By the way, 20 percent doesn't go for insurance company profit and overhead. 100percent goes for health care. Why don't we unite Republican and Democrats in doing that? That's where the President is. You got to figure some things out. But we're a lot further along than you might imagine.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So do you want to fix Obamacare, or do you want to eliminate Obamacare?",
      "SEN. CASSIDY: First, you have to, like, we're going into 2026. That's like a month and a half from now.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Right.",
      "SEN. CASSIDY: And so you've got to work with what you have. But on the other hand, Obamacare was a top heavy, administratively heavy type system in which a lot of money is a lot of money, and responsibility is taken from individuals and given to insurance companies. As one example, I'm a doctor. I work for 20 years in a hospital for the uninsured. I found that if you give the patient the power, good things happen that's supported, by the way, by the medical literature, if the patient is engaged in her health care and the health care of her family. She's going to be a wise shopper, wise for her health and wise for her pocketbook. We need to have a new model, and that model is to engage the patient in her own health care. Doing so is good for her, good for us all.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, but you said we need to work with what we have. That is, as you just said, you have a short amount of time before the end of the year. Do you think you need to extend the health care tax subsidies that are currently in place until you figure out all the rest of this complicated policy making?",
      "SEN. CASSIDY: Let me back you up just a little bit, Margaret. I'll just say, everybody assumes it's easy just to extend the premium tax credits, the enhanced premium tax credits. It's not that easy. 50 percent of the states did not plan on them being extended, and they don't have rates as if they were to be extended. So that means if we pass this mid December, they've got to recalculate rates in time for, wait a second, by that time, we're already into 2026 it's not an easy matter. And by the way, did I mention the policies that people want to lower the premiums for have $6,000 deductibles. It is basically something for insurance companies to make money off of and for the individual to wade through $6,000 of debt before they can finally access it. Now, the kind of proposal I am proposing Republicans are, and I hope Democrats will join, is, let's take that money, and we have a mechanism to do so. We give it to the patient. By giving her that money, she could choose a bronze level plan, which is to say lower premiums. So now her premiums are down, but she has money in an account to help with the deductible, and I think we can figure that out about as easily as we can figure out what we would do if we just did a straight out extension.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So you want to do all this, though, by the second week of December, when the Democrats have been promised they'll have a vote on an ACA bill of their choice.",
      "SEN. CASSIDY: Yes, and I tell my Democratic colleagues first, let's not be Democrats and Republicans. Let's be Americans, representing all of Americans. Let's recognize what you're doing just gives money to insurance companies, but we can do it better with lower premiums and with money and accounts to pay deductibles. And then why don't we come together? There can be a Democratic bill and a Republican bill, and both fail. Let's do an American bill where the American people benefit and this work together, collaborate to lower those premiums and help them with that first dollar coverage in the- in the deductible.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: So we looked and there are about 293,000 Louisianans, your state, enrolled in Obamacare currently, six weeks from now, those extent expanded tax credits that you've been talking about will go away for individuals making $62,000 or above. Individuals making less than that amount will see their tax credit shrink. So are you telling those hundreds of thousands of Louisianans that that tax credit is going away no matter what, that- that they should make plans\u2013",
      "SEN. CASSIDY: No.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: \u2013 for higher prices?",
      "SEN. CASSIDY: I'm telling them that we're I'm telling them that we are working to make it work better for them. And they would tell you, by the way, wait a second, I got a $6,000 deductible that does not work for me. Margaret, I'm a doctor. I would talk to people when they'd come to see me, and they would tell me, I can't afford that. My deductible is too high. That's reality, and that reality is being lost in this discussion. We've got to do something about sky high deductibles. Maybe you can afford the premium. You can't afford the policy. Let's lower the cost of having health insurance, focusing by not just on the premium, but the deductible. And I think we can do both.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, even in the private market, health care costs have gone up up six to 9 percent when you look at the projections. But I want to ask you about your oversight role. Secretary Kennedy has this hand picked panel of vaccine advisors. You know them at ACIP. They're going to meet in a few days and potentially vote on changing the hepatitis B vaccine schedule for infants. That same vaccine advisory group is also considering the safety of vaccine ingredients like aluminum, which would impact a number of childhood shots. This should matter for American parents. Are you comfortable with what they are about to put to a vote?",
      "SEN. CASSIDY: I'm very concerned about this. As it turns out, my medical practice focused on hepatitis B, and so we know that because of a recommended dose at birth of hepatitis B vaccine, recommended, not mandated, the number of children born contracting hepatitis B at birth, or shortly thereafter, has decreased from about 20,000, 20 years ago to like 200 now. That's 20- effectively a clerical error. We have decreased incidence of chronic hepatitis B by 20,000 people over the last two decades with this kind of recommendation. And by the way, if you're infected at birth, you're more likely- you're 95 percent likely to become a chronic carrier. The vaccine is safe. It has been established, and these ingredients they're speaking of have been shown to be safe. This is policy by people who don't understand the epidemiology of hepatitis B, or who have grown comfortable with the fact that we've been so successful with our recommendation that now the incidence of hepatitis B is so low, they feel like we can rest on our laurels. I'm a doctor. I have seen people die from vaccine-preventable disease. I want people to be healthy. I want to make America healthy, and you don't start by stopping recommendations that have made us substantially healthier.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, the president of the United States also told American women not to take Tylenol. Or give it to their kids. This is based on a theory that it causes autism somehow. And he also in a social media post, the same one, called for the measles, mumps and rubella shot to be broken up into three different shots. That was then endorsed by the acting CDC director. Are you concerned by this kind of suggestive linkage at the top of the CDC and from the White House?",
      "SEN. CASSIDY: Again, I'm a doctor, and so I'm going to go where the evidence takes me. And the best evidence is a study out of Sweden with 2 million children that found no- no causality, no association, if you will, between taking Tylenol in pregnancy and getting autism. And of course, that concerns me, because there's going to be a mom out there \u2014again, I'm a doctor, I talk to I talk to patients\u2014 in a room, and her child has autism. She took Tylenol for a high fever during pregnancy and now she blames herself. That's just the way mamas think, and that's wrong. We don't want her to think that. The best evidence is that there is no relationship, by the way, if you have a high fever during pregnancy, that may be a risk for autism. Now, of course, if you're pregnant, talk to your physician before you take anything, but point being, the best evidence is that there is no relationship between the two. And I don't want women putting themselves on a guilt trip when the best evidence shows not. By the way, the President has spoken out strongly in favor of immunizations in other cases, and I noted, when he got his physical, he got the flu and COVID shots. So the President has demonstrated that he believes in immunization.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: But that's why clarifying the statements, I think, is important, since you interpret them differently. I wonder, do you regret your confirmation vote for Secretary Kennedy?",
      "SEN. CASSIDY: I smile because every reporter asks me that--",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, because these questions run right into a pledge that you extracted from him not to tinker with some of the structures that were set in place to have oversight of these vaccines and this process.",
      "SEN. CASSIDY: So you live life forward, again, you just do, let the day's own troubles be sufficient for the day. And I'll credit the secretary. He's brought attention to things like ultra-processed food that has, frankly, never received this sort of attention before, and people praise him for that. So he and I have publicly disagreed on some matters, but I strongly agree with him on others, and so, so that's how I'll answer your question.",
      "if this is your final year in office, sir, will you make overhauling health care your top priority?",
      "SEN. CASSIDY: Well, I sure hope it's not my final year in office, but, but I've been thinking about healthcare for 30 years, because when I worked in a public hospital for the uninsured, I saw the burden it could be on middle-income families who had middle income but couldn't afford the insurance or couldn't assure afford the healthcare. And so it's been my priority for 30 years, and I will continue to do that. And if there is a silver lining, if there is a silver lining in the shutdown, we just had, the silver lining is now we are focused on how do we make health care more affordable for the American people. That should be our goal, not to be partisan one way or the other. How do we make it more affordable for fellow Americans? If we can accomplish that, I will feel like I've done my job.",
      "MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator, thank you for your time.",
      "SEN. CASSIDY: Thank you Margaret.",

    "summary": "President Trump had threatened to sue the BBC for $1 billion over a program it aired in 2024 about the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol.",
    "story": [
      "The BBC has issued an apology to President Trump over\u00a0editing of a speech he gave on Jan. 6, 2021, that aired in its documentary \"Trump: A Second Chance.\" Mr. Trump had threatened to sue the British broadcaster for $1 billion over the program about the Capitol riot, and the BBC noted in a statement Thursday that it \"strongly disagree[s]\" that there's a basis for a defamation claim.",
      "BBC lawyers wrote to Mr. Trump's legal team in response to a letter they received Sunday, the BBC Press Office said. In that letter, lawyers working for Mr. Trump alleged that the Oct. 28, 2024, episode of the network's \"Panorama\" documentary program, which was produced by an external production company, sought to mislead viewers by editing together three separate sections of the speech made by Mr. Trump.",
      "\"BBC Chair Samir Shah has separately sent a personal letter to the White House making clear to President Trump that he and the Corporation are sorry for the edit of the President's speech on 6 January 2021, which featured in the programme,\" the BBC Press Office said in its statement Thursday. \"The BBC has no plans to rebroadcast the documentary 'Trump: A Second Chance?' on any BBC platforms.\"",
      "\"While the BBC sincerely regrets the manner in which the video clip was edited, we strongly disagree there is a basis for a defamation claim,\" the press office added.",
      "The White House did not immediately comment on the BBC's apology. Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One Friday night, Mr. Trump said, \"We'll sue them for anywhere between a billion and $5 billion, probably sometime next week.\"",
      "The BBC's response to Mr. Trump's legal team laid out five main arguments why the organization believes there is no legitimate case against it, BBC News reported. CBS News has not seen the letter sent by the BBC in reply to Mr. Trump's legal team.",
      "According to BBC News' report, those arguments include that the episode in question did not air in the U.S.; that it did not cause Mr. Trump harm, as he won the election a week later; and that the edits made were intended to shorten a long speech rather than to mislead. It also said that the clip was not meant to be taken in isolation, and that matters of public concern and political speech are protected under U.S. law.",
      "An expert on international media law told CBS News that the BBC's response appears to be \"careful and considered.\"",
      "\"President Trump was clearly owed a fulsome apology and he's had that,\" U.K.-based attorney Mark Stephens told CBS News. \"I don't think he was entitled to damages, and so as a consequence, they've rightly hung tough on that particular issue. But, of course, this has been a massive PR victory for the president. He can now call the BBC 'fake news' ... pointing to some credible background for that.\"",
      "The letter over the weekend from Mr. Trump's lawyers claimed that the program \"has caused President Trump to suffer overwhelming financial and reputational harm,\" and that it was defamatory under Florida law. It outlined demands by Mr. Trump that the BBC retract the documentary, issue an apology and \"appropriately compensate President Trump for the harm caused.\"",
      "The letter did not clarify what would be considered appropriate compensation, but it warned that if the BBC failed to comply with Mr. Trump's demands by Friday at 5 p.m. ET, Mr. Trump would file \"legal action for no less than $1,000,000,000 (One Billion Dollars) in damages.\"",
      "Stephens told CBS News that while it would be possible for Mr. Trump to pursue a lawsuit against the BBC in the U.S., \"it's got a number of legal impediments and tripwires.\"",
      "First, Stephens said, was that the program which included the clip was not shown in the U.S.",
      "\"You can't be lowered in the estimation of right-thinking people by a program that wasn't seen by an American audience. So you can't sue, there's no jurisdiction to sue, in America,\" he said.",
      "He also said that because Mr. Trump is \"the president, the ultimate public figure,\" criticism of him would likely be protected under the First Amendment.",
      "Even if the case got past those hurdles, which he doubted, Stephens said, \"lawyers would be looking at whether or not the sting of this was true.

    "summary": "It intends to make refugees who have been granted asylum wait 20 years before applying to be allowed to live in the U.K. long-term.",
    "story": [
      "The United Kingdom will drastically reduce protections for refugees and end automatic benefits for asylum seekers, the Labour government announced late Saturday, under new plans aimed at slashing irregular immigration and countering the hard-right.",
      "The measures, modelled on Denmark's strict asylum system, were announced as Prime Minister Keir Starmer comes under pressure from surging popularity for the anti-immigrant Reform UK party.",
      "\"I'll end UK's golden ticket for asylum seekers,\" interior minister Shabana Mahmood declared in a statement.",
      "But the head of Britain's Refugee Council warned the government the measures would not deter people from trying to reach Britain, and urged a rethink.",
      "Presently, those given refugee status have it for five years, after which they can apply for indefinite leave to remain and eventually citizenship.",
      "But Mahmood's ministry, known as the Home Office, said it would cut the length of refugee status to 30 months.",
      "That protection will be \"regularly reviewed\" and refugees will be forced to return to their home countries once they are deemed safe, it added.",
      "The ministry also said that it intended to make those refugees who were granted asylum wait 20 years before applying to be allowed to live in the U.K. long-term. Currently, they can do so after five years.",
      "Asylum claims in Britain are at a record high, with some 111,000 applications made in the year to June 2025, according to official figures.",
      "The Home Office called the new proposals, which Mahmood is due to lay out in parliament on Monday, the \"largest overhaul of asylum policy in modern times.\"",
      "It said the reforms would make it less attractive for irregular migrants to come to Britain, and make it easier to remove those already in the country.",
      "A statutory legal duty to provide support to asylum seekers, introduced in a 2005 law, would be also be revoked, the ministry said.",
      "That means housing and weekly financial allowances would no longer be guaranteed for asylum seekers.",
      "It would be \"discretionary,\" meaning the government could deny assistance to any asylum seeker who could work or support themselves but did not, or those who committed crimes.",
      "Starmer, elected last summer, is under pressure to stop migrants crossing the English Channel in small boats from France, something that also troubled his Conservative predecessors.",
      "More than 39,000 people, many fleeing conflict, have arrived this year following such dangerous journeys -- more than for the whole of 2024 but lower than the record set in 2022.",
      "The crossings are helping fuel the popularity of Reform, led by firebrand Nigel Farage, which has led Labour by double-digit margins in opinion polls for most of this year.",
      "Labour is taking inspiration from Denmark's coalition government -- led by the center-left Social Democrats -- which has implemented some of the strictest migration policies in Europe.",
      "Senior British officials recently visited the Scandinavian country, where successful asylum claims are at a 40-year-low.",
      "Refugees in Denmark are entitled to a one-year renewable residency permit, and are encouraged to return home as soon as authorities deem there is no longer a need for a safe haven.",
      "Family reunions are also subject to strict requirements, including a minimum age for both parents, language tests and guarantees of funds.",
      "Britain's Mahmood is also expected to announce a tightening of rules around family reunions.",
      "Enver Solomon, chief executive of the Refugee Council, urged the government to rethink its plans, saying they \"will not deter\" the crossings.",
      "\"They should ensure that refugees who work hard and contribute to Britain can build secure, settled lives and give back to their communities,\" he said.",
      "Labour's more left-wing lawmakers will probably oppose the plans, fearing that the party is losing voters to progressive alternatives such as the Greens.",

      "The event, organized by the Vatican's culture ministry, took place in a frescoed Vatican audience hall. Leo called on the attending artists to use their art to include marginalized voices and praised film to console and challenge audiences.",
      "\"It articulates the questions that dwell within us, and sometimes, even provokes tears that we did not know we needed to express,\" Leo said.",
      "The first U.S.-born pope also acknowledged the financial difficulties facing movie theaters. He said institutions should not give up, but \"cooperate in affirming the social and cultural value\" of theaters, drawing applause from the audience.",
      "\"His speech was beautiful and very inspiring, about hope and our work in cinema. We're glad we came,\" said Judd Apatow, who attended the audience with his wife and fellow Hollywood star Leslie Mann.",
      "\"It was so inspiring,\" Mann added.",
      "Leo spent nearly an hour greeting guests and making conversation with each attendee. Lee, a basketball lover, gifted the pontiff a New York Knicks jersey that featured the No. 14 and Leo's name on the back. Leo may be a known Chicago Bulls fan, but Lee said he told the pope that the Knicks' current roster includes three players from Villanova University, the Holy Father's alma mater. Lee said Leo's words about film were \"very, very moving.\"",
      "Pope Francis held similar audiences with artists and comedians. The audiences are part of the Vatican's efforts to reach out beyond the Catholic Church to engage with the secular world.",
      "A pope who \"grew up with cinema\"",
      "Leo is the first American-born Pope and grew up during Hollywood's heyday. Earlier this week, he listed his four favorite movies: \"It's a Wonderful Life,\" \"The Sound of Music,\" \"Ordinary People,\" and \"Life Is Beautiful,\" all classics that celebrate love and hope in the face of darkness. Leo will also be the subject of his own movie, a documentary from the Vatican that traces his life from Chicago to St. Peter's.",
      "\"He is a pope who grew up with television and grew up with cinema, and it's a natural (medium) to tell his story,\" said Monsignor Paul Tighe, the Vatican's culture secretary, in a conversation with CBS Saturday Morning.",
      "Tighe said the large group of filmmakers and actors was pulled together during the last three months. Vatican officials used contacts in Hollywood, including Martin Scorsese, to help craft the list of attendees. The hardest part, Tighe said, was convincing Hollywood agents that the invitation wasn't a hoax. Tighe told CBS Saturday Morning that he hopes the event shows that the Church embraces the arts, instead of just tolerating them.",
      "\"We have to trust that the artist, even when he or she is being provocative, is trying to wake us up, grab our attention, and make us think about things that are important,\" Tighe said.",

Global temperatures, greenhouse gas emissions and sea levels all reached record highs in 2024, the\u00a0State of the Global Climate report\u00a0confirmed.",
      "Many of the protesters reveled in the freedom to demonstrate more openly than at recent climate talks\u00a0held in more authoritarian countries, including Azerbaijan, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt.

      "The government in Tokyo lodged a protest and its top spokesperson, Chief Cabinet Secretary Minoru Kihara, urged China to take \"appropriate measures,\" Japan's Kyodo News Service reported.",
      "China advised its citizens Friday to refrain from traveling to Japan in the near future. It cited earlier attacks against Chinese in Japan and what it called Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi 's \"erroneous remarks\" on Taiwan, which it said undermined the atmosphere for China-Japan\u00a0exchange.",

      "China has repeatedly recommended its nationals take security precautions when in Japan over the past year, but the latest announcement appeared to be stronger in advising against travel, according to notices posted on the website of its embassy in Tokyo.",
      "Japan is an immensely popular destination for Chinese tourists, providing a much-needed economic boost but also sparking an anti-China and anti-foreigner backlash from some. It's unclear what impact the advisory will have on the willingness of Chinese to visit Japan, but several Chinese airlines\u00a0offered no-penalty refunds on previously sold tickets to Japan following the government's announcement.",
      "The dispute suggests that Japan's already fragile relations with China could turn rocky under Takaichi, who supports building up the military to counter potential threats from Beijing and its claims to contested territory in nearby waters in the western Pacific.",
      "Takaichi, who became prime minister last month, said in parliament that a Chinese attack on Taiwan could constitute \"an existential threat\" to Japan, requiring the use of force by its military.",

    "summary": "The Vatican has returned 62 artifacts to Indigenous peoples from Canada.",
    "story": [
      "The Vatican on Saturday returned 62 artifacts to Indigenous peoples from Canada as part of the Catholic Church's reckoning with its role in helping suppress Indigenous culture in the Americas.",
      "Pope Leo XIV gave the artifacts, including an iconic Inuit kayak, and supporting documentation to a delegation of the Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops during an audience. According to a joint statement from the Vatican and Canadian church, the pieces were a gift and a \"concrete sign of dialogue, respect and fraternity.\"",
      "The items were part of the Vatican Museum's ethnographic collection, known as the Anima Mundi museum. The collection has been a source of controversy for the Vatican amid the broader museum debate over the restitution of cultural goods taken from Indigenous peoples during colonial periods.",
      "Most of the items in the Vatican collection were sent to Rome by Catholic missionaries for a 1925 exhibition in the Vatican gardens. The Vatican insists the items were \"gifts\" to Pope Pius XI, who wanted to celebrate the church's global reach, its missionaries and the lives of the Indigenous peoples they evangelized.",
      "But historians, Indigenous groups and experts have long questioned whether the items could really have been offered freely, given the power imbalances at play in Catholic missions at the time. In those years, Catholic religious orders were helping to enforce the Canadian government's\u00a0forced assimilation policy\u00a0of eliminating Indigenous traditions, which Canada's Truth and Reconciliation Commission has called \"cultural genocide.\"",
      "Part of that policy included confiscating items used in Indigenous spiritual and traditional rituals, such as the 1885 potlatch ban that prohibited the integral First Nations ceremony. Those confiscated items ended up in museums in Canada, the U.S. and Europe, as well as private collections.",
      "Negotiations accelerate on returning items",
      "Negotiations on returning the Vatican items accelerated after Pope Francis in 2022 met with Indigenous leaders who had traveled to the Vatican to receive his apology for the church's role in running Canada's disastrous residential schools. During their visit, they were shown some objects in the collection, including an Inuit kayak, wampum belts, war clubs and masks, and asked for them to be returned.",
      "Francis later said he was in favor of returning the items and others in the Vatican collection on a case-by-case basis, saying: \"In the case where you can return things, where it's necessary to make a gesture, better to do it.\"",
      "The Vatican said Saturday the items were given back during the Holy Year, exactly 100 years after the 1925 exhibition where they were first exhibited in Rome.",
      "\"This is an act of ecclesial sharing, with which the Successor of Peter entrusts to the Church in Canada these artifacts, which bear witness to the history of the encounter between faith and the cultures of the Indigenous peoples,\" said the joint statement from the Vatican and Canadian church.",
      "It added that the Canadian Catholic hierarchy committed to ensuring that the artifacts are \"properly safeguarded, respected and preserved.\" Officials had previously said the Canadian bishops would receive the artifacts with the explicit understanding that the ultimate keepers will be the Indigenous communities themselves.",
      "The items are expected to be taken first to the Canadian Museum of History in Gatineau, Quebec. There, experts and Indigenous groups will try to identify where the items originated, down to the specific community, and what should be done with them, officials said previously.",
      "A process of reckoning with abuses",
      "The Canadian ambassador to the Holy See, Joyce Napier, said the return had been a key priority for the Canadian government, something the embassy has been working on for years with the Holy See, Canadian church and Indigenous communities.",

    "story": [
      "A cache of confiscated explosives detonated inside a police station in Indian-administered Kashmir, killing at least nine people and injuring 32 others, police said on Saturday.",
      "The blast occurred in the Nowgam area of Srinagar, the region's main city, late Friday when a team of forensic experts and police were examining the explosive material, said Nalin Prabhat, the region's police director-general. He ruled out any foul play, saying it was an accident.",
      "The dead included six police and forensic officials, two civil administrators and one civilian, authorities said. Some of the injured were in critical condition.",
      "The huge blast ripped through the police station, setting it and multiple vehicles on fire. According to the news agency Press Trust of India, small successive explosions prevented immediate rescue operations.",
      "The police station blast came days after Monday's deadly car explosion in New Delhi, which killed at least eight people near the city's historic Red Fort. Indian officials called it a \"heinous terror incident\" carried out by \"anti-national forces.\" The car blast happened hours after police in Kashmir said they had dismantled a suspected militant cell operating from the disputed region, arresting at least seven people, including two doctors from Indian cities, and seizing a large quantity of bomb-making material in the city of Faridabad, near New Delhi.",
      "Indian security agencies have since carried out a series of raids in Kashmir as part of their investigation into the car blast, questioning hundreds while detaining scores others.",
      "Indian police said Saturday they used DNA to identify the car's driver and that he was a Kashmiri doctor. Government forces blew up his family home in the southern district of Pulwama on Thursday night, officials said.",
      "In the past, troops have demolished homes of suspects they accuse of being tied to militants fighting against Indian administration in Kashmir as a punishment.",
      "Police had brought the explosive material seized in Faridabad to Kashmir as part of their investigation and were \"kept securely in an open area\" at the police station, where the investigation that led to the suspected militant cell began last month, according to Prabhat, the top officer.",
      "Prabhat said a team of experts was taking samples for forensic investigation when the blast occurred, calling it an \"accidental explosion.\"",
      "\"Any other speculation into the cause of this incident is unnecessary,\" he said.",
      "The blast could be heard from miles away in Srinagar, locals said. Some of the victims' body parts were recovered from nearby houses, over 300 feet away from the police station. Multiple houses also suffered damage.",
      "\"The explosion produced a deafening roar that rattled houses and flung open windows closed tight,\" Bashir Ahmed, a resident, told The Associated Press.",
      "Nearly a dozen relatives of Mohammad Shafi Parray, killed in the blast, assembled at his home in Nowgam and marched in protest to the police station, chanting: \"We want justice.\"",
      "One of Parry's relatives, who didn't give her name, said the deceased, a tailor by profession, was summoned by the police Friday night. \"Why did (the police) take him?\" she shouted.",

      "India and Pakistan each administer a part of Kashmir, but both claim the territory in its entirety.",
      "Militants in the Indian-administered portion of Kashmir have been fighting New Delhi's administration since 1989. India insists the Kashmir militancy is Pakistan-sponsored terrorism. Pakistan denies the charge, and many Kashmiris consider it a legitimate freedom struggle.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/largest-spider-web-discovered-cave-greece-albania-border/",
    "published": "Fri, 14 Nov 2025 14:12:09 -0500",
    "summary": "The behavior, which had never been observed before, stunned scientists as, typically, the larger house spider would prey on its smaller neighbor.",
    "story": [
      "What is thought to be the world's largest-known spider's web, housing tens of thousands of arachnids, has been discovered in a cave on the Albanian-Greek border.",
      "After researchers published their findings of two different spider species peacefully cohabiting in a giant colony nestled in a pitch-black, sulfur-rich cave, evolutionary biologist Lena Grinsted likened the \"extremely rare\" occurrence to humans living in an apartment block.",
      "\"When I saw this study, I was very excited because \u2026 group living is really rare in spiders,\" Grinsted, a senior lecturer at the U.K.'s University of Portsmouth, told The Associated Press. \"The fact that there was this massive colony of spiders living in a place that nobody had really noticed before \u2014 I find extremely exciting.\"",
      "The results of the study, published last month in the journal Subterranean Biology, spread rapidly online due to the striking images of the giant 1,140-square-foot spider's web, a carpet-thick sprawl stretching along a narrow passage wall inside Sulfur Cave, which extends into Albania from its entrance in Greece.",
      "This arachnophobe's worst nightmare was quickly labelled the \"world's largest spiderweb.\"",
      "But the most surprising thing about the spider colony \u2014 which boasts an estimated 110,000 spiders \u2014 had less to do with its size and more to do with what scientists found inside the huge mass of funnel-shaped webs.",
      "Two different spider species \u2014 about 69,000 Tegenaria domestica, or common house spider, and 42,000 Prinerigone vagans \u2014 were living side by side and thriving. The behavior, which had never been observed before, stunned scientists as, typically, the larger house spider would prey on its smaller neighbor.",
      "\"So often if you have spiders in close vicinity, they will fight and end up eating each other,\" said Grinsted, who was not part of the cave study but has extensively researched spiders. \"We can sometimes see that if there's an abundance of food that they sort of become a bit less aggressive.\"",
      "In addition to spiders, the terrestrial fauna in the cave include centipedes, terrestrial isopods, scorpions and beetles, the researchers said.",
      "\"In the stream passage located close to the cave entrance, a dense swarm of adult chironomid flies fills the air in the immediate vicinity of the sulfidic stream, and a large portion of the cave wall is covered by a massive colonial spider web,\" the study's authors write.",
      "Abundant food source",
      "Scientists are keen to understand how and why the two species came to coexist peacefully in a \"permanently dark zone\" about 160 feet from the entrance of the cave, carved out by the waters of the Sarandaporo River to form the Vromoner Canyon. (The study's authors note that Vromoner means \"smelly water\" in Greek.)",
      "Part of the answer, the research suggests, may lie in the combination of the estimated 2.4 million midge flies that buzz around the spider colony \u2014 an \"unusually dense swarm\" that provides a constant food source in an otherwise predator-scarce environment. The scientists also speculate that the friendly living arrangement could be a result of darkness impairing the spiders' vision.",
      "However, Grinsted says it is more likely that the larger spiders evolved or simply grew accustomed to responding to vibratory cues when the small flies land on their silken web \u2014 and maybe don't attack otherwise.",
      "\"Spiders, in general, are not particularly good at seeing stuff ... and that includes these two species,\" she said. She added that the two species might cooperate \"to some extent in building the web \u2026 but I think it's highly unlikely that they cooperate in anything else like prey capture, in brood care, or looking after each other's babies.\"",
      "Grinsted draws parallels between the cohabiting spiders and how humans tend to coexist in apartment blocks.",
      "\"You're very happy to share the stairs, the lift,\" she said. \"But if anybody comes into your living room and you haven't invited them, you'll be aggressive towards them.\"",
      "She added that while many spiders are \"typically solitary, very aggressive\" toward other critters, the cohabitation of two species is \"relatively common\" once spiders have evolved the ability to live in groups.",
      "\"But again, because these two species have never been found to live together and never been found to live in groups, it makes it particularly exciting,\" she said.",
      "\"The web is dense \u2014 like a blanket\"",
      "Blerina Vrenozi, a biologist and zoologist at the University of Tirana, in Albania, who co-authored the research paper, told the AP that the expeditions this year helped understand \"how this mystery existed in there.\"",
      "\"The DNA is interesting because they revealed that the species which live inside the cave is different from the one which lives outside the cave,\" she said. \"So it's the same species, but different DNA.\"",
      "The cave colony's giant web was first observed in 2021 by a team of Czech speleologists led by Marek Audy. A year later, the Czech team expanded to include scientists from multiple universities, which led to the recently published scientific paper.",
      "\"The web is dense; it's more like a blanket, and when there's danger, the female crawls back and hides, and no creature of a higher order can dig her out of there,\" Audy said. \"Spiders in the cave lay about a third of the eggs compared to spiders that live outdoors. Because it's certain that they will raise their offspring there \u2026 so they can afford to lay fewer eggs.\"",
      "Audy added that the cave, which is also home to large bat colonies, also thrive on the abundance of midges inside the humid, dark space. \"They are constantly having a party there, both the spiders and the bats,\" he said.",
      "Seemingly ideal environment",
      "The study noted that the methodology used might \"slightly overestimate\" the total population count of spiders in the colony, as some funnel webs may be abandoned or unoccupied. However, other experts agree that the team's exciting new research could offer broader evolutionary clues and deserves deeper study.",
      "Sara Goodacre, professor of evolutionary biology and genetics at the School of Life Sciences, at the U.K.'s University of Nottingham, says these kinds of research projects help pave the way for more studies that could prove \"fundamental to our understanding of what forces shape the world around us \u2014 spidery or not.\"",
      "\"Natural selection will favor the 'best' strategies \u2026 the 'winning strategy,' whatever this is,\" she said. \"My guess is that the benefits of being part of this community far outweigh the costs.\"",
      "She added that if the dynamics in the seemingly ideal environment of abundant food and relative safety were to change, \"then 'freeloading' will emerge and it will all break down.\"",
      "The politics of coexistence will hopefully not prove trickier above ground. Audy said that Albania has already asked which side the newly famous spiders lie.",
      "\"From a conservation point of view, we did something interesting there and marked out a border,\" he said. \"I just looked into it \u2014 and the spider web is on the Greek side.\"",
      "The discovery of the massive web comes just months after Australian scientists discovered a new species of the deadly funnel-web spider that is bigger and more venomous than its relatives, nicknaming it \"Big Boy.\"",

    "story": [
      "Singapore authorities charged an Australian man Friday for rushing film star Ariana Grande at the Asia premiere of \"Wicked: For Good.\"",
      "Grande and other stars were attending the opening night of the film at Universal Studios in Singapore when the man, identified by court papers as Johnson Wen, 26, jumped a barricade and rushed the actor.",
      "Wen was charged with \"being a public nuisance,\" Singapore court documents posted online showed. Wen represented himself and said he would plead guilty, according to the documents. He is to appear in court again on Monday.",
      "Viral video clips show the man wrapping around a shocked Grande before he jumps up and down and waves to the crowd. Grande's co-star Cynthia Erivo then rushes to her defense, jumping between Wen and Grande and shoving him away. He was then grabbed by security guards and put back over the barricade. Footage shows Erivo and others on the red carpet comforting Grande.",
      "After the incident, Wen shared video on Instagram and thanked Grande for \"letting (him) jump on the Yellow Carpet\" with her.",
      "If sentenced, Wen faces a $1,500 fine, three months in jail, or both.",
      "Singapore's public prosecutions office could not immediately be reached for comment.",
      "The movie launch went ahead on Thursday night. \"Wicked: For Good\" will be released in the United States on Nov. 21.",
      "Grande and Erivo have been inseparable during the movie musical's press tours. In December 2024, Erivo told \"CBS Mornings\" that the duo made a pact early in production to take care of and support each other.",
      "\"Before we started shooting both of us had a conversation about making sure that we would take care of each other and make the space that we needed for each other, and take, you know, give each other what we needed, be generous with each other in this thing, because we knew it was a big undertaking,\" Erivo said. \"We knew we had a big responsibility, but we knew neither of us could really do that alone.\"",
      "Grande, 32, began her career as a teen on Broadway before embarking on a hugely successful pop career. At perhaps the height of her meteoric pop fame in 2017, one of her concerts was bombed. The Manchester Arena attack killed 22 people, wounded more than 1,000 and left Grande with PTSD.",

    "story": [
      "Luis Rubiales was pelted by eggs thrown by his own uncle when the former head of Spain's soccer federation was presenting a memoir late Thursday relating his downfall after kissing a player at the 2023 Women's World Cup.",
      "Rubiales was seated on a stool on a low stage when he jumped up and spun quickly trying to avoid three eggs hurled his way. One impacted on the back of his dark jacket, and another splattered against a screen behind him as he charged into the small audience.",
      "\"A man entered who I later saw was my uncle, who is a troubled man, and always has been,\" Rubiales told reporters. \"He had some eggs and threw some at me, but I didn't know what he had in his hands, and when I first saw him I thought he might be carrying a weapon.\"",
      "Spanish media reported that the uncle was Luis Rub\u00e9n Rubiales, an actor who has appeared in several domestic television shows.",
      "Spanish police told The Associated Press they arrested the egg thrower. No motive was immediately given for the incident. A video shows a group of men in the audience grabbing the uncle immediately after he launched the eggs and escorting him away.",
      "Rubiales also had a falling out with another uncle, Juan Rubiales, several years ago when Juan was working for him at the federation.",
      "His book \"Matar a Rubiales\" (Killing Rubiales) is a 500-page version of his professional demise after kissing Spain forward Jenni Hermoso during the 2023 Women's World Cup awards ceremony. It was the first time Spain's women's team took home the title. \u00a0According to its publisher, Rubiales says he was the victim of a \"conspiracy of different powers of Spanish public life\" including the government and \"the profitable world of feminism.\"",
      "Rubiales has always denied he kissed Hermoso without her consent. After initially clinging to power amid a national uproar, he stepped down under immense pressure from the government, soccer officials, women players and fans.",
      "Earlier this year he was found guilty of sexual assault for the unsolicited kiss by a Spanish court. He was fined over $11,000 and ordered not to come within 650 feet of Hermoso or contact her for a year. Prosecutors had pushed for him to spend over two years in prison. Rubiales was acquitted of a separate charge that alleged he and other officials pressued Hermoso to support him in the aftermath of the kiss.",
      "Hermoso testified in court that Rubiales' actions \"tarnished\" what should have been \"one of the happiest days\" of her life.",
      "\"I'd spent years fighting to win titles for my team, like the World Cup,\" she said. \"But all that's happened to me means that I just haven't been able to enjoy any of it from the moment I set foot back in Madrid. I'm a world champion, but it seems that, even to this day, my life has been on standby. I honestly haven't been able to live freely.\"",
      "Rubiales, 48, is also under scrutiny by Spanish authorities probing his 2020 deal to move the Spanish Super Cup to Saudi Arabia.",

      "Iran did not immediately acknowledge the seizure, though it comes as Tehran has been increasingly warning it can strike back after facing a 12-day war in June with Israel that saw the U.S. strike Iranian nuclear sites.",
      "The ship, the Talara, had been traveling from Ajman, United Arab Emirates, to Singapore when Iranian forces intercepted it, said the U.S. defense official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters.",
      "The Reuters news agency cited the private British maritime risk management group Vanguard and other maritime security sources saying the Talara had been intercepted by forces with Iran's Revolutionary Guards (IRGC) and steered toward Iranian waters.",
      "A U.S. Navy MQ-4C Triton drone had been circling above the area where the Talara was for hours on Friday observing the seizure, flight-tracking data analyzed by The Associated Press showed.",
      "Another private security firm, Ambrey, told the AP the assault involved three small boats approaching the Talara.",
      "The British military's United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations center separately acknowledged the incident, saying a possible \"state activity\" had forced the Talara to turn into Iranian territorial waters.",
      "Cyprus-based Columbia Shipmanagement later said in a statement that it had \"lost contact\" with the tanker, which was carrying high sulphur gasoil.",
      "The company \"notified the relevant authorities and is working closely with all relevant parties \u2014   including maritime security agencies and the vessel owner \u2014   to restore contact with the vessel,\" the firm said. \"The safety of the crew remains our foremost priority.\"",
      "The U.S. Navy blamed Iran for a series of limpet mine attacks on vessels that damaged tankers in 2019, as well as for a fatal drone attack on an Israeli-linked oil tanker that killed two European crew members in 2021.",
      "Those attacks began after President Trump, during his first term in office, unilaterally withdrew the U.S. from the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and a number of world powers. The last major seizure came when Iran took two Greek tankers in May 2022 and held them until November of that year.",
      "Those attacks were largely subsumed by the Iranian-backed Houthis' assaults targeting ships during the , which drastically reduced shipping in the crucial Red Sea corridor.",
      "The years of tension between Iran and the West, coupled with the situation in the Gaza Strip, exploded into a full-scale 12-day war in June.",
      "Iran long has threatened to close off the Strait of Hormuz, the narrow mouth of the Persian Gulf through which 20% of all oil traded passes. The U.S. Navy has patrolled the Mideast through its Bahrain-based 5th Fleet to keep the waterways open.",

    "story": [
      "London \u2014 Adolf Hitler most likely suffered from a rare genetic condition called Kallmann Syndrome, researchers and documentary makers said Thursday, following DNA testing of the Nazi dictator's blood. According to the Cleveland Clinic, the syndrome can \"disrupt the process that drives puberty\" and manifest in symptoms that include undescended testicles and a micropenis.",
      "The research also quashes the suggestion that Hitler had Jewish ancestry, the researcher say.",
      "Popular World War II songs often mocked Hitler's anatomy but lacked any scientific basis. The findings by an international team of scientists and historians now appear to confirm longstanding suspicions around his sexual development.",
      "\"No one has ever really been able to explain why Hitler was so uncomfortable around women throughout his life, or why he probably never entered into intimate relations with women,\" said Alex Kay of the University of Potsdam. \"But now we know that he had Kallmann Syndrome, this could be the answer we've been looking for.\"",
      "The research findings are featured in a new documentary, \"Hitler's DNA: Blueprint of a Dictator,\" due to be broadcast on Saturday.",
      "The testing was made possible after researchers obtained a sample of Hitler's blood from a piece of material taken from the sofa on which he shot himself.",
      "The testing found a \"high likelihood\" that Hitler had Kallmann Syndrome, though Britain's Guardian newspaper said in a Thursday article critical of the upcoming documentary that, \"in their attempt to authenticate the blood,\" the research team \"failed to get a fresh DNA sample from any of Hitler's surviving relatives in Austria and the U.S., who are all understandably reluctant about media exposure.\"",
      "The testing of Hitler's DNA showed \"very high\" scores \u2014   in the top one percent \u2014   for a predisposition to autism, schizophrenia and biopolar disorder, program makers Blink Films said.",
      "The Guardian article, however, said that many scientists aren't comfortable using the kind of genetic testing cited by the researchers, known as \"polygenic risk scores,\" to indicate an individual's likelihood of developing such disorders.",
      "\"Polygenic risk scores tell you something about population at large, not about individuals,\" honorary professor David Curtis, at University College London's Genetics Institute, told the Guardian. \"If a test shows you to be in the upper percentile of polygenic risk, the actual risk of acquiring a condition may still be very low, even for conditions that are strongly influenced by genetic factors.\"",
      "The research team stressed that such conditions, even if Hitler did have them, also could not explain or excuse the Nazi leader's warmongering or racist policies.",
      "Over 50 million people are estimated to have died in World War II, including six million Jews were who were systematically murdered.",
      "Geneticist Turi King, known for identifying the remains of medieval king Richard III and who also worked on the project, said Hitler's genes put him in a category of people who were often sent to the gas chambers by the Nazis.",
      "\"Hitler's policies are completely around eugenics,\" said the expert in ancient and forensic DNA at the University of Bath in western England.",
      "\"If he had been able to look at his own DNA ... he almost certainly would have sent himself,\" she said.",

      "Google said the messages are part of a criminal network called \"Lighthouse.\" The texts look legitimate, often warning recipients of a \"stuck package\" or an \"unpaid toll,\" but they're actually phishing or what's called smishing \u2014 a type of phishing scam that uses text messages to try to trick recipients into revealing personal and sensitive information, such as passwords and credit card numbers, which are then stolen.",
      "\"These scammers ended up compromising anywhere from 15 [million] to 100 million potential credit cards within the U.S. and impacted, at our current estimates, over a million victims,\" Google's general counsel,   Halimah DeLaine Prado, told CBS News.",
      "DeLaine Prado said Google has filed what it calls a first-of-its-kind lawsuit under the RICO Act, which is typically used to take down organized crime rings.",
      "The case targets unknown operators \u2014 listed as John Does 1 through 25 \u2014 who allegedly built a \"phishing-as-a-service\" platform to power mass text attacks.",

      "Google said it found more than 100 fake sites using its logo to trick people into handing over passwords or credit card numbers. According to its complaint, it estimates the group has stolen sensitive information linked to tens of millions of credit cards in the U.S. alone.",

      "As if deadly snakes, spiders\u00a0and sharks\u00a0were not enough, Australia now has a new creepy critter: a \"lucifer\" bee with devil-like horns.",
      "The species, dubbed Megachile (Hackeriapis) lucifer, was found in the state of Western Australia, Curtin University announced on Tuesday.",
      "Kit Prendergast at the university's School of Molecular and Life Sciences discovered the bee while surveying a critically endangered wildflower in 2019 and was immediately drawn to the insect's unique appearance.",
      "\"The female had these incredible little horns on her face,\" she said.",
      "A fan of the Netflix TV show \"Lucifer,\" she said the name was the perfect fit for the bee's distinctively devilish appearance.",
      "Prendergast said DNA barcoding confirmed the new species didn't match any known bees in DNA databases. She also said the specimens she retrieved did not match any in museum collections.",
      "\"It's the first new member of this bee group to be described in more than 20 years, which really shows how much life we still have to discover,\" Prendergast said.",
      "She added that she hopes the discovery will raise awareness about the number of undiscovered species that could still be out there, especially in areas threatened climate change and mining.",
      "\"Many mining companies still don't survey for native bees, so we may be missing undescribed species, including those that play crucial roles in supporting threatened plants and ecosystems,\" she said.",
      "\"Without knowing which native bees exist and what plants they depend on, we risk losing both before we even realize they're there.\"",
      "Almost all flowering plants depend on wild pollinators, particularly bees, but habitat loss and climate change are driving many vital species to the brink of extinction.",
      "Curtin University noted the publication of the research coincides with\u00a0Australian Pollinator Week, which highlights the crucial role bees in maintaining healthy ecosystems.",

    "story": [
      "U.N. climate negotiations get underway Monday at a meeting on the edge of the Brazilian Amazon, with leaders pushing for urgency, cooperation and acceleration after more than 30 years fighting to curb global warming by drastically reducing the carbon pollution that causes it.",
      "Andr\u00e9 Corr\u00eaa do Lago, president of this year's conference, known as COP30, emphasized that negotiators engage in \"mutir\u00e3o,\" a Brazilian word derived from an Indigenous word that refers to a group uniting to work on a shared task.",
      "\"Either we decide to change by choice, together, or we will be imposed change by tragedy,\" do Lago wrote in his letter to negotiators Sunday. \"We can change. But we must do it together.\"",
      "Complicating the calls for togetherness is the United States. The Trump administration did not send high-level negotiators to the talks and is withdrawing for the second time from the 10-year-old Paris Agreement, which is being celebrated as a partial achievement here in Belem.",
      "The United States has put more heat-trapping carbon dioxide into the air from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas than any other country. China is the No. 1 carbon polluter now, but because carbon dioxide stays in the air for at least a century, more of it was made in the U.S.",
      "\"I think the environment we are in, the geopolitical landscape, is particularly challenging,\" said Palau Ambassador Ilana Seid, who chairs the Alliance of Small Island States. Small island nations suffer some of the worst effects of climate change because rising seas swallow land. \"The United States withdrawing from the Paris Agreement has really shifted the gravity'' of the whole negotiating system.",
      "President Trump's actions damage the fight against climate change, former U.S. Special Envoy for Climate Todd Stern said.",
      "\"It's a good thing that they are not sending anyone. It wasn't going to be constructive if they did,\" he said.",
      "A report out earlier this year from the World Meteorological Organization warned that climate change is accelerating, with some impacts now irreversible for centuries. The\u00a0State of the Global Climate report\u00a0confirmed global temperatures, greenhouse gas emissions and sea levels all reached record highs in 2024.",
      "In a mission statement published ahead of COP30, organizers wrote, \"We have made progress, but not enough. Climate change is no longer a threat of the future. It is a tragedy of the present.\"",
      "\"We need to accelerate the fight against global warming and strengthen multilateralism in combating climate change,\" they said, noting that \"climate change has increased the exposure of the poorest to natural disasters.\"",
      "In a letter to negotiators released late Sunday, Simon Stiell, the U.N. climate chief, said the 10-year-old Paris Agreement is working to a degree, \"but we must accelerate in the Amazon. Devastating climate damages are happening already, from Hurricane Melissa hitting the Caribbean, Super Typhoons smashing Vietnam and the Philippines, to a tornado ripping through Southern Brazil.\"",
      "Not only must nations do more faster but they \"must connect climate action to people's real lives,\" Stiell wrote.",
      "The Nature Conservancy chief scientist Katharine Hayhoe compared the multinational negotiations to a potluck dinner.",
      "\"Everybody brings the contributions that they are making,\" which in this instance are new and strengthened plans to cut carbon pollution, Hayhoe said. \"And it's obvious who took the time to bake the fresh pie with fruit that they picked and who fished out that year old chicken frozen chicken nuggets from the back of their freezer.\"",
      "\"The United States as a country will not be showing up with a dish,\" Hayhoe said. However, she and several others including former lead American negotiators are pointing to U.S. cities, states and businesses that they said will take up the slack.",

      "\"Home Alone\" is turning 35 this year.",
      "The classic Christmas movie premiered in November 1990 and became an immediate hit, launching its star, Macaulay Culkin, into greater levels of fame.",

      "\"Home Alone\" is celebrating its 35th anniversary this year. (Courtesy: Everett Collection)",
      "It was always Macaulay",
      "Macaulay Culkin was already making a name for himself before starring as Kevin McCallister in \"Home Alone,\" but the 1990 movie made him a household name.",
      "The film's screenwriter, John Hughes, wrote the movie with Culkin in mind. The two worked together on an earlier film, 1989's \"Uncle Buck,\" and Hughes was impressed by Culkin's acting chops.",
      "John Hughes wrote the script with Macaulay Culkin in mind. (Vinnie Zuffante/Getty Images)",
      "\"John was such a respectful guy as far as the directors he worked with, and I remember him saying \u2014 based on\u00a0'Uncle Buck'\u2014 [that] Macaulay would be great for this,\" director Chris Columbus told Entertainment Weekly in November 2015. \"But I think it\u2019s just directorial responsibility [that] I should meet other kids.\"",
      "Columbus recalled meeting with \"hundreds and hundreds of kids\" and watching just as many audition tapes before meeting with Culkin. Following his audition, Columbus was convinced, saying he liked him because he wasn't like \"one of these Hollywood-perfect kids,\" adding that \"he was really funny.\"",
      "Scream heard around the world",
      "Culkin improvised keeping his hands on his face as he yelled in the movie. (Ron Galella, Ltd./Ron Galella Collection via Getty Images)",
      "One of the most iconic scenes in the movie almost didn't happen.",
      "When speaking with Entertainment Weekly, Columbus provided insight on the famous scene in which Culkin's character puts his hands on his cheeks and screams out in pain after applying aftershave.",
      "\"That was not written the way Macaulay performed it,\" Columbus explained. \"I thought he was going to slap on the cologne and move his hands and scream. But on the first take, he slapped his face and kept his hands glued to his face as if he had just put superglue on his face, and his hands stayed completely still as he screamed like the Edvard Munch painting. That\u2019s why he was such an interesting kid: No one else would have done that.\"",
      "The director loved the moment so much, it ended up being the expression on Kevin's face on the movie poster.",
      "Most famous fake movie",
      "The film Culkin is watching in the movie was made for \"Home Alone.\" (Barry King/WireImage)",
      "When left to his own devices, Kevin sits down in front of the TV with a big bowl of ice cream and starts watching a gangster movie called \"Angels with Filthy Souls.\"",
      "\"Guys, I\u2019m eating junk and watching rubbish! You better come out and stop me!\" he yells out, knowing there is no one there to get in the way of his fun.",
      "The film-within-a-film \u2013 which includes the memorable line \"Keep the change, ya filthy animal\" \u2013 has become legendary, but the movie itself is not real and was only filmed for the purposes of \"Home Alone.\"",
      "The clip was filmed the day before filming on \"Home Alone\" began, and was based off of the 1938 James Cagney film \"Angels with Dirty Faces.\"",
      "\"I believe the title was decided upon only because we needed to create a label for the tape Kevin puts in the VHS player,\" art director Dan Webster told Vanity Fair in December 2015. \"Now that is a very old-fashioned sentence!\"",
      "Buzz's girlfriend",
      "Buzz's girlfirend in the film is the art director's son dressed as a girl. (John Parra/Getty Images for STXfilms / Alexander Wang)",
      "The adults behind the scenes of the film didn't want to hurt anyone's feelings for the sake of a joke.",
      "In one of the scenes, Kevin takes advantage of being alone in the house and starts rummaging through his big brother Buzz's belongings. In doing so, he finds a picture of Buzz's girlfriend, and after seeing the photo says, \"Buzz, your girlfriend \u2026 woof!\"",
      "In a 2013 interview with Yahoo, the actor who played Buzz, Devin Ratray, revealed the picture was not of a real young girl.",
      "\"They decided it would be unkind to put a girl in that role of just being funny-looking,\" Ratray said. \"The art director had a son who was more than willing to volunteer for the part. I think if he had known it would become the highest-grossing family comedy of all time, he might have had second thoughts about it.\"",
      "Box office gold",
      "The film set records at the box office. (Maximum Film/Alamy; Sarah Crowley)",
      "The movie wasn't only a career boost for Culkin, but was a huge success for everyone involved.",
      "Debuting in November 1990, the film held the number one spot for the remainder of the year and into the next, for a total of 12 weeks on top.",
      "It then remained in theaters until late into the summer of 1991, staying in the top 10 until June of that year. Its success in theaters was reflected in the box office numbers, as the film grossed $285.7 million domestically and over $470 million worldwide.",
      "The movie would become the highest-grossing film of 1990 and one of the highest grossing live-action comedies ever. It held the record for 27 years until \"Never Say Die\" broke it in 2017, according to Time.",
      "Method acting",
      "Pesci actually bit Culkin when rehearsing for one of the scenes. (The Everett Collection)",
      "Joe Pesci portrayed one of the two burglars who were terrorized by Kevin when they attempted to break into his house.",
      "When rehearsing for one of the scenes, it seems Pesci got a bit too in character and left a permanent mark on Culkin.",
      "\"In the first\u00a0'Home Alone,'\u00a0they hung me up on a coat hook, and Pesci says, \u2018I\u2019m gonna bite all your fingers off, one at a time,\u2019\" Culkin told Rule Forty Two in 2004. \"And during one of the rehearsals, he bit me, and it broke the skin.\"",
      "He told the outlet he still has a scar on his finger from the on-set accident.",
      "Movie swap",
      "The director almost made \"Christmas Vacation,\" but quit because of Chevy Chase. (Warner Bros.)",
      "The movie's director almost worked on another classic Christmas movie, but his issues with the film's star led him to \"Home Alone.\"",
      "Columbus was first approached by Hughes to direct \"Christmas Vacation,\" and after directing a series of flops, Columbus was quick to accept the offer, but backed out after meeting the film's star, Chevy Chase, saying, \"I realized I couldn't work with the guy.\"",
      "\"First of all, he's not engaged. He's treating me like s---. I don't need this. I'd rather not work again,\" he told Variety in December 2024. \"I quit 'Christmas Vacation.' The next weekend, I got another script from John \u2013 and it's 'Home Alone.' 'Home Alone' for me was even more personal, a better script, and I thought, I can really do something with this, and I don't have to deal with Chevy Chase.\"",

      "When working with a comedy legend, a little improvisation is expected, and working with John Candy was no different, according to Columbus.",
      "\"John took those scenes and ran with them,\" Columbus told Entertainment Weekly. \"We\u2019d do a couple scripted takes and then we would improvise about four or five other takes, and a lot of the improvisation ended up in the film. Whereas something like the church scene was like doing a play \u2014 we did it exactly as John had written it.\"",
      "The filmmakers were lucky to even be able to have Candy in the film, as due to his busy schedule, they only had 24 hours to film his scenes. In that time, the comedian improvised many scenes.",

      "In a 2019 episode of the documentary series \"The Movies That Made Us,\" Stern explained the shooting schedule was changed from six weeks to eight weeks, but there was no pay increase for the additional two weeks.",
      "After Stern walked away, they replaced him with Daniel Roebuck. However, after a few days of rehearsal, Columbus decided he wasn't right for the part. After offering Stern the part a second time, the actor agreed, and the rest is history.",

      "\"Many men skip meals, eat too quickly and rely on convenience foods stripped of minerals and fiber,\" Gioffre said.",

      "Biggest food culprits",
      "When it comes to ultraprocessed foods, Gioffre called out three specific components that worsen acid reflux: refined salt, sugar and seed oils.",
      "\"Together, they inflame the gut and weaken both digestion and the lower esophageal sphincter, the valve that keeps acid in the stomach where it belongs,\" he said.",
      "\"Men need to slow down, eat foods that support digestion and strengthen the gut, and stop relying on quick fixes.\"",
      "Men also tend to drink more coffee than women, often two to three cups a day, usually on an empty stomach, Gioffre pointed out.",

      "Biological differences",

      "\"Men produce less protective mucus and saliva \u2014 the body\u2019s natural defense system that buffers acid when it backflows into the esophagus. So when acid reflux strikes, it hits harder,\" he said.",
      "Some examples of alkaline-rich foods include leafy greens, vegetables, fruits, nuts and seeds, and mineral water or spring water. (iStock)",
      "\"That acid burns and erodes tissue that was never designed to handle acid in the first place, setting the stage for inflammation, damage and long-term complications.\"",

      "Hormones also play a role.",
      "\"Estrogen in women appears to protect the esophagus by improving blood flow and mucosal repair, protection men have much less of,\" the doctor said. \"Without lower levels than women, their tissue where reflux hits doesn\u2019t recover as quickly from repeated acid exposure.\"",

      "Gioffre recommends that men take the following simple steps to immediately begin lowering their risk.",
      "\"One of the biggest and most overlooked causes of acid reflux is eating too close to bedtime,\" Gioffre said. \"When you lie down after a meal, gravity is no longer helping to keep acid in your stomach where it belongs, so it\u2019s much easier for it to travel up the wrong way into your esophagus.\"",
      "Reflux symptoms often get worse at night, the doctor noted \u2014 \"and it\u2019s why so many men wake up coughing, choking or with a burning throat, hoarse voice or sour taste in their mouth.\" (iStock)",
      "This is why reflux symptoms often get worse at night, he noted \u2014 \"and it\u2019s why so many men wake up coughing, choking or with a burning throat, hoarse voice or sour taste in their mouth.\"",
      "Gioffre said it\u2019s best to stop eating three hours before bed, which gives the body time to fully digest, empty the stomach and drop acid levels before lying down.",
      "Common triggers include garlic, onions, spicy foods, alcohol, chocolate, caffeine, citrus fruits and carbonated water, according to Gioffre.",
      "CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "\"All of these weaken the lower esophageal sphincter, the valve that keeps stomach acid where it belongs,\" he said. \"Once that muscle relaxes, acid flows upward, causing heartburn by inflaming and irritating the esophageal and throat lining.\"",
      "\"If you want to heal reflux naturally, you can\u2019t just change what you eat \u2014 you have to change how you live.\"",
      "The doctor also recommends adding back alkaline minerals, digestive enzymes and a high-quality probiotic. Some examples of alkaline-rich foods include leafy greens, vegetables, fruits, nuts and seeds, and mineral water or spring water.",

      "\"These activate your parasympathetic \u2018rest-and-digest\u2019 system, calm your gut and keep acid levels in check naturally,\" Gioffre said. \"Get outside and move after meals, and swap your late-night snack for deep breathing or stretching.\"",
      "When men don\u2019t sleep well, the body produces more cortisol, which is the main stress hormone.",
      "\"High cortisol keeps you locked in a constant state of fight-or-flight, and when you\u2019re in that mode, your body isn\u2019t focused on rest, digest or repair \u2014 it\u2019s focused on survival,\" Gioffre said.",
      "TEST YOURSELF WITH OUR LATEST LIFESTYLE QUIZ",
      "In this state, blood flow is pulled away from the gut and sent to the muscles and brain, he noted, which means digestion slows down, stomach acid production drops and food sits in the stomach for too long, which leads to bloating, gas and more reflux.",

      "Meanwhile, China\u2019s third aircraft carrier, the Fujian, was commissioned this fall \u2013 the first with electromagnetic catapults similar to U.S. Ford-class carriers. The move signals Beijing\u2019s ambition to launch stealth jets from sea and project power well beyond its coast.",

      "Security expert Xavier Mertens first spotted the campaign, confirming that the same kind of scheme was seen earlier this year. According to BleepingComputer, these fake TikTok videos show short PowerShell commands and instruct viewers to run them as administrators to \"activate\" or \"fix\" their programs.",

      "But instead of activating anything, the PowerShell command connects to a remote domain named slmgr[.]win, which downloads harmful executables from Cloudflare-hosted pages. The main file, updater.exe, is a variant of the Aura Stealer malware. Once inside the system, it hunts for your credentials and sends them back to the attacker.",

      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.",
      "In-vitro fertilization (IVF) can take a serious toll on families, not only emotionally but financially, especially when every cycle comes with new bills and no clear sense of what the full journey might cost. Gaia Family aims to change that by removing the guesswork around pricing with a blend of tech and AI-driven forecasting.",
      "Instead of worrying about unpredictable costs, couples pay a fixed upfront price or monthly installments that cover their planned IVF treatment, medications, embryo transfers and built-in protections if cycles or transfers aren't successful. It gives families a clearer path forward and support that lasts through the entire process.",

      "Artificial intelligence is giving hopeful parents more clarity about their chances over multiple IVF cycles, helping them plan their journey with clearer expectations instead of guesswork. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How Gaia Family was born",
      "Gaia Family was founded by Nader AlSalim, a former Goldman Sachs executive who knew the IVF struggle firsthand. After spending over $50,000 across five IVF rounds in multiple countries, he and his wife finally had a son. The experience left him frustrated by how little clarity the system offered and how emotionally draining the process could be.",
      "He saw that most fertility systems were built around procedures, not people. His goal with Gaia Family was to build something different, a program that uses data to empower families instead of leaving them to navigate uncertainty and mounting debt. That personal experience became the foundation of Gaia Family's mission to bring agency, transparency and compassion to fertility care.",

      "Gaia Family gives families one fixed IVF price with built-in protection and full support every step of the way. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",

      "Choose your clinic:\u00a0Gaia partners with more than 100 fertility clinics across the U.S.Get your personalized quote: Your doctor designs your treatment plan, and Gaia uses it to calculate your fixed cost upfront.Start with confidence:\u00a0Pay monthly or upfront, then begin treatment knowing all your major expenses are covered.",

      "Get your personalized quote: Your doctor designs your treatment plan, and Gaia uses it to calculate your fixed cost upfront.",
      "Start with confidence:\u00a0Pay monthly or upfront, then begin treatment knowing all your major expenses are covered.",
      "If a cycle doesn't result in viable embryos, Gaia's built-in protection covers another attempt, helping families try again without financial shock. Once you have viable embryos, your Gaia Plan allows you unlimited frozen embryo transfers (usually $5,000 each) at no extra cost until you have a baby. And, if none of those transfers result in a live birth, then Gaia will give you money toward another cycle. Plus, you have the option of including all of your PGT-A testing and your medication for a fixed cost, so you have even more protection throughout your journey. AlSalim, tells CyberGuy the company's mission goes beyond technology.",
      "\"At Gaia Family, we're using AI not to replace the human element of fertility care, but to bring more confidence to it,\" AlSalim said. \"Fertility treatment can feel like a game of chance \u2014 our technology helps turn it into a guided, informed journey. By analyzing millions of data points, we can forecast the most effective and affordable pathway for each individual, so patients can make decisions grounded in data rather than uncertainty. Ultimately, it's about giving hopeful parents more agency, transparency and peace of mind in one of the most emotional experiences of their lives.\"",
      "SKIN DNA BREAKTHROUGH COULD LET 60-YEAR-OLD WOMEN HAVE GENETICALLY RELATED KIDS",
      "For many couples, this combination of data and compassion is transforming uncertainty into confidence and renewed hope. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why Gaia Family's model matters",
      "IVF in the United States can cost as much as $30,000 per cycle, and most couples need several tries. Each failed attempt adds more bills and stress. Gaia Family's fixed-cost model gives families financial predictability while keeping them emotionally supported. It also encourages clinics to focus on outcomes rather than repeated treatments.",
      "This approach is transforming how people view fertility care. Instead of relying on luck, families can benefit from AI insights to make better decisions. While it may not lower the medical costs yet, it changes how couples experience one of life's most emotional challenges, turning fear into informed planning and despair into hope. Gaia removes the spiraling costs, making couples' outcomes so much more cost-efficient.",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you are thinking about IVF or egg freezing, Gaia Family's model could make your path more manageable. It provides upfront transparency about costs, protection against financial loss and a data-driven forecast of success. It helps you make decisions based on evidence rather than guesswork.",
      "Still, while AI can analyze data patterns, it cannot alter biology. Factors like age, health and genetics continue to shape outcomes. Even so, Gaia Family's system gives couples a sense of control that traditional fertility care rarely provides by serving everyone, with no eligibility criteria in terms of age or health factors. Knowing that your finances are protected can ease stress and allow you to focus on what matters most: building your family.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",

      "The proposal amends Title 75 of the Pennsylvania Consolidated Statutes, creating a new legal category for roadable aircraft. These vehicles would have the unique ability to operate both on public roads as motor vehicles and in the air as aircraft.",
      "The legislation was referred to the Senate Transportation Committee Nov. 5, 2025. Although a similar version failed to pass last session, Flynn remains committed to positioning Pennsylvania as a leader in advanced transportation technology. He believes that laying the groundwork now will allow the state to adapt quickly when these vehicles become commercially viable.",

      "Several companies, including\u00a0Alef Aeronautics,\u00a0Samson Sky and\u00a0CycloTech are developing vehicles that can take off vertically or transform from cars to small aircraft within minutes.",
      "Some states are already laying the groundwork for this new era. Minnesota and New Hampshire have passed legislation formally recognizing \"roadable aircraft,\" making them the first states to treat flying cars as both vehicles and aircraft under state law. Pennsylvania now hopes to follow their lead with its own version through Sen. Marty Flynn's Jetsons Act.",
      "At the same time, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has begun approving real-world tests. In 2023, the FAA granted a special airworthiness certificate to SpaceX-backed Alef Aeronautics for its Model A prototype, allowing it to operate on roads and in the air for research and development. That approval marked the first time a flying car received official clearance for combined ground and flight testing in the United States.",
      "Sen. Flynn wants Pennsylvania to be part of this growing national conversation. In his co-sponsorship memo, he explained that proactive legislation will help the state prepare for the next wave of innovation.",
      "WOULD YOU BUY THE WORLD'S FIRST PERSONAL ROBOCAR?",
      "The Alef flying car is made of ultra-light material, allowing it to fly and travel on roads. (Alef Aeronautics)",
      "How the Jetsons Act would work",
      "Under Senate Bill 1077, Pennsylvania would officially define a \"roadable aircraft\" as a hybrid vehicle capable of both driving and flying. These vehicles would need to register with the state, display a unique registration plate and meet standard inspection requirements. When operated on highways or city streets, they would be subject to the same rules as other vehicles. When used in flight, they would remain under federal aviation oversight.",
      "The bill also clarifies how drivers and pilots must transition between ground and air operations safely. It allows take-offs and landings only in approved areas, except during emergencies. Flynn emphasizes that clear definitions and consistent oversight will prevent confusion for both motorists and law enforcement. He hopes this clarity will also encourage manufacturers to consider Pennsylvania a test site for future flying car technologies.",

      "What this means for you",
      "If you live in Pennsylvania, this bill could one day change how you think about personal transportation. While flying cars remain in development, legislation like this sets the stage for their eventual arrival. Drivers may one day register, inspect and insure a flying car just like a regular vehicle. Pilots could use the same roadways to reach take-off zones before switching to flight mode.",
      "Even for residents who never plan to own a flying car, the ripple effects could be significant. New rules may influence local zoning, airspace management and infrastructure planning. Communities might see new vertiports or designated landing pads as part of urban development. Insurance companies and safety regulators will need to rethink how they handle this new class of hybrid travel.",
      "The bill also signals a broader change in how states approach innovation. Rather than waiting for federal action, Pennsylvania wants to establish a framework that welcomes new technologies while protecting public safety.",

As autonomous vehicles, drones and hybrid aircraft evolve, state governments must adapt to keep up. This legislation shows Pennsylvania's willingness to lead rather than follow. While it may take years before you see a flying car parked in your driveway, the groundwork is already being laid.

Protecting yourself means slowing down, verifying every detail and strengthening your digital defenses. Here is how you can stay safe.",
      "The phone number or link in the message connects you directly to scammers, so don't click or call.\u00a0 Once you engage, they can pressure you into sharing personal details or even install harmful software on your device. The moment I saw that \"Payment order settled\" email, I realized something was off because I don't even have a Geek Squad account. That alone was a major red flag. If you ever get a message about a service you never signed up for, delete it right away. Instead of calling the number in the message, go to the official Best Buy or Geek Squad website to confirm if there is a real issue with your account. Also, sign up for strong antivirus software. Antivirus software acts as your digital guard. It scans downloads, detects malicious links and warns you before dangerous sites load. Choose a trusted program that updates automatically and includes email protection features. This extra layer of defense can prevent malware from taking hold if you accidentally click something suspicious.",

      "Scammers often use email addresses that look real but have slight differences, such as extra numbers, misspelled words, or unusual domains. A genuine Geek Squad or Best Buy email will come from @bestbuy.com. Always hover over the sender's name to see the actual address before responding.",
      "If someone contacts you claiming to be from Geek Squad or Best Buy, stay calm and skeptical. Real companies do not ask for banking details, gift card payments, or remote access to your computer over the phone. Hang up and contact the company directly through its verified website or customer service number.",
      "Many scams start with stolen or leaked personal data. A data removal service can help delete your information from data broker sites that sell contact lists to marketers and scammers. Reducing your digital footprint makes it harder for criminals to target you with fake invoices or phishing emails.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Even with precautions, it is smart to monitor your accounts. Check your bank and credit card activity weekly for any charges you do not recognize. If you see something suspicious, contact your financial institution right away to report and dispute the charge.",
      "Two-factor authentication adds another barrier between you and scammers. Even if someone steals your password, they cannot log in without the secondary code sent to your phone or authentication app. Turn on 2FA for your email, online shopping and banking accounts.",
      "Weak or repeated passwords make you an easy target. Create long, unique passwords for each account. A password manager can securely store them and generate complex combinations that are hard to guess or crack.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Old software is one of the easiest ways for hackers to slip in. Keep your operating system, browser and security programs updated. Turn on automatic updates so you do not have to think about it. These patches often close known security holes that scammers exploit.",
      "Before reacting to any invoice or payment alert, go straight to the official account or service mentioned, such as Geek Squad, PayPal, Amazon or your bank. Log in directly through their website or app to verify the details. If nothing shows up there, the email is a scam. This quick step can save you from a costly mistake.",
      "Reporting suspicious emails helps stop scammers from targeting others. Most email services, including Gmail, Outlook and Yahoo, allow you to mark messages as phishing. You can also forward the email to reportphishing@apwg.org, which goes to the Anti-Phishing Working Group (APWG), or to abuse@bestbuy.com to alert the proper teams.",

      "Conduent, which manages critical public services across the United States, says hackers infiltrated its systems for nearly three months. The cyberattack exposed personal information linked to more than 10 million people.",
      "All about the Conduent breach and its scale",
      "Conduent discovered the intrusion in January 2025 and said hackers had infiltrated its network as early as Oct. 21, 2024. During this period, attackers reportedly stole large amounts of data linked to state-level programs such as Medicaid, child support, food assistance and toll systems. Conduent claims that its investigation found no ongoing malicious activity and said operations were safely restored after the breach was contained.",
      "Conduent manages technology and payment systems for dozens of U.S. state governments, processing roughly $85 billion in annual disbursements and handling over 2 billion customer service interactions every year. According to its own estimates, it supports around 100 million residents through various government health and welfare programs.",

      "The company reported that at least 400,000 people in Texas were affected, with compromised data including Social Security numbers, medical records and health insurance details. Other affected states include Washington, South Carolina, New Hampshire, Maine, Oregon, Massachusetts and California.

      "How the Conduent breach unfolded",
      "In January, Conduent described the event as an \"operational disruption caused by a third-party compromise.\" The breach led to several days of downtime, disrupting vital services in multiple states. In Wisconsin, for instance, parents and beneficiaries were unable to process payments due to system outages, leaving many struggling to meet obligations related to child support and welfare programs.",
      "The SafePay ransomware group later claimed responsibility for the attack, alleging it had stolen 8.5 terabytes of data. Conduent confirmed in a Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing that hackers had indeed exfiltrated files belonging to a limited number of clients. The company says it hired cybersecurity experts to analyze the stolen data and recently confirmed that it contained significant amounts of personal information from end-users across multiple programs.",
      "Despite the massive theft, Conduent said there is currently no evidence that the stolen data has been published online or on dark web marketplaces.",
      "HACKERS TARGET ONLINE STORES WITH NEW ATTACK",
      "We reached out to Conduent for a comment, and a rep for the company provided CyberGuy with the following statement:",

At this time, Conduent has no evidence of any attempted or actual misuse of any information potentially affected by this incident.",
      "\"Upon discovery of the incident, Conduent acted quickly to secure its networks, restore its systems and operations, notify law enforcement and conduct an investigation with the assistance of third-party forensics experts. In addition, given the nature and complexity of the data involved, Conduent has been working diligently with a dedicated review team, including internal and external experts, to conduct a detailed analysis of the affected files to identify the personal information contained therein, which was a time-intensive process. Conduent takes this matter seriously and regrets any inconvenience this incident may have caused.\"",

Data exfiltration on this scale has long-term implications, from identity theft to potential fraud within public benefit systems. The real test will be how both Conduent and its government partners adapt their cybersecurity oversight to prevent similar breaches. Because at this point, the question isn't whether these systems will be targeted again, but whether they'll be any better prepared when it happens.",

    "summary": "Texas startup Janta Power raises $5.5M for innovative vertical solar towers that generate 50% more energy than traditional panels while using just one-third the land.",
    "story": [
      "As AI data centers use more electricity, the solar industry is ramping up to provide more power.",
      "Texas startup Janta Power has secured $5.5 million in seed funding to expand its next-generation solar power towers, a vertical alternative to flat solar farms. The funding round was led by MaC Venture Capital with support from Collab Capital. The investment shows strong confidence in 3D solar systems that can reshape renewable energy worldwide.",
      "Why flat solar panels are no longer enough",
      "Traditional solar panels cover large flat areas on rooftops or open fields. This approach uses a lot of land and misses much of the day's available sunlight. The sun moves across the sky, but flat panels capture energy best only when it is directly overhead.",
      "Janta Power takes a different approach. The company's pivoting solar towers stack panels vertically to create a compact three-dimensional structure that captures more sunlight throughout the day. Think of it as the solar version of a skyscraper: more power from less ground space.",
      "Janta Power\u2019s 3D solar towers capture more sunlight throughout the day while using just a third of the land. (Janta Power)",
      "NEVER NEED AN EV CHARGING STATION AGAIN WITH THESE ROOFTOP SOLAR POWER PANELS",
      "How Janta's solar towers work",
      "Each tower uses smart tracking software that follows the sun's path from sunrise to sunset. By adjusting its position throughout the day, the system collects more sunlight than traditional fixed panels. This design allows the towers to produce about 50% more energy while using only one-third of the land required by flat-panel systems.",

      "Because of their vertical orientation, the towers can capture sunlight during early morning and late afternoon when flat arrays are least efficient. The result is a steadier flow of electricity across the entire day, reducing stress on power grids and lowering the need for short-term backup plants.",
      "Stronger, smarter and more efficient",
      "Janta's towers are also built for strength. Each structure can withstand winds up to 170 miles per hour. The towers feature durable steel frames and modular foundations that simplify installation in a wide range of environments.",
      "Pilot programs are already operating at Munich International Airport, Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport and facilities managed by Aena, which oversees more than 70 airports worldwide.",
      "A game-changer for energy economics",
      "The company's 3D geometry gives each site a capacity factor of around 32%, compared to roughly 22% for flat panels. This greater efficiency lowers the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) to about $0.05 per kilowatt-hour, well below the global average of $0.15.",
      "That advantage can make renewable power more accessible for industries such as data centers, universities and telecom operations that need reliable and consistent energy.",
      "Built to endure 170 mph winds, Janta\u2019s modular towers are already powering airports in Munich, Dallas\u2013Fort Worth, and across Aena\u2019s global network. (Shelby Tauber/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "CHINESE-MADE SOLAR PANELS USED ON AMERICAN FARMS PUTS US POWER GRID AT RISK: FORMER NSA OFFICIAL",
      "What this means for you",
      "For businesses and communities, Janta Power's technology could mean smaller solar installations that deliver more energy for less money. Because the towers need less land, they can fit into urban areas, airports or industrial zones that could not host traditional solar farms.",
      "For everyday consumers, these innovations can bring cleaner, more stable and more affordable power to local grids while supporting a greener energy future.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",

    "story": [
      "CyberGuy explains how to make safe and secure passwords on your iPhone.",
      "Your Mac holds a lot more than just files. It carries your personal information, payment data, messages and every online account you access. Keeping that information safe starts with how you sign in. For years, passwords have been the standard way to protect accounts, but they are also one of the weakest links in digital security. They can be guessed, stolen or reused across multiple sites.",
      "Apple's introduction of passkeys marks a major step forward. Instead of relying on something you need to remember, passkeys rely on something you have (your trusted Apple device) and something you are, like your fingerprint or face. Together with iCloud Keychain and two-factor authentication, passkeys create a seamless and much safer way to secure your Mac and your digital life.",
      "What are passkeys?",
      "Passkeys are a modern alternative to passwords. They use public key cryptography to let you sign in without ever creating or typing a password. When you register for an account using a passkey, your Mac creates two unique keys. One is public and stored by the website or app, and the other is private and stays securely on your device.",
      "The public key is not sensitive information. The private key, on the other hand, never leaves your Mac and is protected behind your device's security features. When you sign in, Touch ID or Face ID confirms your identity before your Mac uses the private key to authenticate you. This process prevents phishing and password leaks because no shared secret is ever transmitted to the website.",

      "HOW TO USE PASSKEYS TO KEEP YOUR COMPUTER SAFE",
      "A passkey on your Mac replaces passwords with a faster, more secure way to sign in. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How Apple keeps passkeys secure",
      "Passkeys are stored and synced across your devices through iCloud Keychain, which is protected by end-to-end encryption. This means that not even Apple can access your passkeys or passwords. iCloud Keychain also has built-in protection against brute force attacks, even if someone were to gain unauthorized access to Apple's servers.",
      "If you lose your devices, you can still recover your passkeys through iCloud Keychain recovery. To do this, you must sign in with your Apple ID and password, verify your identity with a code sent to your trusted number and confirm using your device passcode. The system limits the number of attempts, and if too many failed attempts occur, the recovery record is locked or destroyed to prevent misuse.",
      "You can also set an account recovery contact to make sure you never lose access, even if you forget your Apple ID password or device passcode. This multi-layered design ensures that your data remains secure even in extreme scenarios, such as a compromised Apple account or cloud breach.",
      "How to set up passkeys on your Mac",
      "Setting up passkeys is simple and requires iCloud Keychain to be enabled.",

      "Phishing remains one of the most common ways attackers try to steal personal information. They may send fake emails or messages pretending to be from Apple or other trusted companies, urging you to click links or provide login details. Always double-check the sender's address and avoid clicking on links that seem suspicious. Instead, visit the website directly by typing the address into your browser.",
      "While macOS has strong built-in defenses such as Gatekeeper and XProtect, installing strong antivirus software adds another layer of protection against malware, adware and potentially unwanted programs. Strong antivirus software continuously monitors your system for suspicious behavior and can alert you to threats before they cause damage. It is especially useful if you download files from outside the App Store or connect external drives frequently.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "Kids are spending more time online than ever, and that early exposure is opening the door to a new kind of danger.",
      "Artificial intelligence has supercharged online scams, creating personalized and convincing traps that even adults can fall for. The latest Bitwarden \"Cybersecurity Awareness Month 2025\" poll shows that while parents know these risks exist, most still haven't had a serious talk with their children about them.",
      "This growing communication gap is leaving the youngest internet users vulnerable at a time when online safety depends more than ever on education and oversight.",
      "Young children face real risks online",
      "Children as young as preschool age are now part of the connected world, yet few truly understand how to stay safe. The Bitwarden survey found that 42% of parents with children between 3 and 5 years old said their child had accidentally shared personal information online.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy ReportGet my best tech tips, urgent security alerts and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide \u2014 free when you join my\u00a0CYBERGUY.COM newsletter.",
      "5 PHONE SAFETY TIPS EVERY PARENT SHOULD KNOW",
      "AI-powered scams are finding new ways to reach kids who go online earlier than ever. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Nearly 80% of kids between the ages of 3 and 12 already have their own tablet or another connected device. Many parents assume supervision software or family settings are enough, but that assumption breaks down when kids explore apps, games and chat spaces designed to hold their attention. Device access has become nearly universal by early elementary school, but meaningful supervision and honest safety conversations are lagging behind.",
      "The AI threat and the parental disconnect",
      "Artificial intelligence has changed the nature of online scams by making them sound familiar, personal and hard to recognize. Bitwarden's data shows that 78% of parents worry their child could fall for an AI-enhanced threat, such as a voice-cloned message or a fake chat with a friend. Despite that fear, almost half of those same parents haven't talked with their kids about what an AI-powered scam might look like. The disconnect is even stronger among Gen Z parents.",
      "About 80% of them say they are afraid their child will fall victim to an AI-based scheme, yet 37% allow their kids full or nearly full autonomy online. In those households, problems are more common. Malware infections, unauthorized in-app purchases and phishing attempts appear at the highest rates among families who worry the most but monitor the least. The paradox is clear. Parents recognize the threat but fail to translate awareness into consistent action.",
      "Why parents haven't had the talk",
      "There are many reasons this important talk keeps getting delayed. Some parents simply feel unprepared to explain AI, while others assume their existing safety tools will protect their children. Only 17% of parents in the United States actively seek information about AI technologies, according to related research by Barna Group. That leaves a large majority relying on partial knowledge or outdated advice.",
      "Many parents also juggle multiple devices at home, making it difficult to track every app or game their child uses. Some overestimate how safe their own habits are, even though they admit to reusing passwords or skipping security updates. Without firsthand understanding or personal discipline, it becomes even harder to teach those lessons to children. As a result, many kids face the internet with curiosity but without proper guidance.",
      "Smart ways to protect your child online",
      "The Bitwarden findings make one thing clear: kids are getting connected younger, and scams powered by artificial intelligence are already targeting them. The good news is that parents can take practical steps right now to reduce those risks and build lasting online safety habits.",
      "Set up tablets, laptops and gaming consoles in shared family areas rather than bedrooms. When screens stay visible, you naturally become part of your child's online world. This not only encourages open conversation but also helps spot suspicious messages, fake friend requests or scam links before they cause trouble.",
      "Staying involved in your child\u2019s digital life is the best defense against today\u2019s AI threats. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Most devices have strong tools you can activate in minutes. Apple's Screen Time and Google Family Link let you limit screen time, approve new app installs and monitor how long your child spends on specific apps. These controls are especially useful for younger kids who, according to the Bitwarden poll, often have little supervision despite heavy device use.",
      "TEENS TURNING TO AI FOR LOVE AND COMFORT",
      "Before your child installs a new game or app, take a moment to check it together. Read the reviews, look at what data it collects and confirm the developer's name. Explain why some games or \"free\" apps might ask for camera or contact access they don't need. This kind of shared review teaches healthy skepticism and helps children recognize red flags later on.",
      "AI scams thrive on weak or reused passwords. Use a password manager to create and store strong, unique logins for each account.\u00a0Turn on\u00a0two-factor authentication (2FA) wherever possible so that even if a password is stolen, the account stays protected.\u00a0Let your kids see how you use these tools so they learn that security isn't complicated, it's just a habit.",
      "Many parents delay important online safety talks because they feel unprepared to explain AI, leaving kids curious but without the guidance they need to stay safe. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches.

      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "One of the best defenses is simple: encourage your child to pause and talk before reacting to anything unusual online.

      "Talking about online safety early helps build trust and awareness before trouble starts.\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you are a parent, guardian or anyone helping a child use technology, this issue deserves your attention. Start talking early, even before your child begins exploring the web on their own. Teach them simple concepts like asking before clicking or sharing. Instead of relying only on parental controls, have ongoing conversations that help them recognize suspicious links, messages or pop-ups. Show them that cybersecurity isn't about fear but about awareness. Model strong digital habits at home by using unique passwords and turning on\u00a0two-factor authentication. Explain why those steps matter. When your child understands the reasoning behind the rules, they are more likely to follow them. Make technology part of your family routine rather than a private space your child navigates alone. Regularly check the apps they use and the people they interact with. Set clear expectations and age-appropriate boundaries that can grow with your child's experience. Staying engaged is the most powerful protection you can offer.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "The numbers from Bitwarden show a clear warning sign. Concern among parents is high, yet actual conversations about AI-powered scams remain rare. That silence gives scammers the upper hand. Children who learn about online safety early are more confident, more cautious and better equipped to handle unexpected messages or fake alerts. It only takes a few minutes of honest conversation to create awareness that lasts for years. By taking action now, you can close the gap between fear and understanding, protecting your family in a digital world that changes every day.",

      "That might sound technical, but it's actually simple. \"eVTOL\" stands for electric vertical takeoff and landing. Think of a small, quiet aircraft that lifts off like a helicopter but flies forward like a plane, all powered by electric or hybrid engines instead of noisy fuel-burning ones.",
      "And a configurator? It's a tool that lets you design your own version online, choosing colors, materials and other personal details. Put the two together, and you've got something quite remarkable: the ability to design your own flying vehicle from your laptop.",

      "A new kind of personal aircraft",
      "AltoVolo's aircraft is called the Sigma, and it's unlike anything on the market. It's a three-seater hybrid-electric vehicle that combines quiet operation with long range. The Sigma can fly about 500 miles, reach speeds over 220 mph and is more than 80% quieter than a helicopter.",
      "That quietness isn't just about comfort; it's what makes urban air travel possible. Imagine small aircraft quietly taking off from rooftops or open fields, connecting cities and towns without the noise pollution we associate with helicopters today.",
      "Safety is built in, too. The Sigma can keep flying even if one of its small electric jet engines fails, and it carries a ballistic parachute for emergencies. It's compact and light, just under 16 feet wide and weighing a little over 2,100 pounds, making it easier to operate and store than you might expect.",
      "The Sigma is over 80% quieter than a helicopter combining sleek hybrid-electric power with quiet performance. (AltoVolo)",
      "From concept to customization",
      "The idea of customizing your own aircraft might sound futuristic, but AltoVolo's online configurator makes it surprisingly accessible.",
      "Like building your own car online, you can choose colors, seat materials, interior details and even the stitching on your seatbelts. Founder and CEO Will\u00a0Wood says the company's goal isn't to compete on price but on experience and technology.",
      "\"Much like you'd expect from a supercar brand, we're focused on performance and refinement,\" he explained.",
      "The first 100 Sigma models will be limited editions, offering special finishes and materials that won't appear on later production units.",
      "NASA'S 'QUIET' SUPERSONIC JET COMPLETES FIRST FLIGHT IN POTENTIAL BREAKTHROUGH FOR COMMERCIAL AIR TRAVEL",
      "Taking flight before you take off",
      "AltoVolo isn't stopping at online design. They've built a high-fidelity flight simulator that mirrors the Sigma's cockpit exactly, right down to its carbon fiber and soft leather interior.",
      "Customers can train in the simulator and even use those hours toward a pilot's license. The simulator gives them a chance to \"fly\" their customized Sigma before ever leaving the ground.",
      "And for everyone else? The company is sharing flight footage from its simulator on YouTube, so people can see how the Sigma handles in the air.",
      "\"For AltoVolo, opening our order book is a major milestone in bringing the Sigma to life,\" Wood tells CyberGuy. \"Having early customers make an initial financial commitment shows us real demand. In turn, we are able to raise capital to finalise the product, progress certification and prepare for production. Presenting the flight simulator has been a useful catalyst. Allowing customers to fly in a simulated environment really helps them realise how easy this type of aircraft will be to fly.\"",
      "An exclusive community for early Sigma owners shapes the future of personal air travel and sustainable innovation. (AltoVolo)",
      "Innovation you can feel",
      "One of the most interesting details about the Sigma is something you can't see: the sound inside the cabin. AltoVolo's engineers are working to reduce vibration and interior noise, creating a calm, smooth flight experience.",
      "At the same time, they're experimenting with a synthesized soundscape, a gentle background tone that changes with the aircraft's power use. It helps pilots sense how the vehicle is performing and adds a cinematic touch to the flying experience.",
      "It's part science, part art and a hint at how human-centered this design really is.",
      "Future pilots can train in a realistic Sigma cockpit simulator and even log hours toward a license. (AltoVolo)",
      "The path to certification",
      "The Sigma will benefit from new U.S. aviation rules called MOSAIC, which simplify the process for certifying small, advanced aircraft. This means the Sigma can be sold as a light sport aircraft, lowering costs for both the company and future pilots. Certification is also underway in Europe and the UK, which could make global operations possible in the next few years.",
      "Building a community around flight",
      "Buying a Sigma isn't just about owning an aircraft; it's about joining a new kind of community. AltoVolo wants Sigma owners to become collaborators, helping to shape the product and the future of urban flight. The company is also planning a global service and support network, including maintenance and training centers, to make ownership practical for people beyond traditional aviation circles.",
      "What this means to you",
      "For most of us, flying still means boarding a big plane at a crowded airport. But companies like AltoVolo are trying to change that. The Sigma represents a future where small, efficient aircraft could handle regional travel, connecting towns, suburbs and cities in new ways. It's the kind of innovation that could one day make air travel as personal as driving. And while it's still very early, AltoVolo's new configurator makes the dream of personal air travel feel a bit more real.",

    "summary": "Electric vehicles overtake gas cars in total CO2 savings after just two years of driving, with emissions benefits growing over time as power grids get cleaner.",
    "story": [
      "Fox News host Jesse Watters discusses how President Donald Trump bought a red Tesla at the White House and Democrats' reaction to it on \u2018Jesse Watters Primetime.\u2019",
      "Electric vehicles are proving their worth when it comes to long-term emissions. While building an EV creates more pollution upfront because battery production demands more energy, the balance changes fast once the car is on the road. After about two years of normal driving, an electric car overtakes a gas-powered one in total CO2 savings and keeps widening the gap over time.",
      "A peer-reviewed study published in\u00a0PLOS Climate supports this finding. Researchers Pankaj Sadavarte, Drew Shindell, and Daniel Loughlin conducted the analysis titled,\u00a0\"Comparing the climate and air pollution footprints of Lithium-ion BEVs and ICEs in the U.S. incorporating systemic energy system responses.\" Their work examined how manufacturing, fuel production and vehicle operation affect both climate and air quality over a vehicle's lifetime.",

      "New research from PLOS Climate shows electric cars surpass gas vehicles in total CO2 savings after just two years on the road. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How the study shows EVs overtake gas cars in emissions",
      "Using the Global Change Analysis Model (GCAM), the study simulated how U.S. transportation and energy systems interact through 2050 under different rates of EV adoption. The results show that while manufacturing EVs releases about 30% more CO2 than producing gas cars, that gap closes quickly once you drive. By the end of year two, EVs emit less carbon overall, and the advantage widens over time as the power grid shifts toward cleaner energy sources.",
      "Each additional kilowatt-hour of battery capacity is projected to eliminate roughly 485 pounds of CO2 by 2030 and about 280 pounds by 2050. That reflects continued progress in electricity generation and efficiency gains across the EV industry. Over an estimated 18-year lifespan, gas-powered vehicles produce two to three and a half times more pollution-related damage than electric ones. Those damages include the social and economic costs of climate change and health issues linked to air pollution.",
      "While building EV batteries creates more emissions upfront, cleaner power grids and zero tailpipe output help electric vehicles pull ahead over time. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How the GCAM model works",
      "The GCAM model links global energy use, economic activity, and emissions across multiple sectors. In this analysis, researchers measured not only tailpipe emissions but also the upstream effects from mining, refining, and fuel processing. They also factored in how growing EV adoption changes the energy mix. As electricity demand rises, cleaner energy sources like wind, solar and nuclear expand their share, while coal steadily declines.",
      "By 2050, electricity generation from gas, wind and solar grows while coal falls below 6% of the total mix. This cleaner grid makes charging electric cars progressively less carbon-intensive, strengthening the case for a large-scale EV transition.",
      "The study found lifetime health and climate damages from gas cars can be up to 3.5 times higher than from EVs, underscoring the long-term benefits of going electric. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "How EVs impact you and the environment",
      "If you keep a car for more than two years, switching to an EV can meaningfully reduce your carbon footprint. The study found that EVs start paying back their manufacturing emissions faster in regions with renewable-heavy grids. In states still dependent on coal, the break-even point arrives later but still occurs well before a car's third birthday. The cleaner your local power mix, the faster your EV moves into net-positive territory.",
      "INHALERS PRODUCE CARBON EMISSIONS EQUAL TO 530,000 CARS ON ROAD ANNUALLY, STUDY FINDS",
      "The findings also highlight public health benefits. Gas vehicles emit more nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide, both of which contribute to respiratory illnesses and smog. As EVs replace traditional engines, these pollutants drop, improving air quality and reducing healthcare costs.",
      "Context and limitations",
      "The authors acknowledge that their analysis does not include emissions from recycling or disposing of vehicle parts at the end of life. Nor does it count emissions from building charging networks or new power infrastructure. Despite those exclusions, the study provides one of the most comprehensive long-term looks at how EV adoption affects both the economy and the environment.",
      "Because the study uses projections through 2050, results depend on future technology and energy trends. Even so, the consistent pattern across all scenarios is that EVs deliver large reductions in CO2 and air pollutants once on the road.",
      "What this means for you",
      "If you drive often and plan to own your car for several years, the data shows an EV can save both emissions and money over time. Charging on a renewable or low-carbon plan speeds the payoff even more. Choosing a vehicle that matches your driving needs helps minimize unnecessary battery production and further reduces your footprint.",
      "For communities, broader EV adoption means cleaner local air, fewer health-related costs and lower long-term damage from climate change.",

      "In the Idaho student murders and the Maryland slaying of mom of five Rachel Morin, police with few leads turned to Othram for help conducting the IGG, which led them to now-convicted killers Bryan Kohberger and Victor Martinez-Hernandez.",
      "Traditional DNA testing compares a suspect's sample to a law enforcement database in search of a match, but not all criminals can be identified in this manner, especially if it's their first offense. IGG testing involves a blend of forensic science and the same methods used to trace a person's ancestry in order to track down an unknown suspect.",
      "\"When IGG becomes as common as fingerprint and digital forensics, it will ensure that other families don\u2019t have to endure the same pain as the Morins,\" said Randolph Rice, a Baltimore-area attorney who represented Morin's family. \"IGG should not be viewed as a last resort or a luxury; it should be a standard, front-line investigative tool.\"",
      "JONBEN\u00c9T RAMSEY'S FATHER BELIEVES CRUCIAL PROGRESS BEING MADE TO FIND DAUGHTER'S KILLER",

      "\"DNA testing identified him [Kohberger], in a month or in weeks, and the end-to-end cost for that DNA testing was under $10,000,\" Mittelman said. \"So you can't even pay the detective for a month for the amount of money it costs to solve that case.\"",

      "In the Morin case, Martinez-Hernandez was already an international fugitive and suspected killer connected to another sex assault in Los Angeles.",

      "On Oct. 15, the Student Government Association (SGA) Senate at Loyola barred a Turning Point chapter from becoming an officially recognized organization on campus, sparking a national outcry. Now, two law students have stepped in to help the conservative group draft and file an appeal with the SGA.",

They didn't really root it in any of the laws or rules and regulations that they're supposed to follow, and it was purely subjective. And that was our basis in attack in the written appeal that we did.\"",

But as Estis pointed out, Turning Point isn't even an explicitly Christian group, and advocates for conservative principles like free markets and limited government.",

      "\"They were very, very grateful for [the help]. They told me their story. I wrote out exactly what I thought [the appeal] should look like,\" Estis said. \"They made some edits and changes, as did I. But they didn't have a lot of guidance from the get-go of where to go.\"",

      "The United States has taken its Gaza plan to the U.N. Security Council and is now pushing for formal United Nations authorization of a sweeping, multi-year international force that would govern security in the Strip through at least 2027.",
      "The move, which the administration says is necessary to implement President Donald Trump\u2019s 20-point plan, represents one of Washington\u2019s most significant decisions in years to place the United Nations at the center of a major Middle East security framework.",
      "In a statement, the U.S. Mission to the U.N. said the draft was written with input from Qatar, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates. The Mission said the goal is to \"bring to fruition President Trump\u2019s historic 20 Point Comprehensive Plan,\" which was supported by more than 20 countries at a summit in Sharm el-Sheikh on Oct. 13.",

      "Negotiations with Security Council members began in the first week of November to \"stand up the International Stabilization Force and begin a stable, secure, peaceful and prosperous future for Palestinians in Gaza, free of Hamas.\" The Mission added that the ceasefire remains \"fragile\" and delays \"have grave, tangible, and entirely avoidable consequences for Palestinians in Gaza.\"",
      "New details reported by Axios reveal the scope of the U.S. proposal. According to a draft labeled \"sensitive but unclassified,\" the resolution would establish an International Security Force in Gaza for at least two years, with a mandate extending through the end of 2027 and the possibility of extensions. A U.S. official told Axios the plan is to vote on the resolution within weeks and deploy the first troops by January, describing the force as \"an enforcement force and not a peacekeeping force.\"",

      "\"The decision to go to the United Nations was driven principally by the request of participating states, states that the United States hopes will participate in the stabilization force who need a U.N. mandate to help them politically, to dispatch forces eventually to Gaza. So that\u2019s the real origin of this, to enable, to give a political umbrella to participating states to play a role in the stabilization force.\"",

      "Satloff said that although Israel has voiced real concerns about U.N. involvement, it understands why Washington believes the mandate is essential. \"There\u2019s no doubt that involving the United Nations has its own complications, and I think that the Israelis have been pretty vocal about this. But they also appreciate that the United States believes it needs this sort of endorsement for the 20-point plan to move forward. The Israelis want to make sure that these complications don\u2019t overwhelm the benefits of the plan. Which is a legitimate concern.\"",
      "He warned that the plan faces major challenges but urged against pessimism. \"There are enormous obstacles to the implementation of the entire plan. The U.N. aspect of it is just one of them. We\u2019re already seeing some fundamental disagreement over, say, the definition of disarmament, which could derail the whole effort. Now, I think one has to be hopeful. The opportunity here is huge. The desire to find solutions among the states that are committed to this is real and serious. So, while it\u2019s totally legitimate to recognize the significant obstacles, I don\u2019t think that we should get negative about the prospects here.\"",

      "Anne Bayefsky, Director of the Touro Institute on Human Rights and the Holocaust and President of Human Rights Voices, offered a starkly different view. Bayefsky told Fox News Digital: \"Incredibly, the United States has subjected its plans for Gaza to U.N. authorization and oversight. Arab countries claimed U.N. involvement was \u2018necessary\u2019 for them to participate and support the Gaza international force. That was a lie and blatant power grab. The proof is in the text which could have been a one-liner noting, with approval, a non-U. N. initiative. Instead, the resolution is a long-list of orders doing enormous harm to Israeli national security, sovereignty and right of self-defense, hamstringing America's range of action by a web of agencies and involvement antithetical to U.S. interests and peace.\"",
      "She said the move is \"an about-face for American foreign policy on the United Nations and the Arab-Israeli conflict,\" and argued that the United Nations \"has repeatedly demonstrated its antisemitic bias, lack of good faith and support for Palestinian aggression.\" Bayefsky added that the draft \"fails to condemn Hamas\" and \"refuses to acknowledge and reaffirm Israel\u2019s U.N. Charter right of self-defense before granting the treacherous U.N. unprecedented influence,\" calling the omission \"devastating to the prospects of real peace.\"",

Moscow\u2019s draft demands an immediate and unconditional ceasefire, the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Gaza, and the deployment of a U.N. peacekeeping mission under the Secretary-General\u2019s authority and with the consent of the parties involved.",
      "The draft also says it reaffirms the 1967 borders and East Jerusalem as the capital of a future Palestinian state and insists that Gaza\u2019s reconstruction must take place under Palestinian leadership and sovereignty, not through externally managed institutions.

    "story": [
      "Fred Fleitz, vice chairman of the America First Policy Institute\u2019s Center for American Security, says \"standing with Israel is in our strategic interest.\"",
      "Critics once called it isolationist. But national security experts now say Donald Trump\u2019s \"America First\" strategy is proving to be something else entirely \u2014 a hard-nosed policy of deterrence built on strong alliances, especially with Israel.",
      "Fred Fleitz, vice chair of the America First Policy Institute\u2019s Center for American Security and former chief of staff at the National Security Council, told Fox News Digital that \"The America First approach to U.S. national security means a strong national security policy, a decisive president, keeping our nation out of unnecessary wars, having members of alliances carry their own weight, but it also means standing strongly with Israel and fighting antisemitism.\"",
      "He said supporting Israel is not about sentiment. \"Standing with Israel is in our strategic interest,\" he said. \"Israel is dealing with enemies in the region that the U.S. would have to deal with if it were not there. So it\u2019s in our strategic interest.\"",

      "President Donald Trump delivers remarks to the Knesset, Israel's parliament, on Oct. 13, 2025 in Jerusalem. (Evelyn Hockstein/Pool/Getty Images)",
      "Mike Makovsky, CEO of the Jewish Institute for National Security of America (JINSA), said Israel effectively absorbs threats that would otherwise demand U.S. military action. \"Historically, there are about three reasons why we have interests in the region,\" he said. \"One is Israel. Two is oil. And three is Islamic extremism \u2014 terrorism, Shia and Sunni.\"",
      "Makovsky said it is ironic that the America First debate has resurfaced \"only a few months after Israel smoked America\u2019s Mideast enemies.\" He pointed to Iran\u2019s nuclear advances and the role of its proxies. \"They\u2019re building ballistic missiles\u2026 They could reach the eastern seaboard of the United States,\" he said. \"You marry missiles with nukes that could hit the U.S. \u2014 you\u2019ve got the North Koreans on the West Coast; do you really want Iran that could hit the East Coast?\"",
      "According to Makovsky, Israel\u2019s campaign against those threats shows the alliance\u2019s strategic value. \"What did the Israelis just do? They took care of it. The United States came in with the B-2 at the very end\u2026 but it was Israel that did all that work,\" he said.",
      "He added that Israel \"pretty much finished off Hamas,\" weakened Hezbollah \u2014 \"which has hundreds of American soldiers\u2019 blood on their hands\" \u2014 and continues to confront the Houthis to \"ensure freedom of navigation.\" That, he argued, is deterrence in action: \"As long as we support Israel, we give them some help, we give them the weapons they need, they\u2019re really doing our work.\"",
      "Fleitz called Iran \"the biggest threat,\" encompassing \"Iran and Iran\u2019s proxies in the region. This includes Hamas, Hezbollah in Syria, Iran-backed militias in Iraq, and then Iran itself, with its nuclear weapons program and its sponsorship of terror.\"",
      "He said Israel\u2019s actions have \"destroyed Hamas proxies and significantly weakened Iran,\" adding that \"we joined Israel in June in taking on Iran\u2019s nuclear program, which was a threat to global security.\"",
      "Both analysts framed Iran as part of a wider axis of power alongside Russia and China, each exploiting Middle East instability to undermine U.S. influence \u2014 by fueling proxy wars, spiking energy prices, and threatening trade routes through the Gulf and the Red Sea. Fleitz said Trump\u2019s willingness to act decisively \"to attack Iran\u2019s nuclear program\" exemplified using strength to prevent costlier wars later.",

The attacks targeted multiple military, scientific and residential locations, as well as senior government officials. (Stringer/Getty Images)",
      "Both agree that energy policy is where America First becomes measurable. Fleitz said that \"energy independence is a very important part of President Trump\u2019s America First policy to free Americans from high energy bills.\" At the same time, he noted, energy diplomacy abroad reinforces economic security at home. \"By pushing the Saudis \u2014 and the Saudis, I think, are happy to help us with this \u2014 to produce more oil, it may actually help us end the war in Ukraine,\" he said.",
      "Makovsky made a similar case for regional stability: \"The biggest threat to the Gulf Arab oil exporters \u2026 is Iran,\" he said. Without Israel\u2019s containment of Tehran, \"Iran would have taken over the Middle East, most likely. And if you care about oil prices, that\u2019s not too good.\"",

      "Fleitz said Trump\u2019s doctrine is about selective force, not retreat. \"He wants to keep our country out of new and unnecessary wars, but he will use military force prudently to defend our national security,\" he said. \"He is going to avoid sending American troops into certain situations and using military force. But that doesn\u2019t mean he won\u2019t do these things when it is in U.S. strategic interests.\"",
      "He pointed out U.S. personnel who are currently stationed in Israel but \"they\u2019re not going to Gaza\" and \"will not be engaging in combat operations against Hamas.\" Their mission, he said, fits the model of minimal footprint, maximum leverage.",
      "Makovsky warned that abandoning Israel would erode America\u2019s credibility worldwide. He recalled what a senior Arab leader once told him: \"If America doesn\u2019t help Israel attack the nuclear facilities of Iran, it will be one of the great catastrophes.\"",
      "\"That\u2019s because everybody in the Mideast, everyone in Asia, knows that the U.S.\u2013Israel relationship is one of the closest in the world,\" Makovsky said. \"If we don\u2019t help Israel, it undercuts our credibility. The Chinese and the Russians and the North Koreans know that if we\u2019re not going to support Israel, we\u2019re not going to help other allies \u2026 and it would make us more vulnerable to the Chinese without a doubt.\"",

      "Fleitz said Trump\u2019s \"20-point peace plan\" for Gaza exemplifies the America First balance between toughness and diplomacy. \"It achieved its two primary objectives, getting all the living hostages out of Israel and enacting a ceasefire,\" he said, acknowledging that \"the ceasefire is fairly shaky.\" The next step, he added, is \"an international stabilization force\" \u2014 a complex process still under negotiation.",

      "But that assumption was dramatically upended this month. Rodolph learned that ByHeart was recalling its powdered formula because it is likely tied to an infant botulism outbreak that has sickened more than a dozen babies. She panicked, hoping the formula she\u2019s been feeding her daughter for the past three months was not from a defective can.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know if we\u2019ve had those cans or not, and that was pretty terrifying to think about,\u201d she said in a phone interview on Friday. \u201cWhen you\u2019re feeding your baby formula, you don\u2019t think to keep the cans just in case of a recall.\u201d",
      "Rodolph and her husband stopped using the formula on Nov. 9, a day after the product was pulled from store shelves and online merchants amid an investigation by the Food and Drug Administration. She\u2019s been advised by the family\u2019s pediatrician to monitor her daughter Saphira for the emergence of symptoms.",
      "\u201cYou look at your baby and you see them being totally fine, and then you question yourself like: What if they\u2019re not? What if they\u2019re showing symptoms and I just don\u2019t know what they are? What if tomorrow she\u2019s not OK?\u201d Rodolph said. \u201cIt\u2019s an absolutely terrifying situation.\u201d",
      "Rodolph is one of the many parents across the country who are deeply rattled by the botulism outbreak. As of Friday, 23 cases had been reported across 13 states, according to the FDA. No deaths have been reported to date, the agency said.",
      "In a fact sheet, the FDA said most children with infant botulism will initially develop constipation, poor feeding, loss of head control and difficulty swallowing. The symptoms can grow more serious: difficulty breathing, respiratory arrest.",
      "The symptoms take as long as several weeks to appear, the FDA said. If untreated, the infection can lead to paralysis and death, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "ByHeart originally said it would recall two lots of the organic Whole Nutrition Infant Formula after the FDA announced it was investigating the outbreak\u2019s links to the product. ByHeart then widened the recall last week to include all batches of the formula.",
      "\u201cThe safety and well-being of every infant who uses our formula is, and always will be, our highest priority,\u201d ByHeart\u2019s co-founder and president, Mia Funt, said in a statement.",
      "\u201cThis nationwide recall reflects our commitment to protecting babies and giving families clear, actionable information. Alongside this recall, we are conducting a comprehensive investigation to do our part to get the answers parents expect and deserve.\u201d",
      "Summer Besecke, a 25-year-old mother from Longview, Texas, said she was feeding her son Syrus when she learned via email that the formula she was using had been recalled.",
      "\u201cI yanked the bottle out of his mouth, and I started crying,\u201d Besecke said. \u201cAt first, I didn\u2019t know what botulism was, so I was concerned, and my heart kind of dropped.\u201d She went online and did some research. \u201cInstead of my heart dropping, it was more like a hole burning in my chest because I\u2019m literally actively feeding my child this.\u201d",
      "Besecke then noticed troubling symptoms. The 6-week-old became constipated. He had trouble lifting his head. He was \u201ca little more limp than usual,\u201d she said.",
      "Syrus spent two days in the hospital before he was released on Thursday, according to his mother. Besecke and her husband are now waiting for test results to determine if their son has botulism.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been so much worry,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m supposed to be cherishing these moments, and I was robbed of that.\u201d",
      "ByHeart faces at least two lawsuits from parents who say their babies were sickened and allege the company was negligent in selling \u201cdefective\u201d formula. The families are seeking financial compensation for medical bills, emotional distress and other harm.",
      "Yurany and Stephen Dexter of Arizona, the plaintiffs behind one of the suits, said their 4-month-old daughter Rose started to seem sick in August. She appeared weak and listless, her eyelids half-open.",
      "\u201cI just remember her lying there with her arms folded over her chest, being really quiet, refusing her bottle,\u201d Stephen Dexter said in an interview.",
      "The lawsuit says Rose ultimately needed to be flown by air ambulance to a children\u2019s hospital in Phoenix \u2014 two hours away from their home in Flagstaff. She was treated there for about two weeks, her father said.",
      "The Dexters believe ByHeart should face consequences.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ve chosen to be in a position of providing a product that is directly marketed towards a group of people that are, by definition, helpless,\u201d Stephen Dexter said. \u201cIf you\u2019re not doing 110% to make sure the product you\u2019re selling is absolutely pure, then we\u2019ve got a problem.\u201d"

    "summary": "In 2021, nine games into his first season as the head coach of the NFL\u2019s Detroit Lions, Dan Campbell stripped the team\u2019s offensive coordinator of play-calling responsibilities and took over himself.",
    "story": [
      "In 2021, nine games into his first season as the head coach of the NFL\u2019s Detroit Lions, Dan Campbell stripped the team\u2019s offensive coordinator of play-calling responsibilities and took over himself. The Lions were winless and even the coordinator acknowledged that he likely would have made the same move.",
      "Four years later, Campbell did it again.",
      "On Nov. 3, nine weeks into the season, Campbell took over from first-year coordinator John Morton \u2014 but this time, the change didn\u2019t seem to be an obvious choice.",
      "Through five games, the Lions had scored a franchise-record 174 points. By early November, the Lions were 5-3 and had averaged enough points to rank in the NFL\u2019s top five.",
      "Still, Campbell felt a change was required, and the Lions responded with 44 points in a win against Washington, which fielded one of the league\u2019s worst defenses.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s just see if a different play caller can maybe get us a little rhythm? That\u2019s all,\u201d Campbell said of his motivations. \u201cHonestly, it\u2019s nothing more than that.\u201d",
      "Yet the stakes are much more than just a midseason change. As the NFL season enters its stretch run, and no single team has separated itself as a clear-cut Super Bowl favorite, the Lions \u2014 who have never played in a Super Bowl \u2014 are one of numerous potential contenders after two years of entering the postseason as a top NFC threat, only to fall short.",
      "\u201cI just feel like it\u2019s the right thing to do right now, and I\u2019m gonna do it,\u201d Campbell said Monday.",
      "Campbell acknowledged that for Morton, \u201cof course it probably doesn\u2019t feel too good, but also he\u2019s a pro and he understands everything.\u201d He also didn\u2019t remove the possibility of Morton calling plays again, even \u201cmaybe sooner\u201d than 2026, he told reporters. Morton continues to give Campbell information, the coach said, including an opponent\u2019s defensive tendencies. Six coaches provided input during a \u201ccollaborative\u201d Week 10 win at Washington, Campbell said.",
      "The shake-up was consistent with Campbell\u2019s bold tenure in Detroit, marked by provocative quotes in his opening press conference and an aggressive approach to fourth downs. Still, it was surprising. For one, Lions quarterback Jared Goff and Morton had overlapped before in Detroit, in 2022, and the comfort the quarterback had built with the coordinator was \u201cextremely important\u201d to Goff, he said earlier this season.",
      "But after a gaudy first month on offense, Detroit\u2019s attack started gaining fewer yards and showing more signs of concern. After going three-and-out just 25 times in 17 games all of last season, the Lions did it 20 times in this season\u2019s first eight games, the team\u2019s own website noted. Although receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown\u2019s seven touchdowns ranked second in the league, the dual-threat rushing attack of David Montgomery and Jahmyr Gibbs was held to 65 rushing yards combined during a Week 9 loss. Averaging 34.8 points during its first five games, Detroit scored nearly two touchdowns less in its next three.",
      "Play-calling\u2019s learning curve, Campbell said, is about developing a \u201cfeel\u201d that can only be gained through experience, which was partly why he said he still would rely on Morton.",
      "\u201cKnowing when to go and when to pull and push and pull and push and pull and \u2014 to be honest, that\u2019s kind of one of his best traits as a leader,\u201d Goff said. \u201cAnd, not to cross leadership and play-calling, but knowing kind of when the shot [downfield] feels right and when the run feels right, and when to switch the run and do that, it\u2019s really hard. It\u2019s a lot of feel. You can\u2019t really teach it, you can\u2019t really learn it, and he did a great job with that.\u201d",
      "It was Campbell\u2019s first big call, one that could determine Detroit\u2019s Super Bowl aspirations.",
      "What we're watching for in Week 11",
      "Commanders (3-7) vs. Dolphins (3-7), in Madrid, Spain: Washington\u2019s defense (28.0 points allowed per game this season) has contributed to four straight losses of at least 20 points. If that streak of 20-plus-point losses extends to five, it will tie the 1986 Buccaneers for the longest in NFL history.",
      "Panthers (5-5) at Falcons (3-6): Carolina, which beat Atlanta in Week 3, hasn\u2019t swept the Falcons in a season since 2013. Atlanta has lost four straight games in its division.",
      "Buccaneers (6-3) at Bills (6-3): Last week was the first time Buffalo, which leads the NFL with 153 rush yards per game, didn\u2019t gain at least 100 on the ground. The common thread in all three Bills losses has been turnovers, with quarterback Josh Allen committing multiple turnovers in each loss.",
      "Texans (4-5) at Titans (1-8): The Titans have been outscored by a league-worst 127 points, but would have to be outscored by an average margin of 20 points per game the rest of the season to equal the NFL record.",
      "Bears (6-3) at Vikings (4-5): Four fourth-quarter comebacks have turned around Chicago\u2019s season, but the franchise has more work before its playoff contention becomes real. The Bears are 1-8 against their division since 2023, including 0-2 this season.",
      "Packers (5-3-1) at Giants (2-8): The Giants\u2019 79 penalties don\u2019t lead the league \u2014 a distinction earned by Jacksonville and Denver, both with 83.",
      "Bengals (3-6) at Steelers (5-4): It bodes well that this is a day game for the Steelers, who are 0-3 at night. Cincinnati\u2019s DJ Turner leads the league with 14 passes defended. The bad news for the Bengals is that their 109 missed tackles lead the league by 28.",
      "Chargers (7-3) at Jaguars (5-4): Los Angeles has run a league-high 660 plays \u2014 165 more than 32nd-ranked Pittsburgh \u2014 and 46% of its drives end in a score, the fifth-best mark in the NFL.",
      "Seahawks (7-2) at Rams (7-2): Good things happen when these quarterbacks drop back to pass. The Rams\u2019 Matthew Stafford (8.2%) and Seattle\u2019s Sam Darnold (7.5%) rank second and third in the percentage of passes that become touchdowns. And Darnold (league-high 9.24 yards) and Stafford (7.22) both rank in the top five in net yards gained per pass attempt, which factors in yards lost to sacks.",
      "49ers (6-4) at Cardinals (3-6): Arizona is 0-3 against NFC West opponents and 1-6 in its last seven games overall.",
      "Ravens (4-5) at Browns (2-7): Myles Garrett\u2019s 17 tackles for loss lead the NFL. That figure includes 11 sacks, which ties with the Giants\u2019 Brian Burns for the league lead.",
      "Chiefs (5-4) at Broncos (8-2): Denver is 7-0 playing on real grass this season, by far the NFL\u2019s best record. The grass surface the Broncos will play on Sunday is brand new after being installed in their home just nine days ago.",
      "Lions (6-3) at Eagles (7-2): Philadelphia\u2019s offense hasn\u2019t been pretty, but it also doesn\u2019t turn the ball over. Its drives end in turnovers a league-low 4.4% of the time (compare that to the league-worst Dolphins, at 16.5%). Detroit has missed the fewest tackles in the NFL.",
      "Cowboys (3-5-1) at Raiders (2-7): Opponents are converting third downs 52.6% of the time against the maligned Dallas defense, the worst mark in the league. Opponents also are scoring touchdowns nearly 70% of the time they enter the red zone against Dallas, the league\u2019s fourth-worst mark."

    "summary": "In the entire history of the franchise, the Chicago Bears have never had a 4,000-yard passer. That could change with Caleb Williams this season.",
    "story": [
      "Among the quirks and shames that come with being a Chicago Bears fan, there is one fact about the team that is as hard to sit with as a shot of Mal\u00f6rt: In the entire history of the franchise, the Bears have never had a 4,000-yard passer.",
      "Even as their divisional rivals seem to trot out gunslinger after gunslinger \u2014 Brett Favre, Aaron Rodgers, Matthew Stafford, Jared Goff and Daunte Culpepper, to name a few \u2014 and despite all the rule changes to make the sport more passing friendly, Chicago has never had a quarterback top that mark.",
      "That finally might change this season.",
      "Caleb Williams, the first overall pick in the 2024 draft, has not only overcome an 0-2 start to put the Bears in playoff position, but through nine games is on pace to throw for 4,035 yards. This would shatter the current franchise high of 3,838 yards thrown by Erik Kramer in 1995.",
      "More importantly \u2014 or maybe not, considering how desperate Chicago fans are to finally enjoy what literally every other NFL team already has \u2014 Williams isn\u2019t only racking up empty stats in a losing effort. After a win over the New York Giants in Week 10, the Bears are 6-3, in playoff position and tied with the Detroit Lions for first place in the NFC North.",
      "That means Chicago isn\u2019t only chucking the ball downfield, but it also has a chance to play for its first division title since 2018.",
      "\u201cWe understand the urgency that\u2019s at hand,\u201d Bears coach Ben Johnson said in a Monday press conference when asked about the playoff race.",
      "Johnson, who last season was the offensive coordinator drawing up trick plays for the Detroit Lions, was hired in large part to develop Williams and modernize the team\u2019s offense.",
      "He added: \u201cWe know where we are in the NFC right now. But I think the biggest thing and the message to the group is that we\u2019re a 6-3 team right now that\u2019s looking to get to 7-3.\u201d",
      "To get to 7-3, the Bears will need to avenge a loss from Week 1, as they\u2019ll play a Minnesota Vikings team that overcame a 10-point deficit to beat Chicago to start the season. For Williams, the rematch with the Vikings is an opportunity to show how far he\u2019s come since September.",
      "The Bears have won six of their last seven games, and after blowing a lead to Minnesota, Chicago has turned the tables on its opponents. Williams has led four fourth-quarter comebacks and game-winning drives in the team\u2019s six wins, including three on the road.",
      "After pulling off perhaps the wildest win of any team this season against the Cincinnati Bengals in Week 9, Williams followed up with a comeback against the Giants in Week 10, leading two touchdown drives in the fourth quarter to erase a 20-10 deficit.",
      "\u201cTowards the end of the game, it\u2019s time to go win the game and you just get in that mode,\u201d Williams told reporters Wednesday about his success late in games. \u201cDefenses have shown you throughout the game what they\u2019ve game-planned for you, so you get into a rhythm and a flow toward the end of the game, and the mindset changes in the sense of we have no other option at that point other than to score and fight and fight and fight, and that\u2019s what we do and what we\u2019ve done.\u201d",
      "Williams added: \u201cWe do want to showcase, and I want to showcase throughout the whole game that we can play all 60 minutes and put up points and the defense can hold their offense, and we can start steamrolling. But until that happens, we\u2019re going to keep winning games whichever way we need.\u201d",
      "In addition to what he\u2019s done with his arm \u2014 again, on pace to make Bears history! \u2014 Williams has also spurred comebacks with his legs, both with his scrambling and his ability to keep plays alive.",
      "Williams leads the NFL in time to throw this season, the only quarterback who has taken at least 10 snaps to average over three seconds in the pocket. Williams takes his time, but not at the expense of sacks \u2014 he\u2019s been sacked only 14 times in nine games after taking a whopping 68 last season.",
      "He\u2019s also run for three touchdowns so far this year, including the game-winner against New York.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s the beauty behind what we have going right now is, as a coaching staff, we try to get that primary receiver open as much as we can,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cSometimes the defense doesn\u2019t cooperate with you. And so Caleb knows that if we can\u2019t get one to two or if he\u2019s feeling the pressure, he can still make us right and we can still have a good place. So, I think it\u2019s a cool thing about where we\u2019re at right now.\u201d",
      "While the offensive improvement is exciting, the game against Minnesota will be the first in a series of tests for Chicago in the season\u2019s home stretch, tests that should reveal if the Bears are serious competition for the NFC\u2019s heavyweights.",
      "There are reasons to doubt Chicago. Four of its last five wins have  come in one-score games, a combined margin of victory of 11 points in those four contests. The Bears\u2019 strength of victory is .272, second worst in the NFL.",
      "Meanwhile, Chicago is only now getting to the hard part of its schedule. Among the Bears\u2019 remaining opponents are the Lions (6-3), two games against the Green Bay Packers (5-3-1), longtime foe Rodgers and his new team the Pittsburgh Steelers (5-4), the Philadelphia Eagles (7-2) and the San Francisco 49ers (6-4).",
      "But if Williams can stay on his historic throwing pace and lead Chicago to the playoffs against some of the best teams in the league? Then for Bears fans, the wait may have been worth it.",
      "CORRECTION (Nov. 14, 2025, 9:54 a.m. ET): An earlier version of this article misstated the order in which Williams was drafted. He was the first overall pick, not the second."

      "\u201cColostrum has been one of the highest interest supplements over the past year,\u201d a spokesperson for GNC wrote in an email. In GNC\u2019s upcoming \u201cAnti Trend Report,\u201d colostrum supplements were highlighted as one of the biggest supplement trends of the year.",
      "Sometimes referred to as \u201cliquid gold\u201d because of its honeylike appearance, or the \u201cstarter kit\u201d for infants, colostrum is a crucial part of newborns\u2019 development.",
      "But what about adults? And what if that colostrum comes from a cow, not a human?",
      "Here\u2019s everything you need to know about colostrum supplements, and if they\u2019re worth it.",
      "What is colostrum?",
      "Colostrum is an early form of breast milk that\u2019s produced right after giving birth.",
      "It\u2019s meant to support newborns\u2019 development and contains essential nutrients to kick-start their immune system, support their gastrointestinal system and aid their overall growth.",
      "Compared to so-called mature milk, the kind of milk produced after colostrum, colostrum is higher in protein, fat, vitamins, minerals and peptides. It\u2019s produced for about five days after birth.",
      "Dr. Pieter Cohen, an associate professor at Harvard Medical School and a general internist at Cambridge Health Alliance, said colostrum contains certain antibodies and compounds that are important for infant development.",
      "\u201cColostrum contains a lot of things that are good for babies of the given species,\u201d he said. \u201cHuman babies will be exposed to things that can help, like immunoglobulins and other immune-boosting proteins in the colostrum. They\u2019re really good as the babies are developing their own immune system.\u201d",
      "Other studies have demonstrated colostrum\u2019s importance for infants in gut microbiome formation and reducing allergy risk.",
      "Colostrum supplements aren\u2019t made of human breast milk, however. The majority are made from cow\u2019s milk and sold as bovine colostrum. Some colostrum supplements are made from goat\u2019s milk.",
      "Why do people take colostrum and what does the research say?",
      "There\u2019s a lot of interest in colostrum for help with inflammation, particularly in athletes, said Daniel Fabricant, president and CEO of the Natural Products Association, a supplement industry trade group. He also cited gut health as a benefit.",
      "(Fabricant added that colostrum supplements aren't meant to cure, treat or mitigate disease. \u201cIt\u2019s always important to differentiate something that is a health and wellness product versus something that is curing, treating, mitigating disease,\" he said.)",
      "In a review paper published last year in the journal Frontiers in Immunology, researchers said that many studies reported positive effects for athletes taking the supplement \u2014 including supporting muscle recovery, boosting immunity after intense exercise and healing from injuries \u2014 though they added that more research is needed. The review was funded by a dairy company.",
      "Another review saw improvements with gastrointestinal issues like diarrhea. The authors, however, wrote that there was \u201climited evidence\u201d on colostrum\u2019s effects on gut health, \u201cwith mixed findings.\u201d",
      "Wesley McWhorter, a registered dietitian and spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, said the research on colostrum supplementation is too early to make bold claims.",
      "\u201cMost of this research, still very preliminary, it\u2019s early. There\u2019s not large-scale studies, so there\u2019s no strong evidence,\u201d McWhorter said. Still, he said he\u2019s interested in seeing where the research goes.",
      "In many cases, studies are funded by companies that sell colostrum.",
      "Richard Bloomer, dean of the College of Health Sciences and director of the Center for Nutraceutical and Dietary Supplement Research at the University of Memphis, said that each study\u2019s factors \u2014 the supplement\u2019s source, its dosage and who the subjects were \u2014 vary, which can affect results.",
      "Cohen said he doesn\u2019t believe the research is extensive enough yet, and he doesn\u2019t recommend colostrum supplements.",
      "He added supplements can vary by each manufacturer and brand, and quality assurance is lacking.",
      "\u201cSo even if it were that there was one or two studies on a specific product, it doesn\u2019t mean that that product today is made the same way that the one that was studied,\u201d he said.",
      "Can you get the same benefits without colostrum?",
      "The research on colostrum seems more promising for athletes, who have their sleep, diet and exercise \u201cdialed in,\u201d McWhorter said. But for the average person, he said, there are other ways to achieve the same benefits.",
      "McWhorter recommended a \u201cfood first\u201d approach.",
      "\u201cFocus on your diet first, your exercise second and dial in on the other pieces,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s really where you should spend your time, instead of on supplements. There is no magic pill right now.\u201d",
      "Benefits like the ones promised by colostrum can be achieved through lifestyle changes, such as diet, exercise and regular sleep.",
      "Bloomer said consumers should evaluate what they\u2019re willing to spend their money on.",
      "\u201cCould you justify an extra $2, $3, $5 a day to get a little bit of potential benefit? You might be better served by spending those $5 on a bunch of fruit and vegetables and try to enhance your immune function that way,\u201d he said."

      "In a surprise twist, Powell then shared that his sisters, Lauren and Leslie, were able to track down the UPS driver, joking that the women in his family \u201care terrifying.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey found the cell number of this UPS guy, his name is Mitch,\u201d Powell said. \u201cSo to prove to Mitch that I am not a liar, I flew him all the way to New York \u2014 coach, I don\u2019t know how \u2018The Running Man\u2019 is going to do yet \u2014 but I flew him here, and he thought it was a scam, but he still came. And he is sitting in the audience tonight, so let\u2019s give it up for Mitch, the UPS guy.\u201d",
      "The camera panned to Mitch sitting in the audience as he gave a wave to the camera. Powell then invited Mitch onto the stage of Studio 8H to re-create that original selfie and \u201cbring this thing full circle.\u201d",
      "While this marked Powell\u2019s first time hosting the late-night sketch comedy show, the actor made two brief appearances in March 2024 during his \u201cAnyone But You\u201d co-star Sydney Sweeney\u2019s hosting debut.",
      "During her monologue, Sweeney called out the \u201ccraziest rumor\u201d she\u2019d heard about herself online, which was that she and Powell had an affair while they filmed the 2023 rom-com. Sweeney refuted the rumors and said her then-fianc\u00e9, Jonathan Davino, produced the movie and he was with the duo the entire time during filming.",
      "Sweeney added that Davino was in the audience to show his support. But the cameras cut to Powell smiling in the audience, leaving Sweeney to yell, \u201cThat\u2019s not my fianc\u00e9! He\u2019s in my dressing room!\u201d",
      "Powell also appeared during a sketch called \u201cLoud Table,\u201d which featured Sweeney on a date with her boyfriend, played by Andrew Dismukes. However, during the date, Sweeney confessed she cheated on him with her boss, played by none other than Powell."

      "Kim Kardashian said she had no room for error when it came to the California bar exam.",
      "In the latest episode of \"The Kardashians,\" which was filmed three months before Kardashian took the bar exam and failed, she explained why she needed to pass the test on the first try.",
      "The reality TV star said she spent about \"nine hours a day\" studying and was happy to wrap her Hulu show \"All's Fair\" so she could focus more on her studies.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m really just excited to have \u2018All\u2019s Fair\u2019 wrapped and behind me so that I can just dive right on into studying and make that my No. 1 focus,\" she said on Season 7, Episode 4, of the series.",
      "In a confessional, Kardashian admitted that she was feeling \"exhausted.\"",
      "When a producer asked her if she was \"nervous\" about taking the bar, she responded, yes.",
      "\u201cYeah! Absolutely. I\u2019m not ready yet,\" she said. \"You know, you feel like you don\u2019t know anything and then it all clicks and then you feel like you don\u2019t know it. It\u2019s just the craziest, most emotional roller coaster.\"",
      "\"I really do need to pass on the first try,\" Kardashian added. \"I don\u2019t have another few months I can give up.\"",
      "The State Bar of California released the results of its July 2025 exam on Nov. 7, announcing that 54.8% of exam takers passed. Just over 7,300 people took the test, 73.9% of which were first-time test takers. The pass rate for first-time takers was 69.7%, per the state bar.",
      "Kardashian\u2019s name was not included in the publicly available pass list.",
      "She spoke about failing the bar in a TikTok video that she filmed while getting ready for her mother's 70th birthday party. Kardashian told someone on the phone that fortune tellers had inaccurately predicted her future.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m just letting you guys know that all of the f--king psychics that we have met with and that we\u2019re obsessed with are all f--king full of s--t,\" she said angrily. \u201cThey all collectively \u2014 maybe four of them have told me that I was going to pass the bar, so they\u2019re all full pathological liars. Don't believe anything they say.\"",
      "Last May, Kardashian completed her law program after six years of studying. Now that she's failed the bar, she'll have to re-take the test. The bar is given twice a year, in July and February."

    "story": [
      "Small business owners Jaclyn and Kevin Elbaum are always tickled pink when someone wears one of their beautiful pieces of jewelry. But they were enchanted to see one of the world's biggest stars sporting not one, but two special items from their collection last week.",
      "On Nov. 5, Taylor Swift was spotted wearing a stunning yellow gold diamond lock necklace and a diamond chain lariat during a date night with fianc\u00e9 Travis Kelce in New York City.",
      "Word quickly spread that the items came from the Elbaums\u2019 brand, Audry Rose, which the couple founded in 2015.",
      "\u201cIt felt like a top 10 life moment kind of thing,\u201d Kevin Elbaum tells TODAY.com in a joint interview with his wife, calling the experience \u201csurreal.\u201d",
      "The married couple first learned that Swift was a fan of their jewelry while they were sitting down to dinner with their family.",
      "\u201cOne of my friends, she just saw it and she calls me and was like, \u2018I think this is your necklace.\u2019 And so I open up Instagram and I zoom in and I was like, \u2018Oh my God, that is my necklace,\u2019\u201d Jaclyn Elbaum recalls.",
      "The mother of two's animated reaction initially concerned her husband.",
      "\"I wasn\u2019t sure if someone had died. I couldn\u2019t figure it out because her reaction was so insane that my heart sank,\" Kevin Elbaum says.",
      "He decided to film his wife's reaction and post it on Instagram. In the video, Jaclyn Elbaum holds back tears as she looks at the photo of Swift wearing the two necklaces.",
      "The couple was especially touched by Swift's selections. The \"Life of a Showgirl\" singer wore two pieces from their collection that hold special meaning to their family.",
      "Jaclyn Elbaum designed the Pave Diamond Lock Necklace around five years ago and says the piece is \u201creally close to my heart.\u201d",
      "Every part of the necklace is handmade, including the chain, which is named after the couple\u2019s daughter Sloan.",
      "\u201cShe couldn\u2019t have picked a more important piece to us,\u201d Kevin Elbaum adds.",
      "The lariat that Swift paired with the lock necklace also holds sentimental value: Jaclyn Elbaum designed it for her mother\u2019s 70th birthday.",
      "A Life-Changing Moment for a Small Business",
      "The Elbaums are the latest small business owners to experience the \"Taylor Swift effect,\" referring to the singer's cultural and economic influence. Other examples include the NFL's increase in female viewership after Swift started dating Kelce and jewelry designer Kindred Lubeck's explosion in social media followers after Kelce proposed with one of her rings.",
      "Even in their wildest dreams, the Elbaums had never imagined something like this could happen to their small business.",
      "\"We don\u2019t have a publicist or anything. We hadn\u2019t tried to get it to her, so we really were completely blindsided that this could even happen. We assumed the only way it could happen was if you got it to her stylist or something,\u201d Kevin Elbaum says.",
      "Ever since the photo of Swift wearing their jewelry went viral, the Elbaums have noticed an uptick in traffic to their brand\u2019s website and more people purchasing the $7,800 lock necklace.",
      "They\u2019ve since added a sterling silver version of the lock necklace that retails for $890.",
      "The Elbaums say they're incredibly grateful for Swift's support of small businesses.",
      "\"We would have paid her to have the necklace. This is clearly a passion project for her to just sprinkle the Taylor aura around to businesses she likes, so it\u2019s really special,\" Kevin Elbaum says.",
      "Jaclyn Elbaum adds that Swift \"clearly cares about the craft and how things are made.\"",
      "After seeing the photo of Swift wearing items from their brand, the Elbaums emailed the singer's team to express their gratitude.",
      "\"I appreciate what she does to all small businesses, not just ours. It's really a special thing to see,\" Jaclyn Elbaum says.",
      "A Launchpad for a 'New Phase'",
      "The Elbaums started Audry Rose in 2015 shortly after Jaclyn Elbaum's grandmother, the brand's namesake, passed away.",
      "\"She started in the clothing industry and was entrepreneurial before that was really a thing for women. She was really ahead of her time and I always looked up to her. She was always a role model for me. Quality of things was always very important to her, so we wanted that to be infused into the brand,\" Jaclyn Elbaum says.",
      "Before the launch of their brand, Kevin Elbaum specialized in customer acquisition while Jaclyn Elbaum worked in the fashion industry.",
      "\u201cI always really wanted to do something with her, and it was just getting her over her fear to jump with me,\u201d Kevin Elbaum says.",
      "The Elbaums say it'll be a long time before they're able to shake off the feeling of seeing Swift wearing one of their designs.",
      "Looking ahead, the couple hopes this is simply the beginning of a new phase for their brand.",
      "\"I want everyone to know quality for us is really important and I hope other people trust our brand like she did,\" Jaclyn Elbaum says. \"We\u2019re just really excited to keep going, keep designing, keep growing.\"",
      "This moment will certainly be hard to beat, but the Elbaums are excited to see what's next.",
      "\"We're just kind of trying to keep moving forward and hoping for some other special moment in the next 10 years,\" Kevin Elbaum says."

      "\u201cWell, we\u2019re not saying he (dies),\u201d creator Abe Sylvia previously told TODAY.com following the 2024 finale. \u201cThis is a classic soap opera cliffhanger.\u201d",

      "\u201cWe wanted to start with a bang. I\u2019m such a huge fan of movie musicals. I started as a dancer myself, and so I brought a whole book full of inspirations to the designers and brought in the choreographer,\u201d Sylvia says. \u201cIt\u2019s a mash up of a lot of my personal influences, and I was just so grateful that everybody brought their A-game and that we were able to make the musical number of my dreams.\u201d",
      "Shot in one day from beginning to end in a single take, he says, the dancers rehearsed for about three days while the costumes took weeks. They also built the set from scratch.",
      "However, as the performance continues, Robert is shot and begins to bleed. Maxine, still on top of the table, is dragged away from Robert as flashbacks of the Season 1 finale when he was shot appear on screen. The musical number continues and ends with Robert on the floor.",
      "It turns out Maxine was hallucinating and admitted into mental institute Sunny Tides. They have drugged her and she keeps asking for Robert.",
      "Robert is then seen unconscious in a hospital bed with Norma (Carol Burnett) by his side asking how he knew her name. Robert appears to be alive, for now.",
      "As viewers recall, Robert discovered that Norma was really Agnes and stole her identity. This was after Norma asked Robert to marry her so that he could inherit all her wealth.",
      "In the second season's first episode, Norma begins to put the pieces together.",
      "But will Robert survive and be a threat to Norma?",
      "In one scene, Maxine escapes Sunny Tides and visits Robert at the hospital. She hides underneath the hospital bed as Norma walks in and the doctor tells her that Robert is \u201ctouch and go,\u201d leaning on go. If he does wake up, the doctor says, his speech will be their first sign of hope and from there they will assess for any brain damage.",
      "After the doctor leaves, Norma talks to an unconscious Robert and tells him, \u201cI know who told you about Agnes.\u201d",
      "By the end of the episode, Robert opens his eyes and simply says, \u201cAgnes.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s so funny because I read the last episode last season and I\u2019m like, \u2018Oh, am I dying?\u2019 and then Abe told me, \u2018Oh, Ricky, I\u2019m sorry I forgot to tell you, you\u2019re not going to die,\u2019\u201d Martin tells TODAY.com. \u201cBut I am open to anything.\u201d",
      "Kristen Wiig adds that \u201cit\u2019s been hard to keep\u201d Robert\u2019s fate a secret, \u201cbecause people have seen photos. So it\u2019s been really hard for us to be like, \u2018Is he a ghost?\u2019\u201d",

      "Pope Leo XIV welcomed Spike Lee, Cate Blanchett, Greta Gerwig and dozens of other Hollywood luminaries to a special Vatican audience Saturday celebrating cinema and its ability to inspire and unite.",
      "Leo encouraged the filmmakers and celebrities gathered in a frescoed Vatican audience hall to use their art to include marginal voices, calling film \u201ca popular art in the noblest sense, intended for and accessible to all.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen cinema is authentic, it does not merely console, but challenges,\u201d he told the stars. \u201cIt articulates the questions that dwell within us, and sometimes, even provokes tears that we did not know we needed to express.\u201d",
      "The encounter, organized by the Vatican\u2019s culture ministry, follows on similar audiences Pope Francis had in recent years with artists and comedians. It\u2019s part of the Vatican\u2019s efforts to reach out beyond the Catholic Church to engage with the secular world.",
      "But the gathering also seemed to have particular meaning for history\u2019s first American pope, who grew up in the heyday of Hollywood. The 70-year-old, Chicago-born Leo just this week identified his four favorite films: \u201cIt\u2019s a Wonderful Life,\u201d \u201cThe Sound of Music,\u201d \u201cOrdinary People,\u201d and \u201cLife Is Beautiful.\u201d",
      "In a sign of how seemingly star-struck he was, Leo spent nearly an hour after the audience greeting and chatting amiably with each of the participants, something he rarely does for large audiences.",
      "Drawing applause from the celebrities, Leo acknowledged that the film industry and cinemas around the world were experiencing a decline, with theaters that had once been important social and cultural meeting points disappearing from neighborhoods.",
      "\u201cI urge institutions not to give up, but to cooperate in affirming the social and cultural value\u201d of movie theaters, he said.",
      "Celebrities just happy to be invited",
      "Many celebrities said they found Leo\u2019s words inspiring, and expressed awe as they walked through the halls of the Vatican Apostolic Palace, where a light luncheon reception awaited them after the audience.",
      "\u201cIt was a surprise to me that I even got invited,\u201d Spike Lee told reporters along the red carpet gauntlet in the palace.",
      "During the audience, Lee had presented Leo with a jersey from his beloved Knicks basketball team, featuring the number 14 and Leo\u2019s name on the back. Leo is a known Chicago Bulls fan, but Lee said he told the pope that the Knicks now boasts three players from the pope\u2019s alma mater, Villanova University.",
      "Blanchett, for her part, said the pope\u2019s comments were inspiring because he understood the crucial role cinema can play in transcending borders and exploring sometimes difficult subjects in ways that aren\u2019t divisive.",
      "\u201cFilmmaking is about entertainment, but it\u2019s about including voices that are often marginalized and not shy away from the pain and complexity that we\u2019re all living through right now,\u201d she said.",
      "She said Leo, in his comments about the experience of watching a film in a dark theatre, clearly understood the culturally important role cinemas can play.",
      "\u201cSitting in the dark with strangers is a way in which we can reconnect to what unites us rather than what divides us,\u201d she said.",
      "A \u2018hit and miss\u2019 guest list that grew",
      "The gathering drew a diverse group of filmmakers and actors, including many from Italy, like Monica Bellucci and Alba Rohrwacher. American actors included Chris O\u2019Donnell, Judd Apatow and Leslie Mann, his wife.",
      "Archbishop Paul Tighe, the No. 2 in the Vatican culture ministry, said the guest list was pulled together just in the last three months, with the help of the handful of contacts Vatican officials had in Hollywood, including Martin Scorsese.",
      "The biggest hurdle, Tighe said, was convincing Hollywood agents that the invitation to come meet Leo wasn\u2019t a hoax. In the end, as word spread, some figures approached the Vatican and asked to be invited.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s an industry where people have their commitments months in advance and years in advance, so obviously it was a little hit and miss, but we\u2019re very pleased and very proud\u201d by the turnout, he said.",
      "The aim of the encounter, he said, was to encourage an ongoing conversation with the world of culture, of which film is a fundamental part.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a very democratic art form,\u201d Tighe said. Saturday\u2019s audience, he said, was \u201cthe celebration of an art form that I think is touching the lives of so many people and therefore recognizing it and giving it its true importance.\u201d"

      "LONDON \u2014 A flap of outrage is brewing over the fate of 15 residents of a cramped central London building, who critics say live out their lives indoors with no daylight, fresh air or adequately deep water.",
      "The gentoo penguins are one of the star attractions at the Sea Life London Aquarium, in one of the city\u2019s most popular tourist hot spots, across the river from the British Parliament and nestled between a \u201cShrek\u201d-themed experience and the popular London Eye landmark.",
      "British lawmakers this week joined campaigners in voicing mounting concerns for their 15 feathered neighbors, calling for government intervention over what they say is \u201cun-British\u201d treatment.",
      "The company that owns the aquarium says its penguin enclosure meets the standards of modern zoo practice set by the government.",
      "Visitors file past sharks, turtles and tropical fish in big tanks to reach the penguins, housed in a noticeably colder exhibit, built of rocks and artificial snow cliffs that hover over a pool of water.",
      "There, the 10 females and five males appear to spend their time mostly bobbing, jumping and swooshing through the water while visitors look on, children squealing with excitement while adults whip out their phones to take pictures.",
      "Most people filing by Thursday, largely families with children, told NBC News they were not aware of the brewing controversy.",
      "Shivani Gupta, visiting from Canada, said the conditions in the enclosure \u201cdid not seem right,\u201d although she added she would have still visited the aquarium as she has never seen penguins before.",
      "Chelsea Gibbons, 25, on vacation from Massachusetts, said she was not aware of the concerns raised by the campaigners, but noted there was no access to the outdoors for the penguins and the pool area appeared \u201ca bit small,\u201d although there is an additional area for the penguins to waddle around. Had she known about the efforts to free the birds ahead of time, Gibbon said, she would not have come. \u201cThe aquarium is saying it\u2019s meeting the standards, but we can always improve those standards,\u201d she added.",
      "Dozens of British lawmakers have signed an open letter to Environment Secretary Emma Reynolds asking her to \u201cconsider whether the penguins should be relocated to a more suitable facility better aligned with their behavioral, ecological and physiological needs,\u201d according to British media reports.",
      "David Taylor, a member of Parliament with the ruling Labour Party, has been spearheading the campaign, posting on X that \u201cabusing animals for money is un-British.\u201d",
      "The largest populations of gentoo penguins are found in the Falkland Islands and the South Georgia Islands in the South Atlantic, and on the Antarctic Peninsula, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature.",
      "Rory Wilson, a professor of aquatic biology at Swansea University in the United Kingdom, told NBC News that in the wild, gentoo penguins routinely dive up to more than 160 feet deep.",
      "\u201cI know that the official guidelines for captive penguins is that they need at least 4 feet of water depth, which I don\u2019t know who thought of that. It clearly wasn\u2019t someone who thought much about penguins,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are monstrously efficient, wonderful swimmers. They are one of the fastest penguins, most athletic, and therefore any condition that they are being kept in captivity, which constrains their ability to move themselves, is obviously of concern,\u201d he said.",
      "As far as fresh air and daylight are concerned, Wilson said, some subspecies of gentoo could struggle to survive outside in the U.K. due to a risk of fungal infections.",
      "Freedom for Animals, a U.K. charity that opposes the captivity of animals in \u201czoos, aquariums, mobile zoos and circuses,\u201d launched a campaign to free the penguins in February 2024, but the movement has picked up steam with a protest held outside the facility last month and the intervention from MPs.",
      "A petition started by the charity has garnered more than 40,000 signatures and asks theme park operator Merlin Entertainments, which owns the aquarium, to guarantee the \u201csafe and permanent retirement of the penguins\u201d to a facility that can provide \u201ca much more suitable environment.\u201d",
      "In a statement to NBC News, Merlin Entertainments said the penguin enclosure is located on the ground floor of the aquarium, not the basement, and was \u201ccarefully designed to reflect important elements of the penguins\u2019 natural environment as closely as possible to ensure good health, including climate-controlled temperature and filtered fresh air.\u201d",
      "The company also said the enclosure has technology that creates appropriate seasonal lighting, reflecting changing seasons. The penguin colony is regularly inspected by independent veterinarians, and local and national authorities, it added.",
      "\u201cThis is a complex issue,\u201d its statement said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot to consider, and we take every decision seriously, always guided by what\u2019s best for the animals. We\u2019re open. We\u2019re listening. And we\u2019ve always done what\u2019s right for our animals based on expert advice and their individual needs. That\u2019s a commitment we stand by.\u201d"

      "China, which claims the self-ruling island democracy as its territory and has not ruled out the use of force against it, has demanded that Takaichi retract her \u201cegregious\u201d remarks.",
      "Others have gone further: One prominent Chinese commentator called Takaichi an \u201cevil witch,\u201d while a Chinese diplomat in Japan talked about cutting off the \u201cdirty neck\u201d extending itself into what Beijing considers an internal matter.",
      "Both countries have summoned each other\u2019s ambassadors as the saga enters its second week, and on Friday China advised its citizens to avoid travelling to Japan, citing \"significant risks\" to their personal safety.",
      "The war of words underscores the complicated relationship between China and Japan, which are major trading partners but have modern territorial disputes as well as lasting historical tensions over Japan\u2019s World War II-era occupation of China.",
      "It was only two weeks ago that Takaichi, who last month became Japan\u2019s first female prime minister, met with Chinese leader Xi Jinping on the sidelines of a regional summit in South Korea, during which they agreed to pursue stable ties.",
      "Like its ally the United States, Japan has traditionally been vague as to how far it would go to protect Taiwan \u2014 which at its closest point is about 70 miles from Japanese territory \u2014 against Chinese military aggression.",
      "But Takaichi, a China hard-liner who has long advocated for Taiwan, told lawmakers last week that Chinese use of force around Taiwan could qualify as \u201can existential threat,\u201d triggering a military response.",
      "Though former Japanese leaders \u2014 including Takaichi\u2019s mentor, the late Shinzo Abe \u2014 have made similar comments about military action after leaving office, \u201cit\u2019s breaking new ground for a sitting prime minister to state this,\u201d Jeff Kingston, a professor of Asian studies and history at Temple University\u2019s Japan campus, told NBC News.",
      "The reaction from China was strong and swift, with one comment in particular getting the most attention.",
      "\u201cThe dirty neck that sticks itself in must be cut off,\u201d Xue Jian, the Chinese consul general in the Japanese city of Osaka, said in a post on X that has since been deleted.",
      "The Japanese government says it continues to favor a peaceful resolution of the Taiwan issue and has criticized Xue\u2019s \u201chighly inappropriate\u201d remarks, which some interpreted as a death threat against Takaichi.",
      "The U.S. ambassador to Japan, George Glass, has also weighed in on Xue\u2019s comments. \u201cTime for Beijing to behave like the \u2018good neighbor\u2019 it talks repeatedly about \u2014 but fails repeatedly to become,\u201d he said in a post on X.",
      "On Friday, Tokyo summoned the Chinese ambassador to Japan, Wu Jianghao, to lodge a protest over Xue\u2019s post.",
      "China said later Friday that Wu had himself \u201csummoned Japan\u2019s Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs, Takehiro Funakoshi, to lodge solemn representations\u201d and assail Takaichi for failing to retract her comments, which it said \u201cviolated basic common sense, crossed China\u2019s red line, constituted a military threat, and amounted to war-mongering.\u201d",
      "A day earlier, Beijing summoned the Japanese ambassador, Kenji Kanasugi, to warn him over Taiwan.",
      "The Chinese Ministry of National Defense also issued a warning on Friday, saying that Japan would \u201cinevitably crash against the steel wall\u201d of the Chinese military if it intervenes in the Taiwan Strait, \u201cpaying a bitter and heavy price.\u201d",
      "Takaichi has also been excoriated in Chinese state media. A Friday editorial in the People\u2019s Daily newspaper said the Taiwan remarks by Takaichi, who has vowed to increase defense spending and favors revising Japan\u2019s pacifist constitution, were \u201caimed at finding an excuse for Japan\u2019s military expansion.\u201d",
      "Hu Xijin, a Chinese nationalist commentator, said Takaichi was an \u201cevil witch\u201d who had \u201csuccessfully ignited a new explosion of mutual hatred between Chinese and Japanese public opinion.\u201d",
      "Taiwan, which was ruled by China\u2019s Qing dynasty from 1683 to 1895 and by Japan from 1895 to 1945, has emphasized its sovereignty and noted Beijing\u2019s escalating military activity in the Taiwan Strait.",
      "China\u2019s warnings to Japan \u201cunderscore its hegemonic mindset and demonstrate that it is a troublemaker intent on unilaterally changing the international order,\u201d the Taiwan Ministry of Foreign Affairs said this week.",

      "China\u2019s harsh response will only \u201cenhance her reputation\u201d among conservatives in Japan, Kingston said. It could also give her a boost with President Donald Trump, who seemingly hit it off with Takaichi during his visit to Japan last month.",
      "\u201cTaking a hard line on China doesn\u2019t really hurt her in terms of bilateral relations with the United States,\u201d Kingston said.",
      "Because China is so sensitive to the issue of Taiwan, which it describes as its \u201ccore of core interests,\u201d its rebuke of Takaichi\u2019s comments is also unsurprising, said Richard McGregor, senior fellow for East Asia at the Lowy Institute, a foreign policy think tank in Australia.",

      "So for all the tense exchanges her Taiwan remarks have brought between the two Asian powers, McGregor said, \u201cit\u2019s not a cataclysmic event.\u201d",
      "Kingston agreed.",

      "Every day this week, Zhu has been showing up to the empty venue he had booked for the film festival as a form of protest.",

      "In a statement ahead of the film festival\u2019s cancellation, the organizer said he received messages saying that filmmakers, directors and producers from China set to participate in the event, as well as their relatives, were facing harassment.",
      "Many participants who pulled out of the independent film festival did not say why or cited \u201cpersonal reasons,\u201d but a few said they or their family members had been told to do so by Chinese authorities, according to Zhu.",

      "By the time Zhu suspended the film festival, it was too late for him to cancel the venue he had booked. Throughout the week, he has gone to the event space \u2014 sometimes by himself or with a handful of other filmmakers \u2014 to watch some films and discuss them.",
      "\u201cI am still a filmmaker. I\u2019m still a filmmaker from China and I\u2019m still an independent film curator,\u201d Zhu said, adding that independent filmmaking in China \u201cis really difficult; it is extremely different from before.\u201d",
      "Before moving to New York City a decade ago, Zhu had worked on independent film festivals in China for nearly 20 years and co-founded the Beijing Independent Film Festival.",
      "But independent film festivals in China began facing increasing crackdowns after Chinese President Xi Jinping, known for his stringent ideological control, stepped into power in 2012, according to Human Rights Watch. The nongovernmental organization investigating human rights abuses around the world has said that Chinese authorities have shut down all three major independent film festivals in China, including Zhu\u2019s Beijing Independent Film Festival.",
      "\u201cEventually, all of my film festivals were banned, none of them could continue,\u201d Zhu said.",
      "Following what happened to his film festival in Beijing, Zhu had been rethinking how to host a film festival focused on Chinese independent films that could avoid censorship \u2014 the New York City event was the first attempt at that.",
      "\u201cThe Chinese government reached around the globe to shut down a film festival in New York City,\u201d Yalkun Uluyol, China researcher at Human Rights Watch, said in a statement. \u201cThis latest act of transnational repression demonstrates the Chinese government\u2019s aim to control what the world sees and learns about China.\u201d",

      "\u201cWhy do our children deserve this,\u201d Chakrygina, 34, told NBC News in a telephone interview. \u201cWhy are they living under strikes? Why can\u2019t they get proper sleep and go to school? There is anger about everything.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s a routine millions of Ukrainians have been begrudgingly following since Russian President Vladimir Putin launched his invasion almost four years ago, and the nearly nightly barrages of Ukrainian cities that have followed.",
      "As Chakrygina and her family emerged from their shelter, they learned at least four people were killed and another 29 injured in the massive attack, which authorities said had damaged residential buildings in the Ukrainian capital.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who has been pushing for an end to the war, took to X shortly afterward to call it a \u201cwicked attack.\u201d",
      "But with peace negotiations effectively stalled and Russian troops pushing deeper into eastern Ukraine, there is little end in sight.",
      "Chakrygina, who used to work as a pension fund clerk before she had her three children, said she moved to Kyiv from the town of Vuhledar in the eastern Donetsk region shortly after the war started in February 2022.",
      "Vuhledar, which has been obliterated by years of fighting, was captured by Russian forces last October as part of Putin\u2019s wider push to recapture the entire Donbass region, which is made up of  Donetsk and the neighboring region of Luhansk.",
      "While their progress has been slow, earlier this week Russian forces appeared to be advancing on the city of Pokrovsk, a key logistics hub seen as a gateway to the broader region, which sits around 35 miles north of Vuhledar.",
      "Back in Kyiv, business manager Maryna Davydovska said she could feel the air \u201cshake\u201d around her as powerful and loud explosions interrupted the night, forcing her family to go to an underground shelter.",
      "\u201cI feel numb inside,\u201d Davydovska, 36, said in an interview on WhatsApp messenger after the attack. \u201cIt\u2019s too much pain we are carrying every day, and it feels like it will not be over, never. I am not angry or fed up, I am desperate.\u201d",
      "Russia has been pummeling Ukraine with near-daily drone and missile strikes, killing and wounding civilians.",
      "The Russian Defense Ministry said Friday that forces targeted Ukraine\u2019s \u201cmilitary-industrial complex and energy infrastructure\u201d with \u201chigh-precision long-range weapons.\u201d It made no mention of civilian sites hit.",
      "The Kremlin has repeatedly said its only targets are linked to Kyiv\u2019s war effort, but it has relentlessly targeted Ukraine's energy sector in a bid to plunge the country into the cold and dark ahead of winter.",
      "\u201cWe are used to everything. The strikes come, we get scared but life continues,\u201d Chakrygina said, reciting the motto that gets her through the relentless attacks.",
      "But while civilians simply try to survive, there was public anger this week after Ukraine\u2019s justice minister was suspended Wednesday in an investigation into an alleged $100 million kickback scheme in the country\u2019s energy sector.",
      "German Galushchenko was removed from office after anti-corruption authorities said they exposed a scheme which allegedly saw current and former officials, and businesspeople  receive benefits and launder money through the country\u2019s state energy company, Energoatom, authorities said.",
      "Five people have been arrested and another seven were placed under suspicion, according to a statement Tuesday from Ukraine\u2019s National Anticorruption Bureau, the NABU, and Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor\u2019s Office, SAPO.",
      "Zelenskyy said in a statement on Telegram on Wednesday that those involved \u201ccannot remain in their positions,\u201d adding: \u201cThis is a matter of trust in particular. If there are accusations, they must be answered.\u201d",
      "Davydovska called the scandal \u201cdemotivating,\u201d although she said   she was encouraged that the corruption was uncovered and investigated.",
      "\u201cWe have a joke \u2014 Ukraine is the richest country: no matter how much is stolen, there is still money here,\u201d she said. But on a more serious note, she added that Ukrainians had been fundraising for the army for the last four years, \u201cwhile some bastards are doing such things.\u201d",
      "Chakrygina meanwhile, said she was hopeful that peace can be reached. \u201cWe don\u2019t believe anymore in Vuhledar, in our [Donetsk] region, because Vuhledar has been erased from the face of the Earth. But we want to at least live here [in Kyiv],\u201d she said.",
      "It\u2019s her three children that keep her going every day, she said. \u201cThey need their future. They need to live without war,\u201d she added.",
      "Daryna Mayer reported from Kyiv. Yuliya Talmazan from London."

      "BOGOTA, Colombia \u2014 Intelligence \u201cis not for killing,\u201d Colombian President Gustavo Petro told NBC News in a wide-ranging interview Wednesday, explaining his decision to stop sharing information with the United States in opposition to lethal strikes on boats allegedly carrying illegal drugs.",
      "Describing President Donald Trump as a \u201cbarbarian\u201d who \u201cwants to frighten us,\u201d Petro, a former Marxist revolutionary and one of the few international leaders willing to openly criticize his American counterpart, called the U.S. military buildup in the Caribbean \u201cundoubtedly an aggression against Latin America.\u201d",
      "Colombia would not \u201cpass on the information because we would be collaborating with a crime against humanity,\u201d he told NBC News at the presidential palace in Bogota, reiterating a decision announced earlier this week.",
      "Acknowledging \u201cthe most key thing is intelligence\u201d in combating the drug trade, he added, \u201cThe more we coordinate intelligence, the better. That is what I have been doing. But intelligence is not for killing.\u201d",
      "Tensions have risen dramatically between Trump and Petro in recent weeks over the issue of American military attacks against boats allegedly carrying illegal narcotics in the Caribbean and the eastern Pacific, which have killed dozens. At least 19 strikes have been carried out so far, according to Reuters.",
      "Trump has justified them by saying the United States is in \u201carmed conflict\u201d with drug cartels and claiming the boats are operated by foreign terror organizations that are flooding America\u2019s cities with drugs.",
      "But his administration has provided no evidence for these assertions and lawmakers, including Republicans, have pressed for more information on who is being targeted and the legal justification for the strikes.",
      "A White House official said in an email Thursday that it was \u201chardly surprising\u201d that Petro was opposed to Trump\u2019s \u201csuccessful operations to halt the flow of drugs to our country.\u201d They added that Trump had directed the actions \u201cconsistent with his responsibility to protect Americans and United States interests abroad and in furtherance of United States national security and foreign policy interests.\u201d",

      "After Petro called a U.S. strike \u201cmurder\u201d in a post on X, Trump said he would cut aid and raise tariffs on Colombia. The Treasury Department subsequently hit his Colombian counterpart and members of his family with sanctions.",
      "Petro then announced this week that he was suspending intelligence sharing with Washington.",
      "The United Kingdom has also stopped sharing intelligence because of concerns about the legality of U.S. strikes, two sources with knowledge of the matter told NBC News.",

      "Petro did not say definitively that the boats that have been recently attacked were not carrying drugs. \u201cMaybe or maybe not. We do not know,\u201d he said. \u201cAccording to due process, the civilized treatment of people, they \u200bshould be seized and detained.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey are poor boatmen, they know how to drive a boat, they are hired in their poverty by the gangsters. But gangsters don\u2019t sit on the boats,\u201d he said. \u201cThen when one of those missiles arrives [it] kills that boatman. It doesn\u2019t kill the drug trafficker.\u201d",
      "His government, he said, \u201chas seized more cocaine than any other government in world history. Trump\u2019s insult is at odds reality, how can he call the largest destroyer of cocaine a chief trafficker?\u201d",
      "Petro strongly denied Trump\u2019s personal accusations, calling the president \"lost\" and suggesting that he was being misled by other U.S. officials on the issue. \u201cHe is lost on the issue of the real analysis of what is going on with cocaine in Colombia.\u201d",
      "Petro, who considers himself a left-wing revolutionary, added, \u201cHe is a barbarian, but anyone can change.\u201d",
      "The Colombian president is not the only leader in the region feeling pressure. Trump has also singled out the president of neighboring Venezuela, Nicolas Maduro, as a target for his ire and leveled accusations of complicity in the drug trade against him, too.",

      "SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 All five members of the K-pop girl group NewJeans say they plan to return to their record label after losing a long-running legal battle to leave over what they said was mistreatment and harassment.",
      "The band, one of the top-selling acts in the world, announced its intention to return to the label, Ador, in separate statements on Wednesday, with Haerin and Hyein confirming their decision first, followed by the other three members, Danielle, Minji and Hanni, according to South Korean news agency Yonhap.",
      "Last year, NewJeans unilaterally announced a split from Ador, citing the agency\u2019s alleged failure to protect its members following the dismissal of Min Hee-jin, the former chief executive of Ador and the group\u2019s mentor. Ador denied the allegations.",
      "Last month, a South Korean court rejected NewJeans\u2019 argument, ruling that its exclusive contract with Ador remains valid as Min being CEO is not necessarily part of Ador\u2019s contractual obligations.",
      "Ador, which is based in Seoul, confirmed the return of Haerin and Hyein and said it was checking on the return of the other three members.",
      "\u201cAdor is committed to providing its full support to Haerin and Hyein to ensure the seamless continuation of their artistic endeavors,\u201d the label said in a statement. \u201cWe request the warm support from the fans and respectfully urge you to avoid engaging in unfounded speculation regarding the members.\u201d",
      "Shortly after Ador\u2019s announcement, the remaining three members, Danielle, Minji and Hanni, said they were also returning to the label after \u201cprudent consultations,\u201d Yonhap reported.",
      "\u201cOne member is currently in Antarctica, and thus our stance was delivered late,\u201d they said in a statement. \u201cAs Ador is currently not responding, we are notifying it individually.\u201d",
      "In March, NewJeans announced a pause on all independent activities under its new name \u201cNJZ\u201d during a concert in Hong Kong, to the surprise of global fans and supporters. The announcement came after a ruling by a Seoul court in favor of Ador, which had filed an injunction against the group\u2019s independent activities.",
      "The group said it did not regret the choice to break from Ador \u201cat all\u201d and that they had to \u201cspeak up to protect the values\u201d they believe in.",
      "After the court ruling in late October that upheld NewJeans\u2019 exclusive contract with Ador, the members said they planned to appeal \u201cimmediately.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt is impossible to return to Ador and continue normal entertainment activities under the current circumstances, where trust between the parties has completely broken down,\u201d the group said.",
      "NewJeans, which debuted in 2022, is known for songs combining pop and R&B music. Billboard named it \u201cone of the most recognized and most influential groups in pop\u201d in 2023.",
      "It also broke the Guinness World Record for the fastest K-pop act to reach 1 billion streams on Spotify, surpassing K-pop veterans BTS and Blackpink."

    "summary": "A flu strain that emerged over the summer is causing outbreaks in other countries. The CDC hasn't provided any insights on what's happening in the U.S. in weeks.",
    "story": [
      "As flu season gets underway, global health experts are increasingly worried about a new strain of the virus that popped up in June \u2014 four months after the makeup of this year\u2019s flu shots had been decided.",
      "The new strain, a version of H3N2, is causing outbreaks in Canada and the U.K., where health officials are warning about the early wave that\u2019s sending people to the hospital.",
      "\u201cSince it emerged, it\u2019s rapidly spreading and predominating in some countries so far in the Northern Hemisphere,\u201d Dr. Wenqing Zhang, head of the World Health Organization\u2019s Global Respiratory Threats Unit, said Wednesday during a media briefing.",
      "The version of H3N2 that\u2019s circulated worldwide this year \u201cacquired 7 new mutations over the summer,\u201d Antonia Ho, a consultant in infectious diseases at Scotland\u2019s University of Glasgow, said in a media statement. That \u201cmeans the virus is quite different to the H3N2 strain included in this year\u2019s vaccine,\u201d she said.",
      "The U.K. is heading \u201cinto what looks set to be a cruel winter, with flu cases being triple what they were this time last year,\u201d the head of the U.K.\u2019s National Health Service, James Mackey, said last week.",
      "It\u2019s picking up in Canada, too, said Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at the University of Saskatchewan. H3N2 is generally thought to cause more illness and be worse for older adults than other strains. Japan is also experiencing an unusually early and harsh flu season that\u2019s \u201cunprecedented,\u201d Rasmussen said.",
      "Japanese news outlet Nippon TV reported that as of Nov. 4, flu cases in Tokyo had surged to nearly six times the level seen at this time last year, according to the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare. More than 2,300 day cares and schools in the country were at least partially closed because of the outbreak, the outlet reported.",
      "\u201cThese are not good signs,\u201d Rasmussen said.",
      "Is this flu strain already in the U.S.?",
      "H3N2 is an A strain of influenza. While there are plenty of anecdotal reports of people testing positive for flu A across the country, the insights stop there.",
      "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention hasn\u2019t provided a detailed, national report on flu activity since Sept. 26 because of the government shutdown.",
      "Even if it reopens in the coming days, Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious diseases expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee, said that the \u201chollowing out\u201d of the CDC in the form of massive layoffs could further delay flu data collection and analysis. Earlier this year, the Department of Health and Human Services announced it would cut up to 10,000 full-time jobs in the public health sector.",
      "\u201cWe are going to be dependent on state laboratories and academic laboratories for these investigations and report them out,\u201d Schaffner said. \u201cThe information will not be as comprehensive, centralized and as quickly analyzed and communicated from the CDC as we have had in previous years.\u201d",
      "Will this year\u2019s flu shot be helpful?",
      "Global health officials and drugmakers select which viral strain to include in fall flu vaccines for the Northern Hemisphere each year in February, based on which types are circulating in the Southern Hemisphere. This year\u2019s flu shots protect against three strains of influenza, including two types of influenza A and one type of influenza B.",
      "The annual flu shot doesn\u2019t prevent people from getting infected with the flu. It\u2019s mainly used to lessen the severity of the illness. Last year, the vaccine was up to 55% effective in keeping adults with the flu out of the hospital.",
      "On Tuesday, health authorities in the U.K. published preliminary evidence that this year\u2019s vaccine is up to 40% effective in preventing hospitalization among adults.",
      "Schaffner encouraged people to get the shot anyway.",
      "\u201cAll of the data over previous decades shows that even if there is not a close match, use of the vaccine continues to prevent hospitalizations, intensive care unit admissions and continues to help keep people out of the cemetery,\u201d he said."

      "Masked Israeli settlers attacked Palestinians and set fire to property in a pair of villages in the occupied West Bank on Tuesday before clashing with Israeli soldiers sent to break up their rampage, the Israeli military and Palestinian officials said.",
      "\u201cFour Palestinians were injured and evacuated for medical treatment,\u201d the Israel Defense Forces said in a statement Tuesday. Security forces used \u201criot dispersal means\u201d to break up the mob in the Beit Lid and Deir Sharaf villages \u201cand apprehended several Israeli citizens,\u201d the statement added.",

      "The Palestinian Red Crescent said it treated three people who had been beaten with sticks and stones. Israeli police said four Israeli suspects were arrested and held for questioning.",
      "The Palestinian economy ministry said in a statement that preliminary investigations had revealed the attackers had targeted warehouses belonging to a food production company \u201cand smashed windows and other property.\u201d Four trucks and two vehicles belonging to employees had been set on fire, the statement added.",
      "Israeli President Isaac Herzog in a post on X condemned what he called the \u201cshocking and serious\u201d attacks. \u201cSuch violence against civilians and IDF soldiers crosses a red line and I strongly condemn it,\u201d he wrote.",
      "Settler violence has surged since the war in the Gaza Strip erupted just over two years ago. On Friday, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said settlers staged at least 264 attacks on Palestinians in October \u2014 the highest monthly tally since the U.N. began tracking incidents in 2006.",
      "Palestinians and human rights workers accuse the Israeli army and police of failing to halt attacks by settlers, which have intensified in recent weeks as Palestinians harvest their olive trees.",
      "Several senior members of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s government have close ties to West Bank settlers, including his ultranationalist National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, a hard-line settler leader who oversees the police.",
      "News of the attacks came after the Palestinian branch of the Switzerland-based nongovernmental child rights organization Defense for Children International said in a statement that it had obtained documentation that showed a 13-year-old boy had died on Tuesday of tear gas inhalation.",
      "Aysam Jihad Labib Naser was harvesting olives with his family on Oct. 11 in the north of the West Bank \u201cwhen Israeli soldiers heavily bombarded the area with tear gas and fired several tear gas canisters.\u201d",
      "This had caused \u201chim to choke severely and collapse,\u201d the statement said. Although he was transferred to a nearby hospital, he remained in \u201ccritical condition in the cardiac intensive care unit until he died,\u201d it added.",
      "A spokesperson for the IDF said, \u201cThe details of the incident are under review by the relevant authorities.\u201d",
      "Elsewhere, the Zikim crossing in northern Gaza was opened on Wednesday to allow humanitarian aid trucks into the enclave, COGAT, the Israeli military\u2019s arm that oversees aid flows, said in a statement.",
      "U.N. aid agencies have been calling for the reopening of the crossing for more aid to flow into the devastated northern part of the enclave, especially after last month\u2019s ceasefire between Israel and Hamas.",
      "Herzog\u2019s office confirmed Wednesday that he had received a letter from President Donald Trump urging him to consider granting a pardon to Netanyahu in his long-running corruption trial.",
      "\u201cWhile I absolutely respect the independence of the Israeli Justice System, and its requirements, I believe that this \u2018case\u2019 against Bibi, who has fought alongside me for a long time, including against the very tough adversary of Israel, Iran, is a political, unjustified prosecution,\u201d Trump said, using Netanyahu\u2019s nickname in the letter shared by Herzog\u2019s office.",
      "Trump has repeatedly asked for a pardon for his close ally. Netanyahu denies the charges and has pleaded not guilty.",
