      "Rosal\u00eda has won over millions of music lovers for her fusions of flamenco and urban Latin beats",
      "BARCELONA, Spain -- And Rosal\u00eda said, \u201cLet there be Lux.\u201d",
      "Rosal\u00eda, the global Spanish pop star loved by millions for fusing flamenco with Latin hip-hop and reggaeton, has amazed her fans with a radical shift.",
      "The singer and songwriter\u2019s new album, \u201cLux\u201d (\u201cLight\u201d in Latin), is unabashedly spiritual. Fifteen songs, sung in 13 different languages, including fragments in Latin, Arabic and Hebrew, are laden with a yearning for the divine.",
      "And it is receiving praise from on high.",
      "Xabier G\u00f3mez Garc\u00eda, bishop of Sant Feliu de Llobregat which includes Rosal\u00eda\u2019s hometown of Sant Esteve Sesrovires near Barcelona, was one of the first church leaders to laud her work in an open letter to his flock. Rosal\u00eda\u2019s grandmother regularly attends mass in Sant Esteve Sesrovires, according to the diocese.",
      "In an interview with The Associated Press, G\u00f3mez said that while some of her songs were \u201cprovocative,\u201d Rosal\u00eda \u201cspeaks with absolute freedom and without hang-ups about what she feels God to be, and the desire, the thirst (to know God).\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen I listened to \u2018Lux\u2019 and Rosal\u00eda speaking about her the context of her album and the creative process, I found myself faced with a process and a work that transcended the musical. Here was a spiritual search through the testimonies of women of immense spiritual maturity,\u201d he said.",
      "From her opening lyrics sung over piano and mournful cello, \u201cWho could live between the two/ First love the world and later love God,\u201d Rosal\u00eda announces that this album is a rupture from its Grammy-winning predecessors. \u201cEl mal querer (\u00a8The Bad Loving\u201d in Spanish) and \u201c Motomami \" had established Rosal\u00eda as one of the leading artists in the Spanish music world with her experimental urban beats.",
      "Despite \u2014 or thanks to \u2014 its diversity of styles and song forms, ranging from classical strings, snippets of electronica with a cameo by Bj\u00f6rk, a boys' choir from a thousand-year-old monastery, an aria-like song in Italian, a Portuguese fado and, of course, modern flamenco and hip-hop beats, \u201cLux\u201d is off to a powerful start among listeners. It has four songs in Spotify\u2019s Top 50 global chart for this week, more than any artist, including Taylor Swift.",
      "Madonna has declared herself a fan of \"Lux,\" and composer Andrew Lloyd Webber has lavishly called it the \u201calbum of the decade.\u201d",
      "Rosal\u00eda, 33, has said that after her success in more popular music forms, she let her long-held longing for the spiritual guide her in making \u201cLux.\u201d",
      "\u201cIn the end, in an age that seems not to be the age of faith or certainty or truth, there is more need than ever for a faith, or a certainty, or a truth,\" she told reporters in Mexico City last month.",
      "She said that she was guided by the concept that \u201can artist doubts less of his vocation when he works in the service of God than when he works in the service of him or herself.\u201d",
      "Rosal\u00eda apparently has not had a revelatory \u201ccome-to-Jesus\u201d moment common among evangelical believers in America. Like many Spaniards, she grew up in a once staunchly Catholic Spain that has quickly secularized in recent decades, especially among the younger generations, leaving churches mostly to elderly parishioners.",
      "Even her early music flirted with medieval religious poetry, including one video clip from 2017 when she set a poem by 16th-century Spanish poet Saint John of the Cross to music.",
      "While embracing Catholic symbols and expressing a fascination with female saints, Rosal\u00eda seems to eschew strictly organized practice and draws inspiration from other religions, as well. \u201cLux\u201d responds to that diversity of interest, at one point quoting a Sufi poetess.",

      "\u201cI have read much more than I did years ago, reading many hagiographies of feminine saints from around the world,\u201d she said. \u201cThey accompanied me throughout this process.\u201d",
      "Her style has also morphed. Gone are the hip-hop fashion and long fake nails Rosal\u00eda sported only a few years ago when she took the Latin Grammys by storm. Contrast that now with her look on the \u201cLux\u201d album cover, where she is dressed in a solid white nun's veil with her arms apparently trapped inside a white top, her gaze averted.",
      "Despite the potentially controversial move of comparing God to an obsessed lover in the song \u201cDios es un stalker\" (\"God Is a Stalker\" in Spanish), Rosal\u00eda has won over the equivalent of the Vatican's culture minister.",
      "Cardinal Jos\u00e9 Tolentino de Mendon\u00e7a, prefect of the Vatican Dicastery for Culture and Education, told Spanish news agency EFE this month that Rosal\u00eda has detected a wider dissatisfaction with the secular world.",
      "\u201cWhen a creator like Rosal\u00eda speaks of spirituality,\u201d he said, \u201cit means that she captures a profound need in contemporary culture to approach spirituality, to cultivate an inner life.\u201d",
      "Among the songs about faith, Rosal\u00eda found the time to deliver tunes like \u201cLa Perla\" (\"The Pearl\" in Spanish) that dishes out scorn for a former lover.",
      "That deft mix of both high and pop culture is part of the allure of \u201cLux,\u201d said Josep Oton, professor of religious history for the ISCREB theology school in Barcelona.",
      "\u201cShe has succeeded in making popular music with very deep cultural roots,\u201d Oton told the AP. \u201cAnyone can listen to it, and people with different backgrounds can take away different things. It is pop music, but it is profound.\u201d",
      "\u201cLux\u201d can be intimidating for listeners, both due to its elaborate orchestration and smattering of esoteric lyrics that Rosal\u00eda was inspired to write after reading medieval mystical poets and their accounts of undergoing a transformative union with God through deep prayer and meditation.",
      "In the exhilarating \u201cReliquia\u201d (\u201cRelic\u201d in Spanish), Rosal\u00eda compares herself to female saints, listing the parts of her body and life she has left in cities around the world as relics for others\u2019 keeping. Her \u201cMio Cristo Piange Diamanti,\u201d (\"My Christ Weeps Diamonds\" in Italian), brims with the extravagant Baroque image of the jewels dripping from the eyes of the Messiah.",
      "In \u201cDivinize,\u201d Rosal\u00eda sings of the \u201cdivina buidor\u201d (\u201cdivine emptiness\u201d in Catalan), a central concept of medieval mysticism which focused on how the soul must experience abandonment to open a space where God can enter.",
      "Victoria Cirlot, professor of humanities at Barcelona\u2019s Pompeu Fabra University and expert in medieval feminine mystical tradition, liked \u201cLux\u201d for its ability to introduce complex religious concepts to the general public, while noting it is \u201ca minimalist\u201d sample of the mystical tradition.",
      "Cirlot said the moving \u201cLa Yugular\u201d (\u201cThe Jugular\u201d in Spanish) is rich in mystical thought because the throat, the home of the voice and the breath, is associated in many religious traditions as the body\u2019s door to the divine.",
      "But, for Cirlot, it\u2019s the entire package that makes \u201cLux\u201d so impactful.",
      "\u201cRosal\u00eda is not just a great singer; she is a great actress, and her body language is full of these mystical gestures like contorting her face in an expression of ecstasy, of staring into nothing,\u201d Cirlot said. \u201cAnd then we have her amazing voice, which creates a sense of flight.\u201d",

      "Born in Milan in 1937, Vanoni's first love was the theater, which culminated with performances on the Broadway stage in 1964. But her passion for music combined with what LaPresse described as a \u201chighly personal and sophisticated performing style\u201d and vast repertoire from jazz to pop led her to collaborate with some of the most important songwriters in Italy and abroad.",

    "story": [
      "\"Wicked: For Good \u2014 The Soundtrack\" offers a fresh take on the original musical's second act",
      "Are you ready for more \u201cWicked\"? \u201cWicked: For Good \u2014 The Soundtrack\" offers a bulked-up take on the music of the original \u201cWicked\u201d musical's second act, grounded in yet-again stellar vocals from Cynthia Erivo as a misunderstood but defiant Elphaba and Ariana Grande as a conflicted but changing Glinda. New songs and lyrics raise the stakes \u2014 even if the music itself is at times weighed down by the plot it helps move along, like the film it accompanies.",
      "The soundtrack opens with \u201cEvery Day More Wicked,\u201d a lengthened-version of a section of the original Act 2 opener \u201cThank Goodness\u201d with new verses about Elphaba's perceived wickedness and Glinda's presumed goodness set to bold orchestration that matches the first film's opening number, \u201cNo One Mourns the Wicked.\" Drum beats and ensemble singers are the world builders here, twisting the melody into a march.",
      "The album's first solo goes to Michelle Yeoh's Madame Morrible, the sorceress at the center of a propaganda campaign against Elphaba \u2014 a choice that works for the plot, but which offsets the power of Erivo and Grande's forthcoming vocals. They are introduced later, through brief interpolations of the Act 1 showstoppers \u201cThe Wizard and I\" and \u201cPopular.\" All of that makes for a dynamic film opener \u2014 but is more fractured in audio form, sans the sumptuous visuals and character reveals that tie those musical references together on screen.",
      "Fortunately, \u201cThank Goodness / I Couldn't Be Happier\u201d quickly follows, bringing Grande center-stage \u2014 and providing a rare-here opportunity for her soprano head-voice to give way to a deeper belt (her passionate tone, like other Glindas before her, turns this almost nonsensical lyric, \"There are bridges you cross you didn\u2019t know you crossed until you've crossed them,\" into a revelation). That's not the last we hear from this capital \u201cG\u201d Good, Glinda. \u201cWonderful,\u201d usually a duet between Elphaba and the Wizard of Oz, is \u2018Galinda-fied,\u2019 with Grande adding welcome harmonies \u2014 and a brief \u201cDefying Gravity\u201d interlude \u2014 to Jeff Goldblum's Wizard romp.",
      "It was always going to be hard for this album to live up to the soundtrack of the first \u201cWicked,\u201d which ended with Erivo\u2019s take on the iconic \u201cDefying Gravity\" battle cry, and saw Grande own the over-the-top glitz of \u201cPopular.\" But that grandness is replicated in key moments: In Grande's operatic soprano, in Erivo and Jonathan Bailey's sensual \u201cAs Long As You're Mine,\" in which Bailey as Fiyero manages to keep up with Erivo's beckoning vocals, and in \u201cNo Good Deed,\" the album's sonic peak.",
      "At 44 minutes and 52 seconds, the soundtrack adds over 15 minutes of music to the runtime of the original Broadway cast recording's second act. That includes two brand new songs written for the film (making them eligible for Oscar consideration), one for Erivo\u2019s Elphaba and one for Grande\u2019s Glinda. In lengthening the shorter second act into a 2 hour and 17 minute long film, director Jon M. Chu stretches some of these songs across scenes, filling them out with dialogue, additional verses from composer and lyricist Stephen Schwartz and additional scoring from composer John Powell. All of that is a double-edged sword (broom? wand?), at times deflating the power of the tight original tracks, at others adding felt emotional stakes ripe for satisfying listening.",
      "For example: Some of the drama of Marissa Bode, Ethan Slater and Erivo's \u201cWicked Witch of the East,\u201d a song performed on Broadway that was also left off the original cast recording, is weakened by which pieces of the interspersed dialogue remain, and which don't, in the soundtrack version of the song. Like the Tin Man, it feels a bit piecemeal.",
      "But the new tracks are highlights, fleshing out the album. Erivo's \u201cNo Place Like Home\u201d pulls on the iconic line said by Dorothy in \u201cThe Wizard of Oz,\" providing this Oz-inspired show its take on the theme, like another Oz-inspired show, \u201cThe Wiz,\u201d found before. (\"Home,\" that show's nod to the line, was sung by Erivo at this year's Oscars ceremony). The song is the most inherently political, a timely tale of borders, defiance and community. It starts with Erivo's voice almost isolated, strings swelling behind her, and ends with the first of her transcendent vocal runs, restored to a full open note (after being cut short by the Cowardly Lion on screen) in the album.",
      "That power is felt tenfold in Erivo's take on \u201cNo Good Deed.\" The film may belong to Glinda\u2019s emotional trajectory, but it is Erivo who steals the soundtrack's climax. Drums return as the agony heard in her voice intensifies, the strings crescendoing with her final call.",
      "Glinda's emotional journey may at first be more subtle, but Grande portrays it deftly. Airy and introspective, \u201cGirl in the Bubble\u201d serves as turning point, filling in gaps about Glinda's internal reckoning. Her voice is restrained but emotional, Schwartz's lyrics straightforward with a cheese that feels earned, and thus earnest. This is Glinda after all, not Grande.",
      "Both songs boost the emotional payoff of the character\u2019s finale duet, the fan-beloved tear-jerker \u201cFor Good.\" And it's no surprise, years into their own journey with the characters, that Erivo and Grande nail the chemistry of their character's friendship.",

      "\u201cKramer/Fauci\u201d will star Tony-winner Will Brill from \u201cStereophonic\u201d and Thomas Jay Ryan, who starred in the film \u201cHenry Fool.\u201d It will play The Jack H. Skirball Center for the Performing Arts between Feb. 11-21, The AP has learned.",
      "Fish, whose 2019 production of Rodgers and Hammerstein\u2019s \u201cOklahoma!\u201d won the Tony Award for best musical revival, is using the transcript of a 1993 C-Span face-off between the two men as the text of the play, which included call-ins from across the country.",

That\u2019s really where I\u2019m coming from,\u201d said Fish.",
      "Kramer and Fauci went from adversaries to friends as they confronted the AIDS crisis from different sides in the 1980s and '90s. Kramer, who wrote \u201cThe Normal Heart\u201d and founded the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power, or ACT UP, demanded the government do more and faster for those with symptoms.",
      "Fauci, the longtime director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, insisted on a pragmatic approach. He would became a lightning rod again as leader of the national response to the coronavirus pandemic in 2020.",

And that is a terrible position to be in.\u201d",

      "Natalie Paine is a French horn player in New Zealand\u2019s navy who since October has been among 21 military members stationed in Antarctica. There, her melodies drift across the frozen Ross Sea from perhaps the most remote practice room on Earth.",

      "It\u2019s a consuming job, worked in six-day stretches that leave little time for music. Paine monitors radio, phone, email and other communications traffic at New Zealand\u2019s mission at Scott Base, sometimes speaking to people on the ice who haven\u2019t heard other voices for weeks.",
      "In whatever window she can find, Paine squeezes in scales and mouth exercises, going to great lengths not to disturb others on round-the-clock shifts. That means slipping out of the main base to a hut built in 1957 under the leadership of explorer Sir Edmund Hillary as New Zealand established its presence in Antarctica.",

      "\u201cKPop Demon Hunters\u201d is one step closer to another golden moment: The Oscars. The Netflix phenomenon is among 35 films features eligible for the animated feature film category at the 98th Academy Awards.",
      "The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences released on Friday lists of all the films eligible for animated, documentary and international feature prizes at next year\u2019s Oscars.",
      "Though \u201cKPop Demon Hunters\u201d made its name on Netflix, it also received a qualifying theatrical run in New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco in June, which satisfied the film academy\u2019s requirements for Oscar consideration. Its UK theatrical run was not enough to qualify for the BAFTAs, however.",
      "Other animated titles that qualified for the Oscars animated feature category were Neon\u2019s \u201cArco,\u201d Disney\u2019s \u201cElio\u201d and \u201cZootopia 2,\u201d GKids\u2019 \u201cLittle Am\u00e9lie or the Character of Rain,\u201d Netflix\u2019s \u201cIn Your Dreams\u201d and Crunchyroll/Sony\u2019s \u201cDemon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba Infinity Castle\u201d and \u201cChainsaw Man \u2013 The Movie: Reze Arc.\u201d Notably, the Chinese blockbuster \u201cNe Zha 2\u201d was not among the 35 titles listed.",
      "\u201cKPop Demon Hunters,\u201d which Netflix has said is its most watched film of all time, has amassed more than 541 million hours viewed worldwide. It\u2019s the highest charting soundtrack of 2025 with eight of its songs landing on the Billboard Hot 100. It also made a splash in theaters in August where it was estimated to have made around $18 million (which would have topped the charts if Netflix released theatrical earnings) and got a subsequent release over Halloween weekend. Netflix won their first animated feature Oscar in 2022 for \u201cGuillermo del Toro\u2019s Pinocchio.\u201d",
      "There are also 201 documentaries and 86 international features eligible, including \u201cSentimental Value\u201d (Norway), \u201cSir\u00e2t\u201d (Spain), \u201cThe Secret Agent\u201d (Brazil), \u201cIt Was Just an Accident\u201d (France), \u201cThe Voice of Hind Rajab\u201d (Tunisia) and \u201cMy Father\u2019s Shadow\u201d (United Kingdom). \u201c2000 Meters to Andriivka,\u201d a co-production between the AP and PBS Frontline, is eligible in both categories. Both documentary and international titles will be winnowed to a 10-film shortlist that will be revealed on Dec. 16.",

      "Max Hollein, CEO and director of the Met, said in an interview ahead of Monday\u2019s announcement that he hopes the exhibit will take visitors to the New York museum on a (very fashionable) journey through art history, where they will see connections throughout.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a show that can really live in fascinating ways at the museum and can pull from all different areas of our collection \u2014 paintings, sculpture, drawings,\u201d Hollein said.",

      "The new show will examine the dressed body, and will be organized thematically by different body types, according to the Costume Institute's curator in charge, Andrew Bolton. It will include the \u201cNaked Body\u201d and the \u201cClassical Body,\u201d for example, but also less expected themes like the \u201cPregnant Body\u201d and the \u201cAging Body.\u201d",
      "The connections that will be drawn between artworks and garments will range, curators said in a statement, \u201cfrom the formal to the conceptual, the aesthetic to the political, the individual to the universal, the illustrative to the symbolic, and the playful to the profound.\u201d",
      "One example: in the \u201cNaked Body\u201d section, a 1504 print from German artist Albrecht D\u00fcrer will be paired with spandex bodysuits by Belgian designer Walter Van Beirendonck from a 2009 collection that revisits the story of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden.",

      "\u201cMaking movies is not what I do, it's who I am,\u201d said Cruise. He was composed as always, but at moments seemed near tears as he spoke, grasping the gold honorary statuette that celebrated his more than 40 years at the apex of the industry at the film academy's annual Governors Awards.",
      "\u201cIn that theater we laugh together, we feel together, we hope together,\u201d he said after a two-minute ovation.",
      "Production designer Wynn Thomas and choreographer and actor Debbie Allen were also selected by the academy's board of governors to be honored for their storied careers, and an absent Dolly Parton was honored for a lifetime of philanthropy at the ceremony at the Ray Dolby Ballroom in Los Angeles.",
      "A competitive Oscar has eluded Cruise, who's been nominated four times: as an actor for 1989\u2019s \u201cBorn on the Fourth of July,\u201d 1996\u2019s \u201cJerry Maguire\u201d and 1999\u2019s \u201cMagnolia,\u201d and as a producer for 2022\u2019s \u201cTop Gun: Maverick.\u201d",

      "It was fitting that the Governors Awards aren't televised. Tom Cruise doesn't do TV, and he's been among the biggest champions of the theatergoing experience over streaming.",
      "\u201cI will always do everything I can to help this art form,\u201d Cruise said. \u201cTo support and champion new voices, to protect what makes cinema powerful. Hopefully without too many more broken bones.\u201d",
      "Oscar-winning director Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu presented Cruise the award. The two have spent several months shooting a film in London set for release in 2026. The collaboration suggests that Cruise, who has stuck to blockbuster franchise fare in recent years, might not be done trying to win an Academy Award the old-fashioned way.",
      "\u201cThis may be his first Oscar,\u201d I\u00f1\u00e1rritu said, \u201cbut from what I have seen and experienced, this will not be the last.\u201d",
      "The list of stars who attended suggests that the campaign for the next competitive Oscars is low-key underway. The banquet tables were filled with potential nominees, including Leonardo DiCaprio, Michael B. Jordan, Sydney Sweeney, Dwayne Johnson, Ariana Grande and Jacob Elordi.",
      "Here's a look at Sunday night's other honorees:",
      "Allen, 75, has never been nominated for an Oscar. But the multi-hyphenate entertainer has played an integral role in the Oscars show, having choreographed seven ceremonies over the years, four of them nominated for Emmys.",

      "Lidia Bastianich is highlighting community togetherness in her 14th TV special",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Lidia Bastianich grew up in a small town in Italy where neighbors were like extended family. If kids came home from school and mom was out, they went to the neighbors for a snack. If someone had a problem with a sibling, they went next door.",
      "The Emmy Award-winning TV host, author and restaurateur remembers her grandmother making an extra pot for lunch and sending young Lidia next door with it to feed her blind, elderly neighbor, along with a glass of wine.",
      "That sense of community is not specific to Italy, of course. \u201cIt exists in America in smaller situations, but we need to nurture that ever more,\u201d Bastianich says.",
      "She's hoping to spotlight and cultivate togetherness with her 14th TV special, \u201cLidia Celebrates America: A Nation of Neighbors,\u201d which premieres Nov. 25 on PBS and streams on PBS.org.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s my way of really thanking America. I think that there\u2019s no better place in the whole world than the United States of America and somehow it\u2019s been maligned,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat I know is that out there, in the midst of America, there\u2019s a lot of good American people.\u201d",
      "Bastianich travels to wildfire-scarred neighborhoods outside Los Angeles, a pay-how-you-can caf\u00e9 in Denver, a Japanese-American community center in Portland, Oregon, and a first-of-its-kind free grocery market in San Francisco. At every stop, there are hands reaching out to help.",
      "\u201cThat connection makes you feel good, it makes you feel more of a human being. And it gives you back that kind of desire to live on positively,\u201d she says.",
      "The hourlong special starts in Altadena, California, hurting from the recent wildfires. Bastianich joins volunteers making 175 five-course meals that are delivered to victims. One of the volunteers is someone himself living out of his car because the flames had made him homeless.",
      "\u201cI got the shivers. I just needed to hug him,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI know that he needed that. I know he was in his car by himself, and yet he found it within him to give. That takes fortitude. It takes character.\"",
      "She also meets self-taught cook Kiki Ruff in Porter County, Indiana. Ruff hosts a viral TikTok series that helps families struggling with food insecurity stretch their groceries, using recipes from the Depression, recessions and wartime.",
      "In Denver, Bastianich visits a restaurant \u2014 SAME, which stands for So All May Eat \u2014 where guests can offer money, produce or volunteer their time in exchange for a meal.",

      "Bastianich, whose latest book is \u201cLidia\u2019s The Art of Pasta: An Italian Cookbook,\u201d with her daughter, Tanya Bastianich-Manuali, has herself benefited from community aid. She was born in 1947 in Istria, an Italian territory ceded to Yugoslavia after World War II. She spent the first years of her life under communist rule, then fled with her family across the border to Italy. There, they lived in a refugee camp for two years until an aid organization helped bring them to New York in 1958.",
      "Bastianich's last stop is in San Francisco, home of the nation\u2019s first legislatively supported free grocery market, which serves thousands of residents. Shoppers there find shelves full and are free to pick what they want.",
      "\u201cIt was not like just a handout or a box of food. These people came in and they felt good,\u201d Bastianich says. \u201cThey had integrity in going in and choosing what they\u2019re going to eat, not just accepting what was given to them.\u201d",

      "\u201cYou don\u2019t have to give big checks or anything. Do something for your neighbor,\u201d she says. \u201cThat connection makes you feel good. It makes you feel more of a human being. And it sort of gives you back that desire to live on positively.\u201d",

      "George Clooney stars in \"Jay Kelly,\" a film by Noah Baumbach that blurs reality and fiction, says Associated Press critic Mark Kennedy",
      "During his glittering career, George Clooney has played a casino thief, a Batman,a chain-gang convict, an assassin and a high-flying layoff artist. This fall, he's stretching even more, playing an utterly charming and gorgeous movie star. Kidding!",
      "Reality and fiction beautifully weave in and out in \u201cJay Kelly,\u201d director Noah Baumbach's love letter to Hollywood that, in other hands, could so easily have become just a love letter to Clooney.",
      "The script by Baumbach and Emily Mortimer finds Clooney \u2014 sorry, Jay Kelly \u2014 in a sort of midlife funk. He's 60, a universally beloved, deeply earnest movie hunk who has worked his way to the top and found, well, artifice.",
      "\u201cMy life doesn't really feel real,\u201d he says at one point, an actor trained in pretending going meta playing an actor trained in pretending. In another scene he muses: \u201cAll my memories are movies.\u201d",
      "A chance meeting with an old acting partner \u2014 a brilliant Billy Crudup, whose character was betrayed by Kelly years ago \u2014 reveals some unpleasant truths. \u201cIs there a person in there? Maybe you don\u2019t actually exist,\u201d he asks the star, sending Kelly on a journey of self-discovery that just so happens to lead to one of Clooney's favorite places, Italy.",
      "Kelly's careful facade \u2014 the stories he tells about himself \u2014 soon gets chipped away. On his way up the hills of Hollywood, he apparently left some personal carnage behind. \u201cJay Kelly\u201d is about those who sacrificed to get him there.",
      "Adam Sandler and Laura Dern play Kelly's long-suffering manager and publicist, respectively, while his resentful adult daughters are portrayed by Grace Edwards and Riley Keough. Kelly, we learn, put career first and that meant walking away from things like his daughters' school recitals and making his staff miss things like their daughters\u2019 school recitals. \u201cHe's not our family or our friend,\u201d Dern's character screams in despair. \u201cWe're not to him what he is to us.\u201d",
      "You'd expect Clooney to not have to shift out of second gear for this, but he gives a soulful performance, charming enough that his Kelly seduces a trainful of strangers in Italy with his aw-shucks charisma and yet also bristles when his oldest daughter makes him confront her abandonment issues.",
      "\u201cDo you know how I knew you didn't want to spend time with me?\u201d his daughter asks him, before answering in a line that will land like a gut punch with any parent: \u201cBecause you didn't spend time with me.\u201d Another killer: \u201cI wish you were the man I thought you were.\u201d",

There are jokes made about the Method school of acting and being a Dior ambassador, but this is ultimately about mortality and life choices, with one scene actually ending in a cemetery, a little too on the nose.",
      "Kelly melts into past vignettes like watching his own long-ago breakout drama audition and his kids' joyous household revelry. It reaches for the surreal in a mist-filled forest and finds redemption in, of course, a movie theater. A retrospective montage uses such real Clooney roles like \u201cCombat Academy\u201d and \u201cUp in the Air,\u201d further blurring the line between fact and fiction.",

There emerges an off-putting, in-his-own-world Jay Gatsby vibe to him, alluded to by his first name and the name of one of his daughters, Daisy.",

      "Alameddine's speech, like his novel, combined humor and agony.

      "The petition for habeas corpus filed with California's 2nd District Court of Appeal argues that lawyer Philip Cohen did not represent Masterson properly at the 2023 retrial that ended with the actor being convicted of raping two women at his Los Angeles home in 2003. He was sentenced to 30 years to life in prison.",
      "The petition also argues that the trial judge demonstrated a bias against the Church of Scientology, allowing an \u201cunconstitutional intrusion\u201d into the church's doctrine and a misinterpretation of its scripture.",
      "Masterson is a member of the church, whose practices were a major issue at his trial, and the women are former members.",
      "The petition says that Cohen spoke to only two of the 20 potential witnesses brought to his attention by his co-counsel and an investigator. It says the witnesses included some who would have testified that the women spoke favorably of the sexual relationships they had with Masterson. And they included psychological and pharmacological experts who would have testified about the effects of alcohol and drugs on memory.",
      "The court filing says there was \u201cunexpected and unreasonable failure of trial counsel to present any of the mountain of exculpatory evidence\u201d that had been amassed by Masterson's pretrial attorney Shawn Holley, and the result was a violation of his constitutional rights.",
      "Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Charlaine F. Olmedo declined to delay Masterson\u2019s first trial to accommodate Holley\u2019s representation of former Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Trevor Bauer against his own allegations of sexual misconduct. Cohen then took over as lead attorney.",
      "Masterson's first trial ended in a mistrial with a jury unable to reach consensus on any of three rape counts against him. He was promptly retried, and a jury found him guilty of two counts while failing to reach a verdict on the third.",

      "That brings the total award count to 24 for the Oscars broadcast on March 15, where statuettes for best picture, best actor and actress will be among the others awarded.",
      "The board of governors of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences announced the addition of the new prize last year, though it was not confirmed if it would be part of the official broadcast. Not counting the short-lived \u201c popular film Oscar \u201d which never came to be, the addition of the casting prize marked the first time the academy has added a category since best animated feature film was established in 2001. Earlier this year, the organization also revealed plans to add a stunt design award, starting with the 100th Oscars in 2028.",

      "Scientists say the problem is that they are often doing just the opposite by relying on preliminary studies, fringe science or just hunches to make claims, cast doubt on proven treatments or even set policy.",
      "This week, the nation's top public health agency changed its website to contradict the scientific conclusion that vaccines do not cause autism. The move shocked health experts nationwide.",
      "Dr. Daniel Jernigan, who resigned from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in August, told reporters Wednesday that Kennedy seems to be \u201cgoing from evidence-based decision making to decision-based evidence making.\u201d",
      "It was the latest example of the Trump administration's challenge to established science.",
      "In September, the Republican president gave out medical advice based on weak or no evidence. Speaking directly to pregnant women and to parents, he told them not to take acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol. He repeatedly made the fraudulent and long-disproven link between autism and vaccines, saying his assessment was based on a hunch.",

      "At a two-day meeting this fall, Kennedy\u2019s handpicked vaccine advisers to the CDC raised questions about vaccinating babies against hepatitis B, an inoculation long shown to reduce disease and death drastically.",
      "\u201cThe discussion that has been brought up regarding safety is not based on evidence other than case reports and anecdotes,\u201d said Dr. Flor Munoz, a pediatric infectious disease expert at Baylor College of Medicine and Texas Children\u2019s Hospital.",
      "During the country's worst year for measles in more than three decades, Kennedy cast doubt on the measles vaccine while championing unproven treatments and alleging that the unvaccinated children who died were \u201calready sick.\u201d",
      "Scientists say the process of getting medicines and vaccines to market and recommended in the United States has, until now, typically relied on gold standard science. The process is so rigorous and transparent that much of the rest of the world follows the lead of American regulators, giving the OK to treatments only after U.S. approval.",
      "The gold standard can differ because science and medicine is complicated and everything cannot be tested the same way. That term simply refers to the best possible evidence that can be gathered.",
      "\u201cIt completely depends on what question you\u2019re trying to answer,\u201d said Dr. Jake Scott, an infectious disease physician and Stanford University researcher.",
      "There are many different types of studies. The most rigorous is the randomized clinical trial.",
      "It randomly creates two groups of subjects that are identical in every way except for the drug, treatment or other question being tested. Many are \u201cblinded studies,\u201d meaning neither the subjects nor the researchers know who is in which group. This helps eliminate bias.",
      "It is not always possible or ethical to conduct these tests. This is sometimes the case with vaccine trials, \u201cbecause we have so much data showing how safe and effective they are, it would be unethical to withhold vaccines from a particular group,\u201d said Jessica Steier, a public health scientist and founder of the Unbiased Science podcast.",
      "Studying the long-term effect of a behavior can be impossible. For example, scientists could not possibly study the long-term benefit of exercise by having one group not exercise for years.",
      "Instead, researchers must conduct observational studies, where they follow participants and track their health and behavior without manipulating any variables. Such studies helped scientists discover that fluoride reduces cavities, and later lab studies showed how fluoride strengthens tooth enamel.",
      "But the studies have limitations because they can often only prove correlation, not causation. For example, some observational studies have raised the possibility of a link between autism risk and using acetaminophen during pregnancy, but more have not found a connection. The big problem is that those kinds of studies cannot determine if the painkiller really made any difference or if it was the fever or other health problem that prompted the need for the pill.",
      "Scientists can learn even more when they see how something affects a large number of people in their daily lives.",
      "That real-world evidence can be valuable to prove how well something works \u2014 and when there are rare side effects that could never be detected in trials.",
      "Such evidence on vaccines has proved useful in both ways. Scientists now know there can be rare side effects with some vaccines and can alert doctors to be on the lookout. The data has proved that vaccines provide extraordinary protection from disease. For example, measles was eliminated in the U.S. but it still pops up among unvaccinated groups.",

      "Some scientists and medical professionals are more worried about disappointing vaccination rates, a main reason why flu hospitalizations and deaths were unusually bad during last year's flu season \u2014 one of the deadliest this century.",
      "\u201cI think we\u2019re going to see a really severe season,\" said Asefeh Faraz Covelli of the George Washington University School of Nursing.",
      "Last winter, the overall flu hospitalization rate was the highest seen since the H1N1 flu pandemic 15 years ago. Flu was the underlying or a contributing cause of more than 18,000 deaths, and one seven-day stretch early this year saw more than 1,800 deaths \u2014 the highest one-week spike in at least a decade. Child flu deaths also were far higher than usual.",
      "CDC data posted Friday showed low flu activity so far, with only one state \u2014 Louisiana \u2014 reporting moderate activity. Most of the reported infections have been in children, said the CDC's Alicia Budd, who tracks flu infections for the Atlanta-based agency.",
      "Most also have been a new version of the type A H3N2 virus that historically has caused the most hospitalizations and deaths in older people. That type is responsible for most flu infections so far this year, and more than half have been a new subclade K variant that is different from the strain this year's flu shots were built to fight.",
      "A preliminary analysis from the United Kingdom suggests the shots do provide at least partial protection, although it will take some time for scientists to know exactly how effective they are. Experts say any protection that softens the blow of a flu infection is important to get.",

Kennedy Jr. was put in charge of the CDC and other federal health agencies. Kennedy, a leading anti-vaccine activist, has fostered uncertainty about the safety of vaccines, including flu shots that contained a preservative called thimerosal.",
      "Indeed, vaccination rates against COVID-19 clearly continue to plummet, with about 6% of children and 14% of adults up to date on their shots, according to other CDC data posted Friday. Each figure is about 3 percentage points less than it was at this point last fall.",
      "For the flu, vaccination trends are a little muddier. Some sources have suggested flu vaccinations are down. Over two million fewer flu shots were given at U.S. pharmacies through the end of October compared to last year, according to data from IQVIA, a health information and research company.",
      "But the latest CDC data indicates that for children, the vaccination rate this year is about the same as it was at this point last fall, at 34%. And the vaccination rate for adults is up a few percentage points to about 37%, according to the CDC data, which relies on survey information.",
      "It is early in the season and too early to know if the increase will be sustained or what is causing it, CDC officials said.",

      "Sometimes our immune system runs amok and attacks the organ that makes us \u201cus\u201d \u2014 the brain",
      "\u201cMy year of unraveling\u201d is how a despairing Christy Morrill described nightmarish months when his immune system hijacked his brain.",
      "What\u2019s called autoimmune encephalitis attacks the organ that makes us \u201cus,\u201d and it can appear out of the blue.",
      "Morrill went for a bike ride with friends along the California coast, stopping for lunch, and they noticed nothing wrong. Neither did Morrill until his wife asked how it went \u2014 and he'd forgotten. Morrill would get worse before he got better. \u201cUnhinged\u201d and \u201cfighting to see light,\u201d he wrote as delusions set in and holes in his memory grew.",
      "Of all the ways our immune system can run amok and damage the body instead of protecting it, autoimmune encephalitis is one of the most unfathomable. Seemingly healthy people abruptly spiral with confusion, memory loss, seizures, even psychosis.",
      "But doctors are getting better at identifying it, thanks to discoveries of a growing list of the rogue antibodies responsible that, if found in blood and spinal fluid, aid diagnosis. Every year new culprit antibodies are being uncovered, said Dr. Sam Horng, a neurologist at Mount Sinai Health System in New York who has cared for patients with multiple forms of this mysterious disease.",
      "And while treatment today involves general ways to fight the inflammation, two major clinical trials are underway aiming for more targeted therapy.",
      "Still, it's tricky. Symptoms can be mistaken for psychiatric or other neurologic disorders, delaying proper treatment.",
      "\u201cWhen someone\u2019s having new changes in their mental status, they\u2019re worsening and if there\u2019s sort of like a bizarre quality to it, that\u2019s something that kind of tips our suspicion,\u201d Horng said. \u201cIt\u2019s important not to miss a treatable condition.\u201d",
      "With early diagnosis and care, some patients fully recover. Others like Morrill recover normal daily functioning but grapple with some lasting damage \u2014 in his case, lost decades of \u201cautobiographical\u201d memories. This 72-year-old literature major can still spout facts and figures learned long ago, and he makes new memories every day. But even family photos can\u2019t help him recall pivotal moments in his own life.",
      "\u201cI remember \u2018Ulysses\u2019 is published in Paris in 1922 at Sylvia Beach\u2019s bookstore. Why do I remember that, which is of no use to me anymore, and yet I can\u2019t remember my son\u2019s wedding?\u201d Morrill wonders.",
      "Encephalitis means the brain is inflamed and symptoms can vary from mild to life-threatening. Infections are a common cause, typically requiring treatment of the underlying virus or bacteria. But when that's ruled out, an autoimmune cause has to be considered, Horng said, especially when symptoms arise suddenly.",
      "The umbrella term autoimmune encephalitis covers a group of diseases with weird-sounding names based on the antibody fueling it, such as anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis.",
      "While they're not new diseases, that one got a name in 2007 when Dr. Josep Dalmau, then at the University of Pennsylvania, discovered the first culprit antibody, sparking a hunt for more.",
      "That anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis tends to strike younger women and, one of the bizarre factors, it\u2019s sometimes triggered by an ovarian \u201cdermoid\u201d cyst.",
      "How? That type of cyst has similarities to some brain tissue, Horng explained. The immune system can develop antibodies recognizing certain proteins from the growth. If those antibodies get into the brain, they can mistakenly target NMDA receptors on healthy brain cells, sparking personality and behavior changes that can include hallucinations.",
      "Different antibodies create different problems depending if they mostly hit memory and mood areas in the brain, or sensory and movement regions.",
      "Altogether, \u201cfacets of personhood seem to be impaired,\" Horng said.",
      "Therapies include filtering harmful antibodies out of patients' blood, infusing healthy ones, and high-dose steroids to calm inflammation.",
      "Those cyst-related antibodies stealthily attacked Kiara Alexander in Charlotte, North Carolina, who\u2019d never heard of the brain illness.

      "\u201cI\u2019m reentering some real time of fun, joy,\u201d Morrill said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t shooting for that. I just wanted to be alive.\u201d",

      "Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is fending off criticism from his own base as some of the environmental and anti-vaccine activists who propelled him into politics have said they want stronger action against vaccines and pharmaceutical companies",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Robert F. Kennedy Jr. spent a recent Wednesday showered in praise from the vice president and health technology CEOs at a glitzy \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d event in Washington, designed to celebrate the health secretary\u2019s successes and the movement he has built.",
      "Yet online, a different narrative of his tenure was playing out as a small but vocal group of Kennedy\u2019s supporters and former employees assailed top Trump administration advisers, claiming they were sabotaging him and redirecting MAHA away from its original goals.",
      "\u201cMAHA is not MAHA anymore,\u201d Gray Delany, a former Department of Health and Human Services official ousted in August, said in a podcast interview that day. \u201cI\u2019m not there, but what I\u2019ve heard of what\u2019s happening today is not the MAHA that we signed up for.\u201d",
      "The criticisms, which grew loud enough that the health secretary took to social media to defend his colleagues two days later, exposed the cracks that are beginning to form within his coalition as it amasses power and broadens in scope.",
      "Several of the environmental advocates and vaccine skeptics who helped propel Kennedy into politics have become impatient with what they view as inadequate action on their priorities. They\u2019re also wary that the Health Department appears willing to collaborate with pharmaceutical companies, tech firms and other big corporations whose motives they don\u2019t trust.",
      "The fissures pose a threat to the cohesion of a movement that has given President Donald Trump an important ally and Republicans access to a new group of voters. They come as cracks have developed in Trump's own Make America Great Again movement over issues like the Epstein files and the White House's focus on global diplomacy.",
      "In the wider public, MAHA has enjoyed soaring popularity. About two-thirds of Americans said they supported the \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d initiative from the federal government, according to an Ipsos poll from June.",
      "\u201cMAHA\u2019s growth is a sign of its success,\u201d said HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon. \u201cSecretary Kennedy is leading a broad coalition to make Americans healthier, guided by transparency, accountability and measurable results. The movement\u2019s meaning hasn\u2019t changed and it\u2019s stronger than ever.\u201d",
      "Public health researchers say the genius that fuels Kennedy\u2019s movement \u2014 the universal appeal of making Americans healthier \u2014 can also cause conflicts by inviting competing interests.",
      "\u201cThis is a tale as old as time in politics,\u201d said Matt Motta, a professor at Boston University School of Public Health. \u201cThe bigger your tent is, the harder it can be to make everyone happy.\u201d",
      "Kennedy, a longtime environmental lawyer and anti-vaccine activist who helped lead the crusade against COVID-19 shots during the pandemic, has taken many steps to curtail vaccines this year. He pulled $500 million for their development, ousted and replaced every member of a federal vaccine advisory committee and pledged to overhaul a federal program for compensating Americans injured by shots. He also has repeatedly spread false and misleading information about vaccines while in office.",
      "As recently as this week, in a move that thrilled Kennedy's anti-vaccine base, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention changed its website to contradict the longtime scientific conclusion that vaccines do not cause autism.",
      "But many of Kennedy's supporters in what they call the \u201chealth freedom\u201d movement say it\u2019s not enough. Some want punishments for companies that profited from vaccine and mask requirements during the pandemic. Others want mRNA-based COVID-19 shots pulled from the shelves, despite scientific consensus that they have saved millions of lives.",
      "In their attacks on the administration last week, a few MAHA influencers and two fired HHS employees suggested White House chief of staff Susie Wiles and Kennedy\u2019s close adviser, Stefanie Spear, were conspiring to limit Kennedy\u2019s ability to restrict vaccines and crack down on pharmaceutical companies.",
      "Some Kennedy supporters latched on to the claims and pointed to Wiles\u2019 career history at a lobbying firm that has worked with Pfizer as evidence she\u2019s trying to undermine him. They also shared years-old social media posts from Spear criticizing Trump.",
      "Kennedy defended his colleagues in two posts on X, saying the MAHA movement has \u201cno better friend in Washington\u201d than Wiles and that Spear has become a Trump loyalist.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s focus on our extraordinary achievements to date and the monumental work that still needs to be done,\u201d Kennedy wrote. \u201cLet\u2019s build our coalition instead of splintering it.\u201d",
      "Since the \u201cMake America Healthy Again\u201d slogan debuted on the campaign trail last year, Kennedy and Trump have widened the MAHA tent considerably by inviting anyone into the fold who has concerns about Americans\u2019 health, nutrition and chronic disease.",

      "TOKYO -- TOKYO (AP) \u2014 Sanae Takaichi made history by becoming Japan's first female prime minister in October. She must now decide whether she'll break another barrier: the taboo barring women from the sumo ring.",
      "The winner of the Kyushu Grand Sumo Tournament that ends Sunday will be presented with the Prime Minister\u2019s Cup. Some of her male predecessors, including former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, have entered the ring to hand over the cup.",
      "Takaichi, a staunch conservative who supports Japan\u2019s traditional gender and paternalistic values, may not break the taboo. In any case, she won't face a decision on whether to enter the sumo ring this time because she returns a day later from the Group of 20 summit in South Africa.",
      "Her next chance to make a decision will come at the New Year's tournament in Tokyo.",
      "But a debate on the taboo against women likely will continue, in no small part, because a woman now leads Japan. There also is criticism that the ban in sumo and other religious places is out of touch with the changing place of women in Japanese society.",
      "The sumo ring is only part of the controversy.",
      "In Japan, female worshippers have for centuries been banned from certain holy mountains, religious training sessions, temples, shrines and festivals.",
      "Other places in the world have similar taboos, but the one in Japan stems from the belief in female \u201cimpurity\u201d associated with menstruation and childbirth, as well as certain misogynic Buddhist views, says Naoko Kobayashi, an Aichi Gakuin University professor and expert on religion and gender.",
      "The female ban at holy mountains, including Mount Fuji, and religious establishments has been largely eliminated over the years. But it lingers at certain shrines and festivals.",
      "Many of these bans are from the 19th century Meiji era or later, Kobayashi said, and the taboo has been hard to break because women were also kept from political and religious decision-making over the years.",
      "Sumo's origins are linked to rituals for Japan\u2019s indigenous religion of Shinto, which is largely rooted in animism and the belief that thousands of kami, or spirits, inhabit nature. The first sumo matches date back 1,500 years as a ritual dedicated to the kami, with prayers for bountiful harvests, dancing and other performances at shrines.",
      "The dohyo where sumo takes place is an elevated ring made of special clay, with its edge marked by a circle of rice-straw separating the inner sanctuary and the outside world of impurity. It's off-limits to women in professional sumo.",
      "Some experts say sumo follows the Shinto belief in female impurity.",
      "The Japan Sumo Association has denied the female ban is based on the Shinto belief of impurity.",
      "\u201cThis interpretation is a misunderstanding,\u201d said the association chief, Nobuyoshi Hakkaku, in 2018. He said sumo rituals are tied to folk beliefs like being thankful for a good harvest and are not about rigid religious principles.",
      "\u201cWe have consistently denied sexist intentions,\u201d Hakkaku said. \u201cThe rule that makes the dohyo a serious battleground for men is only natural for wrestlers, making the dohyo a male-only world and (leading to) passing down the practice of not having women go up there.\u201d",

Two female medical experts rushed in and started performing first aid as several male sumo officials watched. Two more women tried to join the first-aid effort before announcements demanded the women leave the ring. Sumo officials threw salt afterwards, a gesture of purification.",

      "The sumo association chief apologized over the \u201cfailure to take appropriate action in a life-threatening situation\u201d and for making Nakagawa uncomfortable, and formed a panel of outside experts to examine the female ban. Seven years later, a decision is still pending.",

      "Pope Leo XIV has accepted the resignation of an ailing Spanish bishop who is under church investigation for allegedly sexually abusing a young seminarian in the 1990s",
      "ROME -- ROME (AP) \u2014 Pope Leo XIV on Saturday accepted the resignation of an ailing Spanish bishop who is under church investigation for allegedly sexually abusing a young seminarian in the 1990s, the first known time the new pontiff removed a bishop accused of abuse.",
      "A one-line statement from the Vatican said Leo had accepted the resignation of C\u00e1diz Bishop Rafael Zornoza, 76. It didn't say why, but Zornoza submitted his resignation to the pope last year when he turned 75, the normal retirement age for bishops.",
      "It hadn't been accepted though until the El Pa\u00eds newspaper reported earlier this month that Zornoza had been recently placed under investigation by a church tribunal. The daily, which since 2018 has exposed decades of abuse and cover-up in the Spanish Catholic Church, said Zornoza was accused of abusing a young former seminarian while he was a young priest and directed the diocesan seminary in Getafe.",
      "The report, quoting a letter the former seminarian wrote the Vatican over the summer, said Zornoza fondled him and regularly slept with him from when he was 14-21 years old. The former seminarian\u2019s letter said Zornoza heard his confession and persuaded him to see a psychiatrist to \u201ccure\u201d his homosexuality.",
      "The diocese of C\u00e1diz denied the accusations against Zornoza but confirmed the investigation was being carried out by the church court in Madrid known as the Rota. In a Nov. 10 statement, the diocese said Zornoza was cooperating with the investigation and had suspended his agenda temporarily \u201cto clarify the facts and to undergo treatment for an aggressive form of cancer.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe accusations made, referring to events that took place almost 30 years ago, are very serious and also false,\u201d the statement said.",
      "It is believed to be the first publicly known case of a bishop being retired, and being placed under investigation for alleged abuse abuse, since the Spanish church began reckoning in recent years with a decades-long legacy of abuse and cover-up that have rocked the once-staunchly Catholic Spain.",

      "The family didn't hear from him for months. His only crime, they suspect, was having worked for local humanitarian groups.",
      "Al-Yamani is among dozens of Yemeni workers with aid groups, United Nations agencies and nongovernmental organizations who have been detained since last year by the Houthis in the rebel-held northern part of the country. The crackdown has seen homes and offices raided, families terrorized and smartphones, laptops and documents confiscated.",

      "The raids, which started at the end of May 2024, saw dozens of aid workers arrested, according to a report by Human Rights Watch. For months, their families were not informed of their whereabouts and they had no contact with them, amounting to enforced disappearances, the report says.",
      "Dr. Ali Mudhwahi, 56 and a public health consultant with UNICEF, was also arrested in June 2024. The Houthis raided his office, interrogated him and his colleagues for hours, then blindfolded and took him away.",

      "Since al-Yamani's arrest, the family has seen him once, on Aug. 16. They received instructions from the Houthis to show up at a meeting spot and were driven by bus with blacked-out windows to an unknown location.",
      "Once the bus stopped, al-Yamani was brought in and his wife, mother and son Abdelrahman were able to talk to him for a short while. According to the family, he appeared gaunt and had lost a lot of weight, said Khaled al-Yemeni, adding that he has spoken with his father three times since his arrest.",

      "Najafi said that Iran considers the current situation \u201cfar from normal,\u201d given that safeguarded facilities in Iran that contain \u201cdangerous nuclear material\u201d have been attacked.",

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s plan for ending the war in Ukraine would cede territory to Russia and limit the size of Kyiv\u2019s military, according to a draft proposal obtained by The Associated Press",
      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump's plan for ending the war in Ukraine would cede land to Russia and limit the size of Kyiv's military, according to a draft obtained Thursday by The Associated Press.",
      "The proposal, originating from negotiations between Washington and Moscow, appeared decidedly favorable to Russia, which started the war nearly four years ago by invading its neighbor. If past is prologue, it would seem untenable for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who has opposed Trump's previous calls for territorial concessions.",
      "A side agreement aims to satisfy Ukrainian security concerns by saying a future \u201csignificant, deliberate and sustained armed attack\u201d by Russia would be viewed as \u201cthreatening the peace and security of the transatlantic community.\u201d The agreement, which was detailed by a senior U.S. official who was not authorized to publicly discuss the matter, does not obligate the United States or European allies to intervene on Ukraine's behalf, although it says they would \u201cdetermine the measures necessary to restore security.\u201d",
      "Trump's push to end the war could drive a wedge between himself and European leaders, who are likely to oppose any agreement that could be seen as rewarding Russian President Vladimir Putin for his aggression, leaving him emboldened rather than defeated.",
      "For example, the proposal would not only bar Ukraine from joining NATO but would also prevent the alliance's future expansion. Such a step would be a significant victory for Moscow, which views NATO as a threat.",
      "Putin would also gain ground he has been unable to win on the battlefield. Under the draft, Moscow would hold all the eastern Donbas region, even though approximately 14% still remains in Ukrainian hands. Ukraine's military, currently at roughly 880,000 troops, would be reduced to 600,000.",
      "The proposal opens the door to lifting sanctions on Russia and returning it to what was formerly known as the Group of Eight, which includes many of the world\u2019s biggest economies. Russia was suspended from the annual gathering in 2014 following its annexation of Crimea, a strategically important peninsula on the northern coast of the Black Sea that is internationally recognized as part of Ukraine.",
      "The U.S. team began drawing up the plan soon after U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff held talks with Rustem Umerov, a top adviser to Zelenskyy, according to a senior administration official who was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity. The official added that Umerov agreed to the majority of the plan, after making several modifications, and then presented it to Zelenskyy.",
      "U.S. Army Secretary Dan Driscoll was also in Kyiv on Thursday and discussed the latest draft with Zelenskyy, according to a senior administration official. Zelenskyy offered a measured statement on social media about it but did not directly speak to the substance of the proposal.",
      "\u201cOur teams \u2014 of Ukraine and the United States \u2014 will work on the provisions of the plan to end the war. We are ready for constructive, honest and swift work,\u201d he wrote.",
      "Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s special envoy to Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, has informed the White House he\u2019ll leave his post in January, according to two senior administration officials.",
      "Kellogg was initially named special envoy for Ukraine and Russia during Trump\u2019s presidential transition. But his role shrunk as Witkoff, a real estate developer turned diplomat, emerged as the president\u2019s chief interlocutor with Putin and his advisers.",
      "Under the proposal, Russia would commit to making no future attacks, something the White House views as a concession. In addition, $100 billion in frozen Russian assets would be dedicated to rebuilding Ukraine.",
      "However, handing over territory to Russia would be deeply unpopular in Ukraine. It also would be illegal under Ukraine\u2019s constitution. Zelenskyy has repeatedly ruled out such a possibility.",
      "Russia would also be allowed to keep half of the power generated by Europe\u2019s largest nuclear power plant, Zaporizhzhia, which it captured from Ukraine early during the war.",
      "The draft calls for a \u201cPeace Council\u201d that Trump will oversee. The council is an idea that Trump snatched from his lengthy peace plan aimed at bringing about a permanent end to war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.",
      "If either Ukraine or Russia violated the truce once enacted, it would face sanctions.",
      "U.S. Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., an Air Force veteran, rejected the emerging plan. \u201cUnacceptable,\u201d he posted on social media. \u201cIt is a 1938 Munich,\u201d referring to a diplomatic agreement aimed at securing peace with Nazi Germany but widely viewed as paving the way for World War II.",

      "At least five families say their babies were treated for infant botulism after consuming ByHeart formula months before a current outbreak was detected",
      "As health officials investigate more than 30 cases of infant botulism linked to ByHeart baby formula since August, parents who say their children were sickened with the same illness months before the current outbreak are demanding answers, too.",
      "California public health officials confirmed late Friday that six babies in that state who consumed ByHeart formula were treated for botulism between November 2024 and June 2025, up to nine months before the outbreak that has sickened at least 31 babies in 15 states.",
      "At the time, there was \u201cnot enough evidence to immediately suspect a common source,\" the California Department of Public Health said in a statement.",
      "Even now, \"we cannot connect any pre-August 1 cases to the current outbreak,\u201d officials said.",
      "Parents of at least five babies said that their infants were treated for the rare and potentially deadly disease after drinking ByHeart formula in late 2024 and early 2025, according to reports shared with The Associated Press by Bill Marler, a Seattle food safety lawyer representing the families.",
      "Amy Mazziotti, 43, of Burbank, California, said her then-5-month-old son, Hank, fell ill and was treated for botulism in March, weeks after he began drinking bottles filled with ByHeart formula.",
      "Katie Connolly, 37, of Lafayette, California, said her daughter, M.C., then 8 months old, was hospitalized in April and treated for botulism after being fed ByHeart formula in hopes of helping the baby sleep.",
      "For months, neither mother had any idea where the infections could have originated. Such illnesses in babies typically are caused by spores spread in the environment or by contaminated honey.",
      "Then ByHeart recalled all of its products nationwide on Nov. 11 in connection with growing cases of infant botulism.",
      "As soon as she heard it was ByHeart, Mazziotti said she thought: \u201cThis cannot be a coincidence.\u201d",
      "ByHeart officials this week confirmed that laboratory tests of previously unopened formula found that some samples were contaminated with the type of bacteria that leads to infant botulism.",
      "Marler said at least three other cases that predate the outbreak involved babies who drank ByHeart and were treated for botulism, according to their families. One consumed ByHeart formula in December 2024. The other two were sickened later in the spring, he said.",
      "An official with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said federal investigators were aware of reports of earlier illnesses but that efforts are focused now on understanding the unusual surge of dozens of infections documented since Aug. 1.",
      "\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019re not necessarily part of this,\u201d said Dr. Jennifer Cope, a CDC scientist leading the probe. \u201cIt\u2019s just that right now, we\u2019re focusing on this large increase.\u201d",
      "Because so much time has passed and because parents of babies who got sick earlier may not have recorded lot numbers of product or kept empty cans of formula, \u201cit will make it harder to definitively link them\u201d to the outbreak, Cope said.",

      "Before this outbreak, no powdered infant formula in the U.S. had tested positive for the type of bacteria that leads to botulism, California health officials said. The number of cases also were within an expected range. A test of a can of open formula fed to a sick baby in the spring did not detect the bacterium.",
      "Then, beginning in August and through October, more cases were identified on the East Coast involving a type of toxin rarely detected in the region, officials said. More cases were seen in very young infants and more cases involved ByHeart formula, which accounts for less than 1 percent of infant formula sold in the U.S.",
      "Earlier this month, after a sample from a can of ByHeart formula fed to a sick infant tested positive for the germ that leads to illness, officials notified the CDC, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the public.",
      "Less than 200 cases of infant botulism are reported in the U.S. each year. The disease is caused when babies ingest spores that germinate in the gut and produce a toxin. The bacterium that leads to illness is ubiquitous in the environment, including soil and water, so the source is often unknown.",
      "Officials at the California Infant Botulism Treatment and Prevention Program track reports of botulism and the distribution of the only treatment for the illness, an IV medication called BabyBIG.",

      "CHICAGO -- The massive Border Patrol presence on a recent Saturday morning in Chicago's Little Village neighborhood didn't faze Ofelia Herrera even though she and her husband are in the United States illegally.",
      "She waited for agents to move a few blocks away, then opened their stand serving Mexican-style corn on the cob and \u201caguas frescas\u201d flavored with cucumber, pineapple and strawberry in the heart of the Mexican immigrant community, just as they've done for 18 years. Sirens blared through a chaotic day as Chicago police responded to a Border Patrol call for help and confronted demonstrators.",
      "Herrera, 47, and Rafael Hernandez, 44, have refused to alter their routines during an immigration enforcement blitz in Chicago that has caused many without legal status to stay home since it began in early September. Even some U.S. citizens of Latino heritage are afraid to go outside.",
      "The couple says working not only pays the bills but helps avoid depression, making them stand out from others gripped by fear in Chicago's immigrant communities.",
      "\u201cThe only thing you can do is have faith in God and not be afraid,\u201d Herrera said in an interview at the couple's South Side house, already bedecked with Christmas decorations just days after Halloween. \u201cFear gives way to depression and other things. At the end of the day, they don't deport you to Mexico but you are sick with depression and other things because you didn't have faith in God.\u201d",
      "Hernandez agreed. \"We know people who have fallen into depression. They don't leave the house. It's very sad.\u201d",
      "The couple's Little Village food stand, adorned with American flags, is in a bustling area the Border Patrol has visited often. The two-lane commercial drag is lined with family-owned restaurants serving birria and chilaquiles, and clothing stores with displays of Mexican sports team jerseys and white dresses for quincea\u00f1era parties \u2014 a coming-of-age celebration for 15-year-old girls in Latino families.",
      "Vendors sell sliced fruit and pottery from parked vehicles. Strains of ranchera music from cars and shops add to the festive atmosphere, drawing Mexican immigrant visitors from across Chicago and beyond. A family from Waterloo, Iowa, nibbled corn smothered in mayonnaise, cotija cheese, lime and chili powder at the couple's stand under a cold drizzle.",
      "Many of the couple\u2019s friends haven\u2019t ventured outside in more than two months. That fear has sparked a grassroots effort to buy out street vendors, allowing them to go home early and avoid public exposure.",
      "Sidewalk traffic on 26th Street is livelier than many commercial areas in Chicago, even with the immigration crackdown. It is lined with barber shops, groceries and other businesses that have signs in Spanish and English demanding immigration authorities stay away unless they have a court warrant.",
      "The couple knows people who were arrested by heavily armed agents asking about their legal status \u2014 an egg vendor here, a tamale vendor there. They described the sting of tear gas unleashed by agents on demonstrators at a shopping center parking lot last month.",
      "Many immigrants, even some with legal status, are loathe to speak with reporters, especially if identified by name, fearful it may lead to deportation. Herrera and Hernandez say they are eager to share their story to foster understanding of how the Trump administration's push for mass deportations is playing out.",
      "Herrera crossed the border in 2004, followed later by her two children who are now adults living in Chicago. Hernandez made the journey in 2005. Both paid smugglers thousands of dollars for dayslong treks through the Arizona desert. Acquaintances enticed them to head to Chicago, the second-highest U.S. destination for Mexican immigrants after Los Angeles.",

      "\u201cPeople are frightened because they have lives here, they have kids here, including us,\u201d Herrera said. \u201cWe don't want to go to Mexico but, if we have to, we will. What else is there to do?\u201d",

      "\u201cRental Family,\u201d a moving drama from Searchlight Pictures starring Brendan Fraser, is sure to spark interest in Japan\u2019s real-life industry",
      "TOKYO -- Ryuichi Ichinokawa's life could be right out of the movie \u201cRental Family\u201d as the founder nearly two decades ago of the Heart Project business in Japan, which he bills as a surrogate attendance service complete with furnishing of extras and family members.",
      "He has hired dozens of people to act like reporters with cameras and voice recorders, taking notes and milling with real journalists to fill up an otherwise rather vacant event. He has posed as the boyfriend of a woman who needs to discuss legal paperwork with her former spouse. And he has gone to a hospital as a stand-in husband for a woman getting fertility treatments.",
      "\u201cI am being of service to people. I hope they will be happy,\u201d said Ichinokawa, a dapper elderly man who asked The Associated Press to not be photographed lest his identity become public.",
      "\u201cRental Family,\u201d a moving drama from Searchlight Pictures starring Brendan Fraser, is sure to spark interest in Japan's real-life industry. The film, which opens in theaters Friday, centers on Phillip, an American actor who is recruited by a Tokyo \u201crental family\u201d agency in need of a \u201ctoken white guy.\u201d His recurring jobs range from playing video games with a loner to portraying a little girl's long absentee father. It isn't long before Phillip starts to become emotionally invested in what were supposed to be superficial relationships. The film's Japanese supporting cast also bring to life the intense highs and lows of assuming a role in a stranger's life.",
      "In reality, these niche businesses highlight how deeply people in Japan experience loneliness or worry about keeping up appearances. Outsiders may cringe at the idea of paying amateur actors to be fake family members or friends. But users say they find these services comforting and even healing.",
      "The film's director, Mitsuyo Miyazaki whose professional name is Hikari, was born in Japan yet knew little about the concept. Once she learned about it, she couldn't stop thinking about what a unique story it could inspire. So Hikari started researching and found hundreds of companies in Japan that offer rental families or similar services. She spoke with several people in that world.",
      "\u201cI kind of started tackling those questions, and interviewed them on what are the necessities of the business that needs to happen in Japan. And then that\u2019s how I kind of built stories,\u201d Hikari said.",
      "Even at a time when people seek company through Artificial Intelligence, she thinks hiring of actors to fill emotional voids will always be in demand.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think they will disappear, honestly, it might just probably expand,\u201d she said.",
      "In Ichinokawa's experience, most people who ask for the service have a certain social status to protect. He has organized visits to a bar for a hostess who wants to impress her employer with lots of clientele. Similar to the movie, Ichinokawa has gone to school events with a single mother and her child, acting as a friendly uncle.",
      "Sometimes Ichinokawa takes extra steps to ensure the facade. If required, he will print fake business cards \u2014 which are routinely exchanged at Japanese gatherings.",
      "Some parts are easy, like being a wedding guest who just sits and eats. But it\u2019s often stressful work. You're coached to avoid uttering the wrong name or background information. You might have to be prepared to talk about childhood memories you have no clue about. Ichinokawa used to scribble names on his hand. He also pores over notes in advance. If he's really desperate, he excuses himself to the restroom.",
      "Payment for getting rented out varies. For Heart Project, the relatively easy roles can make 9,800 yen ($63) for a couple of hours. For the more elaborate parts, the client dishes out 20,000 yen ($130) to 30,000 yen ($190) per person.",
      "Ichinokawa's rule is that you only play a role once. To do it more than once is setting yourself up for failure. And he has never failed in his mission, he added proudly.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t feel I am acting. I really get angry if that\u2019s what the situation requires,\u201d he said.",
      "Japan has long grappled with loneliness, high suicide rates and a stigma surrounding mental illness. After a 2011 earthquake and tsunami, the country examined how the disasters were affecting mental health, said Miwa Yasui, a professor at the University of Chicago whose research includes the influence of culture on mental health.",

      "Japanese people isolated physically are prone to feeling it internally, said Chikako Ozawa-de Silva, author of \u201cThe Anatomy of Loneliness: Suicide, Social Connection and the Search for Relational Meaning in Contemporary Japan.\"",
      "\u201cWhen people feel they\u2019re not loved, they are not accepted, they\u2019re now seeing they\u2019re not heard. The sense of \u2018I don\u2019t matter\u2019 is a form of loneliness,\u201d said Ozawa-de Silva, who is also a professor at Emory University.",
      "This can lead to \u201chikikomori,\u201d where people withdraw socially and become shut-ins for months or even years.",
      "Japanese culture's collectivist nature also contributes to hiding mental health challenges. Children are taught the principle of \u201cminna no tame ni\" or for the sake of everybody, Yasui said. As adults, there is pressure to maintain harmony and make sure the needs of others \u2014 work or family \u2014 are met.",
      "\u201cWithin Asian cultures, there\u2019s a concept of loss of face,\u201d Yasui said. \u201cIf you lose that, that actually has significant implications.\u201d",
      "In Ozawa-de Silva's opinion, renting actors for surface-level intimacy is putting a \u201cBand-Aid\" on a deeper problem.",
      "\u201cI'm not against that,\u201d Ozawa-de Silva said. \u201cIf people can buy time by renting a family, while pursuing much better long-term solutions, I think the rental family could be a very, very beneficial thing.\u201d",
      "While someone with a Western mindset might find renting actors bizarre, many Japanese people find it reassuring. Much of the written feedback Ichinokawa gets expresses relief or appreciation: \u201cThank you for today. You really interacted with us like a real mother. My boyfriend kept saying, \u2018What a great mom.\u2019\u201d From a male client: \u201cPlease relay my regards to the person who played the role of my wife and tell her she was a superb wife.\u201d",
      "The film, which will be released in February in Japan, uses the rental family concept to remind people that human nature's need for connection is not something you can suppress.",
      "\u201cWhen you help somebody and if they feel like you\u2019re being supportive, that makes you feel good,\u201d Hikari said. \u201cAnd a family member doesn\u2019t have to be alway blood-related.\u201d",

      "JOHANNESBURG -- Leaders from the Group of 20 countries will meet for a summit in South Africa this weekend without any U.S. representatives after President Donald Trump announced a boycott over his widely rejected claims that the host country is persecuting its Afrikaner white minority.",
      "Trump's decision to pull the United States \u2014 and himself \u2014 out of the talks in Johannesburg is likely to undermine the first G20 leaders' meeting in Africa, as well as South Africa's aim to push for progress on issues affecting poor countries, such as the impact of climate change, the cost of green energy transition and spiraling sovereign debt levels.",
      "Chinese leader Xi Jinping also won't attend as he cuts back on international travel, meaning the heads of the world's two biggest economies will skip a meeting meant to bring developed and developing countries together to tackle pressing global issues.",
      "The G20 is a group of 19 countries that includes the richest but also the top developing economies in the world. The European Union and the African Union, which joined in 2023, are also members, making it now a group of 21.",
      "It was formed in 1999 and unlike the Group of Seven, which only includes the richest democracies, it offers some developing countries a forum to raise their problems.",
      "Its focus is the global economy and international development, though it has no charter or permanent secretariat \u2014 unlike organizations such as the United Nations. It also doesn't issue binding decisions and critics say there's no meaningful mechanism for it to put words into action.",
      "The G20 often struggles to reach real consensus because of the different interests of the big powers like the U.S., China and Russia, as well as those of Western European nations.",
      "The leaders of the United Nations, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund typically attend G20 summits as guests.",
      "Trump has claimed that white Afrikaner farmers in South Africa are being killed and that their land is being seized, calling it a disgrace that South Africa is hosting the summit and saying it should be thrown out of the G20.",
      "The South African government and others, including some Afrikaners themselves, have rejected Trump's claims of racial persecution as misinformation.",
      "South Africa has been a target for Trump since he returned to office at the start of the year, with his administration casting the country as anti-American because of its diplomatic ties with China, Russia and Iran.",
      "The U.S. will take over the rotating presidency of the G20 from South Africa and while the world's biggest economy will boycott the talks, a representative from the U.S. Embassy in South Africa will attend a formal handover ceremony at the end of the summit, a White House official said.",
      "The country holding the G20 presidency gets to set the agenda for the annual summit.",
      "South Africa wants climate change and disaster relief, financing green energy transition, easing debt levels for poor countries and addressing global inequality to be priorities for the two-day meeting.",

      "Google will confront the U.S. government's latest attempt to topple its internet empire in federal court on Friday as a judge considers how to prevent the abusive tactics that culminated in parts of its digital ad network being branded as an illegal monopoly.",
      "The courtroom showdown in Alexandria, Virginia, will pit lawyers from Google and the U.S. Department of Justice against each other in closing proceedings focused on the complex technology that distributes millions of digital ads across the internet each day.",
      "After a lengthy trial last year, U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema ruled in April that pieces of Google's ad technology had been rigged in a way that made it an illegal monopoly. That set up another 11-day trial earlier this fall to help Brinkema determine how to remedy its anti-competitive practices.",
      "Friday's closing arguments will give both Google and the Justice Department a final chance to sway Brinkema before she issues a ruling that probably won't come until early next year.",
      "The Justice Department wants Brinkema to force Google to sell some of the ad technology that it has spent nearly 20 years assembling, contending a breakup is the only way to rein in a company that the agency's lawyers condemned as a \u201crecidivist monopolist\u201d in filings leading up to Friday's hearing.",
      "The condemnation refers not only to Google's practices in digital advertising but also to the illegal monopoly that it unleashed through its dominant search engine. Federal prosecutors also sought a breakup in the search monopoly case, but the judge handling that issue rejected a proposal that would have required Google to sell its popular Chrome web browser.",
      "Although Google is still being ordered to make reforms that it's resisting, the outcome in the search monopoly case has been widely seen as a proverbial slap on the wrist. The belief that Google got off easy in the search case is the main reason the market value of its parent company Alphabet surged by about $950 billion, or 37%, to nearly $3.5 trillion since U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta's decision came out in early September.",
      "That setback hasn't discouraged the Justice Department from arguing for a breakup of an ad tech system that handles 55 million requests per second, according to estimates provided by Google in court filings.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The U.S. Treasury Department said Thursday it plans to reclassify certain refundable tax credits as \u201cfederal public benefits,\" which will bar some immigrant taxpayers from receiving them, even if they file and pay taxes and would otherwise qualify.",
      "Tax experts say immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally by their parents as children, known as DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) recipients, and immigrants with Temporary Protected Status are most likely to be affected by the planned change. Foreign workers and student visa holders as well as some families with children who are U.S. citizens could also be affected, depending on how the rule is written, they say.",
      "The Treasury Department\u2019s announcement was the latest sign of how the Trump administration has been taking a \u201c whole of government \u201d approach when it comes to immigration enforcement and looking to departments across the federal government \u2014 not just Homeland Security \u2014 to come up with ways to help carry out the president\u2019s hardline immigration agenda.",
      "The Treasury said in its announcement that it plans to craft new rules affecting the refunded portions of certain individual income tax credits, including the Earned Income Tax Credit, the Additional Child Tax Credit, the American Opportunity Tax Credit and the Saver\u2019s Match Credit.",
      "The rule-making would redefine the tax credits as \u201cfederal public benefits\u201d within the meaning of Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996. As a result, many immigrants with U.S. work authorization would no longer be able to receive these benefits.",
      "According to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, undocumented immigrants who pay taxes are often not eligible for the same tax benefits as U.S. citizens, even though this group of people paid nearly $100 billion in federal, state, and local taxes in 2022.",
      "For instance, undocumented immigrants are not eligible for Social Security retirement benefits or Medicare health insurance, even though they contribute billions of dollars to the federal payroll taxes that fund these benefits.",
      "Critics slammed the change as a way to target immigrants as part of Trump's broader policies.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a terrible and unfair idea to deny tax credits to people who have paid taxes and are eligible for them because of their immigration status,\u201d said Daniel Costa, director of Immigration Law and Policy Research at the Economic Policy Institute.",

Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said in a news release that \u201cwe are enforcing the law and preventing illegal aliens from claiming tax benefits intended for American citizens.\u201d Treasury sought a Justice Department reinterpretation of the law in order to craft the new rule, the agency said.",

      "A number of controllers started calling out of work as the shutdown dragged on longer than a month and they dealt with the financial pressure of working without a paycheck. Some of them got side jobs, but others simply couldn't afford the child care or gas they needed to work. Their absences forced delays at airports across the country and led the government to order airlines to cut some of their flights at 40 busy airports.",

Duffy said repeatedly that FAA safety experts became worried as the absences grew because of reports from pilots concerned about controllers\u2019 responses and a number of runway incursions.",

      "The chilling sequence first shows an engine coming loose from the UPS cargo plane during takeoff. The engine pops off the plane as fire erupts in the next image, followed by the blazing engine catapulting off the stricken plane. The final images show the plane ablaze as it gets airborne, leaving behind trails of smoke.",
      "Moments later, the plane crashed in a massive explosion that killed 14 people \u2014 including the three crew members \u2014 and carved a path of destruction near Louisville's airport. Dramatic videos of the crash showed the plane on fire plowing into buildings and generating a massive plume of smoke.",

Rogers \u2014 the No. 9 overall NBA draft pick in 1993 \u2014 had been paralyzed from the shoulders down since a dirt bike accident in November 2008.

      "Negotiators at the United Nations climate talks are deciding on a final deal that lacks a plan to phase out fossil fuels",
      "BELEM, Brazil -- Negotiators at the United Nations climate talks will soon decide on a newly forged final deal released on Saturday that does not include a plan to wean the world from the coal, oil and gas that is heating the planet.",
      "While guidelines wanted by 80 nations for a fossil fuel phase-out are not in the document called \u201cUniting humanity in a global mobilization against climate change,\u201d the Brazilian presidency has promised it will join Colombia in coming up with an independent road map that's not needed to be approved by all 190 nations.",
      "\u201cWhile far from what's needed, the outcome in Belem is meaningful progress,\u201d said former German special climate envoy Jennifer Morgan, who is now a fellow at Tufts University.",
      "The conference leaders are aiming for an early afternoon meeting with all nations to approve the deal. Some nations could try to scuttle it if they prefer no deal to what they consider a feeble agreement, but Morgan said she doubted that any country will block the agreement. It was crafted after more than 12 hours of late night and early morning meetings in COP30 President Andr\u00e9 Corr\u00eaa do Lago's office.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a weak outcome,\" said former Philippine negotiator Jasper Inventor, now at Greenpeace International.",
      "A fossil fuel transition plan will be in a separate proposal issued later by do Lago's team that won't carry the same weight as a deal accepted by nations at the conference.",
      "In the text, instead of a transition plan away from fossil fuels, the agreement \u201cacknowledges that the global transition toward low greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development is irreversible and the trend of the future,\u201d and says \u201cthe (2015) Paris Agreement is working and resolves to go further and faster.\u201d",
      "The annual talks this year are held in Belem, a Brazilian city on the edge of the Amazon rainforest. They were scheduled to wrap up Friday, but negotiators blew past that deadline and worked through the night.",
      "Some of the biggest issues include how to distribute $300 billion a year \u2014 a sum previously agreed upon \u2014 in financial aid for vulnerable countries hit hardest by climate change, getting countries to toughen up their national plans to reduce Earth-warming emissions and dealing with climate trade barriers. Poorer nations have requested a tripling of financial aid for adapting to extreme weather and other climate change harms. While that's in the deal, the deadline has been moved back five years to 2035.",
      "Also included in the agreement is the final result of the Action Agenda, which was a list of initiatives aimed at making progress on past deals. That included: a promise of $1 trillion for improving energy grids and infrastructure; ramping up the production of biofuels; industrial decarbonization plans in developing countries; $5.5 billion toward a fund to pay countries to keep their forests standing; and other pledges of funding, including from the private sector, for projects in areas like farming and adaptation.",
      "Whatever deal is proposed still needs a consensus approval from what\u2019s left of the nearly 200 nations that came to the two-week conference. Some delegates, observers and others had to leave Saturday morning when the cruise ships lodging them set sail.",

      "Earlier this week, do Lago issued what he had hoped to be a final proposal. It was roundly criticized by the European Union, small island nations and Latin American countries as too weak on fossil fuels and pushing nations to sharpen their new climate-fighting plans. But other countries including Saudi Arabia pushed back against the call to transition away from fossil fuels.",
      "\u201cOil producing nations are trying to hold on, to really stop the decline of fossil fuels,\u201d Morgan said.",
      "Brazil President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva had pushed for a stronger plan to move away from fossil fuels, as did more than 80 countries. But the earlier proposal by do Lago \u2014 a Lula appointee \u2014 didn\u2019t even mention the words \u201cfossil fuel.\u201d",
      "Agreements coming out of COP30 technically have to be approved by consensus. But in the past, individual countries' objections have been overlooked by the chair in the rush to gavel everything to the end.",
      "One of the points that negotiators will highlight is language sprinkled in the document that won\u2019t be an explicit road map away from fossil fuels, but will refer back to previous agreements to maintain momentum and \"live and fight another day,\u201d said Alden Meyer, a veteran analyst for the European think-tank E3G.",
      "It\u2019s not enough, Greenpeace\u2019s Inventor said: \u201cWe need to reflect on what was possible and what now appears to be missing: the road maps to end forest destruction and fossil fuels and an ongoing lack of finance. We rise up, though, and continue the fight.\u201d",

      "Chatbots are so good at answering questions with detailed written responses that it's tempting to just take their work and pass it off as your own.",

      "You wouldn't copy and paste information from a textbook or someone else's essay and pass it off as your own. The same principle applies to chatbot replies.",
      "\u201cAI can help you understand concepts or generate ideas, but it should never replace your own thinking and effort,\u201d the University of Chicago says in its guidance on using generative AI. \u201cAlways produce original work, and use AI tools for guidance and clarity, not for doing the work for you.\u201d",

      "He tells them to upload class notes, study guides and any other materials used in class, such as slideshows, to the chatbot, and then tell it which textbook and chapter the test will focus on.",
      "Then, students should prompt the chatbot to: \u201cQuiz me one question at a time based on all the material cited, and after that create a teaching plan for everything I got wrong.\u201d",
      "Cuny posts AI guidance in the form of a traffic light on a classroom screen. Green-lighted uses include brainstorming, asking for feedback on a presentation or doing research. Red lighted, or prohibited AI use: Asking an AI tool to write a thesis statement, a rough draft or revise an essay. A yellow light is when a student is unsure if AI use is allowed, in which case he tells them to come and ask him.",

      "Children\u2019s and consumer advocacy groups are urging parents not to buy AI-powered toys during the holiday season",
      "They\u2019re cute, even cuddly, and promise learning and companionship \u2014 but artificial intelligence toys are not safe for kids, according to children\u2019s and consumer advocacy groups urging parents not to buy them during the holiday season.",
      "These toys, marketed to kids as young as 2 years old, are generally powered by AI models that have already been shown to harm children and teenagers, such as OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT, according to an advisory published Thursday by the children\u2019s advocacy group Fairplay and signed by more than 150 organizations and individual experts such as child psychiatrists and educators.",
      "\u201cThe serious harms that AI chatbots have inflicted on children are well-documented, including fostering obsessive use, having explicit sexual conversations, and encouraging unsafe behaviors, violence against others, and self-harm,\u201d Fairplay said.",
      "AI toys, made by companies such as Curio Interactive and Keyi Technologies, are often marketed as educational, but Fairplay says they can displace important creative and learning activities. They promise friendship but also disrupt children\u2019s relationships and resilience, the group said.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s different about young children is that their brains are being wired for the first time and developmentally it is natural for them to be trustful, for them to seek relationships with kind and friendly characters,\u201d said Rachel Franz, director of Fairplay\u2019s Young Children Thrive Offline Program. Because of this, she added, the amount of trust young children are putting in these toys can exacerbate the harms seen with older children.",
      "Fairplay, a 25-year-old organization formerly known as the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood, has been warning about AI toys for more than 10 years. They just weren\u2019t as advanced as they are today. A decade ago, during an emerging fad of internet-connected toys and AI speech recognition, the group helped lead a backlash against Mattel\u2019s talking Hello Barbie doll that it said was recording and analyzing children\u2019s conversations.",
      "\u201cEverything has been released with no regulation and no research, so it gives us extra pause when all of a sudden we see more and more manufacturers, including Mattel, who recently partnered with OpenAI, potentially putting out these products,\u201d Franz said.",
      "It\u2019s the second big seasonal warning against AI toys since consumer advocates at U.S. PIRG last week called out the trend in its annual \u201c Trouble in Toyland \u201d report that typically looks at a range of product hazards, such as high-powered magnets and button-sized batteries that young children can swallow. This year, the organization tested four toys that use AI chatbots.",
      "\u201cWe found some of these toys will talk in-depth about sexually explicit topics, will offer advice on where a child can find matches or knives, act dismayed when you say you have to leave, and have limited or no parental controls,\u201d the report said.",
      "Dr. Dana Suskind, a pediatric surgeon and social scientist who studies early brain development, said young children don't have the conceptual tools to understand what an AI companion is. While kids have always bonded with toys through imaginative play, when they do this they use their imagination to create both sides of a pretend conversation, \u201cpracticing creativity, language, and problem-solving,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cAn AI toy collapses that work. It answers instantly, smoothly, and often better than a human would. We don\u2019t yet know the developmental consequences of outsourcing that imaginative labor to an artificial agent\u2014but it\u2019s very plausible that it undercuts the kind of creativity and executive function that traditional pretend play builds,\u201d Suskind said.",

      "Another company, Miko, said it uses its own conversational AI model rather than relying on general large language model systems such as ChatGPT in order to make its product \u2014 an interactive AI robot \u2014 safe for children.",
      "\u201cWe are always expanding our internal testing, strengthening our filters, and introducing new capabilities that detect and block sensitive or unexpected topics,\" said CEO Sneh Vaswani. \u201cThese new features complement our existing controls that allow parents and caregivers to identify specific topics they\u2019d like to restrict from conversation. We will continue to invest in setting the highest standards for safe, secure and responsible AI integration for Miko products.\u201d",

On its website, it markets its robots as \u201cArtificial Intelligence. Genuine friendship.\u201d",
      "Ritvik Sharma, the company's senior vice president of growth, said Miko actually \u201cencourages kids to interact more with their friends, to interact more with the peers, with the family members etc. It\u2019s not made for them to feel attached to the device only.\u201d",
      "Still, Suskind and children's advocates say analog toys are a better bet for the holidays.",
      "\"Kids need lots of real human interaction. Play should support that, not take its place. The biggest thing to consider isn\u2019t only what the toy does; it\u2019s what it replaces. A simple block set or a teddy bear that doesn\u2019t talk back forces a child to invent stories, experiment, and work through problems. AI toys often do that thinking for them,\" she said. \u201cHere\u2019s the brutal irony: when parents ask me how to prepare their child for an AI world, unlimited AI access is actually the worst preparation possible.\u201d",

      "What\u2019s called autoimmune encephalitis attacks the organ that makes us \u201cus,\u201d and it can appear out of the blue.",
      "Morrill went for a bike ride with friends along the California coast, stopping for lunch, and they noticed nothing wrong. Neither did Morrill until his wife asked how it went \u2014 and he'd forgotten. Morrill would get worse before he got better. \u201cUnhinged\u201d and \u201cfighting to see light,\u201d he wrote as delusions set in and holes in his memory grew.",
      "Of all the ways our immune system can run amok and damage the body instead of protecting it, autoimmune encephalitis is one of the most unfathomable. Seemingly healthy people abruptly spiral with confusion, memory loss, seizures, even psychosis.",
      "But doctors are getting better at identifying it, thanks to discoveries of a growing list of the rogue antibodies responsible that, if found in blood and spinal fluid, aid diagnosis. Every year new culprit antibodies are being uncovered, said Dr. Sam Horng, a neurologist at Mount Sinai Health System in New York who has cared for patients with multiple forms of this mysterious disease.",
      "And while treatment today involves general ways to fight the inflammation, two major clinical trials are underway aiming for more targeted therapy.",
      "Still, it's tricky. Symptoms can be mistaken for psychiatric or other neurologic disorders, delaying proper treatment.",
      "\u201cWhen someone\u2019s having new changes in their mental status, they\u2019re worsening and if there\u2019s sort of like a bizarre quality to it, that\u2019s something that kind of tips our suspicion,\u201d Horng said. \u201cIt\u2019s important not to miss a treatable condition.\u201d",
      "With early diagnosis and care, some patients fully recover. Others like Morrill recover normal daily functioning but grapple with some lasting damage \u2014 in his case, lost decades of \u201cautobiographical\u201d memories. This 72-year-old literature major can still spout facts and figures learned long ago, and he makes new memories every day. But even family photos can\u2019t help him recall pivotal moments in his own life.",
      "\u201cI remember \u2018Ulysses\u2019 is published in Paris in 1922 at Sylvia Beach\u2019s bookstore. Why do I remember that, which is of no use to me anymore, and yet I can\u2019t remember my son\u2019s wedding?\u201d Morrill wonders.",
      "Encephalitis means the brain is inflamed and symptoms can vary from mild to life-threatening. Infections are a common cause, typically requiring treatment of the underlying virus or bacteria. But when that's ruled out, an autoimmune cause has to be considered, Horng said, especially when symptoms arise suddenly.",
      "The umbrella term autoimmune encephalitis covers a group of diseases with weird-sounding names based on the antibody fueling it, such as anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis.",
      "While they're not new diseases, that one got a name in 2007 when Dr. Josep Dalmau, then at the University of Pennsylvania, discovered the first culprit antibody, sparking a hunt for more.",
      "That anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis tends to strike younger women and, one of the bizarre factors, it\u2019s sometimes triggered by an ovarian \u201cdermoid\u201d cyst.",
      "How? That type of cyst has similarities to some brain tissue, Horng explained. The immune system can develop antibodies recognizing certain proteins from the growth. If those antibodies get into the brain, they can mistakenly target NMDA receptors on healthy brain cells, sparking personality and behavior changes that can include hallucinations.",
      "Different antibodies create different problems depending if they mostly hit memory and mood areas in the brain, or sensory and movement regions.",
      "Altogether, \u201cfacets of personhood seem to be impaired,\" Horng said.",
      "Therapies include filtering harmful antibodies out of patients' blood, infusing healthy ones, and high-dose steroids to calm inflammation.",
      "Those cyst-related antibodies stealthily attacked Kiara Alexander in Charlotte, North Carolina, who\u2019d never heard of the brain illness.

      "Meta has started notifying young Australians to download their digital histories and delete their accounts from Facebook, Instagram, and Threads",
      "MELBOURNE, Australia -- Technology giant Meta on Thursday began sending thousands of young Australians a two-week warning to downland their digital histories and delete their accounts from Facebook, Instagram and Threads before a world-first social media ban on accounts of children younger than 16 takes effect.",
      "The Australian government announced two weeks ago that the three Meta platforms plus Snapchat, TikTok, X and YouTube must take reasonable steps to exclude Australian account holders younger than 16, beginning Dec. 10.",
      "California-based Meta on Thursday became the first of the targeted tech companies to outline how it will comply with the law. Meta contacted thousands of young account holders via SMS and email to warn that suspected children will start to be denied access to the platforms from Dec. 4.",
      "\u201cWe will start notifying impacted teens today to give them the opportunity to save their contacts and memories,\u201d Meta said in a statement.",
      "Meta said young users could also use the notice period to update their contact information \u201cso we can get in touch and help them regain access once they turn 16.\u201d",
      "Meta has estimated there are 350,000 Australians aged 13-to-15 on Instagram and 150,000 in that age bracket on Facebook. Australia\u2019s population is 28 million.",
      "Account holders 16-years-old and older who were mistakenly given notice that they would be excluded can contact Yoti Age Verification and verify their age by providing government-issued identity documents or a \u201cvideo selfie,\u201d Meta said.",

      "Researchers have completed a full accounting of water uses and losses in the Rio Grande-Bravo basin as it faces severe shortages throughout its range in the United States and Mexico",
      "ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. -- One of North America's longest rivers, the Rio Grande \u2014 or Rio Bravo as it's called in Mexico \u2014 has a history as deep as it is long. Indigenous people have tapped it for countless generations, and it was a key artery for Spanish conquistadors centuries ago.",
      "Today, the Rio Grande-Bravo water basin is in crisis.",
      "Research published Thursday says the situation arguably is worse than challenges facing the Colorado River, another vital lifeline for western U.S. states that have yet to chart a course for how best to manage that dwindling resource.",
      "Without rapid and large-scale action on both sides of the border, the researchers warn that unsustainable use threatens water security for millions of people who rely on the binational basin. They say more prevalent drying along the Rio Grande and persistent shortages could have catastrophic consequences for farmers, cities and ecosystems.",
      "The study done by World Wildlife Fund, Sustainable Waters and a team of university researchers provides a full accounting of the consumptive uses as well as evaporation and other losses within the Rio Grande-Bravo basin. It helps to paint the most complete \u2014 and most alarming \u2014 picture yet of why the river system is in trouble.",
      "The basin provides drinking water to 15 million people in the U.S. and Mexico and irrigates nearly 2 million acres of cropland in the two countries.",
      "The research shows only 48% of the water consumed directly or indirectly within the basin is replenished naturally. The other 52% is unsustainable, meaning reservoirs, aquifers and the river itself will be overdrawn.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s a pretty daunting, challenging reality when half of our water isn\u2019t necessarily going to be reliable for the future,\" said Brian Richter, president of Sustainable Waters and a senior fellow with the World Wildlife Fund. \u201cSo we have to really address that.\"",
      "By breaking down the balance sheet, the researchers are hopeful policymakers and regulators can determine where water use can be reduced and how to balance supply with demand.",
      "Warnings of what was to come first cropped up in the late 19th century when irrigation in Colorado\u2019s San Luis Valley began to dry the snowmelt-fed river, resulting in diminished flows as far south as El Paso, Texas. Now, some stretches of the river run dry for months at a time. The Big Bend area and even Albuquerque have seen dry cracked mud replace the river more often in recent years.",
      "Irrigating crops by far is the largest direct use of water in the basin at 87%, according to the study. Meanwhile, losses to evaporation and uptake by vegetation along the river account for more than half of overall consumption in the basin, a factor that can't be dismissed as reservoir storage shrinks.",
      "The irrigation season has become shorter, with canals drying up as early as June in some cases, despite a growing season in the U.S. and Mexico that typically lasts through October.",
      "In central New Mexico, farmers got a boost with summer rains. However, farmers along the Texas portion of the Pecos River and in the Rio Conchos basin of Mexico \u2014 both tributaries within the basin \u2014 did not receive any surface water supplies.",
      "\u201cA key part of this is really connecting the urban populations to what\u2019s going on out on these farms. These farmers are really struggling. A lot of them are on the brink of bankruptcy,\" Richter said, linking water shortages to shrinking farms, smaller profits and less ability to afford labor and equipment.",

      "The analysis found that between 2000-2019, water shortages contributed to the loss of 18% of farmland in the headwaters in Colorado, 36% along the Rio Grande in New Mexico and 49% in the Pecos River tributary in New Mexico and Texas.",
      "With fewer farms, less water went to irrigation in the U.S. However, researchers said irrigation in the Mexican portion of the basin has increased greatly.",
      "The World Wildlife Fund and Sustainable Waters are working with researchers at the University of New Mexico to survey farmers on solutions to the water crisis.",
      "Jason Casuga, the chief engineer and CEO of the Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District, said he is not surprised by the findings and was particularly interested in the data on how much water is lost to riparian areas along the river. He talked about his crews clearing thick walls of thirsty invasive salt cedar trees, describing it as an unnatural ecosystem that stemmed from human efforts to manage the river with levees and reservoirs.",
      "While cities and farmers try to conserve, Casuga said there are few rules placed on consumption by riparian areas.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re willing to accept hundreds and hundreds of acres of invasive species choking out native species. And I'm hoping a study like this will cause people to think and ask those kinds of questions because I think our bosque is worth fighting for. As a culture in New Mexico, agriculture is worth fighting for,\u201d he said.",
      "The responses to overuse and depletion are as varied as the jurisdictions through which the river flows, said Enrique Prunes, a co-author of the study and the manager of the World Wildlife Fund's Rio Grande Program.",
      "He pointed to Colorado, where water managers have threatened to shut off groundwater wells if the aquifer that supports irrigated farms cannot be stabilized. There, farmers who pump groundwater pay fees that are used to incentivize other farmers to fallow their fields.",
      "New Mexico's fallowing program is voluntary, but changes could be in store if the U.S. Supreme Court signs off on proposed settlements stemming from a long-running dispute with Texas and the federal government over management of the Rio Grande and groundwater use. New Mexico has acknowledged it will have to curb groundwater pumping.",
      "New Mexico is behind in its water deliveries to Texas under an interstate compact, while Mexico owes water to the U.S. under a 1944 binational treaty. Researchers said meeting those obligations won't get easier.",
      "Prunes said policymakers must also consider the environment when crafting solutions.",
      "\u201cRebalancing the system also means maintaining those basic functions that the river and the aquifers and the groundwater-dependent ecosystems have,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the indicator of resilience to a future of less water.\u201d",

Started about a decade ago to fight illegal border-related activities and the trafficking of both drugs and people, it has expanded over the past five years.",
      "The Border Patrol has recently grown even more powerful through collaborations with other agencies, drawing information from license plate readers nationwide run by the Drug Enforcement Administration, private companies and, increasingly, local law enforcement programs funded through federal grants. Texas law enforcement agencies have asked Border Patrol to use facial recognition to identify drivers, documents show.",
      "This active role beyond the borders is part of the quiet transformation of its parent agency, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, into something more akin to a domestic intelligence operation. Under the Trump administration\u2019s heightened immigration enforcement efforts, CBP is now poised to get more than $2.7 billion to build out border surveillance systems such as the license plate reader program by layering in artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies.",
      "The result is a mass surveillance network with a particularly American focus: cars.",
      "This investigation, the first to reveal details of how the program works on America\u2019s roads, is based on interviews with eight former government officials with direct knowledge of the program who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they weren\u2019t authorized to speak to the media, as well as dozens of federal, state and local officials, attorneys and privacy experts. The AP also reviewed thousands of pages of court and government documents, state grant and law enforcement data, and arrest reports.",
      "The Border Patrol has for years hidden details of its license plate reader program, trying to keep any mention of the program out of court documents and police reports, former officials say, even going so far as to propose dropping charges rather than risk revealing any details about the placement and use of their covert license plate readers. Readers are often disguised along highways in traffic safety equipment like drums and barrels.",
      "The Border Patrol has defined its own criteria for which drivers\u2019 behavior should be deemed suspicious or tied to drug or human trafficking, stopping people for anything from driving on backcountry roads, being in a rental car or making short trips to the border region. The agency\u2019s network of cameras now extends along the southern border in Texas, Arizona and California, and also monitors drivers traveling near the U.S.-Canada border.",
      "And it reaches far into the interior, impacting residents of big metropolitan areas and people driving to and from large cities such as Chicago and Detroit, as well as from Los Angeles, San Antonio, and Houston to and from the Mexican border region. In one example, AP found the agency has placed at least four cameras in the greater Phoenix area over the years, one of which was more than 120 miles (193 kilometers) from the Mexican frontier, beyond the agency\u2019s usual jurisdiction of 100 miles (161 kilometers) from a land or sea border. The AP also identified several camera locations in metropolitan Detroit, as well as one placed near the Michigan-Indiana border to capture traffic headed towards Chicago or Gary, Indiana, or other nearby destinations.",
      "Border Patrol\u2019s parent agency, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, said they use license plate readers to help identify threats and disrupt criminal networks and are \"governed by a stringent, multi-layered policy framework, as well as federal law and constitutional protections, to ensure the technology is applied responsibly and for clearly defined security purposes.\u201d",
      "\u201cFor national security reasons, we do not detail the specific operational applications,\u201d the agency said. While the U.S. Border Patrol primarily operates within 100 miles of the border, it is legally allowed \u201cto operate anywhere in the United States,\u201d the agency added.",
      "While collecting license plates from cars on public roads has generally been upheld by courts, some legal scholars see the growth of large digital surveillance networks such as Border Patrol\u2019s as raising constitutional questions. Courts have started to recognize that \u201clarge-scale surveillance technology that\u2019s capturing everyone and everywhere at every time\u201d might be unconstitutional under the Fourth Amendment, which protects people from unreasonable searches, said Andrew Ferguson, a law professor at George Washington University.",
      "Today, predictive surveillance is embedded into America\u2019s roadways. Mass surveillance techniques are also used in a range of other countries, from authoritarian governments such as China to, increasingly, democracies in the U.K. and Europe in the name of national security and public safety.",
      "\u201cThey are collecting mass amounts of information about who people are, where they go, what they do, and who they know \u2026 engaging in dragnet surveillance of Americans on the streets, on the highways, in their cities, in their communities,\u201d Nicole Ozer, the executive director of the Center for Constitutional Democracy at UC Law San Francisco, said in response to the AP\u2019s findings. \u201cThese surveillance systems do not make communities safer.\u201d",
      "In February, Lorenzo Gutierrez Lugo, a driver for a small trucking company that specializes in transporting furniture, clothing and other belongings to families in Mexico, was driving south to the border city of Brownsville, Texas, carrying packages from immigrant communities in South Carolina\u2019s low country.",
      "Gutierrez Lugo was pulled over by a local police officer in Kingsville, a small Texas city near Corpus Christi that lies about 100 miles from the Mexican border. The officer, Richard Beltran, cited the truck\u2019s speed of 50 mph (80 kph) in a 45 mph (72 kph) zone as the reason for the stop.",
      "But speeding was a pretext: Border Patrol had requested the stop and said the black Dodge pickup with a white trailer could contain contraband, according to police and court records. U.S. Route 77 passes through Kingsville, a route that state and federal authorities scrutinize for trafficking of drugs, money and people.",
      "Gutierrez Lugo, who through a lawyer declined to comment, was interrogated about the route he drove, based on license plate reader data, per the police report and court records. He consented to a search of his car by Beltran and Border Patrol agents, who eventually arrived to assist.",
      "They unearthed no contraband. But Beltran arrested Gutierrez Lugo on suspicion of money laundering and engaging in organized criminal activity because he was carrying thousands of dollars in cash \u2014 money his supervisor said came directly from customers in local Latino communities, who are accustomed to paying in cash. No criminal charges were ultimately brought against Gutierrez Lugo and an effort by prosecutors to seize the cash, vehicle and trailer as contraband was eventually dropped.",
      "Luis Barrios owns the trucking company, Paqueter\u00eda El Guero, that employed the driver. He told AP he hires people with work authorization in the United States and was taken aback by the treatment of his employee and his trailer.",
      "\u201cWe did everything right and had nothing to hide, and that was ultimately what they found,\u201d said Barrios, who estimates he spent $20,000 in legal fees to clear his driver\u2019s name and get the trailer out of impound.",
      "Border Patrol agents and local police have many names for these kinds of stops: \u201cwhisper,\u201d \u201cintel\u201d or \u201cwall\u201d stops. Those stops are meant to conceal \u2014 or wall off \u2014 that the true reason for the stop is a tip from federal agents sitting miles away, watching data feeds showing who\u2019s traveling on America\u2019s roads and predicting who is \u201csuspicious,\u201d according to documents and people interviewed by the AP.",
      "In 2022, a man from Houston had his car searched from top to bottom by Texas sheriff\u2019s deputies outside San Antonio after they got a similar tipoff from Border Patrol agents about the driver, Alek Schott.",
      "Federal agents observed that Schott had made an overnight trip from Houston to Carrizo Springs, Texas, and back, court records show. They knew he stayed overnight in a hotel about 80 miles (129 kilometers) from the U.S.-Mexico border. They knew that in the morning Schott met a female colleague there before they drove together to a business meeting.",
      "At Border Patrol\u2019s request, Schott was pulled over by Bexar County sheriff\u2019s deputies. The deputies held Schott by the side of the road for more than an hour, searched his car and found nothing.",
      "\u201cThe beautiful thing about the Texas Traffic Code is there\u2019s thousands of things you can stop a vehicle for,\u201d said Joel Babb, the sheriff\u2019s deputy who stopped Schott\u2019s car, in a deposition in a lawsuit Schott filed alleging violations of his constitutional rights.",
      "According to testimony and documents released as part of Schott\u2019s lawsuit, Babb was on a group chat with federal agents called Northwest Highway. Babb deleted the WhatsApp chat off his phone but Schott\u2019s lawyers were able to recover some of the text messages.",
      "Through a public records act request, the AP also obtained more than 70 pages of the Northwest Highway group chats from June and July of this year from a Texas county that had at least one sheriff\u2019s deputy active in the chat. The AP was able to associate numerous phone numbers in both sets of documents with Border Patrol agents and Texas law enforcement officials.",
      "The chat logs show Border Patrol agents and Texas sheriffs deputies trading tips about vehicles\u2019 travel patterns \u2014 based on suspicions about little more than someone taking a quick trip to the border region and back. The chats show how thoroughly Texas highways are surveilled by this federal-local partnership and how much detailed information is informally shared.",
      "In one exchange a law enforcement official included a photo of someone\u2019s driver\u2019s license and told the group the person, who they identified using an abbreviation for someone in the country illegally, was headed westbound. \u201cNeed BP?,\u201d responded a group member whose number was labeled \u201cbp Intel.\u201d \u201cYes sir,\u201d the official answered, and a Border Patrol agent was en route.",
      "Border Patrol agents and local law enforcement shared information about U.S. citizens\u2019 social media profiles and home addresses with each other after stopping them on the road. Chats show Border Patrol was also able to determine whether vehicles were rentals and whether drivers worked for rideshare services.",
      "In Schott\u2019s case, Babb testified that federal agents \u201cactually watch travel patterns on the highway\u201d through license plate scans and other surveillance technologies. He added: \u201cI just know that they have a lot of toys over there on the federal side.\u201d",
      "After finding nothing in Schott\u2019s car, Babb said \u201cnine times out of 10, this is what happens,\u201d a phrase Schott\u2019s lawyers claimed in court filings shows the sheriff\u2019s department finds nothing suspicious in most of its searches. Babb did not respond to multiple requests for comment from AP.",

      "Today, the deserts, forests and mountains of the nation\u2019s land borders are dotted with checkpoints and increasingly, surveillance towers, Predator drones, thermal cameras and license plate readers, both covert and overt.",
      "Border Patrol's parent agency got authorization to run a domestic license plate reader program in 2017, according to a Department of Homeland Security policy document. At the time, the agency said that it might use hidden license plate readers \u201dfor a set period of time while CBP is conducting an investigation of an area of interest or smuggling route. Once the investigation is complete, or the illicit activity has stopped in that area, the covert cameras are removed,\u201d the document states.",
      "But that\u2019s not how the program has operated in practice, according to interviews, police reports and court documents. License plate readers have become a major \u2014 and in some places permanent \u2014 fixture of the border region.",
      "In a budget request to Congress in fiscal year 2024, CBP said that its Conveyance Monitoring and Predictive Recognition System, or CMPRS, \u201ccollects license plate images and matches the processed images against established hot lists to assist \u2026 in identifying travel patterns indicative of illegal border related activities.\u201d Several new developer jobs have been posted seeking applicants to help modernize its license plate surveillance system in recent months. Numerous Border Patrol sectors now have special intelligence units that can analyze license plate reader data, and tie commercial license plate readers to its national network, according to documents and interviews.",
      "Border Patrol worked with other law enforcement agencies in Southern California about a decade ago to develop pattern recognition, said a former CBP official who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal. Over time, the agency learned to develop what it calls \u201cpatterns of life\u201d of vehicle movements by sifting through the license plate data and determining \u201cabnormal\u201d routes, evaluating if drivers were purposely avoiding official checkpoints. Some cameras can take photos of a vehicle\u2019s plates as well as its driver\u2019s face, the official said.",
      "Another former Border Patrol official compared it to a more technologically sophisticated version of what agents used to do in the field \u2014 develop hunches based on experience about which vehicles or routes smugglers might use, find a legal basis for the stop like speeding and pull drivers over for questioning.",
      "The cameras take pictures of vehicle license plates. Then, the photos are \u201cread\u201d by the system, which automatically detects and distills the images into numbers and letters, tied to a geographic location, former CBP officials said. The AP could not determine how precisely the system's algorithm defines a quick turnaround or an odd route. Over time, the agency has amassed databases replete with images of license plates, and the system\u2019s algorithm can flag an unusual \u201cpattern of life\u201d for human inspection.",
      "The Border Patrol also has access to a nationwide network of plate readers run by the Drug Enforcement Administration, documents show, and was authorized in 2020 to access license plate reader systems sold by private companies. In documents obtained by the AP, a Border Patrol official boasted about being able to see that a vehicle that had traveled to \u201cDallas, Little Rock, Arkansas and Atlanta\u201d before ending up south of San Antonio.",
      "Documents show that Border Patrol or CBP has in the past had access to data from at least three private sector vendors: Rekor, Vigilant Solutions and Flock Safety.",
      "Through Flock alone, Border Patrol for a time had access to at least 1,600 license plate readers across 22 states, and some counties have reported looking up license plates on behalf of CBP even in states like California and Illinois that ban sharing data with federal immigration authorities, according to an AP analysis of police disclosures. A Flock spokesperson told AP the company \u201cfor now\u201d had paused its pilot programs with CBP and a separate DHS agency, Homeland Security Investigations, and declined to discuss the type or volume of data shared with either federal agency, other than to say agencies could search for vehicles wanted in conjunction with a crime. No agencies currently list Border Patrol as receiving Flock data. Vigilant and Rekor did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Where Border Patrol places its cameras is a closely guarded secret. However, through public records requests, the AP obtained dozens of permits the agency filed with Arizona and Michigan for permission to place cameras on state-owned land. The permits show the agency frequently disguises its cameras by concealing them in traffic equipment like the yellow and orange barrels that dot American roadways, or by labeling them as jobsite equipment. An AP photographer in October visited the locations identified in more than two dozen permit applications in Arizona, finding that most of the Border Patrol\u2019s hidden equipment remains in place today. Spokespeople for the Arizona and Michigan departments of transportation said they approve permits based on whether they follow state and federal rules and are not privy to details on how license plate readers are used.",
      "Texas, California, and other border states did not provide documents in response to the AP\u2019s public records requests.",
      "CBP\u2019s attorneys and personnel instructed local cities and counties in both Arizona and Texas to withhold records from the AP that might have revealed details about the program\u2019s operations, even though they were requested under state open records laws, according to emails and legal briefs filed with state governments. For example, CBP claimed records requested by the AP in Texas \u201cwould permit private citizens to anticipate weaknesses in a police department, avoid detection, jeopardize officer safety, and generally undermine police efforts.\u201d Michigan redacted the exact locations of Border Patrol equipment, but the AP was able to determine general locations from the name of the county.",
      "One page of the group chats obtained by the AP shows that a participant enabled WhatsApp\u2019s disappearing messages feature to ensure communications were deleted automatically.",
      "The Border Patrol\u2019s license plate reader program is just one part of a steady transformation of its parent agency, CBP, in the years since 9/11 into an intelligence operation whose reach extends far beyond borders, according to interviews with former officials.",
      "CBP has quietly amassed access to far more information from ports of entry, airports and intelligence centers than other local, state and federal law enforcement agencies. And like a domestic spy agency, CBP has mostly hidden its role in the dissemination of intelligence on purely domestic travel through its use of whisper stops.",
      "Border Patrol has also extended the reach of its license plate surveillance program by paying for local law enforcement to run plate readers on their behalf.",
      "A federal grant program called Operation Stonegarden, which has existed in some form for nearly two decades, has handed out hundreds of millions of dollars to buy automated license plate readers, camera-equipped drones and other surveillance gear for local police and sheriffs agencies. Stonegarden grant funds also pay for local law enforcement overtime, which deputizes local officers to work on Border Patrol enforcement priorities. Under President Donald Trump, the Republican-led Congress this year allocated $450 million for Stonegarden to be handed out over the next four fiscal years. In the previous four fiscal years, the program gave out $342 million.",
      "In Cochise County, Arizona, Sheriff Mark Dannels said Stonegarden grants, which have been used to buy plate readers and pay for overtime, have let his deputies merge their mission with Border Patrol\u2019s to prioritize border security.",
      "\u201cIf we\u2019re sharing our authorities, we can put some consequences behind, or deterrence behind, \u2018Don\u2019t come here,\u2019\u201d he said.",
      "In 2021, the Ward County, Texas, sheriff sought grant funding from DHS to buy a \u201ccovert, mobile, License Plate Reader\u201d to pipe data to Border Patrol\u2019s Big Bend Sector Intelligence Unit. The sheriff's department did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Other documents AP obtained show that Border Patrol connects locally owned and operated license plate readers bought through Stonegarden grants to its computer systems, vastly increasing the federal agency\u2019s surveillance network.",
      "How many people have been caught up in the Border Patrol\u2019s dragnet is unknown. One former Border Patrol agent who worked on the license plate reader pattern detection program in California said the program had an 85% success rate of discovering contraband once he learned to identify patterns that looked suspicious. But another former official in a different Border Patrol sector said he was unaware of successful interdictions based solely on license plate patterns.",
      "In Trump\u2019s second term, Border Patrol has extended its reach and power as border crossings have slowed to historic lows and freed up agents for operations in the heartland. Border Patrol Sector Chief Gregory Bovino, for example, was tapped to direct hundreds of agents from multiple DHS agencies in the administration\u2019s immigration sweeps across Los Angeles, more than 150 miles (241 kilometers) from his office in El Centro, California. Bovino later was elevated to lead the aggressive immigration crackdown in Chicago. Numerous Border Patrol officials have also been tapped to replace ICE leadership.",
      "The result has been more encounters between the agency and the general public than ever before.",
      "\u201cWe took Alek\u2019s case because it was a clear-cut example of an unconstitutional traffic stop,\u201d said Christie Hebert, who works at the nonprofit public interest law firm Institute for Justice and represents Schott. \u201dWhat we found was something much larger \u2014 a system of mass surveillance that threatens people\u2019s freedom of movement.\u201d",
      "AP found numerous other examples similar to what Schott and the delivery driver experienced in reviewing court records in border communities and along known smuggling routes in Texas and California. Several police reports and court records the AP examined cite \u201csuspicious\u201d travel patterns or vague tipoffs from the Border Patrol or other unnamed law enforcement agencies. In another federal court document filed in California, a Border Patrol agent acknowledged \u201cconducting targeted analysis on vehicles exhibiting suspicious travel patterns\u201d as the reason he singled out a Nissan Altima traveling near San Diego.",
      "In cases reviewed by the AP, local law enforcement sometimes tried to conceal the role the Border Patrol plays in passing along intelligence. Babb, the deputy who stopped Schott, testified he typically uses the phrase \u201csubsequent to prior knowledge\u201d when describing whisper stops in his police reports to acknowledge that the tip came from another law enforcement agency without revealing too much in written documents he writes memorializing motorist encounters.",
      "Once they pull over a vehicle deemed suspicious, officers often aggressively question drivers about their travels, their belongings, their jobs, how they know the passengers in the car, and much more, police records and bodyworn camera footage obtained by the AP show. One Texas officer demanded details from a man about where he met his current sexual partner. Often drivers, such as the one working for the South Carolina moving company, were arrested on suspicion of money laundering merely for carrying a few thousand dollars worth of cash, with no apparent connection to illegal activity. Prosecutors filed lawsuits to try to seize money or vehicles on the suspicion they were linked to trafficking.",
      "Schott warns that for every success story touted by Border Patrol, there are far more innocent people who don\u2019t realize they\u2019ve become ensnared in a technology-driven enforcement operation.",
      "\u201cI assume for every one person like me, who\u2019s actually standing up, there\u2019s a thousand people who just don\u2019t have the means or the time or, you know, they just leave frustrated and angry. They don\u2019t have the ability to move forward and hold anyone accountable,\u201d Schott said. \u201cI think there\u2019s thousands of people getting treated this way.\u201d",

      "President Nikos Christodoulides said that the first quantity of natural gas that could be exported abroad will come from the so-called Cronos deposit, which is operated by a consortium made up of Italian company Eni and French firm TotalEnergies.",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s very worrying because it\u2019s a hot spot with lots of boat traffic,\u2019\u2019 said Guido Pietroluongo, a veterinarian at the University of Padua\u2019s emergency response team for stranded dolphins, whales and porpoises, known by the acronym CERT.",

      "\u201cThe Shroud of Turin: An Immersive Experience,\u201d a $5-million exhibit in Garden Grove featuring 360-degree projection room theaters, Shroud of Turin replicas, interactive kiosks, and a life-size sculpture of Christ, was conceived over a span of three years and funded through private donations.",
      "The content was created primarily by Othonia, Inc., a Rome-based group dedicated to the examination of the shroud, one of the most studied artifacts in history. The original \u2014 a 14-foot-long, 3.5-foot-wide (4.3-meter-long, 1 meter-wide) cloth \u2014 is kept in a bulletproof, climate-controlled case housed in the Cathedral of Saint John the Baptist in Turin, Italy.",
      "The California museum \u2014 covering 10,000 square feet (930 square meters) \u2014 contains a life-size laminated visual of the shroud stretched over a wall. It shows the faint image of a man with wounds similar to those of Christ.",
      "The Vatican has called the cloth a powerful symbol of Christ\u2019s suffering while making no claim to its authenticity. Many experts stand by carbon-dating of scraps of the cloth that put it in the 13th or 14th century, but many faithful \u2014 some accomplished scientists among them \u2014 say the results might have been skewed by contamination, calling for larger samples to be analyzed. Many insist that the cloth contains pollen from Jerusalem and is woven in a pattern that was unique to the first century.",
      "The cloth, considered a relic by many Christians, was most recently on display in the spring of 2015. While the shroud may never leave Turin, the new exhibit will remain at least through 2030 on the Christ Cathedral campus, next to the famous glass tower and sanctuary erected by televangelist Robert H. Schuller that is now home to the Catholic Diocese of Orange.",
      "The Most Rev. Timothy Freyer, an auxiliary bishop at the diocese, said he hopes the exhibit will reinforce for visitors the power of God\u2019s love for all.",
      "\u201cMy hope is that people of faith will have stronger faith, people who are doubting will come to belief and people with no faith will begin the questioning process and then come to faith,\u201d he said.",
      "One of the highlights of the immersive experience is a re-creation of Christ\u2019s resurrection on Easter morning, with museum visitors sitting in the tomb and watching the shrouded body disappear in a flash of light. The exhibit also features replicas of the spear believed to have pierced Christ\u2019s chest and the helmet of thorns placed on his head.",
      "Philip Rizzo, a parishioner at St. Bonaventure Catholic Church in Huntington Beach who was part of a group that got a preview, said seeing these items up close created a powerful visual representation of Christ\u2019s suffering and sacrifice. Also, he said, witnessing the extensive scientific research conducted on the cloth makes the artifact more relatable.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re tangible beings, not just spirit and light,\u201d Rizzo said. \u201cScience really helps make that connection.\u201d",
      "While some scientists have criticized the eagerness of Christians to authenticate the cloth, the new exhibit had its origins in such curiosity. Its main proponent was August Accetta, a gynecologist who opened up the Shroud Center of Southern California in 1998 and has studied the cloth's mystery for over three decades.",
      "Accetta said it was the Shroud of Turin that converted him from agnostic to Catholic. His Shroud fascination continued after meeting John Jackson, a nuclear physicist, who in 1978 led a 40-person team of scientists as part of the Shroud of Turin Research Project. Their study determined that the cloth was not a manufactured work of art, but contained human bloodstains and that no known physical, chemical or biological process could adequately explain how the image on the Shroud was formed.",
      "Accetta believes, as some other scientists do, that the image was created by a burst of radiation and that a massive amount of energy is required to create the image without burning the cloth.",
      "\u201cOn the shroud, you see four centimeters of anatomically correct information encoded in two microns, which is about half the thickness of a strand of hair,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t even begin to understand that, let alone reproduce it.\u201d",
      "To him, the only explanation \u2014 as the interactive exhibit illustrates \u2014 is that the body of Christ became light and the shroud simply collapsed, leaving the fine imprint of his face on the white linen.",

      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump has made hardline immigration policies a signature issue, but acknowledged on Wednesday that he's been criticized for recently saying some skilled immigrants should be allowed into the country from his \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d supporters.",
      "Trump told an audience of business executives that the U.S. needs immigrants who can train domestic workers in high-tech factories \u2014 and insisted that doing so is not inconsistent with his core political beliefs.",

And those people can go home.\u201d",
      "The comments drew applause in the room. But last week, Trump sparred with Fox News host Laura Ingraham over the same issue.

      "For technology adopters looking for the next big thing, \u201cagentic AI\u201d is the future. At least, that's what the marketing pitches and tech industry T-shirts say.",
      "What makes an artificial intelligence product \u201cagentic\u201d depends on who's selling it. But the promise is usually that it's a step beyond today's generative AI chatbots.",
      "Chatbots, however useful, are all talk and no action. They can answer questions, retrieve and summarize information, write papers and generate images, music, video and lines of code. AI agents, by contrast, are supposed to be able to take actions on a person's behalf.",
      "But if you're confused, you're not alone. Google searches for \u201cagentic\u201d have skyrocketed from near obscurity a year ago to a peak earlier this fall.",
      "A new report Tuesday by researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Boston Consulting Group, who surveyed more than 2,000 business executives around the world, describes agentic AI as a \u201cnew class of systems\u201d that \u201ccan plan, act, and learn on their own.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey are not just tools to be operated or assistants waiting for instructions,\u201d says the MIT Sloan Management Review report. \"Increasingly, they behave like autonomous teammates, capable of executing multistep processes and adapting as they go.\u201d",
      "AI chatbots \u2014 such as the original ChatGPT that debuted three years ago this month \u2014 rely on systems called large language models that predict the next word in a sentence based on the huge trove of human writings they've been trained on. They can sound remarkably human, especially when given a voice, but are effectively performing a kind of word completion.",
      "That's different from what AI developers \u2014 including ChatGPT's maker, OpenAI, and tech giants like Amazon, Google, IBM, Microsoft and Salesforce \u2014 have in mind for AI agents.",
      "\u201cA generative AI-based chatbot will say, \u2018Here are the great ideas\u2019 \u2026 and then be done,\u201d said Swami Sivasubramanian, vice president of Agentic AI at Amazon Web Services, in an interview this week. \u201cIt\u2019s useful, but what makes things agentic is that it goes beyond what a chatbot does.\u201d",
      "Sivasubramanian, a longtime Amazon employee, took on his new role helping to lead work on AI agents in Amazon's cloud computing division earlier this year. He sees great promise in AI systems that can be given a \u201chigh-level goal\u201d and break it down into a series of steps and act upon them. \u201cI truly believe agentic AI is going to be one of the biggest transformations since the beginning of the cloud,\u201d he said.",
      "For most consumers, the first encounters with AI agents could be in realms like online shopping. Set a budget and some preferences and AI agents can buy things or arrange travel bookings using your credit card. In the longer run, the hope is that they can do more complex tasks with access to your computer and a set of guidelines to follow.",

Previously, the word describing something that has agency was mostly found in other academic fields, such as psychology or chemistry.",

      "In the 1990s, \u201cpeople agreed that some software appeared more like an agent, and some felt less like an agent, and there was not a perfect dividing line,\u201d said Tambe, a professor at Harvard University. \u201cNonetheless, it seemed useful to use the word \u2018agent\u2019 to describe software or robotic entities acting autonomously in an environment, sensing the environment, reacting to it, planning, thinking.\u201d",
      "The prominent AI researcher Andrew Ng, co-founder of online learning company Coursera, helped advocate for popularizing the adjective \u201cagentic\u201d more than a year ago to encompass a broader spectrum of AI tasks. At the time, he also appreciated that mainly \u201ctechnical people\u201d were describing it that way.",
      "\u201cWhen I see an article that talks about \u2018agentic\u2019 workflows, I\u2019m more likely to read it, since it\u2019s less likely to be marketing fluff and more likely to have been written by someone who understands the technology,\u201d Ng wrote in a June 2024 blog post.",

      "The European Union is considering stricter scrutiny for Amazon and Microsoft's cloud businesses",
      "LONDON -- The cloud businesses of Amazon and Microsoft could face stricter scrutiny from European Union regulators, who are looking into whether they should fall under the bloc's dragnet on Big Tech companies.",
      "The bloc's executive Commission said Tuesday that it's assessing whether Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure should be classified as \u201cgatekeepers\u201d under the EU's Digital Markets Act.",
      "The sweeping rule book is designed to rein in the market power of tech companies with a list of do's and don'ts, under threat of hefty penalties.",
      "Gatekeepers face extra obligations under the DMA and regulators have already given the label to other parts of the two companies, such as Amazon Marketplace and Microsoft's LinkedIn. The designation is based partly on user numbers, which makes it harder to apply to cloud computing providers.",
      "The Commission said it will look at whether Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure \u201cact as important gateways between businesses and consumers\u201d despite not meeting the thresholds. Market research indicates that cloud service providers like AWS and Azure hold \u201cvery strong positions in relation to businesses and consumers,\u201d it said.",

      "Microsoft said Europe's cloud sector is innovative and highly competitive. \"We stand ready to contribute to the European Commission\u2019s market inquiry,\u201d it said.",

      "In the mid-20th century, comic books groups grew in popularity",
      "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- On a recent day at Sacramento native Lecho Lopez's comic shop in the city, his 5-year-old nephew read his first word aloud: \u201cbad.\u201d It was from a graphic novel.",
      "There was irony in that being his first word, because Lopez credits comic books with many positive things in his life. That's why he supports repealing a city ordinance dating back to 1949 that bars the distribution of many comic books to kids and teens. It's not enforced today.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a silly law,\u201d said Lopez, who has a red-and-black tattoo of the Superman logo on his forearm, in an interview at his store, JLA Comics. \u201cA lot of good things come out of comic books.\"",
      "A City Council committee unanimously voted this week to advance the repeal and designate the third week of September as \u201cSacramento Comic Book Week.\u201d It now heads to the full council for a vote. The ban applies to comic books prominently featuring an account of crime that show images of illegal acts such as arson, murder or rape.",
      "In the mid-20th century, as comic books were on the rise, fears spread over their impact on children, with some arguing they could lead to illiteracy or inspire violent crime. The industry decided to regulate itself, and local governments \u2014 from Los Angeles County to Lafayette, Louisiana \u2014 passed bans to shield certain comics from young people. While some cities like Sacramento still have those laws on the books, they are rarely if ever enforced.",
      "Now, proponents of repealing the Sacramento law say it\u2019s necessary to reflect the value of comics and help protect against a modern wave of book bans.",
      "Comic book author Eben Burgoon, who started a petition to overturn Sacramento's ban, said comics \u201chave this really valuable ability to speak truth to power.\u201d",
      "\"These antiquated laws kind of set up this jeopardy where bad actors could work hard to make this medium imperiled,\u201d he said at a hearing Tuesday held by the city council\u2019s Law and Legislation Committee.",
      "Sacramento is a great place to devote a week to celebrating comics, Burgoon said. The city has a \u201cwonderful\u201d comic book community, he said, and hosts CrockerCon, a comics showcase at a local art museum, every year.",
      "Sam Helmick, president of the American Library Association, said \u201cthere is no good reason\u201d to have a ban such as Sacramento's on the books, saying it \u201cflies in the face of modern First Amendment norms.\u201d",
      "The movement to censor comics decades ago was not an aberration in U.S. history, said Jeff Trexler, interim director of the Comic Book Legal Defense Fund, which fights to protect the free-speech rights of people who read or make comics.",

      "JUNEAU, Alaska -- Storms that battered Alaska's western coast this fall have brought renewed attention to low-lying Indigenous villages left increasingly vulnerable by climate change \u2014 and revived questions about their sustainability in a region being reshaped by frequent flooding, thawing permafrost and landscape-devouring erosion.",
      "The onset of winter has slowed emergency repair and cleanup work after two October storms, including the remnants of Typhoon Halong, slammed dozens of communities. Some residents from the hardest-hit villages, Kipnuk and Kwigillingok, could be displaced for months and worry what their futures hold.",
      "Kwigillingok already was pursuing relocation before the latest storm, but that can take decades, with no centralized coordination and little funding. Moves by the Trump administration to cut grants aimed at better protecting communities against climate threats have added another layer of uncertainty.",
      "Still, the hope is to try to buy villages time to evaluate next steps by reinforcing rebuilt infrastructure or putting in place pilings so homes can be elevated, said Bryan Fisher, the state's emergency management director.",
      "\u201cWhere we can support that increased resilience to buy that time, we\u2019re going to do that,\u201d he said.",
      "Alaska is warming faster than the global average. A report released last year by the Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium found 144 Native communities face threats from erosion, flooding, thawing permafrost or a combination.",
      "Coastal populations are particularly vulnerable, climate scientist John Walsh said. Less Arctic sea ice means more open water, allowing storm-driven waves to do damage. Thawing permafrost invites more rapid coastal erosion. Waves hitting permafrost bounce like water off a concrete wall, he said, but when permafrost thaws, the loose soil washes away more easily.",
      "Wind and storm surge from the remnants of Halong consumed dozens of feet of shoreline in Quinhagak, disturbing a culturally significant archaeological site. Quinhagak, like Kipnuk and Kwigillingok, is near the Bering Sea.",
      "Just four times since 1970 has an ex-typhoon hit the Bering Sea coast north of the Pribilof Islands, said Rick Thoman, a climate specialist with the Alaska Center for Climate Assessment and Preparedness. Three of those have been since 2022, starting with the remnants of Merbok that year.",
      "The damage caused by ex-typhoon Halong was the worst Fisher said he has seen in his roughly 30 years in emergency management. About 700 homes were destroyed or severely damaged, estimates suggest. Some washed away with people inside and were carried for miles. Kipnuk and Kwigillingok \u2014 no strangers to flooding and home to around 1,100 people \u2014 were devastated. One person died, and two remain missing.",
      "At-risk communities can reinforce existing infrastructure or fortify shoreline; move infrastructure to higher ground in what is known as managed retreat; or relocate entirely. The needs are enormous \u2014 $4.3 billion over 50 years to protect infrastructure in Native communities from climate threats, according to the health consortium report, though that estimate dates to 2020. A lack of resources and coordination has impeded progress, the report found.",
      "Simply announcing plans to relocate can leave a community ineligible for funding for new infrastructure at their existing site, and government policies can limit investments at a new site if people aren't living there yet, the report said.",
      "It took decades and an estimated $160 million for the roughly 300 residents of Newtok in western Alaska to move 9 miles (14.5 kilometers) to their new village of Mertarvik. Newtok was one of the first Alaska Native communities to fully relocate, but others are considering or pursuing it. In Washington and Louisiana, climate change has been a driving force behind relocation efforts by some tribes.",
      "But many villages, including Kipnuk and Kwigillingok, \u201cdon't have that kind of time,\u201d said Sheryl Musgrove, director of the Alaska Climate Justice Program at the Alaska Institute for Justice. The two are among 10 tribal communities her group has been working with as they navigate climate-adaptation decisions.",

      "Trump, who has demonstrated low regard for Zelenskyy dating back to his first term, said Friday he expects the Ukrainian leader to respond to his administration's new plan to end the war by next Thursday.",

      "The Justice Department is on the clock to release files relating to Jeffrey Epstein after President Donald Trump signed a measure passed by Congress",
      "WASHINGTON -- What began as a campaign-trail promise to release the Jeffrey Epstein files has become one of the most fraught tests of President Donald Trump\u2019s second term \u2014 opening a rift in his political coalition and raising the stakes for an administration now under intense pressure to produce documents that may fall far short of public expectations.",
      "The issue came to a head this week. After months of efforts by the Trump administration to quash it, both chambers of Congress passed a measure forcing the release of the Epstein files with near-anonymous support. Trump, who changed course days before the vote to bless the effort, signed the legislation Wednesday, starting a 30-day window for the Justice Department to deliver the records.",
      "Expectations are sky-high, fueled by years of conspiracy theories promoted by many now in Trump\u2019s orbit. Yet with some claims \u2014 such as a rumored \u201cclient list\u201d of prominent men linked to Epstein \u2014 already deemed nonexistent by federal officials, the anti-establishment coalition Trump built in part by elevating those theories is showing cracks that may widen with the anticipated release.",
      "\u201cWatching this actually turn into a fight has ripped MAGA apart,\u201d Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene said this week, flanked by Epstein survivors ahead of the House vote.",
      "\u201cThe only thing that will speak to the powerful, courageous women behind me is when action is actually taken to release these files,\u201d said Greene, who announced late Friday that she will resign from Congress in January. \u201cAnd the American people won\u2019t tolerate any other bulls\u2014-.\u201d",
      "Epstein\u2019s abuse and 2019 death in a New York jail cell have generated conspiracy theories for years, especially on the political right.",
      "On the campaign trail, Trump expressed openness to releasing the investigative documents, nodding to anti-establishment demands to open up the government\u2019s files on other high-profile cases like the assassinations of John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr.",
      "But once Trump was back in office, divulging records from the federal investigations \u2014 as well as satisfying the appetites of conspiracy theorists \u2013 became less appealing. Attorney General Pam Bondi raised expectations of a full release, only to reverse course over the summer. Her attempt to close the book on the Epstein saga outraged many on the right.",
      "It was the first sign of a rift in Trump\u2019s coalition, and Democrats took notice.",
      "In Congress, they began looking for ways to force Republicans to take votes on releasing the Epstein files. Eventually, they found traction with two tracks: initiating an investigation in the House Oversight Committee and putting full support behind a rarely successful petition that maneuvers around the House speaker\u2019s control of which bills see the floor.",
      "The Democratic effort \u2014 joined by a few key Republicans, including Greene \u2014 culminated last week in passage of the bill with overwhelming support from both chambers of Congress.

      "Trump has signed legislation compelling the Justice Department to release the files on Jeffrey Epstein",
      "For Marina Lacerda, the upcoming publication of U.S. government files on Jeffrey Epstein represent more than an opportunity for justice: Lacerda says she was just 14 when Epstein started sexually abusing her at his New York mansion, but she struggles to recall much of what happened because it is such a dark period in her life.",
      "Now, she\u2019s hoping that the files will reveal more about the trauma that distorted so much of her adolescence.",
      "\u201cI feel that the government and the FBI knows more than I do, and that scares me, because it\u2019s my life, it\u2019s my past,\u201d she told The Associated Press.",

      "\u201cWe have waited long enough. We\u2019ve fought long enough,\u201d Lacerda said.",
      "It isn't clear yet how much new information will be in the files, gathered over two decades of investigations into Epstein's alleged sexual abuse of many girls and women.",
      "Some of his accusers expect the files to provide a level of transparency they had hardly allowed themselves to believe would materialize, but the release of the documents will be a more complicated moment for others.",
      "The FBI and police in Palm Beach, Florida, began investigating Epstein in the mid-2000s after several underage girls said he had paid them for sex acts. He pleaded guilty in 2008 to charges including procuring a minor for prostitution, but a secret deal with the U.S. attorney in Florida allowed him to avoid a federal prosecution. He served little more than a year in custody.",
      "Jena-Lisa Jones says she was abused by Epstein in Palm Beach, in 2002, when she was 14. She did not report the abuse to the police at the time, but she later became one of many accusers to sue the multimillionaire.",
      "The Miami Herald published a series of articles about Epstein in 2018 that exposed new details about how the federal prosecution was shelved. A year later, federal prosecutors in New York, where Epstein owned a mansion, revived the case and charged him with sex-trafficking",
      "Jones said she was interviewed during that federal investigation and was prepared to testify in court.",
      "\u201cIt was very important for me to have my moment, for him to see my face and hear my words, and me have that control and power back,\u201d Jones said.",
      "But that day never came.",
      "Epstein killed himself in a federal jail cell in New York City in August 2019.",
      "In lieu of her day in court, Jones and others are hoping for a public reckoning with the publication of the government files on Epstein.",
      "While the government only ever charged two people \u2014 Epstein and his longtime confidante Ghislaine Maxwell \u2014 in connection with the alleged abuse, at least one of Epstein's accusers has claimed she was instructed to have sex with other rich and powerful men.",
      "Jones didn't make similar claims but said she believes the documents could map out a \u201cbroad scheme\u201d involving others.",

      "Lacerda said she was soon spending so much time working for Epstein that she dropped out of school. The sexual abuse persisted until she turned 17, when Epstein informed her that she was \u201ctoo old,\u201d she said.",
      "Lacerda wondered whether the files might include videos and photographs of her and other victims at Epstein\u2019s properties.",
      "\u201cI need to know \u2014 for my healing process and for the adult in me \u2014 what I did as a child,\u201d Lacerda said. \u201cIt will be re-traumatizing, but it\u2019s transparency \u2014 and I need it,\u201d she said.",

      "\u201cI guess it really comes from the trauma I\u2019ve endured, because this is kind of what Jeffrey Epstein did to us. You know, he wasn\u2019t transparent. He played these manipulation tactics,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s triggering for anybody who\u2019s been in that situation.\u201d",

      "Republican Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia has announced she will resign from Congress on January 5, 2026",
      "ATLANTA -- It all happened so fast. Less than a week after President Donald Trump denounced Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, the Georgia Republican announced that she would resign from Congress on Jan. 5.",
      "Greene's departure will cap five tumultuous years in Congress. She was first an outsider, then briefly at the center of power during House Speaker Kevin McCarthy's reign. Trump's return to the White House could have heralded a new era of clout in Washington, but Greene's simmering discontent led to a split with the president.",
      "Here's a look at Greene's background and some of the most notable episodes in her tumultuous five-year career in Congress.",
      "Greene had little involvement in politics before Trump ran for president. She and her husband had bought a commercial contracting company from Greene's father. Greene later opened a CrossFit gym in suburban Atlanta. But during the 2016 campaign, she started posting stories and videos online.",
      "Her initial commentary was a stew of conspiracy theories. Greene suggested a 2017 mass shooting in Las Vegas was a coordinated attack to spur support for new gun restrictions. In 2018, she endorsed the idea that the U.S. government perpetrated the attacks on Sept. 11, 2001. In a video filmed at the U.S. Capitol in 2018, she claimed Reps. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., and Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., both Muslim women, weren\u2019t \u201cofficial\u201d members of Congress because they used Qurans rather than Bibles in their swearing-in ceremonies.",
      "In 2020, Greene jumped into politics by joining a crowded Republican primary in a competitive congressional district in suburban Atlanta, where she lived. But after the incumbent in northwest Georgia's strongly Republican 14th District announced his retirement, Greene shifted her candidacy there.",
      "During her campaign, Greene openly sympathized with QAnon, a conspiracy theory involving a global cabal of Satan-worshipping cannibals, including U.S. government leaders, that operates a child sex trafficking ring. She eventually distanced herself, saying she got \u201csucked into some of the things I had seen on the internet.\u201d",
      "Greene won the Republican nomination in a runoff and then cruised to election when Democrat Kevin Van Ausdal dropped out of the race.",
      "Some of Greene's most inflammatory rhetoric wasn't publicized until after she was elected, like a 2018 claim that California wildfires were ignited by a laser beam from space controlled by the Rothschild banking family.",
      "The claim was often summarized as \u201cJewish space lasers\u201d because the family has been the subject of antisemitic claims over the years. Greene later said she didn't know the Rothschilds were Jewish.",
      "A Democratic-led House kicked Greene off both her committees just weeks into her first term, saying she'd earned the punishment by spreading by hateful and violent conspiracy theories. Eleven Republicans backed the ejections.",

For example, she and two other Republican House members sued House Speaker Nancy Pelosi after they were fined for refusing to wear masks on the House floor during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
      "When Republicans won the House majority in 2022, she lined up with McCarthy, the California Republican who became House speaker. McCarthy returned Greene to committee assignments and enlisted her as a close adviser.",
      "Greene has often been at the center of drama with Democrats, including bickering with Democratic Rep. Jasmine Crockett of Texas and heckling President Joe Biden as a \u201cliar\u201d during one of his State of the Union speeches.",
      "While Trump ran for a second term, Greene was a constant cheerleader, often appearing alongside him at rallies in Georgia and elsewhere.",
      "But they soon drifted apart. Greene\u2019s discontent dates back at least to May, when she announced she wouldn\u2019t run for the Senate against Democratic incumbent Jon Ossoff. Trump later claimed that he had sent Greene a poll showing that she \u201cdidn't have a chance\u201d in the race.",
      "Greene also passed on running for Georgia governor, attacking a political \u201cgood ole boy\u201d system and alleging it was endangering Republican control of the state.",
      "She started taking positions contrary to Trump. Greene described Israel's actions in Gaza as a \u201cgenocide\u201d against Palestinians, and she backed the release of files related to Jeffrey Epstein. She also criticized Republican leadership over the recent federal government shutdown, saying they needed a better plan to ease the sting of expiring health insurance subsidies.",
      "Greene referred to herself as \u201cAmerica first, America only,\u201d suggesting that Trump was too focused on foreign affairs. As her criticism escalated, Trump became fed up and said he would endorse a primary challenger.",
      "After years of support, he declared, Greene was a \u201ctraitor.\u201d A week later, she announced her resignation.",

      "\u201cPretrial publicity, even when intense, is not itself a constitutional defect,\" prosecutors wrote in a 121-page court filing, citing prior rulings from the Supreme Court and the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.",
      "As for the evidence, which Mangione\u2019s lawyers contend was collected without a warrant and without him being read his rights, prosecutors said police officers were justified in searching the suspect\u2019s backpack to make sure there were no dangerous items. His statements to officers, they said, were made voluntarily and before he was taken into police custody.",
      "Rather than dismissing the case outright or barring the government from seeking the death penalty, prosecutors argued, the defense\u2019s concerns can best be alleviated by carefully questioning prospective jurors about their knowledge of the case and ensuring Mangione\u2019s rights are respected at trial.",
      "\u201cWhat the defendant recasts as a constitutional crisis is merely a repackaging of arguments\u201d rejected in previous cases, prosecutors said. \u201cNone warrants dismissal of the indictment or categorical preclusion of a congressionally authorized punishment.\u201d",

      "Her break with him was a notable fissure in his grip over conservatives, particularly his most ardent base. But her decision to step down in the face of his opposition put her on the same track as many of the more moderate establishment Republicans before her who went crosswise with Trump.",
      "The congresswoman, who recorded the video announcing her resignation while sitting in her living room wearing a cross necklace and with a Christmas tree and a peace lily plant behind her, said, \u201cMy life is filled with happiness, and my true convictions remain unchanged, because my self-worth is not defined by a man, but instead by God.\u201d",

Jacky Rosen, D-Nev., and other lawmakers.",
      "Rosen and Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., sent a letter on Friday to Adm. Kevin Lunday, the acting commandant of the Coast Guard, who had released the memo late Thursday to make clear that \u201chate symbols and flags are prohibited.\u201d",
      "The senators, who said they spoke to Lunday on Thursday, called the new policy a \u201cstep in the right direction to affirm the Coast Guard\u2019s commitment to maintaining a safe and inclusive environment for all its members.\u201d",

      "Nevada gaming regulators voted to fine Caesars Palace $7.8 million Thursday over failing to comply with anti-money laundering rules, settling a case that centered on an illegal bookmaker with ties to the former interpreter for the baseball star Shohei Ohtani.",
      "The Nevada Gaming Control Board alleged that Caesars Palace failed to verify bookmaker Mathew Bowyer's source of funds as he gambled millions of dollars between 2017 and 2024, despite suspicions being raised on several occasions and an anonymous tip that Bowyer was a bookie.",
      "It's the third casino to be fined at least partly in relation to Bowyer's activity; a $10.5 million stipulated fine handed to the Resorts World casino earlier this year was the second-largest ever from the gaming board.",
      "Caesars executives said their systems for catching such behavior had failed.",
      "\u201cThere is no customer that\u2019s worth illegitimate profits. We didn\u2019t catch Bowyer and we should have,\u201d Tom Reeg, the CEO of Caesars Entertainment, said at Thursday's hearing.",
      "Bowyer pleaded guilty to federal charges in 2024, which included running an illegal gambling business and money laundering. Prosecutors said Bowyer took bets from hundreds of people, including Ohtani's former interpreter, Ippei Mizuhara.",

      "The Kennedy Center is receiving $7.4 million ahead of the World Cup draw next month",
      "WASHINGTON -- The Kennedy Center said Friday that it is being paid $7.4 million to hold the draw for the World Cup at the performing arts venue on Dec. 5.",
      "FIFA is donating $2.4 million to the Kennedy Center as it prepares to host one of the biggest events in sports, Roma Daravi, the Kennedy Center's vice president of public relations, told The Associated Press. Soccer's world governing body \u201chas also given us sponsorship opportunities separate from their commitments for an additional $5 million,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cWhen you look at the full picture, it totals $7.4 million to the Kennedy Center, plus incurred expenses,\u201d Daravi added.",
      "The figures, which haven't been previously reported, emerged as Senate Democrats question spending and management practices by Kennedy Center leadership. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, the top Democrat on the Environment and Public Works Committee, released documents Thursday showing the Kennedy Center entered into an agreement giving FIFA \u201cexclusive\u201d use of the facility from Nov. 24 through Dec. 12 at no cost, arguing that the venue was at risk of losing millions in potential revenue because of the arrangement.",
      "Responding to the committee in a letter and on social media, Richard Grenell, the Kennedy Center\u2019s president, said FIFA paid several million dollars as a sponsor, instead of participating in a traditional rental agreement. He added the FIFA was paying for all expenses related to the event.",
      "Asked for comment on the $7.4 million figure, a spokesperson for Democrats on the Environment and Public Works Committee said they have requested that the Kennedy Center answer its questions with documents and have not yet received any documents.",
      "More broadly, Democrats sought to portray wasteful spending by the venue\u2019s management, including thousands of dollars spent on meals, champagne and other beverages along with hotel rooms. Whitehouse targeted $10,773.19 spent by Kennedy Center leaders between April 17 and July 2 on private lunches, dinners and alcohol purchases that he said were unrelated to fundraising needs.",
      "In his response, Grenell insisted the food and beverage costs were related to \u201cdonor-based events\u201d and paled in comparison to the amount spent under the Kennedy Center's previous leadership. He wrote that fundraising costs totaled $4 million from April through June 2024 and $9.3 million for the full year.",
      "Whitehouse also questioned $27,185 spent on rooms at the Watergate Hotel for new hires between April 21 and July 16. Grenell said such expenses are incurred as new employees prepare to move to Washington and said the prior leadership spent $878,000 at the Watergate in 2024.",
      "The final weeks of the year are typically a lighthearted period for the Kennedy Center, with the focus on holiday programming and the annual awards program celebrating some of the top artists in the U.S. But the dispute between Whitehouse and Grenell reflects how the Kennedy Center has become a backdrop for partisan politics.",
      "\u201cI have ample reason to be concerned by reports and information that cast doubt on your stewardship of the institution,\u201d Whitehouse wrote in a letter to Grenell.",

      "The fiery crash of a UPS plane shortly after its left engine flew off its wing and sparked a massive fire during takeoff could spell the end of the 109 remaining MD-11 airliners that have been exclusively hauling cargo for more than a decade.",
      "The fate of the planes won't be determined until after UPS, FedEx and Western Global see how expensive the repairs the Federal Aviation Administration orders will be and learn whether there is a fatal flaw in their design. The package delivery companies may have already been thinking about retiring their MD-11s \u2014 which average more than 30 years old \u2014 over the next few years and replacing them with newer planes that are safer and more efficient. The FAA grounded all MD-11s and the 10 remaining related DC-10s after the crash.",
      "Fourteen people \u2014 including the plane's crew of three \u2014 died after the aircraft crashed into several businesses just outside the Muhammad Ali International Airport in Louisville, Kentucky, on Nov. 4. The plane got only 30 feet (9 meters) into the air.",
      "Mary Schiavo, a former U.S. Department of Transportation Inspector General, said it probably won't be worth fixing the planes when better options are available from Boeing and Airbus, though the manufacturers have such a backlog that it takes years to get a plane after it is ordered. Still, it will depend on exactly what investigators find.",
      "\u201cFor them to order inspections and to ground them as readily as they did makes me think that they\u2019re worried about them,\u201d Schiavo said.",
      "The National Transportation Safety Board said Thursday that its investigators discovered cracks in key parts that failed to keep the rear of the engine attached to the UPS plane's wing. The crash reminded experts of the 1979 disaster that killed 273 after the left engine of an American Airlines jet catapulted up and over its wing after takeoff in Chicago.",
      "That crash led to the worldwide grounding of 274 DC-10s, the predecessor to the MD-11. The airline workhorse was allowed to return to the skies because the NTSB determined that maintenance workers improperly using a forklift to reattach the engine damaged the plane that crashed. That meant the crash wasn't caused by a fatal design flaw even though there had already been a number of accidents involving DC-10s.",
      "The lugs that the NTSB said were cracked and failed in the crash earlier this month are located close to the part that failed in the 1979 crash, but they are different. Investigators will have to determine whether there is a common defect between the UPS plane and other MD-11s or whether the problem that caused the engine to fall off was unique to the plane.",

Twice in the 1970s, a DC-10 lost its rear cargo door in flight. The second time in 1974 caused a crash outside Paris that killed 346 people. But airlines loved the DC-10 for years, and the Air Force maintained a fleet of dozens of tankers based on the DC-10 that it flew for decades before retiring them last year.",
      "Formerly independent aircraft company McDonnell Douglas announced the MD-11 in 1984. The three-engine plane appeared promising with its larger capacity and longer range than the DC-10, but its performance never fully lived up to expectations, and newer planes from Boeing and Airbus eclipsed it. Schiavo said the MD-11 was \u201cpractically obsolete\u201d when it came out compared to two-engine planes, which are cheaper to operate. Only 200 MD-11s were built between 1988 and 2000.",

      "Investigators are looking at the maintenance history of the UPS plane closely. NTSB said the last time a detailed inspection was done on its engines was in 2021. A similar inspection was not done during the extended maintenance the plane underwent the month before the crash, and the plane wasn't due for another in-depth engine inspection until after roughly 7,000 more flights. Boeing and the FAA will have to determine whether that current maintenance schedule is adequate.",

    "summary": "Rapper Prakazrel \"Pras\" Michel of the Fugees has been sentenced to 14 years in prison for a case in which he was convicted of illegally funneling millions of dollars in foreign contributions to the 2012 Obama campaign.",
    "story": [
      "Grammy-winning rapper Prakazrel \"Pras\" Michel of the Fugees was sentenced on Thursday to 14 years in prison for a case in which he was convicted of illegally funneling millions of dollars in foreign contributions to former President Barack Obama's 2012 reelection campaign.",
      "Michel, 52, declined to address the court before U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly sentenced him.",
      "In April 2023, a federal jury convicted Michel of 10 counts, including conspiracy and acting as an unregistered agent of a foreign government. The trial in Washington, D.C., included testimony from actor Leonardo DiCaprio and former Attorney General Jeff Sessions.",
      "Justice Department prosecutors said federal sentencing guidelines recommended a life sentence for Michel, whom they said \"betrayed his country for money\" and \"lied unapologetically and unrelentingly to carry out his schemes.\"",
      "\"His sentence should reflect the breadth and depth of his crimes, his indifference to the risks to his country, and the magnitude of his greed,\" they wrote.",
      "Defense attorney Peter Zeidenberg said his client's 14-year sentence is \"completely disproportionate to the offense.\" Michel will appeal his conviction and sentence, according to his lawyer.",
      "Zeidenberg had recommended a three-year prison sentence. A life sentence would be an \"absurdly high\" punishment for Michel, given that it is typically reserved for deadly terrorists and drug cartel leaders, Michel's attorneys said in a court filing.",
      "\"The Government's position is one that would cause Inspector Javert to recoil and, if anything, simply illustrates just how easily the Guidelines can be manipulated to produce absurd results, and how poorly equipped they are, at least on this occasion, to determine a fair and just sentence,\" they wrote.",
      "Michel, a Brooklyn native whose parents immigrated to the U.S. from Haiti, was a founding member of the Fugees along with childhood friends Lauryn Hill and Wyclef Jean. Their hip-hop band won two Grammy Awards and sold tens of millions of albums.",
      "Michel obtained more than $120 million from Malaysian billionaire Low Taek Jho \u2014 also known as Jho Low \u2014 and steered some of that money through straw donors to Obama's campaign.",
      "Michel said during trial that he viewed Low's payments as \"free money,\" and accepted the millions over the course of nine months to help Low secure a photo op with Obama. He said under oath at the time that no one told him such payments toward political donations could have been unlawful or violations of campaign finance laws.",
      "The Justice Department also charged Michel with serving as an unregistered foreign agent for China, alleging that in 2017 he sought to sway the Trump administration to halt its probe into Low and to extradite a Chinese government target living in the U.S. That individual, dissident Miles Guo, was charged in New York in a billion-dollar fraud case and is still in custody.",
      "Low, who has lived in China, was one of the primary financiers of \"The Wolf of Wall Street,\" a movie starring DiCaprio. Low is a fugitive but has maintained his innocence.",
      "\"Low's motivation for giving Mr. Michel money to donate was not so that he could achieve some policy objective. Instead, Low simply wanted to obtain a photograph with himself and then-President Obama,\" Michel's attorneys wrote.",
      "In August 2024, the judge rejected Michel's request for a new trial based in part on his defense attorney's use of a generative artificial intelligence program during his closing of the trial's arguments. The judges said that and other trial errors didn't amount to a serious miscarriage of justice.",

    "story": [
      "As an artist, Lily Allen stands firm by her belief that heartbreak can be a gift. After all, it helped lead to her latest album, \"West End Girl.\"",
      "\"You know, while I was writing it, I wasn't really sure that it was going to see the light of day,\" Allen told CBS News special correspondent Anthony Mason in an interview for \"CBS Mornings\" that aired Thursday, describing the music as \"an act of desperation.\" The studio album, released in late October, was written during the breakup of her nearly 4-year marriage to \"Stranger Things\" actor David Harbour.",
      "The theme of what's been described as Allen's epic \"breakup album\" centers around tales of a deceptive partner, which the singer says is based partly on truth and partly on fantasy.",
      "Harbour has not directly addressed his breakup with Allen or commented on her \"West End Girl\" album. But in an interview with Esquire UK, published around the album's release, Harbour discussed the importance of accepting your mistakes. \"I'd change everything or nothing. If you accept your past, you accept it completely, even the pain, the mistakes... It's all part of the journey, the growth, the wisdom, the empathy, and the connection, and if you change one thing, you change everything,\" he told the magazine at the time, adding that his work is about being honest.",
      "New album says \"everything that I needed to say\"",
      "But Allen said it was a \"nightmare\" holding onto the album and stunted her healing process. She felt a sense of relief and peace when she finally was able to share her words with the world.",
      "\"Since I've put it out, it's felt completely and utterly liberating. It was kind of hellish having it in the background,\" Allen said. \"I don't know. I just feel like I couldn't \u2013 it said everything that I needed to say. And I felt like I couldn't really like get on with my life until I'd said it.\"",
      "Her newly released music quickly lit up social media, with fans reacting to it on TikTok.",
      "Allen wrote most of the record within the span of 10 days at the end of last year. She was excited to complete the album, but at the same time her personal life was falling into pieces.",
      "After spending Christmas with her two daughters whom she shares with ex-husband Sam Cooper, Allen decided to check herself into a treatment facility.",
      "\"I knew the things I was feeling were too intense,\" Allen explained her decision to seek professional help at the time following her separation. As a recovering alcoholic, Allen said she's not afraid of working on herself and knew she needed some quiet time.",
      "A cathartic release",
      "The Brooklyn townhouse that Allen and Harbour gave Architectural Digest a tour of in 2023 is now listed for around $8 million. The pair bought the home in early 2021 shortly after they got married.",
      "Allen said her music was cathartic \u2013 for herself and her children.",
      "\"All of the pain that, you know, that I've been through in the past year, they've been through too,\" Allen said. \" But you know, one thing that I wanted to do was to show my kids that, you know, you can use that pain and harness it and turn it into something else. And I think I've done that.\"",
      "Now, Allen is preparing for her 2026 tour \u2013 her first since she got sober in 2019.",
      "The singer said she's planning her touring schedule around her girls' holidays so they'll be able to come and bring their friends.",
      "\"I can't wait to have them there. It's like, it's gonna be... It's as much for them as it is for me,\" Allen said, adding that she feels like she's living her best life after a year of healing.",

    "summary": "Many fans of Taylor Swift showed parasocial relationships with the pop star after her engagement to Travis Kelce.",
    "story": [
      "If you felt a personal connection with a celebrity this year, you likely weren't alone.",
      "That feeling led Cambridge Dictionary to select \"parasocial\" as its 2025 word of the year. Parasocial is defined as \"involving or relating to a connection that someone feels between themselves and a famous person they do not know, a character in a book, film, TV series, etc., or an artificial intelligence.\"",
      "It's an academic term that has only been around for about 70 years, but it has now become mainstream, said Colin McIntosh, the lexical program manager for Cambridge Dictionary.",
      "\"Millions of people are engaged in parasocial relationships; many more are simply intrigued by their rise,\" McIntosh said in a statement. \"The data reflects that, with the Cambridge Dictionary website seeing spikes in lookups for 'parasocial.'\"",
      "A recent example of this happened when pop star Taylor Swift and NFL star Travis Kelce announced their engagement. Many fans who have been captivated by Swift's lyrics for years celebrated the moment despite not actually knowing her or Kelce.",
      "But parasocial relationships can become problematic, Simone Schnall, a professor of experimental social psychology at the University of Cambridge, said.",
      "\"We've entered an age where many people form unhealthy and intense parasocial relationships with influencers,\" Schnall said. \"This leads to a sense that people 'know' those they form parasocial bonds with, can trust them and even to extreme forms of loyalty. Yet it's completely one sided.\"",
      "The trend is also evolving to include artificial intelligence.",
      "\"Parasocial trends take on a new dimension as many people treat AI tools like ChatGPT as 'friends,' offering positive affirmations, or as a proxy for therapy. This is an illusion of a relationship and group think, and we know young people can be susceptible for this,\" Schnall said.",

    "summary": "Miami Beach Police announced that the 22-year-old was taken into custody on multiple charges, including possessing amphetamine and marijuana, along with resisting an officer without violence.",
    "story": [
      "YouTuber and social media influencer Jack Doherty was arrested for drug possession and other charges in Miami Beach after he was found disrupting traffic to allegedly film social media content, police said.",
      "Miami Beach Police announced that the 22-year-old was taken into custody early Saturday on multiple charges, including possessing amphetamine and marijuana, along with resisting an officer without violence.",
      "\"The Miami Beach Police Department remains steadfast in its commitment to maintain public safety and order throughout the city\u2014regardless of celebrity status,\" the agency said. \"The Department will continue to take proactive enforcement action against behavior that endangers residents, visitors, or officers and will hold all individuals accountable under the law.\"",
      "Later Saturday night, Doherty posted a TikTok video showing him bonding out of jail with the caption \"I got arrested last night and now I'm free.\"",
      "\"I'm a free man, baby,\" he said in the video, while holding the property bag that held his personal items at the time of his arrest. \"Let's go.\"",
      "According to his bio on Delka Talents, his talent agency, Doherty has over 3.2 million YouTube subscribers and over 500 million YouTube views. Doherty is best known for filming \"daredevil\" stunts and pranks, and his most-watched video has over 18 million views as of March 2018, his bio said.",
      "CBS News Miami has reached out to Doherty's representatives for comment on his arrest.",
      "An influencer blocks traffic for the sake of \"content\"",
      "Around 3:12 a.m. Saturday, Miami Beach Police officers were conducting a high-visibility detail along the 700 block of Washington Avenue within the city's Entertainment District, when a group of individuals entered the roadway from the east sidewalk into the northbound lanes. A man from the group -- later identified as Doherty -- separated from them and attempted to engage officers to \"create video content, positioning himself in the middle of the roadway with passing vehicular traffic and creating a significant safety hazard,\" according to arrest documents obtained by CBS News Miami.",
      "Miami Beach Police officers began issuing multiple commands to direct Doherty to exit the roadway, but he refused. Even after his group urged him to comply, he continued refusing officers' commands.",
      "Officers continued, warning Doherty that failure to comply would result in his arrest. Still, the influencer continued to refuse commands and told them, \"Once I'm done with this bet,\" the arrest documents said. At this moment, Miami Beach Police safely apprehended Doherty in the middle of the road due to his \"deliberate refusal to follow lawful orders and continued to obstruct traffic.\"",
      "According to arrest documents, while officers searched Doherty's person, they found \"half of an orange oval-shaped pill with 3 imprinted on it, consistent with a Schedule II amphetamine, as well as a black plastic container holding three hand-rolled suspected cannabis cigarettes weighing approximately 4.0 grams combined.\"",
      "After a records check that showed no active warrants, officers took Doherty to Miami Beach Police's holding facility for booking and contacted an after-hours attorney for charging guidance.",

    "published": "Fri, 21 Nov 2025 16:23:04 -0500",
    "summary": "The new dummy, known as THOR-05F, contains female-specific proportions, according\u200b to the Transportation Department.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. Department of Transportation introduced a new female crash dummy as it seeks to step up safety for women, who face a higher injury risk in car crashes than men.",
      "The U.S. government has used a dummy model for decades that is based almost entirely on male proportions.",
      "The new dummy, known as THOR-05F, is more human-like and contains female-specific proportions, according to the Transportation Department. The new model could potentially replace the Hybrid III dummy, which has previously been utilized for crash testing.",
      "\"Advances in technology now make it possible to more accurately account for the biological differences between male and female anatomy in crash testing,\" the Department of Transportation said in a statement Thursday.",
      "Women are 73% more likely to be injured in a head-on crash, and they are 17% more likely to be killed in a car crash, than men.",
      "Transportation officials will consider using the new dummy in the government's vehicle crash test five-star ratings once a final rule is adopted, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Thursday in a news release.",
      "The department also noted that THOR-05F will be available to manufacturers to build models and to the automotive industry, which can begin testing the model in their vehicles.",
      "The road to THOR-05F",
      "The standard crash test dummy used in the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration five-star vehicle testing was developed in 1978 and was modeled after a 5-foot-9 (175-centimeter), 171-pound (78-kilogram) man.",
      "The female dummy is smaller and has a rubber jacket to represent breasts. It's routinely tested in the passenger or back seat but seldom in the driver's seat, even though the majority of licensed drivers are women.",
      "But the change is not guaranteed to happen. Some American automakers have been skeptical and a group representing auto insurers has already said it thinks the current crash test dummies are fine.",
      "The new female dummy endorsed by the department more accurately reflects differences between men and women, including the shape of the neck, collarbone, pelvis, and legs. It's outfitted with more than 150 sensors, the department said.",
      "Maria Weston Kuhn, a law student at New York University, started lobbying members of Congress to pass a law requiring the new female dummy after surviving a 2019 crash in Ireland in which her seat belt slid off her hips and ruptured her intestines. She welcomed Duffy's support but said she won't celebrate until NHTSA incorporates the new model into its testing \u2014 a step that has been delayed numerous times.",
      "\"I fear that with this announcement everybody will throw up their hands and say we've won,\" Kuhn said Friday. \"But we are far from crossing the finish line.\"",
      "Some American automakers have been skeptical, arguing the new model may exaggerate injury risks and undercut the value of some safety features such as seat belts and airbags.",
      "Despite Duffy's announcement, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, a research arm funded by auto insurers, continues to advocate for the current line of dummies used to represent women and has seen dramatic improvements in safety as a result, spokesperson Joe Young said.",
      "\"Certainly, we are going to continue to monitor the new tools and perhaps do some additional research,\" Young said. \"But for now, our researchers are content and confident that the dummies we're using are doing a good job.\"",
      "Lawmakers and transportation secretaries from the past two presidential administrations have expressed support for new crash test rules and safety requirements, but developments have been slow.",
      "U.S. Sens. Deb Fischer, a Republican from Nebraska, and Tammy Duckworth, a Democrat from Illinois, both released statements welcoming the female crash test dummy announcement.",
      "\"Any progress here is good because there's simply no good reason why women are more likely to be injured or die in car crashes,\" Duckworth said.",
      "Fischer introduced legislation, the She Drives Act, that would require the most advanced testing devices available, including a female crash test dummy. Duckworth is a co-sponsor.",
      "\"It's far past time to make these testing standards permanent, which will help save thousands of lives and make America's roads safer for all drivers,\" Fischer said.",

    "summary": "Bitcoin has erased all of its 2025 gains and is on track for its worst monthly performance since 2022. Here's what experts say about the decline.",
    "story": [
      "Bitcoin continued to slide on Friday, extending a weeks-long slump that has wiped out nearly $800 billion in value since the cryptocurrency hit its 2025 peak last month. The downturn has stripped away all of bitcoin's gains this year \u2014 and raised questions about where it might go from here.",
      "Since closing at almost $125,000 on Oct. 6, its highest price this year, bitcoin has shed about one-third of its value. On Friday, bitcoin sank below $82,000 before rebounding slightly to $83,509 before noon EDT, according to CoinGecko, a cryptocurrency data aggregator.",
      "The cryptocurrency, which is trading at its lowest level since April, is now on track for its worst monthly performance since 2022, when a spate of corporate collapses sparked turbulence in the crypto sector, Bloomberg\u00a0reported\u00a0Friday.",
      "The precipitous drop comes as Wall Street grapples with unease over whether there's a bubble in artificial technology and tech stocks, prompting a shift away from assets that are viewed as carrying more risk, analysts say. Investors are also cautious given signs of weakness in the labor market, and the outlook for the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision next month, with more economists now expecting the Fed to hold off on cutting rates.",
      "\"The future is uncertain. It almost feels like it's moving back to the question: do I even want to hold [bitcoin] in this environment?\" said Thomas Chen, the CEO of cryptocurrency company Function, in an email.",
      "Why is Bitcoin falling?",
      "Concerns about an AI bubble can translate into turbulence for cryptocurrencies because tech stocks tend to move in tandem with bitcoin, experts noted.",
      "\"When tech sneezes, it's natural to expect Bitcoin to catch a cold,\" noted Nic Puckrin, investment analyst and co-founder of The Coin Bureau, in an email.",
      "Aside from pulling back from riskier assets, some investors may be selling bitcoin to cover margin calls. Coinbase, for example, now offers \"perpetual futures,\" a product that lets traders use up to 10-to-1 leverage on bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.",
      "Leveraged positions can force investors to sell because borrowing amplifies every price move \u2014 for both gains and losses. Even a small drop in the underlying asset can lead to an outsized loss on a leveraged trade. But if an asset tumbles and the investor can't meet the margin requirements, the trading platform may automatically liquidate the position, which leads to more selling and downward pressure on its price.",
      "\"When traders borrow heavily to magnify positions, any reversal triggers liquidations that accelerate the move,\" Nigel Green, CEO of deVere Group, a financial advisory organization, said in an email.",
      "Large declines in bitcoin's price aren't unusual, and the cryptocurrency has always rebounded, experts noted.",
      "Brian Vieten, a research analyst at Siebert Financial, said in a Tuesday email that bitcoin has historically experienced around five corrections of 20-30% or more during bull markets, adding that the issues may represent \"temporary headwinds\" as some investors could view lower crypto prices as a buying opportunity.",

    "summary": "The agency's \"Golden Age of Travel\" campaign aims to restore civility to air travel. Experts say they have doubts.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. Department of Transportation on Wednesday unveiled a campaign aimed at bringing more civility to air travel, urging Americans to dress \"with respect\" and remember simple courtesies like saying \"please\" and \"thank you\" to flight attendants. Travel experts say they're skeptical it will make much difference.",
      "The new plan \u2014 called \"The Golden Age of Travel Starts With You\"\u00a0\u2014 is meant to \"jumpstart a nationwide conversation around how we can all restore courtesy and class to air travel,\" the agency said.",
      "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy is rolling out the civility campaign in part as a response to what the agency called a record rise in unruly passenger incidents, including altercations with other travelers and airline staff. The issue isn't new, with U.S. Federal Aviation Administration data showing that incidents with unruly passengers peaked in 2021, although reports remain roughly double their pre-pandemic level.",
      "The Transportation Department didn't define what it meant by \"dressing with respect.\" In a Wednesday social media post, Duffy wrote, \"Dress up to go to the airport, help a stranger out, and be in a good mood.\"",
      "Duffy said he's encouraging air travelers to ask themselves the following five questions to ensure civility:",
      "Are you helping a pregnant woman or the elderly with placing their bags in the overhead bin?Are you dressing with respect?Are you keeping control of your children and helping them through the airport?Are you saying thank you to your flight attendants?Are you saying please and thank you in general?",
      "Are you helping a pregnant woman or the elderly with placing their bags in the overhead bin?",
      "Are you dressing with respect?",
      "Are you keeping control of your children and helping them through the airport?",
      "Are you saying thank you to your flight attendants?",
      "Are you saying please and thank you in general?",
      "Can dressing better improve economy class?",
      "Travel experts are skeptical that the Transportation Department's call to dress up for the airport will result in meaningful changes. Most travelers now prize comfort over formality, especially given the typically tight seating in economy and the likelihood of delays.",
      "In response to Duffy's social media post, some users chimed in with their own ideas \u2014 from widening cramped economy seats to making security checkpoints friendlier for travelers. While some agreed that a little more civility would be welcome, others noted that comfortable clothes make flying more tolerable in such tight quarters.",
      "A few decades ago, when Americans typically dressed up to fly, the travel experience looked a whole lot different.",
      "\"Economy class was actually nice. Now, everyone is wedged together on planes,\" Chris Elliott, a travel expert and consumer advocate, told CBS News.",
      "Sarah Silbert, a strategist at the flight search engine Points Path, said the clothing guideline isn't enforceable and isn't likely to shift traveler behavior.",
      "\"It's more of a soft nudge about travel etiquette,\" she told CBS News. \"Given how cramped and stressful flying can be for most people now, it's easy to see why a message about 'dressing up' will draw pushback.\"",
      "Travelers' interpretations may also vary significantly, experts added.",
      "\"Do I imagine anyone would be able to agree on what the dress code is? No,\" Daniel Green, co-founder of Faye Travel Insurance, told CBS News. He added that he doesn't think there should be a dress code for travelers, either.",
      "\"At the end of the day, I think this is just a well-intentioned messaging campaign about behaving well in public that will likely have no practical or tangible implications for people,\" he said.",
      "Changes in air travel",
      "The rise in unruly passengers stems from several issues, including alcohol, drugs and mental health issues, as well as stress from dealing with crowded airports and problems like flight delays, according to Transport Security International, a travel publication.",
      "Scott Keyes, founder of the flight-deals site Going.com, noted that the \"golden age of travel\" was hardly golden for most Americans. Airfare was so expensive that flying was largely limited to the wealthy. Because flying is more affordable today, air travel has become a more democratized experience, he added.",
      "\"Many more people are traveling today. You see people from all walks of life getting on planes, and this campaign harkens back to a time when air travel was only for the elite,\" he told CBS News.",
      "He also objects to the notion that the \"golden age\" of flying provided a better passenger experience than today's flights.",
      "\"There are many ways in which it was an objectively worse experience. The flights took longer, they didn't have Wi-Fi, and there was cigarette smoke wafting through cabins,\" he said.",
      "Even so, he said he doubts the Transportation Department's civility push will inspire anyone to start dressing to the nines.",
      "\"If you think it's a good thing that most of society today can afford to buy tickets and travel, then you have to accept that people are going to behave how they're going to behave,\" Keyes said. \"I don't think I would want to live in a society that had dress recommendations to be on an airplane.\"",

    "story": [
      "Los Angeles \u2014 A vintage blue VW bus that became an unlikely symbol of resilience after it survived a California wildfire made its public debut this week, shiny and like-new after Volkswagen spent months restoring the damaged vehicle.",
      "The bus went viral in January when an Associated Press photographer captured it looking surprisingly unharmed by the deadly Palisades Fire, a spot of blue and white dwarfed by the charred remains of a Malibu neighborhood. Volkswagen saw the accompanying AP story and reached out to the owner, Megan Weinraub. Upon closer inspection, VW technicians discovered that while the bus had survived, it had smoke damage and blistered paint, rust and a window busted by the heat.",
      "In its restoration, the 1977 Type 2 Microbus named Azul - Spanish for the color blue - again brought people together as technicians consulted the broader community of VW enthusiasts in a shared mission to revive what was a quirky middle-aged vehicle.",
      "\"It melted and Volkswagen saved it,\" Weinraub said Thursday at the LA Auto Show, standing with the bus's previous owner, Preston Martin. \"It was a giant relief because it wasn't my first priority with everything going on.\"",
      "While Weinraub calls the microbus \"Azul,\" it became known as the \"Magic bus\" on social media, CBS News Los Angeles points out.",
      "\"I was lucky and grateful to have the opportunity for them to restore it because I wouldn't have been able to restore it myself,\" she told the station.",
      "Weintraub and Martin still can't believe the bus they wrote off as a goner is now ready to take them on another surfing adventure. The last time they saw the pre-burned Azul was two days before the Palisades Fire broke out, when they parked the bus near Weinraub's apartment after surfing.",
      "Mark J. Terrill, the AP photographer who captured the original image, was on hand when Weinraub and Martin saw the bus for the first time after its restoration in late October.",
      "Volkswagen hauled the microbus to its Oxnard facility west of Los Angeles where it houses historic VW vehicles. Vehicle technicians Farlan Robertson and Gunnar Wynarski sourced hard-to-find parts, got creative and reached out to a lot of people.",
      "\"At the bottom of it it was to try to take the vehicle that everyone else saw and do what we could to improve upon it, but not change it,\" said Robertson, \"to actually have it come out and be the revived, resurrected vehicle returned to its former glory.\"",

    "story": [
      "A Treasury Department analysis indicates that new U.S. sanctions on Russian oil producers have sent prices there tumbling, choking off a key revenue source that Russia has used to fund its war in Ukraine, the department said.",
      "One key benchmark for Russian oil prices \u2014 Urals crude \u2014 had fallen by at least 21% since a set of new sanctions were announced last month, a Treasury official said Thursday. The official also pointed to a decrease in the amount of oil departing from Russia to unknown destinations and said transaction volume has decreased.",
      "The sanctions, announced Oct. 22, target Russian oil giants Lukoil and Rosneft. They represent the first direct actions against Russia of the second Trump administration and some of the most aggressive since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022. Since the announcement, nearly a dozen major Indian and Chinese purchasers of Russian oil have stated intentions to pause their purchases of Russian oil deliveries for December, Treasury has said.",
      "A November 17 memo from the Treasury's Sanctions Economic Analysis Division assessed that the \"sanctions on Russian energy firms Lukoil and Rosneft are having their intended effect of dampening Russian revenues by lowering the price of Russian oil and therefore the country's ability to fund its war effort against Ukraine.\"",
      "The memo said that several grades of Russian oil are trading at multi-year lows, and are \"well below all other international prices.\"",
      "The memo also indicated that sanctions are \"likely to have a long-term negative impact on the quantity of Russian oil sold.\"",
      "The sanctions set a Friday, Nov. 21, deadline for companies to wind down dealings with Rosneft and Lukoil. Nearly three dozen entities are petitioning Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control for additional time to wind down operations, which would take them beyond the original deadline. That is not unusual, as companies work to comply with U.S. sanctions.",
      "Treasury has issued some extensions already for certain transactions involving Lukoil's retail service stations and contracts for the sale of the firm's international assets until Dec. 13. A separate waiver for deals pertaining to Lukoil's entities in Bulgaria was extended through April 29, according to a CBS review of the licenses.",
      "A Treasury official also said Thursday that many Chinese and Indian entities \u2014 including banks and refineries \u2014 are conscious of the sanctions and are \"risk averse, do recognize the importance of the relationships with the West, and are moving to comply.\"",
      "Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last month the sanctions on Russia's largest oil companies were driven by President Vladimir Putin's \"refusal to end this senseless war.\" Treasury said the companies have helped to \"fund the Kremlin's war machine.\"",
      "Last month on CBS News' \"Face the Nation,\" Bessent told moderator Margaret Brennan that the latest actions could cut Russia's oil revenue 20% or 30%. A Treasury official said the impacts are still being assessed, but that \"it is clear that there will be revenue impacts\" from the sanctions.",
      "The oil price plunge comes as President Trump presses Russia and Ukraine to reach a ceasefire. At various points, he has expressed frustration with the leaders of both countries.",

    "story": [
      "The holiday shopping season is creating fresh openings for scammers looking to snag consumers' payment data, according to Visa's 2025 Holiday Threats Report.",
      "Artificial intelligence is also helping criminals move faster and reach more victims, according to Visa's scam disruption team. AI tools can generate authentic-sounding text for fake websites that look legitimate but are designed to steal your information.",
      "\"Just as regular consumers are excited for shopping season, scammers are also excited, because it gives them opportunities to capitalize on these feelings, and illicitly gather payment data, or other personal information from unsuspecting victims,\" Michael Jabbara, global head of fraud services at Visa, told CBS News.",
      "Here are five of the most common types of scams to watch for this holiday season, according to Visa.",
      "Fake retail websites",
      "Websites that appear authentic but have been constructed for the sole purpose of scamming customers are proliferating, according to Visa. These sites can closely mimic popular companies, duping shoppers into handing over credit card information.",
      "Sometimes they ship shoddy goods to customers, but in other cases, they don't bother sending anything.",
      "Jabbara said it can be difficult to distinguish between legitimate and copycat sites, and that it's wise to do extra research if your gut instinct says something is awry.",
      "\"Scammers do this for a living and are very good at it. You don't want to underestimate them,\" Jabbara said. \"If a consumer has a feeling that a deal is too good to be true, or a website looks fishy, do some validation.\"",
      "That can include looking at online reviews of the site or going directly to the business's site by typing in its URL, versus clicking on a social media site. For example, open a web browser and type in Gap.com, as opposed to clicking a link in a digital ad promoting T-shirts.",
      "Package delivery scams",
      "Scam artists are sending consumers texts claiming there is a \"delivery problem\" with an online order they probably didn't place. Criminals posing as package delivery services like UPS or FedEx tell consumers they must turn over their credit card information to receive a phony delivery.",
      "This type of scam proliferates around the holidays, when consumers make more online purchases and shippers deal with higher-than-normal volumes of packages, Visa notes.",
      "Criminals may sell and trade your personal information on the dark web, or enroll you in recurring billing cycles you never signed up for. Some consumers might not catch these issues if they don't pay close attention to their credit card statements, according to Visa.",
      "\"They input your payment information into a form and monetize it on different channels,\" Jabbara said.",
      "Jabbara advises that consumers never click on links from unknown senders.",
      "Paying for seasonal work",
      "Fake job offers also crop up during the holidays, when many Americans are trying to earn extra cash to cover gift-giving and travel. Scammers take advantage of that financial pressure.",
      "Visa advises job seekers to apply only through a company's official channels and to avoid any role that requires upfront payments.",
      "\"We see 'job offers' that tell workers they have to pay a fee to apply, or for a background check,\" Jabbara said. \"That is a surefire sign of a scam.\"",
      "Consumers should also verify that any company they're applying to is legitimate, he added.",
      "Travel-related fraud",
      "Scammers are also creating fake travel sites and sending phishing emails targeting people with holiday travel plans.",
      "Make sure to make reservations through trusted travel sites, and if a deal appears to be too good to be true, it probably is. Looking at reviews can help determine if a site is legitimate, Jabbara advises.",
      "Charity scams",
      "The year-end giving season also attracts scammers who exploit people's generosity by setting up phony charities.",
      "Fraudsters may build convincing websites or approach people in person with tap-to-donate schemes, Visa said. As with other scams, it's wise to confirm a charity's legitimacy before donating.",

    "published": "Thu, 20 Nov 2025 15:10:43 -0500",
    "summary": "The government's latest jobs data could affect whether Federal Reserve officials continue their push to ease borrowing costs.",
    "story": [
      "Just a few weeks ago, a December interest rate cut was viewed as practically a done deal by many economists. Now, with fresh government data showing solid U.S.\u00a0job growth in September, many forecasters think the Federal Reserve is likely to hold off lowering borrowing costs when policy makers meet next month.",
      "The probability of a Federal Reserve rate cut now stands at 22%, down from a likelihood of 97% as of mid-October, according to economists polled by financial data company FactSet. CME Fedwatch, a tool that forecasts rate cuts based on changes in the 30-Day Fed Funds futures prices, gives slightly better odds of a reduction, at about 41%.",
      "Translation: Wall Street economists and traders alike expect the Fed to leave rates unchanged at its next two-day meeting on Dec. 9-10. That would amount to a pause in the central bank's recent move to lower lending rates, coming after two consecutive cuts in September and October.",
      "The shift in expectations for future Fed rate cuts follows a six-week blackout in federal economic data because of the\u00a0government shutdown, a hiatus that hindered the central bank's ability to assess key economic trends. Last month, Fed Chair Jerome Powell cautioned that a December rate cut wasn't a \"foregone conclusion,\" pointing to signs that the job market remains on firm ground.",
      "The Fed is more likely to lower its benchmark federal funds rate \u2014 or what banks charge each other for short-term loans \u2014 if officials conclude that the job market and broader economic growth are in danger of stalling. But Thursday's jobs data showed that employers continued to hire at a healthy clip in September.",
      "\"Given that today's numbers were not a bad as feared, in conjunction with hawkish statements from the Fed recently, it does appear that the Fed will skip a cut in December,\" Preston Caldwell, chief U.S. economist at Morningstar, said in an email.",
      "He added, \"But with the negative trend in labor markets remaining in place, we'd expect the Fed to resume cutting in their next meeting in January 2026, if they don't cut this December.\"",
      "The federal funds rate is currently sitting in a range of 3.75% to 4%.",
      "A move by the Fed to dial back rate cuts in 2026 could keep borrowing costs for homes and cars elevated. Pricier mortgages and auto loans are also reinforcing the feeling among many Americans, reflected in sentiment polls, that the cost of living remains too high.",
      "Mixed economic picture",
      "The Federal Reserve's so-called dual mandate requires monetary policymakers to keep both inflation and unemployment in check. The central bank cited the slowing labor market when it twice trimmed borrowing costs this fall.",
      "But the latest payroll gains released Thursday showed that employers hired 119,000 people in September \u2014 more than double what most economists had forecast. The nation's unemployment rate ticked up from 4.3% to 4.4%, the highest level since October of 2021. The increase in the jobless rate suggests more people are re-entering the workforce to search for a job, economists said.",
      "At the same time, inflation has edged up, climbing at an annual rate of 3% in September. That puts pressure on the Fed to keep price increases from spiraling higher, with some policymakers expressing concern over persistent inflation.",
      "The mixed economic picture is complicated by the absence of more recent official data. The Bureau of Labor Statistics said\u00a0this week that it will fold some October jobs data into its November report, which is set for release after the Fed's next meeting, on Dec. 16.",
      "\"September's payroll numbers may have surprised to the upside, but in terms of the Fed's December interest rate decision, October is what mattered,\" Ellen Zentner, chief economic strategist for Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, said in an email. \"With that data now delayed until after the FOMC meeting, the Fed's rate-cut path has more question marks.\"",
      "She added, \"Overall, the available economic data has supported a December cut, but given the Fed's cautious bent, it may choose to wait until it has more numbers in hand.\"",

      "\"This notice serves as a next step in the process in REAL ID compliance, which was signed into law more than 20 years ago and finally implemented by Secretary Noem as of May 2025,\" a TSA spokesperson told CBS News, noting that the agency would soon provide additional guidance. \"TSA is working with stakeholders and partners to ensure both security and efficiency at our checkpoints.\"",
      "Embracing biometrics",
      "The TSA is launching a biometric identity verification program at its checkpoints to screen individuals who don't have a Real ID or other suitable alternative form of identification, such as a passport.",
      "Alternative ID verification methods are \"time and resource intensive,\" the TSA said in proposing the fee.",
      "\"To address the government-incurred costs, individuals who choose to use TSA's modernized alternative identity verification program will be required to pay an $18 fee,\" the agency's proposed rule states.",
      "Verifying people's identity at the nation's airports \"is the first step in the physical screening process at a TSA security checkpoint and the last link in intelligence-based traveler prescreening, ensuring that high-risk travelers are identified. ...\" the proposal states.",
      "The TSA said that biometric verification, which it also refers to as a registered traveler program, will streamline the process of identifying passengers.",
      "Passengers will start incurring the $18 fee when the TSA announces that individuals may register for the alternative identity verification program at TSA.gov.",
      "Daniel Green, co-founder of Faye Travel Insurance, thinks the fee proposal is reasonable, given that travelers have had ample time to obtain a Real ID.",
      "\"For years, they've been saying either get a Real ID or a passport or don't travel,\" he told CBS News. \"So the idea that you can pay $18 and potentially travel anyway isn't so unreasonable.\"",
      "Check your driver's license bureau",
      "The TSA began requiring passengers to\u00a0present a Real ID\u00a0or other approved documents in May. The enhanced form of identification can either be a driver's license, learner's permit or nondriver ID card.",
      "\"The fact that TSA is floating an identity-verification fee suggests things are tightening,\" said Sarah Silbert, a strategist at flight search engine Points Path. \"If you haven't updated your ID yet, it's smart to take care of it soon, especially with peak travel season adding extra stress for everyone.\"",

    "summary": "The September jobs report, which was delayed due to the government shutdown, comes amid a slowdown in hiring across the U.S.",
    "story": [
      "Employers across the U.S. added 119,000 jobs in September, marking a pickup after previous employment data had shown a slowdown in hiring. The report marks the first official job tally since the\u00a0government shutdown ended last week, ending a six-week blackout on labor data.",
      "The numbers",
      "Economists had forecast payroll gains of 50,000 jobs in September, according to a poll by FactSet.",
      "The unemployment rate rose 4.4% in September, up from 4.3% in August and the highest level since Oct. 2021. With robust job growth in September, that suggests more people are re-entering the workforce to search for a job, economists said.",
      "The Labor Department also revised job growth down for July and August by a combined 33,000, a sign that hiring during those months was weaker than previously reported.",
      "The health care sector saw the biggest boost in jobs, with 43,000 hires in September. The federal workforce, meanwhile, lost 3,000 jobs that month.",
      "Investment advisor firm Capital Economics estimates 150,000 federal workers will drop off the government's payroll in the fourth quarter this year, mainly due to the end of the Trump administration's deferred resignation programs.",
      "The job market has been losing momentum for much of this year, with previous employment reports indicating a slowdown in hiring. At the same time, employers have been announcing layoffs in recent months, leading to the worst October for job reductions in 22 years, according to\u00a0outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas.",
      "Verizon said it would lay off 13,000 employees on Thursday. That follows major recent job cuts by\u00a0Target, Amazon, UPS\u00a0and other major companies.",
      "What it means",
      "The September employment figures suggest job growth remains firm amid concerns that the labor market was at risk of stalling.",
      "\"The September jobs report may be backward-looking, but offers reassurance that the labor market wasn't crumbling before the government shutdown,\" Nancy Vanden Houten, lead economist at Oxford Economics, said in a research note.",
      "Although job growth has weakened, \"it is not collapsing,\" added Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics.",
      "The hiring numbers will shape Federal Reserve officials' decision on whether to cut interest rates at their next meeting in December. Art Hogan, chief market strategist at investment firm B. Riley Financial, thinks the odds of a rate cut have \"diminished significantly\" given there will not be a full October employment report and the November report won't be issued until after the Fed meets in December.",
      "Ashworth expects the Fed to delay its next rate cut until January. The probability of a rate cut now stands at 22%, according to economists polled by FactSet.",
      "Delayed employment reports",
      "The September jobs report, originally slated for Oct. 3, was pushed back by the government shutdown that ended on Nov. 12. The delay means it offers a belated snapshot of the labor market just before federal funding lapsed on Oct. 1.",
      "On Tuesday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said it won't publish the full October employment report, which was originally slated for release on Nov. 7. Instead, the agency will fold select October data into the November report, which is set for release on Dec. 16.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/medicare-advantage-networks-complaints-federal-enforcement/",
    "published": "Thu, 20 Nov 2025 10:22:48 -0500",
    "summary": "Government documents show that federal regulators rarely warn plans that their networks of health providers are so skimpy they violate legal requirements.",
    "story": [
      "Along with the occasional aches and pains, growing older can bring surprise setbacks and serious diseases. Longtime relationships with doctors people trust often make even bad news more tolerable. Losing that support \u2014 especially during a health crisis \u2014 can be terrifying. That's why little-known federal requirements are supposed to protect people with privately run Medicare Advantage coverage when contract disputes lead their health care providers and insurers to part ways.",
      "But government documents obtained by KFF Health News show the agency overseeing Medicare Advantage does little to enforce long-standing rules intended to ensure about 35 million plan members can see doctors in the first place.",
      "In response to a Freedom of Information Act request covering the past decade, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services produced letters it sent to only five insurers from 2016 to 2022 after seven of their plans failed to meet provider network adequacy requirements \u2014 lapses that could, in some cases, harm patient care.",
      "Agency officials said some plans lacked enough primary care clinicians, specialists, or hospitals, according to the letters. And they warned that failure to meet the requirements could result in a freeze on marketing and enrollment, fines, or closure of the plan.",
      "CMS declined to detail why it found so few plans with network violations over the 10 years. \"The number of identified violations reflects the outcomes of targeted reviews, not a comprehensive audit of all plans in all years,\" said Catherine Howden, a CMS spokesperson.",
      "Officials in states with Advantage network violations say CMS didn't notify them, including directors of the government-funded State Health Insurance Assistance Program, which helps people navigate Medicare.",
      "\"It's hard for me to believe that only seven Medicare Advantage plans violated network rules,\" said David Lipschutz, a co-director of the Center for Medicare Advocacy, a nonprofit group. \"We often hear from folks \u2014 particularly in more rural areas \u2014 who have to travel significant distances in order to find contracted providers.\"",
      "Medicare Advantage is an increasingly popular alternative to the government-run Medicare program, which covers adults 65 and older and some people with disabilities. Of the 63 million Americans who were eligible to join Advantage plans instead of traditional Medicare, 54% did so for this year. The plans usually offer lower out-of-pocket costs and extra benefits, like coverage for vision, dental, and hearing care, but typically require their members to stick to select networks of doctors, hospitals, and other providers. Last year, the federal government paid Advantage plans an estimated $494 billion to care for patients.",
      "Traditional Medicare, by comparison, has no network and is accepted by nearly all doctors and hospitals in the nation.",
      "Conflicts between Medicare Advantage plans and the doctors, hospitals, and other providers that serve their members are common. Just this year, at least 38 hospital systems serving all or parts of 23 states have cut ties with at least 11 Advantage plans after failing to agree on payment and other issues, according to a review of news releases and press reports. Over the past three years, separations between Advantage plans and health systems have increased 66%, said FTI Consulting, which tracks reports of the disputes.",
      "After March, Medicare Advantage beneficiaries are generally locked into their plans for the year until the annual open enrollment period happening now through Dec. 7, for coverage beginning Jan. 1. But hospitals, doctors, pharmacies, and other health providers can leave plans anytime.",
      "When providers and insurers separate, Advantage members can lose access to longtime doctors or preferred hospitals in the middle of the year. In response, CMS sometimes gives Advantage customers a little-known escape hatch called a \"special enrollment period\" to change plans or enroll in traditional Medicare midyear.",
      "How CMS decides who gets an SEP is a mystery even to well-versed state insurance regulators and U.S. senators who oversee federal health programs. Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden, the senior Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, and Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) cited previous KFF Health News reporting on Medicare Advantage in an Oct. 30 letter asking CMS Administrator Mehmet Oz for an explanation.",
      "\"Despite the serious impacts of SEPs on enrollees and the market, the process of SEP determinations is opaque, leaving enrollees and state regulators in the dark,\" they wrote.",
      "\"Seniors deserve to know their Medicare plan isn't going to pull the rug out from under them halfway through the year,\" Wyden told KFF Health News.",
      "\"Help us\"",
      "Oz spoke to Medicare Advantage insurers Oct. 15 at a conference organized by the Better Medicare Alliance, a trade group, and encouraged them to help CMS police fraud in the program.",
      "\"Be our early-warning system,\" he told them. \"Tell us about problems you're witnessing. Help us figure out better ways of addressing it.\"",
      "When he finished speaking, he took a seat in the audience next to the president and chief executive of the group, Mary Beth Donahue, and smiled for photos.",
      "In six letters KFF Health News obtained, CMS officials told five insurers that their network adequacy violations could affect Advantage members' access to care. Five letters listed the number or types of medical specialists or facilities missing from the networks. In three cases, CMS noted that plans could request exceptions to the rules but didn't. In one letter, CMS requested the plan allow members to receive out-of-network care at no additional cost. Four letters required specific steps to address deficiencies, including submitting evidence that more clinicians were added to networks.",
      "Three letters required a \"corrective action plan,\" set deadlines for fixing problems, and warned that failure to comply with the rules could result in enrollment and marketing suspensions, fines, or forced plan closure. The other three letters were a \"notice of non-compliance,\" which urged insurers to comply with legal requirements.",
      "Although CMS regards the letters as the first step in its enforcement process, the agency did not provide information about whether these violations were resolved or if they resulted in penalties.",
      "The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, a group created by Congress to monitor the program, said in a June 2024 report that \"CMS has the authority to impose intermediate sanctions or civil monetary penalties for noncompliance with network adequacy standards, but it has never done so.\"",
      "One of the network adequacy violation letters went to Vitality Health Plan of California in November 2020. That came after five hospitals and 13 nursing homes in one county and four hospitals in another all left the insurer's network, according to the letter from Timothy Roe, then-director of CMS' Division of Compliance, Surveillance, and Marketing. Two months before sending its letter, CMS granted Vitality plan members a special enrollment period.",
      "Beneficiaries welcomed the opportunity, said Marcelo Espiritu, program manager of the Santa Clara County office of California's Health Insurance Counseling & Advocacy Program. But Espiritu didn't know at the time that Vitality's depleted network violated CMS requirements, which Roe said put \"the health of Vitality's beneficiaries at risk.\"",
      "\"By not having enough network providers, beneficiaries may not be able to receive necessary services timely, or at all,\" Roe wrote.",
      "That's information patients need to know, Espiritu said.",
      "\"People would not be able to receive promised benefits and there would be delays in care and a lot of frustration in trying to find a new plan,\" he said. \"We would certainly warn people about the plan and remove it from our materials.\"",
      "Representatives from Commonwealth Care Alliance, which acquired Vitality in 2022, did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Network minimums",
      "Federal law requires Medicare Advantage plans to include in their networks a minimum of 29 types of health care providers and 14 kinds of facilities that members can access within certain distances and travel times. The rules, which vary depending on a county's population and density, also limit how long patients should wait for appointments. The agency checks compliance every three years, or more often if it receives complaints.",
      "Networks can vary widely even within a county because the provider minimums apply to the insurer, not each plan it sells, according to a report from KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News. The company can offer the same network to members of multiple plans in one or more counties or create a separate network for each plan.",
      "In Arizona's Maricopa County, KFF researchers found, UnitedHealthcare offered 12 plans with 12 different networks in 2022. Depending on the plan, the company's customers had access to 37% to 61% of the physicians in the area available to traditional Medicare enrollees.",
      "In early 2016, CMS allowed 900 people in an Advantage plan in Illinois run by Harmony, then a WellCare subsidiary, to leave after the Christie Clinic, a large medical practice, left its provider network. The WellCare plan continued to operate without the clinic. But in June 2016, CMS told the plan in one of the letters KFF Health News obtained that losing the Christie Clinic meant the remaining provider network violated federal requirements.",
      "It was \"a significant network change with substantial enrollee impact,\" the letter said.",
      "Claudia Lennhoff, executive director at Champaign County Health Care Consumers, a government-funded Medicare counseling service that helped the WellCare members, said her group didn't know about the letter at the time.",
      "\"Not disclosing such information is a violation of trust,\" Lennhoff said. \"It could lead someone to make a decision that will be harmful to them, or that they will deeply regret.\"",
      "Centene Corp. bought WellCare in 2020, and representatives for the St. Louis-based company declined to comment on events that occurred before the acquisition.",
      "Two violation letters KFF Health News obtained from CMS went to Provider Partners Health Plan of Ohio in 2019 and 2022. The Ohio Department of Insurance was unaware of the violations, spokesperson Todd Walker said. He said CMS also did not notify the Ohio Senior Health Insurance Information Program, the state's free counseling service.",
      "Rick Grindrod, CEO and president of Provider Partners Health Plans, which is based in Maryland, said that after CMS reviewed its 2019 network, \"we proactively reduced our service area and deferred enrollment in the plan until 2021.\"",
      "But Grindrod said the plan enrolled only a small number of members in one county in 2021 and decided to withdraw from the Ohio market entirely at the end of that year.",
      "After Provider Partners withdrew from Ohio, CMS sent it another letter in March 2022 saying its network in 2021 had gaps in four counties for four types of providers and facilities. CMS asked the plan to comply with network rules by adding more providers.",
      "\"We believe CMS' network adequacy standards are generally clear and appropriate for ensuring beneficiary access,\" Grindrod said. \"While the standards are not difficult to understand, as a provider-sponsored plan with a small footprint, we sometimes face challenges securing contracts with large systems that prioritize larger Medicare Advantage plans.\"",
      "In 2021, CMS also sent a violation letter to North Carolina's Liberty Advantage. CMS didn't tell the state's free counseling service, the Seniors' Health Insurance Information Program, about the letter, said its director, Melinda Munden.",
      "Liberty representatives did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "CMS sent a letter in 2016 to CareSource about network deficiencies in some of its Medicare Advantage plans sold in Kentucky and Indiana. The agency asked the company to fix the problems, including by reimbursing any members billed for services from doctors who were not in the plans' networks.",
      "\"In response to the 2016 violations, we promptly implemented a Corrective Action Plan, which included a thorough review of our provider network to ensure adequacy standards were met,\" said Vicki McDonald, a CareSource spokesperson. \"CMS approved our plan, and no further action was required.\"",
      "KFF Health News is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues and is one of the core operating programs at KFF \u2014 the independent source for health policy research, polling, and journalism.",

    "story": [
      "Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers said Wednesday he is resigning from the board of OpenAI and leaving a number of other roles after last week's release of emails between him and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "\"In line with my announcement to step away from my public commitments, I have also decided to resign from the board of OpenAI,\" Summers said in a statement.",
      "\"I am grateful for the opportunity to have served, excited about the potential of the company and look forward to following their progress,\" he said.",
      "On Wednesday night, Summers went on leave from teaching at Harvard University, with his spokesperson, Steven Goldberg, saying in a statement: \"Mr. Summers has decided it's in the best interest of the Center for him to go on leave from his role as Director as Harvard undertakes its review. His co-teachers will complete the remaining three class sessions of the courses he has been teaching with them this semester, and he is not scheduled to teach next semester.\" A Harvard spokesperson said Summers \"communicated his decision\" to the university.",
      "Summers said earlier this week that he will be stepping back from \"public commitments\" after dozens of messages between him and Epstein were included in a trove of documents from Epstein's estate that was released by the House Oversight Committee last week.",
      "His other departures include positions with Bloomberg News, The New York Times, the Brookings Institution's Hamilton Project, the Center for American Progress, the Peterson Institute for International Economics and the Yale Budget Lab.",
      "Summers joined the OpenAI board in 2023.",
      "The emails showed Summers and Epstein communicated regularly during the last years of Epstein's life, even as the accused sex trafficker's public infamy and notoriety grew. Many of the messages were from the late 2010s, well after Epstein pleaded guilty to prostitution charges in Florida, but before he was charged with sex trafficking in federal court and taken into custody in July 2019.",
      "The exchanges between Summers and Epstein include one in which they appeared to banter about a woman Summers knew in London, with Epstein seeming to offer him advice.",
      "There is no evidence of illegal conduct on the part of Summers.",
      "Summers, who served as Treasury Secretary in the Clinton administration, was a key economic adviser in the Obama administration. The former president of Harvard University, Summers was teaching two classes at the school.",
      "In a statement on Wednesday, Harvard said it is \"conducting a review of information concerning individuals at Harvard included in the newly released Jeffrey Epstein documents to evaluate what actions may be warranted.\"",
      "On Tuesday, both the House and Senate voted overwhelmingly to require the Justice Department to release its files related to Epstein, sending the bill to President Trump's desk. Mr. Trump called on the Justice Department last week to investigate Epstein's relationships with Summers, former President Bill Clinton and other high-profile Democrats.",
      "Epstein was facing sex trafficking charges when he died by suicide at New York City jail in 2019. He pleaded guilty in 2007 to two prostitution counts in a Florida court as part of a controversial deal to avoid federal charges.",

    "story": [
      "Nvidia's third-quarter financial results on Wednesday surpassed analyst expectations, signaling that demand for its artificial intelligence chips remains robust amid investor concerns about an AI bubble.",
      "The chipmaker reported earnings of $31.9 billion on record revenue of $57 billion for the third quarter. Revenue for the period surged 22% from the previous quarter and 62% from a year ago. Its earnings per share were $1.30. The Santa Clara, Calif., company had been expected to earn $1.26 per share on revenue of $54.9 billion for the quarter, according to analysts polled by FactSet.",

      "\"Compute demand keeps accelerating and compounding across training and inference \u2014 each growing exponentially. We've entered the virtuous cycle of AI. The AI ecosystem is scaling fast \u2014 with more new foundation model makers, more AI startups, across more industries, and in more countries. AI is going everywhere, doing everything, all at once,\" Huang added.",
      "Nvidia forecast revenue of $65 billion for the fourth quarter. The company's shares, which have jumped 39% this year, rose nearly 4% in after-hours trading to $193.80.",
      "\"This is a huge print and guidance from Nvidia that should reignite the bullish tech trade into year-end,\" Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said in a note to investors, adding that he thinks \"fears of an AI Bubble are way overstated.",
      "In October, the chipmaker became the first publicly listed company worth $5 trillion, with its shares buoyed by Wall Street expectations of surging demand.",
      "Rational exuberance?",
      "In recent weeks, some investors have expressed caution about the hype surrounding AI and whether the soaring market value of companies linked to the technology is warranted. Despite the promise of AI, most companies that are implementing AI have yet to see a measurable increase in productivity or profits, according to Wall Street analysts.",
      "\"Nvidia earnings are such an important event both because of the weighting that the stock has in the major equity indices and because it is ground zero for the entire Artificial Intelligence build out,\" Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Northlight Asset Management, said in an email.",
      "The rapid construction of data centers across the U.S. has boosted demand for Nvidia's chips. Data center investment, which includes spending on AI research and development, has become the largest contributor to U.S. growth this year, according to S&P Global.",
      "The S&P 500's 15% gain this year has been driven largely by big tech companies with AI investments. The combined market capitalization of the so-called \"Magnificent 7\" \u2014 Google-owner Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla \u2014 accounts for 37% of the index's total value,\u00a0according\u00a0to Morningstar.",
      "\"Market psychology has been negative this month as investors worried that the artificial intelligence infrastructure build out was a bubble, and in a few years we may look back at this time and point to signs that it was, Zaccarelli said. \"But in the meantime, the largest technology companies in the world are extremely profitable, and they are reinvesting billions of dollars into data centers, servers and chips, and the spending is real.\"",
      "China hurdle",
      "Nvidia reported robust demand for its chips despite being blocked from the vital Chinese market because of U.S. export restrictions as the two nations compete on AI.",
      "In an earnings call with analysts, Nvidia Chief Financial Officer Collete Kress on Wednesday said the company is \"disappointed\" it can't ship products to China.",
      "\"To establish a sustainable leadership and position in AI computing, America must win the support of every developer and be the platform of choice for every commercial business, including those in China,\" she said, adding that Nvidia will continue to push for access to the Chinese market.",

    "summary": "Although inflation has eased, many Americans say they still feel squeezed financially. Here are five areas where households are feeling the pinch.",
    "story": [
      "Although inflation across the U.S. is far cooler than in the post-pandemic years, millions of Americans say they still feel the pinch of rising prices, struggle to pay the bills and express concern about their financial prospects.",
      "Price increases are nowhere near the level reached in June of 2022, when the Consumer Price Index hit a 40-year high of 9.1%. Yet many people feel squeezed by the cost of simple daily necessities, including the ability to afford healthy food, and by long-term increases in the cost of essentials such as housing and health care.",
      "This affordability crisis is rooted in a combination of both longstanding economic issues dating back decades and more recent developments. For instance, housing costs have surged partly due to a lack of available homes, a result of cutbacks in construction following the Great Recession, while more recently steep new U.S. tariffs have fueled inflation.",
      "Inflation and the economy now rank as Americans' top national concerns, according to an October CBS News poll.",
      "\"Everything is going up in price very quickly,\" said Jeremy Tolbert, a 47-year-old web developer in Lawrence, Kansas.",
      "With his family's monthly health care premiums set to rise 18% to $2,600 next year, he's planning to cut back in other areas. \"Our food budget is going to go down \u2014 we're not talking about eating beans and rice, but going from a comfortable middle-class lifestyle to eating how we did when we first got out of college,\" Tolbert said.",
      "Here are five key categories of spending that many Americans are struggling to afford.",
      "Food",
      "Almost half of Americans say it's harder to afford groceries today than it was a year ago, according to a September survey\u00a0by Axios and the Harris Poll. Only 19% said food prices are cheaper than a year earlier, with roughly a third seeing no change.",
      "Growth in food prices has eased considerably, although it is still rising, with the latest CPI report showing grocery prices rose 2.7% in September on an annual basis, a sharp contrast to the\u00a011.4% increase in 2022. Overall, however, food prices as of September were more than 18% higher than in January of 2022, according to the CBS News price tracker.",
      "Shoppers don't assess food costs the same way economists do. They focus on their day-to-day spending \u2014 which keeps climbing \u2014 and compare their out-of-pocket spending today with what they paid several years ago,\u00a0according to research from the University of Florida.",
      "In other words, people's experience of inflation and how they measure it in their daily lives may not mesh with official economic measures that paint a more optimistic picture.",
      "Meanwhile, other recent signals underscore the difficulty many Americans have simply putting food on the table. Roughly 14% of U.S. households reported food insecurity on average between January and October, up from 12.5% in 2024, according to data from Purdue University's Center for Food Demand Analysis and Sustainability.",
      "In New York City, for example, 40% of local families can't afford their weekly food costs, according to new data from charitable organization Robin Hood and Columbia University.",
      "Housing",
      "Almost three-quarters of Americans said housing has grown more unaffordable in their communities in recent years, according to an October poll from YouGov and the University of Florida Center for Public Interest Communications.",
      "The data backs that up, with a homebuyer today needing to earn $121,400 a year to afford a typical home, meaning that their monthly costs would remain below 30% of their annual income, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. The average American earns about $84,000 a year, highlighting the considerable gap between incomes and home prices.",
      "Several forces have pushed housing costs higher. The rate of home construction plunged after the 2008-09 financial crisis, leading to a shortfall in housing inventory. Meeting today's demand for housing would require building as many as 4 million additional homes beyond current construction levels, Goldman Sachs estimates.",
      "The low interest rates that prevailed during the pandemic, when homebuyers could secure mortgages below 3%, sparked a buying rush that sent prices soaring. Even with a slight cooling this year, homes are selling for about 25% above their 2019 levels, while mortgage rates have more than doubled since their pandemic lows.",
      "Child care",
      "The challenge of affording child care is another pain point for many families. In 2024, the average annual cost of care for one child around the U.S. topped $13,000, up 30% from 2020, according to Child Care Aware America, a nonprofit group.",
      "Families with a single child can end up paying between roughly 9% and 16% of their median income on full-time day care,\u00a0according\u00a0to the Department of Labor. That means parents are often spending more on child care than they do on other expenses, such as groceries or even rent, data shows.",
      "Gina Monroe, a 42-year-old mom based in Massapequa, New York, said the financial strain of child care has made her and her husband think twice about having another child. She started sending her 2-year-old son to day care in September and pays around $450 a week.",
      "\"Nothing's getting any cheaper,\" she told CBS News.",
      "Child care costs have surged partly because there aren't enough early education workers to support the number of children who need care, according to experts. The industry also pays meager wages, adding to the challenges of recruiting new workers, said Keri Rodrigues, co-founder and president of the National Parents Union, an advocacy group for American families.",
      "Health care",
      "Americans are also getting socked by rising health care costs, ranging from higher insurance premiums to out-of-pocket expenses such as deductibles and co-pays. The increase in medical costs stems largely from the emergence of more expensive treatments, such as the popular GLP-1 weight loss drugs, as well as an aging population that requires more care, according to consulting firm Mercer.",
      "The cost of health care was at the center of the longest government shutdown in U.S. history, with Democratic lawmakers pushing to extend a tax credit to defray the cost of health insurance for 22 million Americans who buy coverage through the Affordable Care Act.",
      "The shutdown ended without an agreement to extend the subsidies, which means low- and middle-income households that previously qualified for the tax credits would likely see their ACA premiums rise from an average of $888 in 2025 to $1,904 in 2026, according to a KFF\u00a0analysis.",
      "Employees who get their insurance through employer-based plans are likely to see their health care costs rise as much as 7% for their 2026 plans, according to Mercer.",
      "Electricity and utility costs",
      "Americans now pay an average of $265 per month in utility costs, up 12% since last year, according to a new\u00a0report from The Century Foundation, a progressive think tank, and advocacy group Protect Borrowers.",
      "The surge stems from a succession of rate hikes across the U.S, as electricity demand outstrips supply. In 2025 alone, more than 124 million Americans are expected to see some sort of rate increase in their energy bill, a recent PowerLines\u00a0report\u00a0found.",
      "Even if you do your best to shut off every light, some fixed costs are unavoidable, such as the so-called \"delivery charge,\" or what a utility charges to send electricity from a power plant to a home, said Rodrigues of the National Parents Union.",
      "The energy burden falls most acutely on low- and middle-income families, who spend between 6% and 10% of their income on energy, or three to five times that of higher-income households, according to the National Energy Assistance Directors Association.",

A\u00a0survey\u00a0of roughly 3,000 people released this week by Brigham Young University and Deseret News found that 7 in 10 respondents said that raising children is unaffordable, a sentiment that has surged over the last decade.",
      "One parent facing a child care crunch is New York City resident Gina Monroe, who started sending her son to day care in September.",
      "\"Having to have a household with both parents working and a grandmother that was getting too old to take care of a two-year-old, you don't have a choice,\" she told CBS News.",
      "The 42-year-old said she pays $450 a week to send her son to a day care center on nearby Long Island. That's less than her monthly mortgage payment of $3,200, but still represents one of her family's biggest expenses, she said.",
      "The financial strain of everyday life in the U.S., especially following the fierce inflation that erupted during the pandemic, has emerged as a political flashpoint this year.",
      "For example, the Trump administration has in recent weeks floated several ideas aimed at easing costs for Americans, including proposals for a\u00a0$2,000 tariff rebate check\u00a0and a 50-year mortgage. The administration also last week\u00a0announced tariff exemptions on some popular grocery store staples, including bananas, beef and coffee, as Americans continue to battle elevated food costs.",
      "Incoming New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani also made issues around affordability the centerpiece of his campaign, urging city officials to establish free child care for children ages 6 weeks to 5 years old.",
      "Why are child care costs soaring?",
      "Child care expenses have been rising steadily for years, and show little sign of relenting. From 2020 to 2024, costs rose nearly 30%, data from the nonprofit group Child Care Aware shows.",
      "The main driver for that surge, according to experts: a shortage of early education workers and available places at daycare centers, relative to the enormous demand for such services from families around the U.S.",
      "To that end, Matt Schulz, chief consumer finance analyst at LendingTree, pointed to what he described as \"child care deserts\" in some regions, where parents face a dearth of acceptable options. These are most common in low-income rural areas, which have difficulty recruiting and retaining a qualified workforce, a 2023 government report found.",
      "Where high-quality child care is in short supply, the owners can charge a premium given they face little competition, Schulz noted.",
      "Many households also don't have the benefit of having nearby family members who can help with child care responsibilities, Keri Rodrigues, co-founder and president of the National Parents Union, an advocacy group for American families, told CBS News.",
      "\"What we actually need are policies that recognize the modern realities of working families and what the true cost of raising children in America actually is right now,\" she said.",

    "story": [
      "Roblox, the popular online gaming platform that hosts millions of user-created games, said Tuesday it is strengthening protections for minors.",
      "Roblox said it will soon require players to use AI-powered facial age-estimation technology to help verify their age. The system, combined with ID-based age verification and confirmed parental consent, is intended to \"provide a more accurate measure of a user's age than simply relying on what someone types in when they create an account,\" the company said in a statement.",
      "Roblox CEO David Baszucki described the guardrails in an interview with CBS Mornings' Tony Dokoupil as \"what we believe will become the gold standard for safety and civility on the internet.\"",
      "Doukopil questioned Baszucki about potential parental concerns about the AI verification, given that it involves minors sending pictures of themselves into the app to verify the user's age. Some parents \"are already skeptical about their children's safety on Roblox,\" Doukopil said.",
      "Roblox is \"not storing these images,\" Baszucki said. The photos \"are deleted soon after [Roblox] process[es] them.\"",
      "The image is used to determine the age of the Roblox user, and \"then to assign them to the right people that might connect with,\" he added.",
      "The company will start enforcing the age-check requirement in select global markets, including Australia, New Zealand and the Netherlands, before expanding the system to other countries in early January. Roblox is also launching a dedicated online safety center to help families understand and set up the platform's parental controls.",
      "The company's enhanced protections arrive as dozens of families, along with attorneys general in Kentucky and Louisiana, are suing Roblox, Discord and other technology companies for allegedly failing to deter sexual predators from approaching children on their platforms. Florida is also investigating Roblox, with Attorney General James Uthmeier accusing the platform of failing to protect minors.",
      "Roblox in September outlined plans to expand age checks for all users who want to access communication features on the gaming platform. The guardrails are meant to limit communication between adults and minors unless they already know each other in the real world.",

    "summary": "The stock market has stumbled on concerns that the surge in artificial intelligence stocks could echo the dot-com bubble.",
    "story": [
      "Artificial intelligence has fired the stock market to record highs this year, with companies eager to tout their AI prowess and investor darlings like AI chipmaker Nvidia soaring\u00a0on expectations of runaway growth.",
      "But a tinge of fear is starting to shadow that exuberance. Stocks have slumped this week as investors fret that the AI boom could go bust, with the S&P 500 on Nov. 18 dipping 0.8%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average losing 1.1% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite sinking 1.2%.",
      "The startling run-up in AI-related stocks is prompting comparisons to the dot-com era of the late 1990s, when many internet companies saw their stock prices skyrocket despite suffering vast financial losses. When that bubble burst in the early 2000s, it took down former high-fliers like Pets.com, torched investor portfolios and triggered a recession.",
      "Bubbles occur when stocks surge on inflated growth expectations that ultimately prove to be disconnected from a company's underlying fundamentals, a painful reality check that typically ends with overhyped shares falling back to Earth.",
      "Beyond the stock market, economists are also questioning whether AI will turn out to be as transformative for businesses as proponents of the technology insist. Advocates say AI will spur a productivity boom, leading to stronger corporate growth and profitability.",
      "\"The stock market is a giant bet on AI right now. It's really 10 companies that are driving all of it,\" Rebecca Homkes, an economist and lecturer at the London Business School, told CBS News.",
      "In other words, this year's 15% gain in the S&P 500 \u00a0is largely due to a handful of tech giants that are heavily investing in AI. The combined market capitalization of the so-called \"Magnificent 7\" \u2014 Google-owner Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla \u2014 today represents a record 37% of the S&P 500's total value, according to Morningstar.",

      "\"No one wants to be caught dancing after the music has stopped,\" Aaron Schaechterle, portfolio manager at Janus Henderson, said in an email.",
      "Still, today's stock valuations aren't nearly as stretched as they were in the late 1990s, Goldman Sachs analysts note. The investment bank's analysis of the Magnificent 7's median price-to-earnings ratio \u2014 a measure of a company's share price compared to its profits \u2014 found it is \"roughly half\" that of the largest seven companies in the late 1990s.",
      "\"So it is true that valuations are high but, in our view, generally not at levels that are as high as are typically seen at the height of a financial bubble,\" they noted.",

      "\"This is different in the sense that these companies \u2014 the companies that are so highly valued \u2014 actually have earnings and stuff like that,\" Powell said. \"So you go back to the '90s and the dot-com [period]... these were ideas rather than companies.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 18 Nov 2025 15:05:56 -0500",

    "story": [
      "Meta has prevailed over an existential challenge to its business that could have forced the tech giant to spin off Instagram and WhatsApp after a judge ruled that the company does not hold a monopoly in social networking.",
      "U.S. District Judge James Boasberg issued his ruling Tuesday after the historic antitrust trial wrapped up in late May. His decision follows two separate rulings that branded Google an illegal monopoly in both search and online advertising, dealing yet another regulatory blow to the tech industry that for years enjoyed nearly unbridled growth.",
      "The Federal Trade Commission \"continues to insist that Meta competes with the same old rivals it has for the last decade, that the company holds a monopoly among that small set, and that it maintained that monopoly through anticompetitive acquisitions,\" Boasberg wrote in his ruling. \"Whether or not Meta enjoyed monopoly power in the past, though, the agency must show that it continues to hold such power now. The Court's verdict today determines that the FTC has not done so.\"",
      "Meta Platforms Inc., the FTC had argued, has maintained a monopoly by pursuing CEO Mark Zuckerberg's strategy, \"expressed in 2008: 'It is better to buy than compete.' True to that maxim, Facebook has systematically tracked potential rivals and acquired companies that it viewed as serious competitive threats.\"",
      "During his April testimony, Zuckerberg pushed back against the FTC's contention that Facebook bought Instagram to neutralize a threat. In his line of questioning, FTC attorney Daniel Matheson repeatedly brought up emails \u2014 many of them more than a decade old \u2014 written by Zuckerberg and his associates before and after the acquisition of Instagram.",
      "While acknowledging the documents, Zuckerberg has often sought to downplay the contents, saying he wrote them in the early stages of considering the acquisition and that what he wrote at the time didn't capture the full scope of his interest in the company. But the case was not about the acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp more than a decade ago, which the FTC approved at the time, but about whether Meta holds a monopoly now. The FTC, Boasberg wrote in the ruling, could only win if it proved \"current or imminent legal violation.\"",
      "The FTC's complaint said Facebook also enacted policies designed to make it difficult for smaller rivals to enter the market and \"neutralize perceived competitive threats,\" just as the world shifted its attention to mobile devices from desktop computers.",
      "Meta said Tuesday's decision \"recognizes that Meta faces fierce competition.\"",
      "\"Our products are beneficial for people and businesses and exemplify American innovation and economic growth. We look forward to continuing to partner with the Administration and to invest in America,\" the Menlo Park, California-based company said in a statement.",
      "The social media landscape has changed so much since the FTC filed its lawsuit in 2020, Boasberg wrote, that each time the court examined Meta's apps and competition, they changed. Two opinions to dismiss the case \u2014 filed in 2021 and 2022 \u2014 didn't even mention popular social video platform TikTok. Today, it \"holds center stage as Meta's fiercest rival.\"",
      "Quoting the Greek philosopher Heraclitus, \"that no man can ever step into the same river twice,\" Boasberg said the same is true for the online world of social media as well.",
      "\"The landscape that existed only five years ago when the Federal Trade Commission brought this antitrust suit has changed markedly. While it once might have made sense to partition apps into separate markets of social networking and social media, that wall has since broken down,\" he wrote.",
      "Emarketer analyst Minda Smiley said Meta's win \"is not necessarily surprising considering the lengths it's gone to in recent years to keep up with TikTok.\"",
      "\"But from a regulatory standpoint, Meta is far from out of the woods: next year, major social networks will face landmark trials in the US regarding children's mental health,\" she added. \"Still, today's win is surely a boost for the company as it battles criticism and questions over how its massive AI spending will ultimately benefit Meta in the long run.\"",
      "Facebook bought Instagram \u2014 then a scrappy photo-sharing app with no ads and a small cult following \u2014 in 2012. The $1 billion cash and stock purchase price was eye-popping at the time, though the deal's value fell to $750 million after Facebook's stock price dipped following its initial public offering in May 2012.",
      "Instagram was the first company Facebook bought and kept running as a separate app. Up until then, Facebook was known for smaller \"acqui-hires\" \u2014 a type of popular Silicon Valley deal in which a company purchases a startup as a way to hire its talented workers, then shuts the acquired company down. Two years later, it did it again with the messaging app WhatsApp, which it purchased for $22 billion.",
      "WhatsApp and Instagram helped Facebook move its business from desktop computers to mobile devices, and to remain popular with younger generations as rivals like Snapchat (which it also tried, but failed, to buy) and TikTok emerged. However, the FTC has a narrow definition of Meta's competitive market, excluding companies like TikTok, YouTube and Apple's messaging service from being considered rivals to Instagram and WhatsApp.",

      "Data from the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland shows that 39,006 Americans last month in 21 states received a Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, or WARN, notice informing them of an upcoming layoff. U.S. labor law requires employers to provide these written warnings 60 days ahead of plant closings or mass layoffs.",

      "Despite the lack of official government data, some other measures point to a cooling U.S. labor market. For example, outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas recently said that layoffs last month\u00a0soared to their highest October level in 22 years, while\u00a0ADP data\u00a0released Tuesday shows U.S. companies shed an average of 2,500 jobs per week in the four weeks ending Nov. 1.",

      "The S&P 500, which set a record high in late October, fell 78 points, or 1.2%, to 6,594 roughly an hour into Tuesday's session. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.2% and 1.6%, respectively.",
      "The S&P 500 remains up more than 12% this year, the Dow has added 8% and the Nasdaq has risen more than 15%.",
      "AI pioneer Nvidia was again the heaviest weight on the market. The chipmaker's drop of 3.2% brought its loss for the month to nearly 11%, putting it in \"correction\" territory, or when a stock falls at least 10% from its previous high. The company is scheduled to report is third-quarter financial results on Wednesday.",
      "\"Stocks are extending their losses so far on [Tuesday] as sentiment stays downbeat and investors continue to dial back on tech exposure,\" market analyst Adam Crisafulli of Vital Knowledge said in a research note.",
      "What Nvidia does matters disproportionately to investors because it's the most influential stock on Wall Street. It can almost single-handedly steer the direction of the S&P 500 on some days because of its immense size, after fervent demand for its AI chips helped it briefly top $5 trillion in total value. The S&P 500 sits at the heart of many investors' 401(k) accounts.",
      "\"The boost AI has given to the U.S. stock market since the launch of ChatGPT has been so strong that the S&P 500 would currently be closer to 5,000 without it,\" John Higgins, chief markets economist with Capital Economics, said in a note to investors. \"It's therefore hardly surprising that investors are preoccupied with whether the gains racked up by titans in the sectors at the heart of this transformative technology can be sustained.\"",
      "Nvidia's and the U.S. stock market's struggles are a sharp turnaround from months of relentless rallying since April, when Wall Street sold off after President Donald Trump shocked the world with stiff tariffs.",
      "That rally, though, was so strong that critics said it may have carried stock prices too high, too fast and left the market at risk of a sharp drop. They pointed in particular to stocks swept up in the mania around AI.",
      "Despite Wall Street's recent stumble, many big investors expect stocks to recover, according to the latest monthly survey of global fund managers by Bank of America Global Research. But when asked what the No. 1 risk for the market is, one with a lower probability of happening but a high chance of damage, 45% pointed to an AI bubble. That beat out trouble in the bond market, inflation and trade wars.",
      "The highest net percentage of investors in 20 years is also saying companies are \"overinvesting,\" according to the survey. The worry is that all the investment pouring into AI chips and data centers worldwide may not produce the kind of revolution that proponents have been predicting, or at least not as profitable a one.",
      "Other high-flying areas of the market with their own evangelists have also been struggling lately. Bitcoin's price briefly fell below $90,000 during the morning, down from nearly $125,000 last month.",
      "Elsewhere on Wall Street, Cloudflare fell 3.1% after an issue at the internet infrastructure provider caused global outages for ChatGPT and other services.",

Those are Bedminster in New Jersey, or\u00a0Mar-a-Lago\u00a0in Palm Beach, Florida.

      "\"So we'll fix that up, and Jack will be the architect and he'll design it,\" the president said.",

    "summary": "President Trump and NYC Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani have hurled attacks at each other for months \u2014 but on Friday, they seemed to hit it off.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's meeting with incoming New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani on Friday was not expected to be warm and congenial. The two politicians agree on very little, and they've lobbed attacks at each other for months, with Mr. Trump calling Mamdani a \"100% communist lunatic\" and Mamdani describing himself as \"Donald Trump's worst nightmare.\"",
      "But instead, the two men seemed to hit it off. In a surreal 30-minute Oval Office appearance, Mr. Trump lavished Mamdani with praise, calling him \"very rational\" and predicting he could do \"really great\" things for their shared hometown. Mamdani, standing beside Mr. Trump, steered clear of criticizing the president \u2014 sometimes with an assist from Mr. Trump himself \u2014 and pledged to work with the administration on cost-of-living issues.",
      "Here are the highlights:",
      "\"I think you're going to have, hopefully, a really great mayor\"",
      "Mr. Trump was unceasingly optimistic about Mamdani, saying that during a private one-on-one meeting before their public appearance, the two men agreed on more than he expected. He pointed to Mamdani's focus on affordability and stated desire to build more housing.",
      "\"I think you're going to have, hopefully, a really great mayor,\" the president said. \"The better he does, the happier I am.\"",
      "\"I think he is going to surprise some conservative people\"",
      "Days before the election, Mr. Trump had encouraged people to vote for Mamdani's chief rival, Democratic governor-turned-independent Andrew Cuomo.",
      "But on Friday, the president said: \"I feel very confident that he can do a very good job\u2026I think he is going to surprise some conservative people, actually. And some very liberal people, he won't surprise them because they already like him.\"",
      "\"I expect to be helping him, not hurting him\"",
      "For months, Mr. Trump has flirted with cutting off federal financial support to New York City if Mamdani wins, suggesting it would be a waste.",
      "After their meeting, Mr. Trump didn't fully back away from the threat, but said it was unlikely.",
      "\"I expect to be helping him, not hurting him,\" Mr. Trump said. \"A big help. Because I want New York City to be great. Look, I love New York City, it's where I come from, I spent a lot of years there. ... I think this mayor could do some things that are going to be really great.\"",
      "Does Mamdani think Trump is a fascist? \"That's okay, you can just say yes,\" president says",
      "At various points, reporters pressed Mamdani on whether he stands by his prior attacks on Mr. Trump \u2014\u00a0 and the president helped him dodge.",
      "One reporter asked Mamdani if he believes Mr. Trump is a \"fascist.\" As the incoming mayor began to answer, the president laughed and cut him off.",
      "\"That's okay, you can just say yes,\" Mr. Trump interjected, patting Mamdani on the arm. \"That's easier. It's easier than explaining it. I don't mind.\"",
      "Earlier in the meeting, Mamdani was asked if he still believes Mr. Trump is a \"despot.\"",
      "Said Mr. Trump: \"I've been called much worse than a despot, so it's not that insulting. I think he'll change his mind after we get to working together.\"",
      "\"He's got views that [are] a little out there, but who knows\"",
      "The president also deflected when asked about his claim that Mamdani is a \"communist.\"",
      "Said Mr. Trump: \"He's got views that [are] a little out there, but who knows. I mean, we're going to see what works.\"",
      "\"He's going to change, also. We all change. I changed a lot,\" the president continued.",
      "Mamdani describes himself as a democratic socialist, not a communist. He stood by that label on Friday.",
      "Trump: Mamdani isn't a \"jihadist,\" he's \"very rational\"",
      "Earlier this month, GOP Rep. Elise Stefanik \u2014 a candidate for governor of New York \u2014 called Mamdani an \"Antisemite Jihadist Communist.\"",
      "Asked if he agrees that Mamdani is a \"jihadist,\" Mr. Trump said no.",
      "\"I met with a man who's a very rational person. I met with a man who really wants to see New York be great again,\" the president continued.",
      "\"I would feel very, very comfortable being in New York\"",
      "Mr. Trump \u2014 a Queens native whose primary residence is now in Florida \u2014 said he'd feel comfortable moving back to New York City under Mamdani's leadership.",
      "\"I would feel very, very comfortable being in New York, and I think much more so after the meeting,\" he said.",
      "The pair's views on crime and immigration enforcement came up repeatedly on Friday. The president expressed confidence in Mamdani: He said he believes the mayor-elect cares about public safety, and praised Mamdani for choosing to retain\u00a0New York City Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch.",
      "\"That's a good sign,\" the president said.",
      "Trump: \"A lot of my voters actually voted for him, and I'm okay with that\"",
      "Mamdani pointed out that Mr. Trump's vote share in New York City jumped last year, which he attributed mostly to worries about affordability. And the mayor-elect noted that he swept up some Trump voters, which the president appreciated.",
      "\"He said a lot of my voters actually voted for him, and I'm okay with that,\" the president said.",
      "\"I think he's different than your typical guy\"",
      "Mr. Trump, for his part, praised Mamdani for the former state legislator's unexpected come-from-behind victory in the Democratic primary.",
      "\"He came out of nowhere,\" said the president. \"I watched. I said, 'Who is this guy?'\"",
      "Left unmentioned were the parallels with Mr. Trump's own insurgent victory in the 2016 Republican primary.",
      "Asked why Mamdani has drawn so much enthusiasm, Mr. Trump said: \"I think he's different than your typical guy, runs, wins, becomes mayor maybe and nothing exciting.\"",
      "At another point, Mr. Trump called being mayor a \"big deal,\" saying, \"one of the things I would've loved to be someday is the mayor of New York City.\"",

    "summary": "Members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the Congressional Ukraine Caucus criticized a reported peace plan backed by the Trump administration.",
    "story": [
      "Some U.S. lawmakers criticized the Trump administration's proposed 28-point peace plan designed to end the Ukraine-Russia war on Saturday, saying the framework appears to favor Moscow.",
      "The deal would require Ukraine to give up its eastern Donbas region and Crimea, and swear off NATO membership, according to a draft shared publicly by a Ukrainian opposition politician and confirmed by a White House official. The plan includes feedback from Russian and Ukrainian officials, and diplomatic conversations about it are ongoing. President Trump gave Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy a suggested deadline of Thanksgiving Day to respond to the plan.",
      "Members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, including Democrat Jeanne Shaheen and Republican Thom Tillis, said in a statement on Saturday that they had \"significant concerns over the details of the reported peace plan.\"",
      "\"For over 10 years, Russia has illegally occupied Ukrainian territory and for almost 4 years, Ukraine has admirably defended itself against Russia's attempts to fully occupy Ukraine. No one wants a just and lasting peace more than the Ukrainian people,\" the committee members said in a statement. \"However, we will not achieve that lasting peace by offering Putin concession after concession and fatally degrading Ukraine's ability to defend itself.\"",
      "\"History teaches us that Putin only understands strength and will not abide by any agreement unless it is backed by force,\" the statement continued. \"We must consult closely with our Ukrainian and NATO partners on the path forward. We should put real pressure on Russia to come to the negotiating table. And we must make clear to the Kremlin\u2014and would-be aggressors in Beijing\u2014that America will stand unwaveringly in defense of freedom.\"",
      "Co-chairs of the bipartisan Congressional Ukraine Caucus also criticized the reported peace plan, saying it \"appears to favor the interest of the aggressor,\" Russian President Vladimir Putin, \"over the sovereignty and security of a democratic Ukraine.\"",
      "\"This framework does not offer a genuine path to lasting peace, but instead, demands the surrender and capitulation of Ukraine to Russian aggression,\" the caucus said in a statement shared on Saturday.",
      "The Trump administration's backing of the plan \"raises serious concerns,\" the caucus said.",
      "\"The international community must remain firm in supporting Ukraine, upholding the principles of territorial integrity and self-determination, and rejecting any plan that rewards an aggressor,\" the caucus said. \"Lasting peace comes not from conceding to aggression, but from the strength and unity of free nations that refuse to bow to it.\"",
      "European governments were not involved in drafting the proposal, according to European officials contacted by CBS News. Western leaders gathered at the G20 summit in South Africa said Saturday that the plan needs \"additional work.\"",
      "The plan emerged following recent meetings between the U.S. and officials from both Russia and Ukraine. Mr. Trump's envoy, Steve Witkoff, met with a key adviser to Russian President Vladimir Putin, Kirill Dmitriev, on Oct. 24 in Miami, to develop the plan, CBS News reported Thursday.",
      "Ukrainian envoys are set to meet with a U.S. delegation \u2014 including Secretary of the Army Dan Driscoll, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Witkoff \u2014 in Geneva, Switzerland, to discuss the proposal. Nine Ukrainian officials, including Zelenskyy's chief of staff, are set to take part in the talks, the Associated Press reported.",
      "Ukraine is commemorating its \"great famine\" on Saturday. The famine, imposed by Soviet leader Josef Stalin in the early 1930s, led to millions of deaths from starvation. In a video address, Zelenskyy addressed the country's ongoing fight.",
      "\"We defended, defend and will always defend Ukraine,\" Zelenskyy said. \"Because only here is our home. And in our home, Russia will definitely not be the master.\"",

      "Her last day will be Jan. 5, 2026, Greene said.",
      "In a statement, the hard-right congresswoman expressed frustration with her party and with the change of pace in Congress, writing that GOP leadership had refused to work on addressing health care costs, and bills that she drafted on immigration and other issues had sat \"collecting dust.\" She said the \"legislature has been mostly sidelined.\"",
      "She also pointed to her dramatic break with Mr. Trump. The president pulled his support from Greene last week, calling her \"wacky\" and a \"traitor\" after she criticized Republicans' handling of several issues. She has claimed that Mr. Trump was set off by her push to disclose records related to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, which the president previously opposed before endorsing and later signing a bill to release the records this week.",
      "\"Standing up for American women who were raped at 14, trafficked and used by rich powerful men, should not result in me being called a traitor and threatened by the President of the United States, whom I fought for,\" Greene wrote, saying her \"self worth is not defined by a man, but instead by God.\"",
      "On Mr. Trump's threat to back a primary challenger in her deep-red district, Greene said: \"I have too much self respect and dignity, love my family way too much, and do not want my sweet district to have to endure a hurtful and hateful primary against me by the President we all fought for, only to fight and win my election while Republicans will lose the midterms.\"",
      "\"It's all so absurd and completely unserious,\" she said. \"I refuse to be a 'battered wife' hoping it all goes away and gets better.\"",
      "Mr. Trump reacted to the news of Greene's resignation on Saturday, saying it was because of \"PLUMMETING Poll Numbers and not wanting to face a Primary Challenger with a strong Trump Endorsement (where she would have no chance of winning!)\"",
      "\"For some reason, primarily that I refused to return her never ending barrage of phone calls, Marjorie went BAD,\" Mr. Trump\u00a0wrote on Truth Social. \"Nevertheless, I will always appreciate Marjorie, and thank her for her service to our Country!",
      "In recent days, Trump's political operation has been receiving inquiries from potential Republican contenders to challenge Greene, a GOP source familiar with the situation told CBS News.",
      "In a\u00a0statement posted to X, Georgia GOP Chairman Josh McKoon called Greene a \"tireless fighter.\"",
      "\"While her decision to step down from Congress effective January 5 comes as a surprise amid recent challenges, her legacy as a bold voice for the grassroots will endure,\" he said.",
      "If Greene's resignation leaves her seat vacant, it could tighten the GOP's already razor-thin margin in the House until it's filled with a special election. Under Georgia state law, the governor must issue a writ of special election within 10 days of a House vacancy, and the election is required to be held 30 days after that, according to the\u00a0National Conference of State Legislatures.",
      "Greene's political status has been upended over the last month and a half. She has broken with a president she defended for years and clashed with her party's top congressional leaders, drawing plaudits from Democratic lawmakers who once voted to take away her committee assignments due to conspiratorial comments.",
      "It began during the government shutdown, which was driven in part by Democrats' push to extend a set of expiring health insurance tax credits in exchange for their votes to fund federal agencies. Republican leadership had argued the government should reopen before negotiating on health care.",
      "Greene publicly lashed out at her party, accusing leadership of failing to come up with a plan to prevent the massive health insurance premium increases that many families could face next year if the tax credits aren't extended. She also criticized Speaker Mike Johnson for keeping the House out of session for the duration of the shutdown.",
      "Asked by CBS News if he found any surprise GOP allies during the shutdown fight, the top House Democrat, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, answered: \"Three words \u2014 Marjorie Taylor Greene.\"",
      "Greene has also criticized the Trump administration for focusing on foreign policy rather than affordability issues at home.",
      "And her stance on the Epstein files had conflicted with Mr. Trump's. Greene and three other House Republicans joined with Democrats to force a vote on a bill ordering the release of government documents on Epstein, elevating an issue that animates many Trump allies, but one the president has long cast as a distraction by Democrats and \"stupid\" Republicans.",
      "Greene called Mr. Trump's position on the issue \"a huge miscalculation\" in an interview last week with \"CBS Mornings,\" arguing that the president has nothing to hide. Mr. Trump eventually came out in favor of the bill, which passed the House and Senate nearly unanimously this week and was signed into law on Wednesday.",
      "In a Truth Social post last week, the president said Greene \"has gone Far Left,\" and wrote that \"all I see 'Wacky' Marjorie do is COMPLAIN, COMPLAIN, COMPLAIN!\" He argued that she was upset because he discouraged her from running in next year's closely contested Georgia Senate race.",
      "Greene, meanwhile, has cast her break with the GOP and the president as a product of her commitment to the \"America First\" agenda widely associated with Mr. Trump.",
      "\"If I am cast aside by MAGA Inc and replaced by Neocons, Big Pharma, Big Tech, Military Industrial War Complex, foreign leaders, and the elite donor class that can't even relate to real Americans, then many common Americans have been cast aside and replaced as well,\" she wrote in Friday's statement.",

    "story": [
      "A page of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's website was changed Thursday to include a false claim about autism and vaccines. Multiple CDC officials familiar with the situation said the change was made by political appointees inside the Department of Health and Human Services without input from relevant agency staffers.",
      "The page about vaccines and autism formerly said that \"no links have been found between any vaccine ingredients and Autism spectrum disorder.\" The website has now been changed to say, \"'Vaccines do not cause autism' is not an evidence-based claim\" \u2014 a statement the Autism Science Foundation calls \"misinformation\" that \"actually contradicts the best available science.\" The CDC page also falsely claims that studies supporting a link between vaccines and autism have \"been ignored by health authorities.\"",
      "Previously, changes have only occurred in consultation with subject matter experts at the agency's National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities and its National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. The CDC sources told CBS News political appointees at HHS devised the change and instructed an employee inside the office of acting CDC Director Jim O'Neil to make it.",
      "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime vaccine critic, later said in an\u00a0interview with The New York Times\u00a0that\u00a0he personally ordered the change.",
      "Autism is a developmental disability caused by differences in the brain. It presents with a wide range of symptoms that can include delays in language, learning, and social or emotional skills. The National Institutes of Health has committed hundreds of millions of dollars a year to studying the condition and trying to understand how and why it develops.",
      "The debunked theory that the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine causes autism has its roots in a 1998 study that was\u00a0found to be fraudulent\u00a0and has been retracted. Since then, \"independent researchers across seven countries have conducted more than 40 high-quality studies involving over 5.6 million people,\" said American Academy of Pediatrics president Susan Kressly in a statement decrying the website change.",
      "\"We are at a very dangerous moment for the health of America's children,\" said Dr. Sean O'Leary, chair of the AAP's Committee on Infectious Diseases, in a news briefing on Thursday.",
      "Research has found no evidence of increased rates of autism among those who are vaccinated compared to those who are not. Vaccines also undergo intensive safety testing. Research shows that genetics play a role in autism diagnoses. The NIH says some possible risk factors for autism include prenatal exposure to pesticides or air pollution, extreme prematurity or low birth weight, certain maternal health conditions, or parents conceiving at an older age.",
      "\"There is overwhelming evidence that vaccines do not cause autism,\" said Dr. Mandy Cohen, a former CDC director. \"This change to CDC language undermines the agency's scientific integrity, damaging its credibility on vaccines and other health recommendations. Most concerning, it risks endangering children by driving down vaccination rates and leaving kids vulnerable to preventable diseases like measles and whooping cough.\"",
      "In a statement, HHS communications director Andrew Nixon said, \"This is a common-sense update that brings CDC's website in line with our commitment to transparency and gold standard science.",
      "\"As the updated page explains, the claim that 'vaccines do not cause autism' is not supported by comprehensive evidence, as studies to date have not definitively ruled out potential associations. Some research suggesting possible biologic mechanisms has been ignored or dismissed by public health agencies, and HHS is committed to finding a definitive answer,\" Nixon said.",
      "Leading autism advocacy groups dispute that.",
      "The Autism Science Foundation\u00a0said in a statement\u00a0it was \"appalled\" by the change to the CDC's website, and highlighted the decades of research into the topic. Alison Singer, the co-founder and president of the ASF, said that while researchers \"can't do a scientific study to show that something does not cause something else,\" there are a \"mountain of studies that we have exonerating vaccines as a cause of autism.\"",
      "\"I think the question of whether vaccines causes autism is one that science can answer, and science has answered it,\" Singer said in Thursday's news briefing.",
      "A subhead saying that \"Vaccines do not cause autism\" remains on the CDC website with an asterisk next to it. The bottom of the page explains that the header remains in place because of an agreement with Louisiana Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy, a physician who is the chair of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee and backed Kennedy during his confirmation hearings. Cassidy said Sunday on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" that he supported Kennedy in part because of \"serious commitments\" from the Trump administration, but did not specify what those were.",
      "\"I'm a doctor who has seen people die from vaccine-preventable diseases,\" Cassidy wrote on social media on Thursday afternoon. \"What parents need to hear right now is vaccines for measles, polio, hepatitis B and other childhood diseases are safe and effective and will not cause autism. Any statement to the contrary is wrong, irresponsible, and actively makes Americans sicker.\"",
      "Cassidy highlighted recent outbreaks of whooping cough and measles. He also called for more research into \"the real causes of autism,\" and criticized\u00a0HHS funding\u00a0cuts.",
      "\"Redirecting attention to factors we definitely know DO NOT cause autism denies families the answers they deserve,\" Cassidy wrote.",
      "Other health agency pages with information about autism and vaccines had not been changed as of early Thursday afternoon.",
      "Kennedy has previously pushed the\u00a0discredited claim\u00a0that routine\u00a0childhood shots\u00a0cause autism. President Trump has also falsely suggested vaccines could be to blame for autism rates. Both expressed concern about rising rates of\u00a0autism diagnoses, which appear to be driven by a variety of factors including\u00a0increased awareness\u00a0and changes in how the condition is diagnosed.",
      "O'Leary said he feared the website changes would \"scare parents and further stigmatize\" people with autism.",
      "\"We have been dealing with these falsehoods for many years. They are not new. We have been promoting the science, and we're going to continue to do that, as are the other professional societies,\" he said. \"The problem is now it's coming from, these falsehoods are coming for our federal government.\"",
      "Experts have previously raised concerns about Kennedy reviving debunked theories about the cause of autism. In April, Kennedy announced the CDC would conduct a \"massive testing and research effort\" to find out what causes the disorder, and hired David Geier, a man who repeatedly claimed a link between vaccines and autism, to lead the effort. Kennedy said the work would be completed by September, though other health officials later pushed the timeline.",
      "Dr. Fiona Havers, an infectious disease physician and former CDC official, said that the website change showed scientists \"who in the past carefully vetted scientific information have been pushed aside.\"",
      "The \"CDC should be a data-driven agency based on science and not ideology, but when you take the scientists out of the process you get rhetoric that can harm families,\" said former CDC chief science and medical officer Dr. Debra Houry, who lresigned from the agency earlier this year.",

    "story": [
      "As New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani wrapped up his high-stakes meeting with President Trump\u00a0on Friday, the president said\u00a0the two had a great conversation\u00a0centered on the future of New York City.",
      "The two leaders spent half an hour answering questions from reporters in the Oval Office and highlighting some surprising areas of agreement.",
      "Here are the top four takeaways from the meeting.",
      "The meeting was surprisingly cordial",
      "Mr. Trump and Mamdani have spent months criticizing each other. For two people who appeared, going into the meeting, to be at such loggerheads, the conviviality the two displayed, cracking jokes and offering friendly pats with one another, was surprising.",
      "They joked about past names they've called one another. At one point, Mr. Trump responded when Mamdani was asked about having called the president a \"despot\" and \"fascist.\"",
      "\"I've been called much worse than a despot,\" Mr. Trump said. \"I think he'll change his mind once he gets to know me.\"",
      "During the meeting, Mr. Trump clapped Mamdani on the shoulder in a friendly gesture. At one point, Mr. Trump told reporters Mamdani could end up being the best mayor New York has ever seen.",
      "\"I just want to congratulate [him], I think you're going to have, hopefully, a really great mayor, and the better he does, the happier I am,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "The two pledged to work together",
      "Mamdani and Mr. Trump, who both have roots in Queens, said repeatedly they look forward to working together.",
      "\"I expect to be helping him, not hurting him,\" Mr. Trump said. \"A big help, because I want New York City to be great.\"",
      "The two appeared to bury the hatchet, abandoning the name-calling and divisive rhetoric.",
      "Mamdani seemed to relish his first test of diplomacy on the national stage, smiling and laughing as the two spoke about common ground.",
      "\"When I spoke to New Yorkers who had voted for the president last November on Hillside Avenue and Fordham Road, I heard, again and again, two major reasons. One, was that they wanted an end to forever wars. They wanted an end to taxpayer dollars we had funding violations of human rights, and they wanted to address the cost of living crisis. And I appreciated the chance to discuss both of those things,\" Mamdani said.",
      "\"He said a lot of my voters actually voted for him, and I'm OK with that,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Mr. Trump has previously threatened to pull federal funding if Mamdani won. He said Friday he and Mamdani are aligned on many issues, like keeping New York City safe.",
      "\"So, we're going to work together. We're going to make sure that if there are horrible people, that we want to get them out,\" Mr. Trump said. \"He wants to have a safe New York. Ultimately, a safe New York is going to be a great New York.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said he'd feel comfortable living in New York under a Mamdani administration.",
      "Mamdani got good advice",
      "Before the meeting, Mamdani spoke by phone with Gov. Kathy Hochul, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.",
      "Based on the outcome of the meeting, Mamdani got some good advice.",
      "\"I think that [Mamdani] went there knowing that he had to make a friend of Donald Trump for this reason: he can't get his agenda passed if he has troops marching down Fifth Avenue, or if he has to deal with more ICE agents,\" CBS News New York's political reporter Marcia Kramer said. \"He can't do his budget if he's going to have a huge chunk in it caused by a loss of federal funds. So he knew he had to make him his friend. And I think he did that, and I think that the advice probably that made the most sense to him came from Gov. Hochul. Because the governor had tried repeatedly to get along with the president, and I think she gave him some tips on how to do it.\"",
      "Kramer added that both Mr. Trump and Mamdani \"had a lot riding on this meeting.\"",
      "\"[President Trump] doesn't need a fight with the mayor of New York City, who has the media spotlight, not only in New York City, but the international media spotlight. This is not something President Trump wants,\" Kramer said. \"And besides, let's remember this. This is his hometown. He may be living in Florida. This is his hometown. He has a lot of real estate interests here. And if Mr. Mamdani does not succeed as mayor, it's going to hurt the president in his pocketbook.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said he wanted to be mayor himself",
      "A surprising moment was when Mr. Trump admitted that being mayor of New York is a \"big deal.\"",
      "\"I always said, one of the things I would've loved to be someday, is the mayor of New York City, \" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Kramer pointed out that the president is term-limited, but he could run for mayor in New York City at the end of his term.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Kennedy Center president Ric Grenell and Democratic Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island are clashing over the center's spending and operations records, after Trump allies were appointed to key roles at the Kennedy Center earlier this year, and President Trump was elected chairman of the board.",
      "In a letter to Grenell, Whitehouse said that under Grenell's stewardship, \"The Center is being looted to the tune of millions of dollars in foregone revenue, cancelled programming, unpaid use of its facilities, and wasteful spending on luxury restaurants and hotels.\" He called it \"an unprecedented pattern of self-dealing, favoritism, and waste.\"",
      "At one point, Whitehouse alleged that the Kennedy Center had let FIFA use the space for free, waiving its rental fee. On Friday, the center told the\u00a0Associated Press that it would actually receive $7.4 million in connection with the FIFA event.",
      "Grenell posted a long letter on X that responded to Whitehouse's accusations, point by point: \".@SenWhitehouse just stepped in it,\" Grenell wrote. \"He attacked the Kennedy Center with outrageous claims. So we responded with the facts.\"",
      "Grenell said when he arrived at the Kennedy Center, it was \"paying a bloated staff with our future debt reserves account,\" but \"today, and for the first time in decades, we have a balanced budget at the Kennedy Center.\"",
      "Grenell also denied the center has \"cancelled shows,\" but instead said that he has \"installed a break-even policy for programming\" and rentals. Grenell said that if ticket sales won't cover a program, it won't be confirmed unless the cost shortfall is covered by a sponsor or donor.",
      "Whitehouse, citing records his committee staff obtained about the center, accused the former acting director of national intelligence of using the center as a \"playground for the president of the United States and his allies\" and requested a slew of records from Grenell regarding the Kennedy Center's financial management.",
      "Whitehouse is the top Democrat on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, which has oversight responsibility for the Kennedy Center and authorizes its federal funding. Since Democrats are in the minority in the Senate, Whitehouse is only able to request information from Grenell. Only Republicans have subpoena power. It remains to be seen whether Grenell will provide any more information to Whitehouse, beyond his social media post.",
      "He asked for material on the Kennedy Center's financial management and ethics, a description of the process for selecting contractors and consultants, reimbursement policies, and information about audit protocols.",
      "Rental fee for FIFA?",
      "Whitehouse, in his letter, accused the Kennedy Center of offering FIFA \"free and exclusive use of the Kennedy Center.\"",
      "The Washington Post previously reported the center in August had waived a rental fee in the range of $5 million for FIFA, which will be using the Kennedy Center from Nov. 24 through Dec. 12 to host its 2026 World Cup draw. The Post noted that it wouldn't be the first time that a venue waived a rental fee for the draw, but it would be unusual for the Kennedy Center, since it usually has a crowded schedule at that time of year.",
      "Grenell said that FIFA \"has given us several million dollars, in addition to paying all of the expenses for this event in lieu of a rental fee.\"",
      "On Friday, the Kennedy Center told the Associated Press that it would be paid $7.4 million to host the FIFA draw, including a $2.4 million donation from the World Cup organizer and another $5 million in sponsorship opportunities.",
      "Contracts offered \"for your personal friends?\"",
      "Whitehouse also accused Grenell of offering \"contracts for your personal friends,\" and asked him for information about expenditures or contracts that have benefited people personally associated with Mr. Trump or with Kennedy Center leadership. He also asked Grenell to provide a justification for each contract.",
      "Grenell mentioned three people in his response, though he did not specifically say that he was responding to this question: Jeff Halperin, who was hired for multimedia work and whose work Grenell praised; a fundraiser named Lisa Dale, credited by Grenell with raising over $117 million; and an editor, researcher and writer who was a colleague of Grenell's when he was the ambassador to Germany in Mr. Trump's first administration. Grenell did not name the former colleague, but he said that the cost of his work curating an exhibit was completely covered by a donor.",
      "$10,000 spent on food and beverage for personal use?",
      "Whitehouse also accused Grenell of spending more than $10,000 over several months on \"private lunches, dinners and alcohol purchases unrelated to fundraising or development purposes,\" including on \"champagne service.\"",
      "Grenell said that all of the food and beverage costs Whitehouse cited were \"for donor-based events.\" He said fundraising expenses last year were much higher \u2014 $9.3 million.",
      "$27,000 for Watergate Hotel stays for new hires, associates?",
      "Whitehouse also said Grenell charged the center over $27,000 between April and July for \"new hires and your associates\" at the Watergate Hotel.",
      "Grenell, replied that it's \"customary\" for new employees to stay at the Watergate Hotel, which is next door to the Kennedy Center, and he countered that Watergate Hotel expenses for 2024 were much higher, totaling $878,000.",
      "The Kennedy Center receives government funding in addition to private funding. Federal funding goes to operations, security, maintenance and capital repairs. It received over $40 million in federal funds last year.",
      "The Trump administration became involved in the center's leadership earlier this year, and multiple Trump allies, including Grenell, were appointed to its board by Mr. Trump.",

    "summary": "Texas asked the Supreme Court on Friday to halt a court order that threw out the state's redrawn House maps in time for next month's candidate filing deadline \u2014 arguing the new maps were driven by politics, not race.",
    "story": [
      "The Supreme Court on Friday temporarily halted\u00a0a lower court order\u00a0that threw out Texas' redrawn congressional maps in time for next month's candidate filing deadline \u2014 as the state and its legal opponents square off on whether the maps were driven by politics or race.",
      "Lawyers for Texas had asked the court earlier Friday to issue a stay and effectively let Texas return \u2014 at least for now \u2014 to the maps it passed over the summer, which redrew five Democratic House seats to make them more GOP-friendly.",
      "Justice Samuel Alito granted the state's request for an administrative stay, which means the lower court ruling is now on hold until the Supreme Court takes further action.",
      "Texas is asking the high court to stay the lower court ruling on a longer-term basis by Dec. 1, noting that\u00a0the deadline\u00a0for candidates to file for next year's primary elections is Dec. 8. He directed the plaintiffs who sued Texas to file their response by Monday afternoon.",
      "The state's redistricting push set of a\u00a0nationwide effort to redraw House maps ahead of next year's midterms, with California shifting five congressional districts to the left, and Missouri and North Carolina each shifting a seat to the right. President Trump has pushed other GOP-led states to take similar steps.",
      "But earlier this week, a panel of federal judges blocked Texas from using its new maps in a 2-1 ruling. The court's opinion, penned by Trump-appointed U.S. District Judge Jeffrey Brown, sided with plaintiffs who argued the map was an unconstitutional racial gerrymander.",
      "The lower court pointed to a majority-White Democratic district that it said should have changed more if the process was driven purely by politics, not race.\u00a0It also argued that some state officials, like Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, seemed to move in response to a letter by a top Justice Department official warning them to redraw four existing districts that the federal government viewed as illegal \"coalition\" districts, where non-Hispanic White voters are in the minority, but no racial group has a majority.",
      "In Friday's request to the Supreme Court, the state of Texas pushed back on these arguments, asserting that the redistricting process was entirely partisan and wasn't motivated by race.",
      "\"From the start, everyone recognized that the purpose of Texas's redistricting effort was Republican political advantage,\" the state wrote, quoting several elected Democrats who criticized the new maps on political grounds.",
      "Texas said the lower court ruling \"erroneously rests on speculation and inferences of bad faith.\" And it said the state GOP's chief mapmaker worked with data on partisanship rather than race.",
      "In some cases, the state of Texas cited a dissent from the lower court ruling written by Judge Jerry Smith. The Reagan appointee drew headlines earlier this week for his fiery opinion, which used the phrase \"I dissent\" 16 times, called Brown an \"unskilled magician,\" said the majority opinion would deserve an \"F\" on a law school exam and accused the other judges of improperly leaving him out of the process.",
      "The State of Texas also argued the lower court ruling could cause \"chaos\" since it was issued during the candidate filing period for next year's races.",

    "story": [
      "Abortion is again illegal in North Dakota after the state's Supreme Court on Friday couldn't muster the required majority to uphold a judge's ruling that struck down the state's ban last year.",
      "The 2023 law makes it a felony crime for anyone to perform an abortion, though it specifically protects patients from prosecution. Doctors could be prosecuted and penalized by as much as five years in prison and a $10,000 fine.",
      "Three justices agreed that the ban is unconstitutionally vague under the state constitution. The other two justices said the law is not unconstitutional.",
      "The state constitution requires at least four of the five justices to agree for a law to be found unconstitutional, a high bar. Not enough members of the court joined together to affirm the lower court ruling.",
      "In his opinion, Justice Jerod Tufte said the natural rights guaranteed by the state constitution in 1889 do not extend to abortion rights. He also said the law \"provides adequate and fair warning to those attempting to comply.\"",
      "North Dakota Republican Attorney Drew Wrigley welcomed the ruling, saying, \"The Supreme Court has upheld this important pro-life legislation, enacted by the people's Legislature. The Attorney General's office has the solemn responsibility of defending the laws of North Dakota, and today those laws have been upheld.\"",
      "Republican state Sen. Janne Myrdal, who introduced the 2023 legislation that became the law banning abortion, said she is \"thrilled and grateful that two justices that are highly respected saw the truth of the matter, that this is fully constitutional for the mother and for the unborn child and thereafter for that sake.\"",
      "Attorneys for the challengers did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The ruling means access to abortion in North Dakota will be outlawed. Even after a judge had earlier struck down the ban last year, the only scenarios for a patient to obtain an abortion in North Dakota had been for life- or health-preserving reasons in a hospital.",
      "The only abortion provider relocated in 2022 from Fargo to nearby Moorhead, Minnesota.",
      "Justice Daniel Crothers, one of the three judges to vote against the ban, wrote that the district court decision wasn't wrong.",
      "\"The vagueness in the law relates to when an abortion can be performed to preserve the life and health of the mother,\" Crothers wrote. \"After striking this invalid provision, the remaining portions of the law would be inoperable.\"",
      "North Dakota's newly confirmed ban prohibits the performance of an abortion as a felony crime. The only exceptions are for rape or incest in the first six weeks \u2014 before many women know they are pregnant \u2014 and to prevent the mother's death or a \"serious health risk\" to her.",
      "North Dakota joins 12 other states enforcing bans on abortion at all stages of pregnancy. Another four bar it at or around six weeks gestational age.",
      "Judge Bruce Romanick had struck down the ban the state Legislature passed in 2023, less than a year after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and opened the door to the state-level bans, largely turning the abortion battle to state courts and legislatures.",
      "The Red River Women's Clinic \u2014 the formerly sole abortion clinic in North Dakota \u2014 and several physicians challenged the law. The state appealed the 2024 ruling that overturned the ban.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/coast-guard-guidance-nooses-swastikas-hate-symbols/",
    "published": "Fri, 21 Nov 2025 18:25:53 -0500",
    "summary": "A Coast Guard personnel directive updated language identifying symbols of racial or religious hatred, setting off a political firestorm this week.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. Coast Guard is scrambling to clarify proposed internal policy changes that appeared to loosen how the service branch handles the conduct within its ranks involving hate symbols including nooses, swastikas, and other extremist symbols \u2014 touching off a political firestorm inside the nation's smallest military branch after the Space Force.",
      "The controversy centers on a little-noticed personnel directive signed on Nov. 13 by Rear Admiral Charles Fosse, the assistant commandant for personnel, following a report by the Washington Post. The document, titled \"Harassing Behavior Prevention, Response and Accountability,\" contained a provision that proposed replacing longstanding language that explicitly identified swastikas, nooses, Confederate iconography and other symbols of racial or religious hatred as \"incidents of hatred and prejudice.\"",
      "Instead, the Coast Guard's new policy recast those same images as \"potentially divisive,\" a subtle but consequential shift that alarmed lawmakers and civil rights groups when it was first reported this week.",
      "What did the original policy actually change?",
      "The internal guidance that ignited the controversy introduced a few changes. The Coast Guard eliminated the term \"hate incident.\" Instead, conduct previously handled under that category was referred to as harassment \u2014 and only when a specific victim could be identified.",
      "The guidance also raised the threshold for disciplinary action by specifying that public displays of extremist symbols would constitute misconduct only if they could be shown to harm \"good order and discipline, unit cohesion, command climate, morale or mission effectiveness.\"",
      "Further, the policy also allowed symbols \"widely identified with oppression or hatred\" to be displayed in private or non-public settings, including military housing. The policy removed gender identity from the list of protected characteristics altogether, aligning the Coast Guard with Mr. Trump's January executive order barring transgender service.",
      "It also required that harassment be \"severe or pervasive\" and judged by a \"reasonable person.\" And it went out of its way to note that hazing \u2014 even when it involves physical force \u2014 can serve \"a proper military or other governmental purpose,\" a framing that echoes Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's push to cultivate a tougher \"warrior ethos.\"",
      "What was the response?",
      "For years, Coast Guard policy has drawn a bright line on extremist symbols, stating unequivocally that items like nooses and swastikas \"have no place in the Coast Guard.\" The discovery that the service intended to downgrade them to \"potentially divisive\" immediately raised alarms on Capitol Hill.",
      "Democratic Rep. Lauren Underwood of Illinois said she met with the Coast Guard's acting commandant, Adm. Kevin Lunday, to express her concerns and was reassured that the policy would be clarified.",
      "\"He came by the office and assured us that there is an across-the-board prohibition on hate symbols, including swastikas and nooses,\" Underwood remarked in a video statement.",
      "Democratic Rep. Rick Larsen of Washington said in a statement, Thursday, that \"lynching is a federal hate crime. The world defeated the Nazis in 1945. The debate on these symbols is over.\" He added, \"Coast Guard: be better.\"",
      "By removing the \"hate incident\" designation, the Coast Guard appeared to create a narrower pathway for removing racist or extremist imagery from operational facilities, barracks and other training environments. Its new timeline for reporting \u2014 requiring victims to come forward within 45 days \u2014 also raised eyebrows over concerns it might deter reporting and make enforcement harder.",
      "In January, President Trump abruptly removed Adm. Linda Fagan as commandant just a day after taking office, placing Coast Guard leadership under scrutiny.",
      "What is the Coast Guard saying now?",
      "In response to the uproar, Lunday issued a forceful statement just hours after the policy became public, asserting that \"any display, use or promotion of symbols like nooses and swastikas will be thoroughly investigated and severely punished.\"",
      "Later that night, the service released an additional memo declaring that \"divisive or hate symbols and flags are prohibited\" at Coast Guard workplaces \u2014 an even firmer posture. The Coast Guard insisted the new memo was not a reversal but rather a clarification meant to counter \"misinformation\" and reaffirm the service's longstanding stance against extremist imagery.",
      "Still, leadership has not explained why earlier guidance explicitly permitted private displays or eliminated the \"hate incident\" language altogether.",
      "How do harassment cases work under the new framework?",
      "Even with the late clarifications, the underlying mechanics of the directive remain changed in significant ways. Because the term \"hate incident\" has been retired, displays of extremist symbols are not automatically categorized as harassment, and commanders will have to determine whether a specific victim exists and whether the conduct meets the now higher bar of being \"severe or pervasive.\"",
      "Investigations and punishment will use a \"preponderance of the evidence\" standard \u2014 higher than before \u2014 and leaders evaluating an incident must consider how a hypothetical \"reasonable person\" would interpret any alleged misconduct.",
      "The directive does reinforce that any public displays of the Confederate battle flag remain prohibited, except in rare instances of historical or artistic contexts. And although victims have 45 days to file a harassment report, commanders must notify their chain of command within 48 hours if an incident sparks potential interest from the media or Congress.",
      "The Coast Guard occupies a unique middle ground \u2014 subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice but operating under the Department of Homeland Security rather than the Defense Department. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has been outspoken in his intent to roll back what he views as \"woke\" personnel policies, including diversity initiatives and certain extremism-prevention measures.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Former FBI Director James Comey is seeking to dismiss the criminal case against him because of what he claims were \"fundamental errors\" in the grand-jury process and interim U.S. Attorney Lindsey Halligan's handling of the indictment.",
      "Comey's filing, submitted to the federal court in Alexandria, Virginia, on Friday, reflects information revealed during a court proceeding earlier this week, during which federal prosecutors said that the grand jury that indicted Comey on two criminal counts did not vote on the operative indictment.",
      "Defense lawyers instead said that the grand jury rejected the only indictment that Halligan presented to it, and argued that the government's attempt to prosecute Comey without a \"valid\" indictment violates his Fifth Amendment rights.",
      "In addition to questioning the validity of the operative indictment, which charges Comey with one count of lying to Congress and one count of obstructing a congressional proceeding, defense lawyers argued that the case should be dismissed because of alleged misconduct by Halligan before the grand jury.",
      "Halligan, who was appointed interim U.S. attorney in late September, mere days before Comey was indicted, was the only prosecutor who presented the case against Comey before the grand jury, and only she signed the indictment. Comey has pleaded not guilty to both counts.",
      "\"Those errors reflect the reckless and ill-conceived nature of this prosecution: A president intent on prosecuting Mr. Comey before the statute of limitations expired directed the appointment of a White House aide, Lindsey Halligan, as interim U.S. Attorney, and she then rushed to secure an indictment while flagrantly violating basic grand jury rules in the process,\" Comey's lawyers wrote in their bid to dismiss the case. \"Those grand jury errors warrant dismissal twice over.\"",
      "Questions about the proceedings before the grand jury gained steam Monday when a federal magistrate judge identified what he said was a \"disturbing pattern of profound investigative missteps\" in its handling of the case against the ex-FBI director.",
      "U.S. Magistrate Judge William Fitzpatrick found that during Halligan's presentation to the grand jury, the former White House aide made two statements that \"on their face appear to be fundamental misstatements of the law that could compromise the integrity of the grand jury process.\"",
      "Halligan worked as a former insurance lawyer before joining Mr. Trump in the White House for his second term. She had no prosecutorial experience when she was tapped to lead the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Virginia.",
      "Grand jury transcripts are typically secret, but U.S. Magistrate Judge William Fitzpatrick reviewed them as part of a separate hearing on the grand-jury material in Comey's case and whether it should be handed over to the defense.",
      "Fitzpatrick said one statement Halligan made to the grand jury \"suggests\" that Comey does not have a constitutional right to not testify at trial. The second remark from Halligan suggested that the grand jury \"did not have to rely on only the record before them\" and that there was \"more evidence \u2014 perhaps better evidence\" that the Justice Department had that would be used at trial, the judge said.",
      "In a statement, a Justice Department official said that \"when the grand jury transcript is read in full \u2014 as federal judicial ethics require \u2014 it shows that U.S. Attorney Halligan's statements were entirely proper. Selectively quoting half-sentences cannot create impropriety where none exists.\"",
      "Fitzpatrick also raised concerns with the evidence the Justice Department used in its grand jury presentation, finding that much of the material used was seized by the FBI in an earlier probe into Daniel Richman, a law professor at Columbia University and friend of Comey's who was investigated during the first Trump administration for allegedly leaking to the media. The investigation was closed in 2021 and no charges were filed.",
      "Fitzpatrick said the materials seized from Richman were the \"cornerstone\" of Halligan's presentation to the grand jury that voted to indict Comey, and found that the Justice Department may have used information that was collected but outside of the scope of the initial Richman search warrants, as well as potentially privileged information, during the grand-jury proceedings in Comey's case.",
      "The FBI, Fitzpatrick said, \"chose to rummage through\" the material it seized more than five years ago again this summer when it began investigating Comey, and \"inexplicably, the government elected not to seek a new warrant for the 2025 search\" of Richman's devices, \"even though the 2025 investigation was focused on a different person, was exploring a fundamentally different legal theory, and was predicated on an entirely different set of criminal offenses.\"",
      "A Justice Department official said \"the Government remains committed to following the law, respecting grand-jury secrecy, and ensuring that judicial decisions rest on facts \u2014 not assumptions. The magistrate judge's order does not meet that standard.\"",
      "During a hearing Wednesday before U.S. District Judge Michael Nachmanoff, who is presiding over Comey's case, the judge repeatedly questioned federal prosecutors about the validity of the operative indictment and the events surrounding the grand-jury proceedings on Sept. 25.",
      "Documents made public in Comey's case show that the grand jury was initially presented with a three-count indictment, but rejected one of the counts and voted to indict him on the two others.",
      "Tyler Lemons, an assistant U.S. attorney, told the judge that after the grand-jury coordinator informed the U.S. attorney's office about the outcome of the vote, a second indictment was drafted to remove the rejected count and list only the two approved by the grand jury.",
      "But the admission prompted Nachmanoff to question whether the grand jurors had ever been presented with and voted on the second two-count indictment, or whether it was given straight to a U.S. magistrate judge who was presiding over the return of the indictment.",
      "Lemons said the two-count indictment was given straight to the judge, and argued it was not a \"new\" indictment. Instead, he said it had been edited only to reflect the grand jury's decision to charge Comey with lying to Congress and obstruction of a congressional proceeding.",
      "Nachmanoff then asked if the second indictment was never shown to the entire grand jury. The prosecutor said that was correct. Halligan separately told the judge that only the foreperson for the grand jury and another grand juror were in the courtroom when the indictment was presented to the magistrate judge. That assertion was also backed up in a court filing Wednesday, when the Justice Department said that the \"corrected indictment\" with only the two counts marked was presented to the grand jury foreperson and deputy foreperson.",
      "Comey's lawyers seized on that admission, and argued during the hearing that the operative indictment was never presented to the grand jury and never voted on.",
      "\"There is no indictment that Mr. Comey is facing,\" Michael Dreeben, one of his attorneys, told the judge.",
      "Prosecutors attempted to clear up confusion about the proceedings and, pointing to the transcript of proceedings when the indictment was returned, wrote in a filing\u00a0Thursday that the foreperson told the court that the grand jury voted on the two-count indictment.",
      "\"The complete record eliminates any doubt: The foreperson confirmed the vote. The Court acknowledged the vote. The Court docketed the two-count true bill as the operative indictment. Only Count One lacked concurrence; Counts Two and Three were true-billed by at least twelve jurors,\" they said.",
      "But in their latest bid to dismiss the charges related to the alleged grand-jury issues, Comey's lawyers argued that \"there is no record of the grand jury seeing the new indictment \u2014 let alone voting on it.\" Prosecutors' \"late-breaking\" effort to correct the record \"cannot save the putative indictment,\" they continued.",
      "Their filing, defense lawyers said, \"contradicts numerous other representations that the government has made to this Court. And it rests on an erroneous overreading of an ambiguous exchange between the grand jury foreperson and the magistrate judge.\"",
      "The topic of the hearing earlier this week was Comey's effort to dismiss the indictment on the basis that his prosecution is vindictive and selective. Nachmanoff has yet to rule on that motion. Comey is also seeking to have the charges tossed out on the grounds that Halligan was unlawfully appointed interim U.S. attorney. A different judge is weighing that request and has said she intends to rule before Thanksgiving.",

      "Editor's note: You can follow along with live updates about their Friday meeting here.",
      "New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani is set to meet with President Trump at the White House on Friday afternoon, where he plans to discuss affordability and public safety with the president.",
      "The outcome of the meeting could be hugely consequential for the future of New York City. There's a lot on the line -- from\u00a0funding for infrastructure projects, to setting parameters around\u00a0immigration enforcement and, perhaps most importantly, Mamdani needs federal security clearance to be briefed on terror threats and other law enforcement activity.",
      "The mayor-elected shared a photo on social media Friday morning that appeared to show him on board a plane to D.C.",
      "\"I will work with him on any agenda that benefits New Yorkers\"",
      "The high stakes meeting comes\u00a0after months of public hostility\u00a0between the two men. Mr. Trump sharply\u00a0criticized Mamdani during the mayoral campaign, even threatening to arrest and deport him, and has falsely labeled him a \"communist,\" when he's a democratic socialist.",
      "Mamdani, in turn, accused Mr. Trump of acting like an authoritarian and promised to challenge what he calls federal overreach.",
      "The mayor-elect, who vowed to \"Trump-proof\" the city\u00a0on election night, said he reached out to the president to\u00a0set up the sit-down\u00a0meeting.",
      "\"I have many disagreements with the president, and I believe that we should be relentless and pursue all avenues and all meetings that could make our city affordable for every single New Yorker,\" Mamdani\u00a0told reporters Thursday. \"I intend to make it clear to President Trump that I will work with him on any agenda that benefits New Yorkers.\"",
      "He says he plans to focus on the issue of affordability Friday, including federal funding for housing and transit, the future of New York's status as a sanctuary city and the president's threat to withhold certain federal grants unless the city complies with new immigration enforcement tactics.",
      "\"I will work with anyone to make life more affordable for the more than 8.5 million people who call this city home,\" Mamdani said Thursday.",
      "Can they find common ground?",
      "The White House called the meeting an opportunity for \"clarity and cooperation.\" Press secretary Karoline Leavitt seemed to indicate Thursday that Mr. Trump still had reservations about the 34-year-old mayor-elect.",
      "\"I think it speaks volumes that we have a communist coming to the White House, because that's who the Democrat party elected as the mayor of the largest city in the country,\" she said.",
      "It's unclear if the two leaders will be able to find any common ground, but New York Gov. Kathy Hochul -- who has tried to forge a working relationship with the president, despite major policy disagreements -- thinks it's possible.",
      "\"Let's get the Gateway Tunnel finished. Let's work on our subway system, money that we need here in the city. And also just the conversation about how it is not necessary to send in the National Guard, because crime is going down dramatically,\" she said.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-administration-proposed-28-point-russia-ukraine-peace-plan/",
    "published": "Fri, 21 Nov 2025 12:02:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Trump administration officials have proposed a 28-point peace plan designed to end the Russia-Ukraine war \u2014 a framework that would require Ukraine to give up territory and swear off NATO membership.",
    "story": [
      "Trump administration officials have proposed a 28-point peace plan designed to end the Russia-Ukraine war\u00a0\u2014 a framework that would require Ukraine to give up its eastern Donbas region and Crimea, and swear off NATO membership, according to a draft shared publicly by a Ukrainian opposition politician and confirmed by a White House official.",
      "The 28-point plan is the most recent working document offered by the administration, reflecting feedback from Russian and Ukrainian officials, the White House official said. It still remains unclear whether both sides will agree to it; diplomatic conversations are ongoing and further changes are being negotiated, according to multiple sources.",
      "While some European governments were aware the U.S. was working on a proposal, they were not involved in drafting it,\u00a0according to European officials contacted by CBS News.",
      "The plan emerged following recent meetings between the U.S. and officials from both Russia and Ukraine. President Trump's envoy, Steve Witkoff, met with a key adviser to Russian President Vladimir Putin, Kirill Dmitriev on Oct. 24 in Miami, to develop the plan, CBS News reported Thursday.",
      "The plan was also presented to a senior member of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's administration, Rustem Umerov, a White House official said. Umerov confirmed on\u00a0X\u00a0that he was party to the talks on a technical level but said, \"I provided no assessments or, even more so, approvals of any points. This is not within my authority and does not correspond to the procedure.\"",
      "On Thursday, Zelenskyy met with U.S. Army Secretary Dan Driscoll in Kyiv, and was presented with what he later characterized in a post on X as \"points of a plan to end the war \u2014 [America's] vision.\" Zelenskyy said he outlined Ukraine's key principles, and the two sides agreed to continue working on the plan's provisions. A White House official told CBS News that Driscoll had two hours of meetings with Ukrainian officials, including 45 minutes of direct talks with Zelenskyy, which they described as \"productive.\"",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement to CBS News: \"This plan was crafted to reflect the realities of the situation, after 5 years of a devastating war, to find the best win-win scenario, where both parties gain more than they must give.\"",
      "Here's how the proposed plan would work:",
      "Immediate ceasefire",
      "The plan says a ceasefire would take effect immediately if both sides agree to the deal.",
      "Ukraine expected to give up its eastern regions",
      "As written, the plan would allow Russia to hold onto much of the Ukrainian territory that it currently occupies \u2014 and take over some Ukrainian-held areas.",
      "The plan calls for the Ukrainian oblasts of Crimea, Donetsk and Luhansk to be recognized by the U.S. and others as de facto Russian territory. Crimea was fully annexed by Russia in 2014, and the Russian military has occupied most of Donetsk and Luhansk \u2014 collectively known as the Donbas \u2014 since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022. Parts of the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine were first occupied by Russian-aligned forces in 2014.",
      "Crucially, parts of Donetsk that are still under Ukrainian control would also be ceded to Russia, according to the proposal, but would be deemed a neutral buffer zone with no Russian military presence.",
      "The conflict would be frozen at the existing front lines in two other Ukrainian oblasts \u2014 Kherson and Zaporizhia \u2014 effectively allowing Russia to hold onto cities like Mariupol and retain a land connection to Crimea.",
      "Those terms could prove to be a sticking point for Ukraine. Zelenskyy has long refused to give up any new territory or recognize Russian control over Crimea, instead calling for the war to be paused on the existing conflict lines.",
      "Ukraine must cap its military size",
      "The proposal also calls for Ukraine to cap the size of its military at 600,000 people.",
      "Zelensky said in January that the country's military numbered 880,000, according to the Kyiv Independent. Six years earlier, it had roughly 250,000 troops, the Atlantic Council said.",
      "No to NATO membership \u2014 but Ukraine can join the EU",
      "Under the plan, Ukraine would be barred from joining NATO.",
      "The country would be expected to modify its constitution to specify that it will not join the 32-nation bloc, a change of course since the country's NATO aspirations are currently enshrined in its constitution. Ukraine has pursued NATO membership for years, a status that would require the United States and other members to come to the country's defense if it's attacked again.",
      "And NATO is expected to agree not to accept Ukraine into the alliance. In 2008, its member states issued a declaration agreeing that Ukraine would become a member of NATO at some point in the future, but it did not set out a timeline.",
      "The plan also calls for NATO to agree not to send troops to Ukraine \u2014 possibly scuttling any postwar security deal that involves placing allied troops on Ukrainian soil.",
      "Another point in the plan says Russia will not invade neighboring countries and NATO will not expand any further \u2014 a favorable point for Russia, which has long chafed at the alliance's post-Cold War expansions. Sweden and Finland are the alliance's newest members, joining in 2024 and 2023, respectively, partly in reaction to the Russia-Ukraine war.",
      "NATO's longstanding position is that it has an \"open door policy,\" and decisions to admit new countries are made by its members, not any other countries.",
      "But the plan does specify that Ukraine has a right to join the European Union, and that it would get access to the European market in the meantime. Russia has long been wary of further economic and political integration between Ukraine and Europe.",
      "A U.S. guarantee",
      "The plan lays out a security guarantee if Russia reinvades Ukraine, calling for a \"decisive coordinated military response\" and the reinstatement of sanctions on Russia. Other benefits from the agreement, including recognition of new Russian territory, would be called off as well. The plan does not specify what type of military response Russia would face.",
      "The guarantee would be terminated if Ukraine invades Russia, or if it launches missiles at Moscow or St. Petersburg.",
      "Ukrainian elections",
      "Ukraine would be expected to hold elections in 100 days. Ukraine had elections scheduled for early 2024, but they were delayed due to the war. Zelenskyy won the presidency in 2019.",
      "Economic plan for Ukraine, Russian sanctions lifted",
      "The plan calls for a recovery plan for Ukraine, whose economy has been devastated by a yearslong Russian invasion and aerial bombardment. That includes reconstruction of Ukrainian cities, a development fund to boost Ukraine's tech industry and investments in mining and gas.",
      "Some $100 billion in frozen Russian assets would be invested in Ukraine, with the U.S. leading that effort. Europe would contribute an additional $100 billion.",
      "The plan also calls for negotiations on lifting the hefty sanctions that Russia has faced since the invasion began, choking it off from much of the global economy. The sanctions would be lifted in stages, according to the framework. And frozen Russian assets beyond $100 billion would be plowed into a joint U.S.-Russia investment fund.",
      "The overall plan would be monitored and enforced by a Peace Council, to be chaired by President Trump.",
      "Other points in the plan include a Russia-NATO security dialogue, a joint U.S.-Russia security working group and a non-aggression pact between Russia, Ukraine and Europe. It would also extend U.S.-Russia arms control treaties, require Ukraine to be a non-nuclear state and bar Russia from blocking Ukraine from using the key Dnipro river for commercial purposes.",
      "All civilian detainees taken during the war would be returned, including children, and both sides in the conflict would be granted amnesty for their conduct during the war. And both countries would be expected to adopt educational programs to discourage racial prejudice.",
      "The plan also calls for a return of Russia to the Group of Eight, a grouping of powerful countries that kicked Russia out after its 2014 annexation of Crimea.",
      "Leavitt said in her statement: \"As the Trump Administration has clearly said, any deal must provide full security guarantees and deterrence for Ukraine, Europe, and Russia to ensure the end of the war, in addition to financial opportunities for Ukraine to rebuild, and for Russia to rejoin the global economy, to benefit the people in both countries.\"",

    "story": [
      "Update: President Trump and Mayor-elect Mamdani struck a positive tone in their meeting. Read the latest here. Our earlier story is below.",
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump has called Zohran Mamdani \"my little communist mayor.\" Mamdani has vowed to \"Trump-proof\" New York City. On Friday, after months of heated rhetoric on both sides, the president and the mayor-elect of the nation's biggest city were\u00a0set to meet for the first time at the White House.",
      "Mamdani, a democratic socialist, doesn't have much in common politically with the Republican president. But he called the meeting \"an opportunity to make the case for New Yorkers\" and said he plans to discuss economic security and public safety.",
      "\"I'll be ready for whatever happens,\" Mamdani said.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Thursday, \"President Trump is willing to meet with anyone and talk to anyone and to try to do what's right on behalf of the American people.\"",
      "Mamdani used similar language, saying his team reached out to set up the meeting \"because I will work with anyone to make life more affordable for the more than 8.5 million people who call this city home.\"",
      "But often, their words for each other have been more combative.",
      "Mr. Trump, who grew up in Queens and built his business career in New York City, has decried the incoming mayor as \"a communist lunatic.\" Mamdani has blasted the president's immigration raids and economic policies.",
      "Here's a sampling of what the two men have said about each other:",
      "Trump has leaned into calling Mamdani a \"communist\"",
      "The president has repeatedly referred to Mamdani, a self-identifying democratic socialist, as a communist. He's called him \"my little communist mayor\" and a \"communist lunatic.\"",
      "\"Zohran Mamdani, a 100% Communist Lunatic, has just won the Dem Primary, and is on his way to becoming Mayor. We've had Radical Lefties before, but this is getting a little ridiculous,\" Mr. Trump\u00a0posted in June.",
      "\"I don't know what it is, but we have to win the midterms otherwise all of the things that we've done, so many of them are going to be taken away by the radical left lunatics,\" the president said ahead of Election Day. \"I mean, we're going to end up with a communist mayor in New York, can you believe it, a communist? Remember, I would always say we will not have a socialist elected in our country.\"",
      "Trump has suggested Mamdani, a naturalized citizen, may be in the country illegally",
      "President Trump \u2014 who spent years promoting \"birther\" conspiracies about President Obama \u2014 has suggested that Mamdani isn't in the country legally, despite Mamdani being a naturalized U.S. citizen. Mamdani was born in Uganda and moved to New York City with his family at age 7. He gained citizenship in 2018.",
      "\"A lot of people are saying he's here illegally,\" he said of Mamdani this summer. \"We're going to look at everything.\"",
      "The president has also floated the possibility of arresting Mamdani if he tries to keep U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents from arresting and deporting people. If that happens, the president said, \"Well then, we'll have to arrest him.\"",
      "Trump has threatened to pull federal funding from New York City",
      "Before Mamdani's election, Mr. Trump urged New Yorkers to vote for his rival, former Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo, and threatened to pull federal funding from New York City if Mamdani were mayor.",
      "\"If Communist Candidate Zohran Mamdani wins the Election for Mayor of New York City, it is highly unlikely that I will be contributing Federal Funds, other than the very minimum as required, to my beloved first home,\" said Mr. Trump, who spent most of his life in New York before changing his primary residency to Florida in 2019.",
      "The Trump administration's efforts to pull federal funding for projects in blue cities and states during the government shutdown has been met with resistance in court.",
      "But after Mamdani won, the president sounded like he might take a different approach.",
      "\"We'll help them,\" Mr. Trump said. \"We want New York to be successful. We'll help them a little bit, maybe.\"",
      "Trump said Jews who vote for Mamdani are \"stupid\"",
      "The president said during the campaign that any Jews who vote for Mamdani are \"stupid\" because of Mamdani's\u00a0positions on Israel and support for Palestinian statehood.",
      "\"Any Jewish person that votes for Zohran Mamdani, a proven and self professed JEW HATER, is a stupid person!!!\" the president wrote.",
      "Mamdani has said his views were often misrepresented. \"And frankly, I think much of it has to do with that I am the first Muslim candidate to be on the precipice of winning this election,\" he said during the last debate.",
      "Trump said \"Mamdani, or whatever the hell his name is\"",
      "Speaking at the America Business Forum in Miami on Nov. 5, Mr. Trump brought up Mamdani while talking about the subject of transgender athletes.",
      "\"How about the weightlifting? 218 pounds by a woman, that's a lot to lift over your head. 218 pounds, or whatever, was the record. A man beat the record by 100 pounds. It stood for, like, 17 years or something. A man beat the record by 100 pounds. He was a failed male weightlifter, but as a female, he did very well,\" Trump said, mimicking a weightlifter. \"People are crazy.\"",
      "\"And Mamdani, whatever the hell his name is, in New York. He thinks it's wonderful to have men playing in women's sports,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Mamdani has said he's ready to challenge Trump",
      "On the campaign trail, Mamdani was highly critical of the president's immigration crackdown. He's also suggested the president and his administration are looking out for the rich.",
      "During his victory speech, Mamdani spoke directly to the president: \"Donald Trump, since I know you're watching, I have four words for you: Turn the volume up!\" he said to a cheering crowd.",
      "\"If anyone can show a nation betrayed by Donald Trump how to defeat him, it is the city that gave rise to him,\" Mamdani said.",

    "summary": "Only 776 air traffic controllers and techs with perfect attendance during the government shutdown will get $10,000 bonuses while nearly 20,000 others will be left out, the FAA says.",
    "story": [
      "Only 776 air traffic controllers and technicians who had perfect attendance during the government shutdown will receive $10,000 bonuses while nearly 20,000 other workers will be left out, the Federal Aviation Administration announced Thursday.",
      "A number of controllers started calling out of work as the shutdown dragged on longer than a month and they dealt with the financial pressure of working without a paycheck. Some of them got side jobs, but others simply couldn't afford the child care or gas they needed to work. Their absences forced delays at airports across the country and led the government to order airlines to cut some of their flights at 40 busy airports.",
      "President Trump suggested the bonuses for those who have stayed on the job in a social media post, but he also suggested that controllers who missed work should have their pay docked. FAA officials haven't publicly announced plans to penalize controllers.",
      "Thousands of FAA technicians also had to work during the shutdown to maintain the equipment that air traffic controllers rely on. At least 6,600 technicians were expected to work throughout the shutdown but more than 3,000 others were subject to be recalled to work.",
      "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said the bonuses acknowledged the dedication of these few workers who never missed a shift during the 43-day shutdown. In a post on X he described it as \"Santa's coming to town a little early.\"",
      "\"These patriotic men and women never missed a beat and kept the flying public safe throughout the shutdown,\" Duffy said in his formal announcement.",
      "The National Air Traffic Controllers Association union said only 311 of its more than 10,000 members will receive the bonuses. The union said these workers with perfect attendance deserve recognition but so do the others.",
      "\"We are concerned that thousands of air traffic controllers who consistently reported for duty during the shutdown, ensuring the safe transport of passengers and cargo across the nation, while working without pay and uncertain of when they would receive compensation, were excluded from this recognition. More than 311 of these dedicated professionals were instrumental in keeping America moving,\" the union said in a statement.",
      "The Professional Aviation Safety Specialists union said the thousands of technicians it represents worked hard to keep the aging computer and radar systems controllers use operating during the shutdown and they should all be recognized - not just the 423 getting bonuses.",
      "\"It took many hands to ensure that not one delay during the historic 43-day shutdown was attributed to equipment or system failures,\" the union said in a statement.",
      "Democratic Rep. Rick Larsen of Washington State questioned why all the controllers and others who worked to keep flights moving during during the shutdown won't get bonuses.",
      "\"For the Trump administration to not give a bonus to every single one of these hardworking women and men is wrong; they all deserve a bonus and back pay,\" said Larsen, the ranking member of the House Transportation and Infrastructure committee.",
      "The controllers union said they hope to work with Duffy to find a way to recognize all the other air traffic controllers who worked during the shutdown.",
      "Last week, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced that any TSA officers who went \"above and beyond\" while working without pay would get $10,000 bonuses but she never specified how many will qualify beyond the handful of checks she handed out to officers at a news conference.",
      "The FAA was already critically short on air traffic controllers before the shutdown. Duffy had been working to boost controller hiring and streamline the years of training required in the hope of eliminating the shortage over the next several years.",
      "Duffy has said that some students and controllers quit and more experienced controllers retired during the shutdown. Many controllers already work 10-hour shifts six days a week because the FAA is so short on staffing.",
      "As more controllers missed work, the FAA ordered airlines to cut flights to relieve pressure on the system. Duffy said repeatedly that FAA safety experts became worried as the absences grew because of reports from pilots concerned about controllers' responses and a number of runway incursions.   FAA lifts emergency order that slashed flights at 40 major U.S. airportsSince the shutdown ended, controller staffing has improved significantly and airlines were allowed to resume normal operations this week.",

      "New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani says he plans to focus on affordability when he meets with President Trump Friday at the White House. It's scheduled for 3 p.m.",
      "Mamdani held a news conference Thursday morning at City Hall Park, a day after Mr. Trump announced the upcoming meeting between them. Many wonder if the high-stakes discussion will diffuse the tension between the two leaders who have openly criticized each other.",
      "The mayor-elect called it \"an opportunity to make the case for New Yorkers,\" and said he also plans to discuss economic security and public safety.",
      "\"I'll be ready for whatever happens,\" Mamdani said.",
      "Affordability top of the agenda",
      "\"I will be heading to Washington, D.C. tomorrow to meet with President Trump at the White House. It is customary for the mayor of this city to meet with the White House, given their mutual reliance,\" Mamdani said Thursday morning. \"It is more critical than ever, given the national crisis of affordability \u2014 one that New Yorkers know very well across these five boroughs \u2014 and the specific challenge many cities are facing with balancing public safety against steps taken by this administration.\"",
      "The mayor-elect said his team reached out to set up the meeting, \"because I will work with anyone to make life more affordable for the more than 8.5 million people who call this city home.\"",
      "As for potential disagreements?",
      "\"I have many disagreements with the president, and I believe that we should be relentless and pursue all avenues and all meetings that could make our city affordable for every single New Yorker,\" he continued. \"I intend to make it clear to President Trump that I will work with him on any agenda that benefits New Yorkers. If an agenda hurts New Yorkers, I will also be the first to say so.\"",
      "Mamdani says he'll seek common ground",
      "Mamdani said New Yorkers may see the meeting as one between \"two very different candidates who they voted for for the same reasons.\"",
      "\"They wanted a leader who would take on the cost of living crisis that makes it impossible for working people to afford living in this city,\" he added.",
      "After Mr. Trump's 2024 election victory, Mamdani said he spoke with people in neighborhoods with the biggest swings toward Republican candidates \u2014 Hillside Avenue in Queens and Fordham Road in the Bronx.",
      "\"When I asked those New Yorkers who they voted for and why, I met many who voted for President Trump, and they told me it was the affordability crisis, it was cost of living, cost of living, cost of living,\" he said. \"They said that they remembered being able to afford their rent, their child care, their Con Ed, their public transit more four years ago than they could in that moment.\"",
      "Mamdani said that's something he and the president have in common.",
      "\"We ran a campaign focused on the same thing: Cost of living. And what we found, actually, is that 1 in 10 New Yorkers who voted for Trump ended up voting for our campaign, and they did so because they're looking for leaders to actually deliver on the cost of living crisis,\" Mamdani said.",
      "\"An opportunity to make the case for New Yorkers\"",
      "CBS News New York's Marcia Kramer asked Mamdani how he feels heading into the White House meeting. He told reporters he's not concerned and views it as an opportunity.",
      "\"This is an opportunity to make the case for New Yorkers, and it's a case that reflects what New Yorkers are having to live through at this time,\" he told Kramer.",
      "He pointed to 1 in 4 New Yorkers living in poverty and 1 in 5 struggling to afford the $2.90 bus fare.",
      "\"New Yorkers for whom the daily acts of live are becoming increasingly harder to afford,\" he continued. \"And that's an opportunity I have to make the case to President Trump, to the White House, as to what it means to have to suffer through this affordability crisis and what it means to make it even more difficult to do so.\"",
      "Mamdani was asked whether he expects to face any negativity from the president or from other lawmakers on Capitol Hill. Mr. Trump has been a vocal critic of the democratic socialist, previously calling him a \"communist\" and threatening to withhold federal funding.",
      "\"Being a New Yorker means that you're prepared for all situations, all kinds of comments, all kinds of commentary,\" Mamdani replied Thursday. \"At the end of it, the focus has to be, what's the case that you're making, why are you there? And for me, it's not about myself, it's not about a relationship with an individual, it's about a relationship between New York City and the White House, the president, the federal administration.\"",
      "It's important the two strike up a relationship for a number of reasons, Kramer reported. It's not only about federal aid or threats from White House border czar Tom Homan to send more ICE agents into the city. Mamdani will need a federal security clearance in order to be briefed on terror threats and other law enforcement matters, and the president could hold the key to that.",
      "CBS News New York asked Mamdani's team if he planned to meet with other lawmakers in Washington and were told we'll find out Friday.",
      "Gov. Kathy Hochul, who has tried to forge a working relationship with the president even though they have major policy disagreements, says she thinks the two men will be able to find some common ground.",
      "\"Let's get the Gateway Tunnel finished. Let's work on our subway system, money that we need here in the city. And also just the conversation about how it is not necessary to send in the National Guard because crime is going down dramatically,\" Hochul said.",
      "\"We have a communist coming to the White House\"",
      "\"It speaks volumes that tomorrow we have a communist coming to the White House, because that's who the Democrat party elected mayor of the largest city in the country,\" White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said. \"I think it's very telling, but I also think it speaks to the fact that President Trump is willing to meet with anyone, and talk to anyone, and to try to do what's right on behalf of the American people, whether they live in blue states or red states or blue cities, and in a city that's becoming much more left than I think the president ever anticipated in his many years of living in New York itself.\"",
      "Leavitt was asked whether Mamdani could convince the president not to cut off funding New York City, as he has threatened.",
      "\"We'll see how the meeting goes tomorrow, and I'll let for the president speak for himself,\" Leavitt said.",
      "Mamdani on disagreements with Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch",
      "The mayor-elect's remarks followed Wednesday's announcement that NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch has agreed to stay on\u00a0as leader of the police department.",
      "\"Every commissioner should be a fierce advocate for those that work for their department or their agency, and I look forward to ensuring that that is the case across the entirety of my administration \u2014 where, when I have a meeting with the commissioners, I know that they are bringing forth the concerns of those that they work with, those they represent, so we can make sure we are actually addressing them,\" Mamdani told reporters Thursday.",
      "He added any disagreements they may have \"are actually signs of a healthy relationship.\"",
      "\"Too often mayors and leaders are looking to surround themselves with people who are characterized by the quickness with which they can say yes, as opposed to the quickness with which they can tell you their honest opinion,\" he said.",

      "Grammy-winning rapper Prakazrel \"Pras\" Michel of the Fugees was sentenced on Thursday to 14 years in prison for a case in which he was convicted of illegally funneling millions of dollars in foreign contributions to former President Barack Obama's 2012 reelection campaign.",
      "Michel, 52, declined to address the court before U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly sentenced him.",
      "In April 2023, a federal jury convicted Michel of 10 counts, including conspiracy and acting as an unregistered agent of a foreign government. The trial in Washington, D.C., included testimony from actor Leonardo DiCaprio and former Attorney General Jeff Sessions.",
      "Justice Department prosecutors said federal sentencing guidelines recommended a life sentence for Michel, whom they said \"betrayed his country for money\" and \"lied unapologetically and unrelentingly to carry out his schemes.\"",
      "\"His sentence should reflect the breadth and depth of his crimes, his indifference to the risks to his country, and the magnitude of his greed,\" they wrote.",
      "Defense attorney Peter Zeidenberg said his client's 14-year sentence is \"completely disproportionate to the offense.\" Michel will appeal his conviction and sentence, according to his lawyer.",
      "Zeidenberg had recommended a three-year prison sentence. A life sentence would be an \"absurdly high\" punishment for Michel, given that it is typically reserved for deadly terrorists and drug cartel leaders, Michel's attorneys said in a court filing.",
      "\"The Government's position is one that would cause Inspector Javert to recoil and, if anything, simply illustrates just how easily the Guidelines can be manipulated to produce absurd results, and how poorly equipped they are, at least on this occasion, to determine a fair and just sentence,\" they wrote.",
      "Michel, a Brooklyn native whose parents immigrated to the U.S. from Haiti, was a founding member of the Fugees along with childhood friends Lauryn Hill and Wyclef Jean. Their hip-hop band won two Grammy Awards and sold tens of millions of albums.",
      "Michel obtained more than $120 million from Malaysian billionaire Low Taek Jho \u2014 also known as Jho Low \u2014 and steered some of that money through straw donors to Obama's campaign.",
      "Michel said during trial that he viewed Low's payments as \"free money,\" and accepted the millions over the course of nine months to help Low secure a photo op with Obama. He said under oath at the time that no one told him such payments toward political donations could have been unlawful or violations of campaign finance laws.",
      "The Justice Department also charged Michel with serving as an unregistered foreign agent for China, alleging that in 2017 he sought to sway the Trump administration to halt its probe into Low and to extradite a Chinese government target living in the U.S. That individual, dissident Miles Guo, was charged in New York in a billion-dollar fraud case and is still in custody.",
      "Low, who has lived in China, was one of the primary financiers of \"The Wolf of Wall Street,\" a movie starring DiCaprio. Low is a fugitive but has maintained his innocence.",
      "\"Low's motivation for giving Mr. Michel money to donate was not so that he could achieve some policy objective. Instead, Low simply wanted to obtain a photograph with himself and then-President Obama,\" Michel's attorneys wrote.",
      "In August 2024, the judge rejected Michel's request for a new trial based in part on his defense attorney's use of a generative artificial intelligence program during his closing of the trial's arguments. The judges said that and other trial errors didn't amount to a serious miscarriage of justice.",

    "published": "Thu, 20 Nov 2025 19:24:58 -0500",
    "summary": "The Trump administration is proposing new oil drilling off the California and Florida coasts for the first time in decades, as President Trump seeks to expand U.S. oil production.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration announced new oil drilling off the California and Florida coasts for the first time in decades on Thursday, as President Trump seeks to expand U.S. oil production, advancing a project that critics say could harm coastal communities and ecosystems.",
      "The oil industry has been seeking access to new offshore areas, including off Southern California and Florida, as a way to boost U.S. energy security and jobs. The federal government has not allowed drilling in federal waters in the eastern Gulf, which includes offshore Florida and part of offshore Alabama, since 1995, because of concerns about oil spills. California has some offshore oil rigs, but there has been no new leasing in federal waters since the mid-1980s.",
      "California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat who is eyeing a 2028 presidential run and has emerged as a leading Trump critic, called the plan \"idiotic\" and \"reckless\" in a statement. The proposal is also likely to draw bipartisan opposition in Florida. Tourism and access to clean beaches are key parts of the economy in both states.",
      "The administration's plan proposes six offshore lease sales off the coast of California.",
      "It also calls for new drilling off the coast of Florida in areas at least 100 miles from that state's shore. The area targeted for leasing is adjacent to an area in the Central Gulf that already contains thousands of wells and hundreds of drilling platforms.",
      "The five-year plan also would compel more than 20 lease sales off the coast of Alaska, including a newly designated area known as the High Arctic, more than 200 miles offshore in the Arctic Ocean.",
      "CBS News reported earlier this month that the Trump administration was planning to hold offshore drilling auctions in several areas, including off the coasts of California, New England and the Carolinas. Plans viewed by CBS News called for lease sales off California as soon as 2027, and off Alaska as soon as next year.",
      "The energy industry has encouraged the Trump administration to expand offshore drilling. All offshore areas \"with the potential to generate jobs, new revenue and additional production to advance America's energy dominance should be considered for inclusion,\" the American Petroleum Institute and other groups said in a joint letter to the administration in June.",
      "Some Florida politicians have pushed back on offshore drilling plans. Sen. Rick Scott, a Florida Republican and Trump ally, helped persuade Trump administration officials to drop a similar offshore plan in 2018 when he was governor. Earlier this month, Scott and fellow Florida Republican Sen. Ashley Moody co-sponsored a bill to maintain a moratorium on offshore drilling in the state, which Mr. Trump signed in his first term.",
      "\"As Floridians, we know how vital our beautiful beaches and coastal waters are to our state's economy, environment and way of life,\" Scott said in a Nov. 3\u00a0statement\u00a0announcing the bill. \"I will always work to keep Florida's shores pristine and protect our natural treasures for generations to come.\"",
      "Newsom said in a statement Thursday: \"Trump's idiotic plan endangers our coastal economy and communities and hurts the well-being of Californians. This reckless attempt to sell out our coastline to his Big Oil donors is dead in the water.\"",
      "California has been a leader in restricting offshore oil drilling since the infamous 1969 Santa Barbara spill that helped spark the modern environmental movement. While there have been no new federal leases offered since the mid-1980s, drilling from existing platforms continues.",
      "Newsom expressed support for greater offshore controls after a 2021 spill off Huntington Beach and has backed a congressional effort to ban new offshore drilling on the West Coast.",
      "\"For decades, California has stood firm in our opposition to new offshore drilling, and nothing will change that,\" the governor said in his statement Thursday.",
      "A Texas-based company, with support from the Trump administration, is seeking to restart production in waters off Santa Barbara, California, damaged by a 2015 oil spill. The administration has hailed the plan by Houston-based Sable Offshore Corp. as the kind of project Mr. Trump wants to increase U.S. energy production as the federal government removes regulatory barriers.",
      "Since taking office for a second time in January, Mr. Trump has reversed former President Joe Biden's focus on climate change to pursue what he calls U.S. \"energy dominance\" in the global market. The president created a National Energy Dominance Council and directed it to move quickly to drive up already record-high U.S. energy production, particularly fossil fuels such as oil, coal and natural gas.",
      "Mr. Trump signed an executive order on the first day of his second term reversing Biden's ban on future offshore oil drilling on the East and West coasts. A federal court later struck down Biden's order to withdraw 625 million acres of federal waters from oil development.",
      "Meanwhile, Trump's administration has blocked renewable energy sources such as offshore wind and canceled billions of dollars in grants that supported hundreds of clean energy projects across the country.",
      "Democratic lawmakers, including California Sens. Alex Padilla and Adam Schiff and Rep. Jared Huffman, the top Democrat on the House Natural Resources Committee, warned that opening vast coastlines to new offshore drilling \"would devastate coastal economies, jeopardize our national security, ravage coastal ecosystems, and put millions of Americans' health and safety at risk.''",
      "Oil spills \"not only cause irreparable environmental damage, but also suppress the value of coastal homes, harm tourism economies and weaken coastal infrastructure,'' the lawmakers said in a letter signed by dozens of Democrats. One disastrous oil spill can cost taxpayers billions in lost revenue, cleanup costs and ecosystem restoration, they said.",
      "The League of Conservation Voters called Thursday's plan \"dangerous.\"",
      "\"This needless, reckless expansion of offshore drilling would jeopardize our coastal communities, public health, local economies, and the environment, while prolonging our dependence on fossil fuels and doing nothing to lower costs,\" America Fitzpatrick, the group's conservation program director, said in a statement.",

    "published": "Thu, 20 Nov 2025 18:12:15 -0500",
    "summary": "A federal judge ruled Thursday that President Trump's months-long deployment of thousands of National Guard forces to the streets of Washington, D.C., violates federal law.",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge ruled Thursday that President Trump's months-long deployment of thousands of National Guard forces to the streets of Washington, D.C., violates federal law.",
      "U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb sided with D.C. Attorney General Brian Schwalb, who sued the federal government over the Guard deployment, arguing it exceeded the president's legal authority. But the judge stayed her ruling for 21 days to give the Trump administration a chance to appeal it.",
      "White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson blasted the ruling, arguing that Mr. Trump has the authority to deploy Guard troops in the nation's capital. Jackson called Schwalb's lawsuit \"nothing more than another attempt \u2014 at the detriment of DC residents \u2014 to undermine the President's highly successful operations to stop violent crime in DC.\"",
      "In his own statement following the ruling, Schwalb said, \"Normalizing the use of military troops for domestic law enforcement sets a dangerous precedent, where the President can disregard states' independence and deploy troops wherever and whenever he wants \u2013 with no check on his military power. This unprecedented federal overreach is not normal, or legal. It is long past time to let the National Guard go home \u2013 to their everyday lives, their regular jobs, their families, and their children.\"",
      "Mr. Trump first ordered National Guard forces to D.C. in August, part of a broader crackdown on crime using a combination of Guard troops, federal law enforcement agents and local D.C. police who were briefly taken over by the federal government.",
      "Since then, Guard forces have been a common sight on the streets of the capital, especially in tourist-heavy areas, drawing pushback from some local officials. The deployment has been extended multiple times, and is currently set to run until at least February 2026.",
      "The president deployed the D.C. National Guard using his authority as commander in chief of the district's Guard forces \u2014 a unique arrangement as state-level Guard forces are usually controlled by governors. Several GOP-led states have also sent their own Guard troops to the city.",
      "In Thursday's ruling, Cobb said the president lacked the power to deploy the D.C. Guard for \"non-military, crime-deterrence missions in the absence of a request from the city's civil authorities.\" She said that, even though the president is the force's commander in chief, he doesn't have unlimited power to deploy the Guard as he sees fit.",
      "The federal government has argued the deployment is justified by a clause in D.C. local law that says the Guard's commanding general \"may order out any portion of the National Guard for such drills, inspections, parades, escort, or other duties\" \u2014 with the current deployment falling under the category of \"other duties.\" Cobb disputed that interpretation, writing that \"other duties\" appears to only cover military exercises.",
      "The Trump administration has also pointed to a local law that says the Guard can \"aid the civil authorities in the execution of the laws.\" But Cobb said that doesn't allow the government to \"unilaterally call upon the DCNG to assist the District with crime control,\" without a request from local officials.",
      "Separately, Cobb said federal law \"cannot support the out-of-state National Guards' operations in the District because there is no state-law basis for those Guards to travel to the District.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has dispatched National Guard forces to several other cities in recent months, often to protect federal agents and property during immigration crackdowns \u2014 drawing local pushback and mixed results in court.",
      "Members of the California National Guard were deployed to Los Angeles over the summer, despite opposition from Gov. Gavin Newsom. And hundreds of out-of-state National Guard forces were later sent to Chicago and Portland, Oregon, though many of those troops are set to return home, a Defense Department official confirmed to CBS News last weekend.",
      "The Trump administration has argued the deployments were justified because of tense protests against immigration agents, pointing to Title 10, a law that allows the Guard to be used when \"there is a rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of the government of the United States.\" Local officials have said the deployments are unnecessary and inappropriate, arguing that local police can handle the protests themselves.",
      "A panel of appeals court judges allowed Mr. Trump's Los Angeles deployment to go forward over the summer, following a lawsuit from Newsom, but a judge later found the troops had illegally engaged in civilian law enforcement. In Chicago and Portland, judges blocked\u00a0Guard forces from being deployed onto the streets, leaving them in a holding pattern for weeks.",

      "Education Secretary Linda McMahon told CBS News on Tuesday that federal money to support low-income students and special education will continue to flow as the Education Department shifts some of its grant programs to other agencies, amid the Trump administration's push to wind down the department altogether.",
      "The agency announced Tuesday\u00a0that the Department of Labor will now manage many of the Education Department's grants to elementary and secondary schools, including the Title I program, which hands out billions of dollars to aid schools with large numbers of low-income students.",

Certain higher education grants will be moved to the Department of Labor, the Department of the Interior will now handle Native American education grants, the State Department will run some international education programs, and the Department of Health and Human Services will take over a small child care grant program and a panel that reviews foreign medical schools.",
      "McMahon said the department has not decided how to handle some of its other major responsibilities, including its special education\u00a0grants and its Office for Civil Rights.",
      "But programs that support low-income students, students with special needs and civil rights will remain in place, even if they're moved to different agencies, McMahon told CBS News chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett on \"The Takeout.\"",
      "\"They will all still be done,\" McMahon said. \"They were done before there was a Department of Education, and they will continue to be done.\"",
      "\"Special education will not be abandoned,\" McMahon added.",
      "She said the Education Department will still oversee the programs that are being moved to other agencies, and their funding will come from the department's budget.",
      "McMahon said permanently moving the Education Department's responsibilities elsewhere would require congressional approval. But the department has argued that it does have the legal authority to essentially contract out some of its duties to other parts of the federal government.",
      "She referred to the moves as a \"pilot program\" and a \"proof of concept.\"",
      "\"I want to prove to Congress that these transfers of programs are more efficient and that they work,\" McMahon said. \"And so if we can do that, then hopefully ... we can get Congress to vote and to codify those transfers and make it a permanent move.\"",
      "President Trump has taken aim at the Education Department for months, signing an executive order in March directing the department to start closing itself down to the maximum extent required by law. The department has also moved to slash its workforce.",
      "The administration has argued that the Department of Education is overly bureaucratic and many of its tasks should be overseen by states and localities.",
      "\"The Trump Administration is fully committed to doing what's best for American students, which is why it's critical to shrink this bloated federal education bureaucracy while still ensuring efficient delivery of funds and essential programs,\" White House spokesperson Liz Huston said Tuesday, adding that \"students and teachers don't need Washington bureaucrats micromanaging their classrooms.\"",
      "Tuesday's moves drew pushback from the American Federation of Government Employees, which represents thousands of Education Department staffers.",
      "\"Students, educators and families depend on the Department's comprehensive support for schools, from early learning through graduate programs,\" the union said in a press release that called the changes \"unlawful\" and an \"insult\" to students. \"That national mission is weakened when its core functions are scattered across other federal or state agencies that are not equipped or positioned to provide the same support and services as ED staff.\"",

Jena, a study author and professor at Harvard Medical School. \"It would be one thing if studies affected by terminated grants focused on less rigorous or important forms of research, but clinical trials are important, gold-standard in terms of evidence generation, time-intensive, and costly. Those are the last types of studies we would want to stop mid-stream.\"",
      "The paper, published Monday in JAMA Internal Medicine, found that 383 clinical trials were interrupted by the funding cuts, which Jena said was \"surprisingly high\" to the research team. To calculate that number, the researchers looked at all clinical trials that received NIH funding between Feb. 28, 2025, the day of the first reported grant termination, and Aug. 15, 2025. There were about 11,008 clinical trials funded by NIH grants during that time period.",
      "More than 36% of the interrupted trials have since been completed. Another 35% were recruiting patients. About 11% of the trials were active and not recruiting patients, while 14% were active but not yet recruiting. The remaining trials were enrolling patients by invitation. Trials that had their funding interrupted had more expected participants enrolled than trials that were not affected, the researchers found.",
      "Trials that were active and not recruiting, where participants may have been receiving interventions, had a total of 74,311 patients enrolled in them, the researchers said.",
      "The researchers looked at the trial details to learn more about what kind of research was being interrupted. Trials conducted outside the U.S. were disproportionately affected, and within the United States, the Northeast had the highest rate of interrupted trials. More than 115 trials studying cancer were interrupted, as well as 97 trials that looked at infectious diseases. Trials studying cardiovascular diseases, mental health and reproductive health were also affected.",
      "Jena warned that the interruptions could lead to \"avoidable waste\" and \"impact the future willingness of patients to participate in trials.\"",
      "Jena said there is no systemic data on how often clinical trials are paused for funding lapses. Termination of federal grant funding was \"exceedingly rare\" before 2025, he said.",
      "\"Clinical trials aren't light switches,\" said CBS News medical contributor Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, an editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News. \"You can't just flip them off without consequences. Cutting off funding mid-trial wastes research dollars and puts patients at risk. This is a breach of trust with every person who volunteers for research.\"",
      "The NIH said it strongly rejected the \"intentionally misleading portrayal of our grant management process\" in the letter and accused the researchers of having conflicts of interest, though it did not specify what those were. The NIH highlighted the \"more than 42,500 active, recruiting, or planned clinical trials across every major disease area\" that it currently funds and oversees, and said the paper had a \"selective focus on a handful of appropriately paused studies.\"",
      "\"What they fail to mention is that NIH is undergoing a strategic realignment. We are prioritizing high-impact, high-urgency science ... The biomedical research enterprise is being refocused and that's what will keep America at the forefront of global science, safety, and innovation,\" the NIH said. The agency also said the terminated or interrupted studies \"likely happened because this research prioritized ideological agendas over scientific rigor and meaningful outcomes for the American people.\"",
      "The NIH is the largest funder of biomedical research. More than $2 billion in federal research grants were canceled by the NIH earlier this year as part of President Trump and the Department of Government Efficiency's efforts to downsize the federal government. Agency spending has also been slowed, and 1,300 employees have been fired. Thousands of universities and U.S. institutions rely on NIH funding for their research.",
      "Former NIH head Dr. Francis Collins, who led the agency for 12 years across three administrations, told CBS News in April that \"every dollar that NIH gave out in 2024 to a grant is estimated to have returned $2.46 just in a year.\"",
      "\"When you're talking about medical research, when you're talking about people's lives, when you're talking about clinical trials for Alzheimer's disease or cancer that may take three or four years, you can't just go in and decide, 'I'm going to shut those down and maybe I'll try something else.' Those are people's lives at risk,\" Collins told CBS News.",

    "summary": "Moss spores survived in outer space for a majority of 2022, and could even reproduce when they were eventually returned to Earth, according to a new study.",
    "story": [
      "Moss spores survived in outer space for a majority of 2022, and could even reproduce as usual when they were eventually returned to Earth, according to a new study from researchers who say their findings \"reveal the potential of terrestrial plants to endure extreme environments\" \u2014 including the extraterrestrial kind.",
      "\"Climate change highlights the importance of understanding life's survival limits for addressing global challenges and supporting future human habitation beyond Earth,\" reads the introductory text of the study, conducted by scientists at Hokkaido University in Japan. \"Understanding the resilience of Earth-born organisms in extreme and unfamiliar conditions, such as the space environment, is a crucial step toward expanding human habitats other than Earth like the Moon or Mars.\"",
      "The full text was published Thursday in the online journal iScience. It describes a pioneering effort to study bryophyte plants, such as moss, with the intent to learn more about the limits of their survival skills and gauge their adaptability. Although the plants' resilience was already well-known in environments on Earth, research on their survival limits more widely is still in its early stages, the study's authors said.",
      "For nine months, moss withstood the markedly harsh conditions of space \u2014 which very few Earthly creatures have ever done \u2014 while affixed to the outside of the International Space Station. While the spores' chlorophyll, which gives them their green color, did degrade during the experiment, scientists said more than 80% of them retained their viability after nine months outside of the space station.",
      "Different types of moss spores had individual strengths, like one that may protect against ultraviolet rays, heat and intensive light stresses, and another that \"could be used for planetary greening and life support systems,\" the authors said.",
      "Bryophytes have existed on Earth since at least 500 million years ago, when they began to advance from water onto land, scientists say. The plants continue to exist today despite the fact that Earth has changed considerably, and they have become known for their tolerance to desiccation, freezing and radiation, all of which made them good candidates to be studied in an extraterrestrial setting.",
      "In addition to surviving the 9-month period, the spores could still germinate after the experiment ended and scientists returned them back down to Earth, according to the study.",

    "summary": "The Sentinel-6B is the second of two satellites in a $1 billion program to monitor sea levels over a full decade.",
    "story": [
      "SpaceX launched a joint NASA-European environmental research satellite early Monday, the second in an ongoing billion-dollar project to measure long-term changes in sea level, a key indicator of climate change.",
      "The first satellite, known as Sentinel-6 and named in honor of NASA climate researcher Michael Freilich, was launched in November 2020. The latest spacecraft, Sentinel-6B, was launched from California atop a Falcon 9 rocket at 12:21 a.m. EST.",
      "Both satellites are equipped with a sophisticated cloud-penetrating radar. By timing how long it takes beams to bounce back from the ocean 830 miles below, the Sentinel-6 satellites can track sea levels to an accuracy of about one inch while also measuring wave height and wind speeds.",
      "The project builds on earlier missions dating back to the early 1990s that have provided an uninterrupted stream of sea level data.",
      "That data indicates sea levels are slowly but surely rising, widely interpreted as evidence of global warming caused in large part by human industrial activity.",
      "But in keeping with recent Trump administration policies aimed at scaling back climate research and the interpretation of such data, NASA did not directly refer to \"climate change\" or \"global warming\" in a Sentinel-6B pre-launch briefing Saturday.",
      "In the press kit released by NASA for the first Sentinel 6 mission in 2020, the first item in a \"need to know list\" said the satellite would \"provide information that will help researchers understand how climate change is reshaping Earth's coastlines \u2014 and how fast this is happening.\"",
      "In the press kit for the Sentinel 6B mission launched Monday, NASA's first \"need to know\" item said simply that \"Sentinel-6B will contribute to a multi-decade dataset that is ... key to helping improve public safety, city planning and protecting commercial and defense interests.\"",
      "Karen St. Germain, director of NASA's Earth Science Division, did not directly mention climate change in the Saturday briefing, focusing instead on the practical importance of monitoring sea levels.",
      "\"Sentinel 6B is the latest in a line of missions stretching over three decades, keeping an uninterrupted watch over our planet's sea surface height, finding patterns and advancing our understanding of planet Earth,\" she said.",
      "She said the data provided by the Sentinel-6 satellites \"underpins navigation, search and rescue and industries like commercial fishing and shipping. These measurements form the basis for U.S. flood predictions for coastal infrastructure, real estate, energy storage sites and other assets along our shoreline.\"",
      "The data, she continued, will help scientists \"understand and predict coastal erosion and salt water encroachment into inland supplies of water that are used for agriculture, irrigation as well as municipal drinking water.\"",
      "Regardless of interpretation, the launch of Sentinel-6B went off without a hitch.",
      "After blasting off from launch complex 4E at the Vandenberg Space Force Base, the Falcon 9 rocket's first stage powered the vehicle out of the dense lower atmosphere, separated and flew itself back to a landing pad at the California launch site.",
      "The upper stage then carried out two firings of its single engine before releasing the 2,600-pound Sentinel-6B into an 830-mile-high orbit tilted 66 degrees to the equator, the same orbit used by Sentinel-6A and earlier sea level-monitoring spacecraft.",
      "Taking 112 minutes to complete one orbit, the solar-powered satellite will fly over locations between 66 degrees north and south latitude, covering 90 percent of the world's oceans.",
      "Along with measuring sea levels, the new satellite will monitor temperature and humidity in the lower atmosphere as well as the higher-altitude stratosphere using an instrument that measures atmospheric effects on signals broadcast by navigation satellites.",
      "But the primary mission is monitoring Earth's changing sea levels.",
      "\"The dynamic balance that persisted before the industrial revolution has been upset by the almost instantaneous combustion of huge reserves of carbon as our society has developed,\" Craig Donlon, a European Space Agency project scientist, said before the first Sentinel-6 launch in 2020.",
      "\"We see evidence of this dramatic change in many different measurements ... but they all point the same direction: the Earth is warming. And the greatest indicator of this Earth system imbalance is sea level rise.\"",
      "The Sentinel-6 satellites are the result of a collaboration between NASA, the European Space Agency, the European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).",
      "St. Germain said NASA's share of the cost for both Sentinel-6 satellites came to about $500 million. The Europeans contributed a similar amount.",

    "story": [
      "Amazon has started issuing payments to eligible Prime members as part of a $2.5 billion settlement over federal allegations that it misled customers.",
      "The online retailer\u00a0agreed to the payouts in September\u00a0to resolve a 2023 Federal Trade Commission\u00a0lawsuit that accused Amazon of misleading customers into enrolling in Prime and making it hard for them to cancel their membership.",
      "Under the settlement, Amazon agreed to offer $1.5 billion in refunds to customers. However, the e-commerce company neither admitted nor denied the FTC's allegations. In a\u00a0statement\u00a0at the time, the company said that \"Amazon and our executives have always followed the law.\"",
      "Here's what to know about the Amazon refund, including how to determine if you qualify for the payment.",

      "Amazon is issuing settlement refunds to eligible Prime Members, starting with automatic payments issued between Nov. 12 and Dec. 24 (see below for more details on how payments are being made).",
      "\"Our settlement required Amazon to pay those people who clearly qualify without them having to do anything,\" Christopher Bissex, deputy director of public affairs at the FTC, told CBS News. \"So those people are getting the automatic payments.\"",

      "How do I know if I qualify?",
      "Only customers who signed up for Amazon Prime between June 23, 2019, and June 23, 2025, are eligible to receive a refund.",
      "Customers qualify for an automatic payment if they signed up for Prime or unsuccessfully tried to cancel their membership through Amazon's \"challenged enrollment flow,\" defined as \"any version of the Universal Prime Decision Page, the Shipping Option Select Page, Prime Video enrollment flow, or the Single Page Checkout,\" according to a September\u00a0court order.",
      "The FTC also said these customers must have used no more than three \"Amazon Prime Benefits\" in a 12-month period.",

      "\"Once you do not claim the PayPal or Venmo payment, Amazon will mail you a check to your default shipping address listed on your Prime subscription,\" the FTC said on its website. \"If you get a check, please cash it within 60 days.\"",

The AI ecosystem is scaling fast \u2014 with more new foundation model makers, more AI startups, across more industries, and in more countries. AI is going everywhere, doing everything, all at once,\" Huang added.",
      "Nvidia forecast revenue of $65 billion for the fourth quarter. The company's shares, which have jumped 39% this year, rose nearly 4% in after-hours trading to $193.80.",

      "\"Market psychology has been negative this month as investors worried that the artificial intelligence infrastructure build out was a bubble, and in a few years we may look back at this time and point to signs that it was, Zaccarelli said. \"But in the meantime, the largest technology companies in the world are extremely profitable, and they are reinvesting billions of dollars into data centers, servers and chips, and the spending is real.\"",

The system, combined with ID-based age verification and confirmed parental consent, is intended to \"provide a more accurate measure of a user's age than simply relying on what someone types in when they create an account,\" the company said in a statement.",
      "Roblox CEO David Baszucki described the guardrails in an interview with CBS Mornings' Tony Dokoupil as \"what we believe will become the gold standard for safety and civility on the internet.\"",
      "Doukopil questioned Baszucki about potential parental concerns about the AI verification, given that it involves minors sending pictures of themselves into the app to verify the user's age. Some parents \"are already skeptical about their children's safety on Roblox,\" Doukopil said.",
      "Roblox is \"not storing these images,\" Baszucki said. The photos \"are deleted soon after [Roblox] process[es] them.\"",
      "The image is used to determine the age of the Roblox user, and \"then to assign them to the right people that might connect with,\" he added.",
      "The company will start enforcing the age-check requirement in select global markets, including Australia, New Zealand and the Netherlands, before expanding the system to other countries in early January. Roblox is also launching a dedicated online safety center to help families understand and set up the platform's parental controls.",
      "The company's enhanced protections arrive as dozens of families, along with attorneys general in Kentucky and Louisiana, are suing Roblox, Discord and other technology companies for allegedly failing to deter sexual predators from approaching children on their platforms. Florida is also investigating Roblox, with Attorney General James Uthmeier accusing the platform of failing to protect minors.",
      "Roblox in September outlined plans to expand age checks for all users who want to access communication features on the gaming platform. The guardrails are meant to limit communication between adults and minors unless they already know each other in the real world.",

      "The startling run-up in AI-related stocks is prompting comparisons to the dot-com era of the late 1990s, when many internet companies saw their stock prices skyrocket despite suffering vast financial losses. When that bubble burst in the early 2000s, it took down former high-fliers like Pets.com, torched investor portfolios and triggered a recession.",

The investment bank's analysis of the Magnificent 7's median price-to-earnings ratio \u2014 a measure of a company's share price compared to its profits \u2014 found it is \"roughly half\" that of the largest seven companies in the late 1990s.",
      "\"So it is true that valuations are high but, in our view, generally not at levels that are as high as are typically seen at the height of a financial bubble,\" they noted.",
      "Why this time may be different",
      "The question of whether AI is fueling a bubble akin to the late 1990s was even posed to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell at the central bank's Oct. 29 meeting.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/meta-ftc-whatsapp-instagram/",
    "published": "Tue, 18 Nov 2025 15:05:56 -0500",
    "summary": "Meta has prevailed over an existential challenge to its business that could have forced the tech giant to spin off Instagram and WhatsApp.",
    "story": [
      "Meta has prevailed over an existential challenge to its business that could have forced the tech giant to spin off Instagram and WhatsApp after a judge ruled that the company does not hold a monopoly in social networking.",
      "U.S. District Judge James Boasberg issued his ruling Tuesday after the historic antitrust trial wrapped up in late May. His decision follows two separate rulings that branded Google an illegal monopoly in both search and online advertising, dealing yet another regulatory blow to the tech industry that for years enjoyed nearly unbridled growth.",
      "The Federal Trade Commission \"continues to insist that Meta competes with the same old rivals it has for the last decade, that the company holds a monopoly among that small set, and that it maintained that monopoly through anticompetitive acquisitions,\" Boasberg wrote in his ruling. \"Whether or not Meta enjoyed monopoly power in the past, though, the agency must show that it continues to hold such power now. The Court's verdict today determines that the FTC has not done so.\"",
      "Meta Platforms Inc., the FTC had argued, has maintained a monopoly by pursuing CEO Mark Zuckerberg's strategy, \"expressed in 2008: 'It is better to buy than compete.' True to that maxim, Facebook has systematically tracked potential rivals and acquired companies that it viewed as serious competitive threats.\"",
      "During his April testimony, Zuckerberg pushed back against the FTC's contention that Facebook bought Instagram to neutralize a threat. In his line of questioning, FTC attorney Daniel Matheson repeatedly brought up emails \u2014 many of them more than a decade old \u2014 written by Zuckerberg and his associates before and after the acquisition of Instagram.",
      "While acknowledging the documents, Zuckerberg has often sought to downplay the contents, saying he wrote them in the early stages of considering the acquisition and that what he wrote at the time didn't capture the full scope of his interest in the company. But the case was not about the acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp more than a decade ago, which the FTC approved at the time, but about whether Meta holds a monopoly now. The FTC, Boasberg wrote in the ruling, could only win if it proved \"current or imminent legal violation.\"",
      "The FTC's complaint said Facebook also enacted policies designed to make it difficult for smaller rivals to enter the market and \"neutralize perceived competitive threats,\" just as the world shifted its attention to mobile devices from desktop computers.",
      "Meta said Tuesday's decision \"recognizes that Meta faces fierce competition.\"",
      "\"Our products are beneficial for people and businesses and exemplify American innovation and economic growth. We look forward to continuing to partner with the Administration and to invest in America,\" the Menlo Park, California-based company said in a statement.",
      "The social media landscape has changed so much since the FTC filed its lawsuit in 2020, Boasberg wrote, that each time the court examined Meta's apps and competition, they changed. Two opinions to dismiss the case \u2014 filed in 2021 and 2022 \u2014 didn't even mention popular social video platform TikTok. Today, it \"holds center stage as Meta's fiercest rival.\"",
      "Quoting the Greek philosopher Heraclitus, \"that no man can ever step into the same river twice,\" Boasberg said the same is true for the online world of social media as well.",
      "\"The landscape that existed only five years ago when the Federal Trade Commission brought this antitrust suit has changed markedly. While it once might have made sense to partition apps into separate markets of social networking and social media, that wall has since broken down,\" he wrote.",
      "Emarketer analyst Minda Smiley said Meta's win \"is not necessarily surprising considering the lengths it's gone to in recent years to keep up with TikTok.\"",
      "\"But from a regulatory standpoint, Meta is far from out of the woods: next year, major social networks will face landmark trials in the US regarding children's mental health,\" she added. \"Still, today's win is surely a boost for the company as it battles criticism and questions over how its massive AI spending will ultimately benefit Meta in the long run.\"",
      "Facebook bought Instagram \u2014 then a scrappy photo-sharing app with no ads and a small cult following \u2014 in 2012. The $1 billion cash and stock purchase price was eye-popping at the time, though the deal's value fell to $750 million after Facebook's stock price dipped following its initial public offering in May 2012.",
      "Instagram was the first company Facebook bought and kept running as a separate app. Up until then, Facebook was known for smaller \"acqui-hires\" \u2014 a type of popular Silicon Valley deal in which a company purchases a startup as a way to hire its talented workers, then shuts the acquired company down. Two years later, it did it again with the messaging app WhatsApp, which it purchased for $22 billion.",
      "WhatsApp and Instagram helped Facebook move its business from desktop computers to mobile devices, and to remain popular with younger generations as rivals like Snapchat (which it also tried, but failed, to buy) and TikTok emerged. However, the FTC has a narrow definition of Meta's competitive market, excluding companies like TikTok, YouTube and Apple's messaging service from being considered rivals to Instagram and WhatsApp.",

      "The granddaughter of late President John F. Kennedy,\u00a0Tatiana Schlossberg, announced Saturday that she has less than a year to live amid a cancer diagnosis.",
      "The 35-year-old journalist published an essay in the New Yorker magazine, writing that ten minutes after she gave birth to her second child, a baby girl, in May 2024, doctors noticed her white-blood-cell count \"looked strange.\"",
      "She wrote in the magazine that she was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia, with a rare mutation called Inversion 3, shortly afterward. Schlossberg, who has been married to Dr. George Moran since 2017, wrote that she couldn't believe this was happening.",
      "\"I had a son whom I loved more than anything and a newborn I need to take care of,\" she wrote.",
      "Schlossberg said after several clinical trials and two transplants, her doctor told her he could keep her \"alive for a year, maybe.\"",
      "Another tragedy hits the Kennedy family",
      "The second of Caroline Kennedy and Edwin Schlossberg's three children, Schlossberg said she received care at Memorial Sloan Kettering in New York City. She wrote searingly in her essay of the guilt she felt over another tragedy hitting the famous Kennedy family.",
      "\"For my whole life, I have tried to be good, to be a good student and a good sister and a good daughter, and to protect my mother and never make her upset or angry. Now I have added a new tragedy to her life, to our family's life and there's nothing I can do to stop it,\" she wrote.",
      "Caroline Kennedy, who served\u00a0as the U.S. ambassador to Australia and Japan, lost her father, President John F. Kennedy, when he was assassinated\u00a0on Nov. 22, 1963, by Lee Harvey Oswald \u2014 the same day, 62 years later, her daughter published her essay announcing her cancer diagnosis. She also lost her uncle Bobby Kennedy when he was shot and killed in 1968 while he was campaigning.",
      "Kennedy's mother, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis,\u00a0died in 1994 at age 64 following a diagnosis of Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma. Her brother, John F. Kennedy Jr.,\u00a0died in a plane crash\u00a0off the coast of Massachusetts in 1999.",
      "Kennedy's cousin, Maria Shriver, urged people on social media\u00a0on Saturday to read Schlossberg's story to see what \"a beautiful writer, journalist, wife, mother, daughter, sister, and friend\" has been going through for the last year and a half. Shriver said to let the story \"be a reminder to be grateful for the life you are living today, right now, this very minute.\"",
      "Collecting memories",
      "Schlossberg spends a portion of her essay writing about her family's dismay regarding the\u00a0nomination and confirmation\u00a0of her cousin Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as Secretary of Health and Human Services. She spoke about how he cut nearly half a billion dollars for research into mRNA vaccines and slashed funding from the National Institutes of Health. She wrote that hundreds of National Institute of Health grants and clinical trials were canceled.",
      "She wrote that she worries millions of women might not get the care they deserve after she was given a dose of misoprostol to stop her postpartum hemorrhage. Because the drug is part of medication abortion, it is currently under review at the Food and Drug Administration, she wrote, due to her cousin's urging.",
      "Schlossberg mostly focused on writing about her family, how she is going to miss living life with her \"kind, funny, handsome genius\" husband she managed to find, and what would happen to her two young children growing up without their mother.",
      "\"Mostly I try to live and be with them now,\" she wrote in The New Yorker. But she says that it is harder than it seems and tries to fill herself up with memories of her children, which she hopes she can carry with her after she is gone.",
      "\"Sometimes I trick myself into thinking I'll remember this forever, I'll remember this when I'm dead,\" Schlossberg wrote.",

      "President Trump's meeting with incoming New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani on Friday was not expected to be warm and congenial. The two politicians agree on very little, and they've lobbed attacks at each other for months, with Mr. Trump calling Mamdani a \"100% communist lunatic\" and Mamdani describing himself as \"Donald Trump's worst nightmare.\"",
      "But instead, the two men seemed to hit it off. In a surreal 30-minute Oval Office appearance, Mr. Trump lavished Mamdani with praise, calling him \"very rational\" and predicting he could do \"really great\" things for their shared hometown. Mamdani, standing beside Mr. Trump, steered clear of criticizing the president \u2014 sometimes with an assist from Mr. Trump himself \u2014 and pledged to work with the administration on cost-of-living issues.",
      "Here are the highlights:",
      "\"I think you're going to have, hopefully, a really great mayor\"",
      "Mr. Trump was unceasingly optimistic about Mamdani, saying that during a private one-on-one meeting before their public appearance, the two men agreed on more than he expected. He pointed to Mamdani's focus on affordability and stated desire to build more housing.",
      "\"I think you're going to have, hopefully, a really great mayor,\" the president said. \"The better he does, the happier I am.\"",
      "\"I think he is going to surprise some conservative people\"",
      "Days before the election, Mr. Trump had encouraged people to vote for Mamdani's chief rival, Democratic governor-turned-independent Andrew Cuomo.",
      "But on Friday, the president said: \"I feel very confident that he can do a very good job\u2026I think he is going to surprise some conservative people, actually. And some very liberal people, he won't surprise them because they already like him.\"",
      "\"I expect to be helping him, not hurting him\"",
      "For months, Mr. Trump has flirted with cutting off federal financial support to New York City if Mamdani wins, suggesting it would be a waste.",
      "After their meeting, Mr. Trump didn't fully back away from the threat, but said it was unlikely.",
      "\"I expect to be helping him, not hurting him,\" Mr. Trump said. \"A big help. Because I want New York City to be great. Look, I love New York City, it's where I come from, I spent a lot of years there. ... I think this mayor could do some things that are going to be really great.\"",
      "Does Mamdani think Trump is a fascist? \"That's okay, you can just say yes,\" president says",
      "At various points, reporters pressed Mamdani on whether he stands by his prior attacks on Mr. Trump \u2014\u00a0 and the president helped him dodge.",
      "One reporter asked Mamdani if he believes Mr. Trump is a \"fascist.\" As the incoming mayor began to answer, the president laughed and cut him off.",
      "\"That's okay, you can just say yes,\" Mr. Trump interjected, patting Mamdani on the arm. \"That's easier. It's easier than explaining it. I don't mind.\"",
      "Earlier in the meeting, Mamdani was asked if he still believes Mr. Trump is a \"despot.\"",
      "Said Mr. Trump: \"I've been called much worse than a despot, so it's not that insulting. I think he'll change his mind after we get to working together.\"",
      "\"He's got views that [are] a little out there, but who knows\"",
      "The president also deflected when asked about his claim that Mamdani is a \"communist.\"",
      "Said Mr. Trump: \"He's got views that [are] a little out there, but who knows. I mean, we're going to see what works.\"",
      "\"He's going to change, also. We all change. I changed a lot,\" the president continued.",
      "Mamdani describes himself as a democratic socialist, not a communist. He stood by that label on Friday.",
      "Trump: Mamdani isn't a \"jihadist,\" he's \"very rational\"",
      "Earlier this month, GOP Rep. Elise Stefanik \u2014 a candidate for governor of New York \u2014 called Mamdani an \"Antisemite Jihadist Communist.\"",
      "Asked if he agrees that Mamdani is a \"jihadist,\" Mr. Trump said no.",
      "\"I met with a man who's a very rational person. I met with a man who really wants to see New York be great again,\" the president continued.",
      "\"I would feel very, very comfortable being in New York\"",
      "Mr. Trump \u2014 a Queens native whose primary residence is now in Florida \u2014 said he'd feel comfortable moving back to New York City under Mamdani's leadership.",
      "\"I would feel very, very comfortable being in New York, and I think much more so after the meeting,\" he said.",
      "The pair's views on crime and immigration enforcement came up repeatedly on Friday. The president expressed confidence in Mamdani: He said he believes the mayor-elect cares about public safety, and praised Mamdani for choosing to retain\u00a0New York City Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch.",
      "\"That's a good sign,\" the president said.",
      "Trump: \"A lot of my voters actually voted for him, and I'm okay with that\"",
      "Mamdani pointed out that Mr. Trump's vote share in New York City jumped last year, which he attributed mostly to worries about affordability. And the mayor-elect noted that he swept up some Trump voters, which the president appreciated.",
      "\"He said a lot of my voters actually voted for him, and I'm okay with that,\" the president said.",
      "\"I think he's different than your typical guy\"",
      "Mr. Trump, for his part, praised Mamdani for the former state legislator's unexpected come-from-behind victory in the Democratic primary.",
      "\"He came out of nowhere,\" said the president. \"I watched. I said, 'Who is this guy?'\"",
      "Left unmentioned were the parallels with Mr. Trump's own insurgent victory in the 2016 Republican primary.",

      "COVER STORY: Powering our appetite for proteinProteins, whether from whey, plants or animals, are essential for building muscle. Last year, approximately 71% of consumers identified protein as the nutrient they most frequently try to eat. That's an appetite corporate America is more than happy to feed \u2013 even though protein often doesn't taste very good. Lee Cowan looks at how companies like General Mills are developing protein-fueled products, and how Americans may be consuming more protein than they need.",

    "story": [
      "Some U.S. lawmakers criticized the Trump administration's proposed 28-point peace plan designed to end the Ukraine-Russia war on Saturday, saying the framework appears to favor Moscow.",
      "The deal would require Ukraine to give up its eastern Donbas region and Crimea, and swear off NATO membership, according to a draft shared publicly by a Ukrainian opposition politician and confirmed by a White House official. The plan includes feedback from Russian and Ukrainian officials, and diplomatic conversations about it are ongoing. President Trump gave Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy a suggested deadline of Thanksgiving Day to respond to the plan.",
      "Members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, including Democrat Jeanne Shaheen and Republican Thom Tillis, said in a statement on Saturday that they had \"significant concerns over the details of the reported peace plan.\"",
      "\"For over 10 years, Russia has illegally occupied Ukrainian territory and for almost 4 years, Ukraine has admirably defended itself against Russia's attempts to fully occupy Ukraine. No one wants a just and lasting peace more than the Ukrainian people,\" the committee members said in a statement. \"However, we will not achieve that lasting peace by offering Putin concession after concession and fatally degrading Ukraine's ability to defend itself.\"",
      "\"History teaches us that Putin only understands strength and will not abide by any agreement unless it is backed by force,\" the statement continued. \"We must consult closely with our Ukrainian and NATO partners on the path forward. We should put real pressure on Russia to come to the negotiating table. And we must make clear to the Kremlin\u2014and would-be aggressors in Beijing\u2014that America will stand unwaveringly in defense of freedom.\"",
      "Co-chairs of the bipartisan Congressional Ukraine Caucus also criticized the reported peace plan, saying it \"appears to favor the interest of the aggressor,\" Russian President Vladimir Putin, \"over the sovereignty and security of a democratic Ukraine.\"",
      "\"This framework does not offer a genuine path to lasting peace, but instead, demands the surrender and capitulation of Ukraine to Russian aggression,\" the caucus said in a statement shared on Saturday.",
      "The Trump administration's backing of the plan \"raises serious concerns,\" the caucus said.",
      "\"The international community must remain firm in supporting Ukraine, upholding the principles of territorial integrity and self-determination, and rejecting any plan that rewards an aggressor,\" the caucus said. \"Lasting peace comes not from conceding to aggression, but from the strength and unity of free nations that refuse to bow to it.\"",
      "European governments were not involved in drafting the proposal, according to European officials contacted by CBS News. Western leaders gathered at the G20 summit in South Africa said Saturday that the plan needs \"additional work.\"",
      "The plan emerged following recent meetings between the U.S. and officials from both Russia and Ukraine. Mr. Trump's envoy, Steve Witkoff, met with a key adviser to Russian President Vladimir Putin, Kirill Dmitriev, on Oct. 24 in Miami, to develop the plan, CBS News reported Thursday.",
      "Ukrainian envoys are set to meet with a U.S. delegation \u2014 including Secretary of the Army Dan Driscoll, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Witkoff \u2014 in Geneva, Switzerland, to discuss the proposal. Nine Ukrainian officials, including Zelenskyy's chief of staff, are set to take part in the talks, the Associated Press reported.",
      "Ukraine is commemorating its \"great famine\" on Saturday. The famine, imposed by Soviet leader Josef Stalin in the early 1930s, led to millions of deaths from starvation. In a video address, Zelenskyy addressed the country's ongoing fight.",
      "\"We defended, defend and will always defend Ukraine,\" Zelenskyy said. \"Because only here is our home. And in our home, Russia will definitely not be the master.\"",

    "summary": "Democratic Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse and Kennedy Center president Ric Grenell are clashing over the Kennedy Center's spending and operations.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Kennedy Center president Ric Grenell and Democratic Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island are clashing over the center's spending and operations records, after Trump allies were appointed to key roles at the Kennedy Center earlier this year, and President Trump was elected chairman of the board.",
      "In a letter to Grenell, Whitehouse said that under Grenell's stewardship, \"The Center is being looted to the tune of millions of dollars in foregone revenue, cancelled programming, unpaid use of its facilities, and wasteful spending on luxury restaurants and hotels.\" He called it \"an unprecedented pattern of self-dealing, favoritism, and waste.\"",
      "At one point, Whitehouse alleged that the Kennedy Center had let FIFA use the space for free, waiving its rental fee. On Friday, the center told the\u00a0Associated Press that it would actually receive $7.4 million in connection with the FIFA event.",
      "Grenell posted a long letter on X that responded to Whitehouse's accusations, point by point: \".@SenWhitehouse just stepped in it,\" Grenell wrote. \"He attacked the Kennedy Center with outrageous claims. So we responded with the facts.\"",
      "Grenell said when he arrived at the Kennedy Center, it was \"paying a bloated staff with our future debt reserves account,\" but \"today, and for the first time in decades, we have a balanced budget at the Kennedy Center.\"",
      "Grenell also denied the center has \"cancelled shows,\" but instead said that he has \"installed a break-even policy for programming\" and rentals. Grenell said that if ticket sales won't cover a program, it won't be confirmed unless the cost shortfall is covered by a sponsor or donor.",
      "Whitehouse, citing records his committee staff obtained about the center, accused the former acting director of national intelligence of using the center as a \"playground for the president of the United States and his allies\" and requested a slew of records from Grenell regarding the Kennedy Center's financial management.",
      "Whitehouse is the top Democrat on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, which has oversight responsibility for the Kennedy Center and authorizes its federal funding. Since Democrats are in the minority in the Senate, Whitehouse is only able to request information from Grenell. Only Republicans have subpoena power. It remains to be seen whether Grenell will provide any more information to Whitehouse, beyond his social media post.",
      "He asked for material on the Kennedy Center's financial management and ethics, a description of the process for selecting contractors and consultants, reimbursement policies, and information about audit protocols.",
      "Rental fee for FIFA?",
      "Whitehouse, in his letter, accused the Kennedy Center of offering FIFA \"free and exclusive use of the Kennedy Center.\"",
      "The Washington Post previously reported the center in August had waived a rental fee in the range of $5 million for FIFA, which will be using the Kennedy Center from Nov. 24 through Dec. 12 to host its 2026 World Cup draw. The Post noted that it wouldn't be the first time that a venue waived a rental fee for the draw, but it would be unusual for the Kennedy Center, since it usually has a crowded schedule at that time of year.",
      "Grenell said that FIFA \"has given us several million dollars, in addition to paying all of the expenses for this event in lieu of a rental fee.\"",
      "On Friday, the Kennedy Center told the Associated Press that it would be paid $7.4 million to host the FIFA draw, including a $2.4 million donation from the World Cup organizer and another $5 million in sponsorship opportunities.",
      "Contracts offered \"for your personal friends?\"",
      "Whitehouse also accused Grenell of offering \"contracts for your personal friends,\" and asked him for information about expenditures or contracts that have benefited people personally associated with Mr. Trump or with Kennedy Center leadership. He also asked Grenell to provide a justification for each contract.",
      "Grenell mentioned three people in his response, though he did not specifically say that he was responding to this question: Jeff Halperin, who was hired for multimedia work and whose work Grenell praised; a fundraiser named Lisa Dale, credited by Grenell with raising over $117 million; and an editor, researcher and writer who was a colleague of Grenell's when he was the ambassador to Germany in Mr. Trump's first administration. Grenell did not name the former colleague, but he said that the cost of his work curating an exhibit was completely covered by a donor.",
      "$10,000 spent on food and beverage for personal use?",
      "Whitehouse also accused Grenell of spending more than $10,000 over several months on \"private lunches, dinners and alcohol purchases unrelated to fundraising or development purposes,\" including on \"champagne service.\"",
      "Grenell said that all of the food and beverage costs Whitehouse cited were \"for donor-based events.\" He said fundraising expenses last year were much higher \u2014 $9.3 million.",
      "$27,000 for Watergate Hotel stays for new hires, associates?",
      "Whitehouse also said Grenell charged the center over $27,000 between April and July for \"new hires and your associates\" at the Watergate Hotel.",
      "Grenell, replied that it's \"customary\" for new employees to stay at the Watergate Hotel, which is next door to the Kennedy Center, and he countered that Watergate Hotel expenses for 2024 were much higher, totaling $878,000.",
      "The Kennedy Center receives government funding in addition to private funding. Federal funding goes to operations, security, maintenance and capital repairs. It received over $40 million in federal funds last year.",
      "The Trump administration became involved in the center's leadership earlier this year, and multiple Trump allies, including Grenell, were appointed to its board by Mr. Trump.",
      "Next month, Mr. Trump will host the Kennedy Center Honors \u2014 which recognize performing art professionals for their lifetime achievements \u2014 airing on CBS.",

      "The distinction between H5N5 and H5N1 lies in a protein involved in releasing the virus from an infected cell and promoting spread to surrounding cells.",
      "Bird flu has been detected in a variety of bird populations since January 2022, and in March of last year, it was found in dairy cows for the first time.",

      "Scott Smith, an attorney representing Thomas Hudson, the father of the 16-year-old, said that while \"we don't really want to\" put the boy in the middle of an ongoing custody dispute, \"I may have to call him\" to testify about the circumstances surrounding his stepsister's death.",

      "The testimony would be given as part of a child custody dispute between Thomas Hudson and Shauntel Hudson, the stepmother of 18-year-old Anna Kepner. Kepner's body was found under a bed on a Carnival cruise ship earlier this month by a housekeeper, according to two sources familiar with the matter.",

      "The new document, a Motion for Non-Dissemination Order, was filed by an attorney for the 16-year-old's mother. It is a request that the family court proceedings be closed to the press and for documents related to the custody battle remain under seal.",
      "Thomas Hudson and Shauntel Hudson have been in a custody dispute over three of their children, including the 16-year-old. Testimony from the 16-year-old could shed light on what happened to Kepner, and could also help bolster Thomas Hudson's custody claim against his ex-wife, Shauntel Hudson.",
      "The 16-year-old is being investigated for possible involvement in Kepner's death, a law enforcement source and a person familiar with the matter recently told CBS News. Kepner's family also believes he is a suspect in an FBI investigation into her death, according to court filings that refer to him as \"T.H.\"",

Kepner had been staying in the same room as her stepbrother and one other stepsibling.",

    "story": [
      "Abortion is again illegal in North Dakota after the state's Supreme Court on Friday couldn't muster the required majority to uphold a judge's ruling that struck down the state's ban last year.",
      "The 2023 law makes it a felony crime for anyone to perform an abortion, though it specifically protects patients from prosecution. Doctors could be prosecuted and penalized by as much as five years in prison and a $10,000 fine.",
      "Three justices agreed that the ban is unconstitutionally vague under the state constitution. The other two justices said the law is not unconstitutional.",
      "The state constitution requires at least four of the five justices to agree for a law to be found unconstitutional, a high bar. Not enough members of the court joined together to affirm the lower court ruling.",
      "In his opinion, Justice Jerod Tufte said the natural rights guaranteed by the state constitution in 1889 do not extend to abortion rights. He also said the law \"provides adequate and fair warning to those attempting to comply.\"",
      "North Dakota Republican Attorney Drew Wrigley welcomed the ruling, saying, \"The Supreme Court has upheld this important pro-life legislation, enacted by the people's Legislature. The Attorney General's office has the solemn responsibility of defending the laws of North Dakota, and today those laws have been upheld.\"",
      "Republican state Sen. Janne Myrdal, who introduced the 2023 legislation that became the law banning abortion, said she is \"thrilled and grateful that two justices that are highly respected saw the truth of the matter, that this is fully constitutional for the mother and for the unborn child and thereafter for that sake.\"",
      "Attorneys for the challengers did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The ruling means access to abortion in North Dakota will be outlawed. Even after a judge had earlier struck down the ban last year, the only scenarios for a patient to obtain an abortion in North Dakota had been for life- or health-preserving reasons in a hospital.",
      "The only abortion provider relocated in 2022 from Fargo to nearby Moorhead, Minnesota.",
      "Justice Daniel Crothers, one of the three judges to vote against the ban, wrote that the district court decision wasn't wrong.",
      "\"The vagueness in the law relates to when an abortion can be performed to preserve the life and health of the mother,\" Crothers wrote. \"After striking this invalid provision, the remaining portions of the law would be inoperable.\"",
      "North Dakota's newly confirmed ban prohibits the performance of an abortion as a felony crime. The only exceptions are for rape or incest in the first six weeks \u2014 before many women know they are pregnant \u2014 and to prevent the mother's death or a \"serious health risk\" to her.",
      "North Dakota joins 12 other states enforcing bans on abortion at all stages of pregnancy. Another four bar it at or around six weeks gestational age.",
      "Judge Bruce Romanick had struck down the ban the state Legislature passed in 2023, less than a year after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and opened the door to the state-level bans, largely turning the abortion battle to state courts and legislatures.",
      "The Red River Women's Clinic \u2014 the formerly sole abortion clinic in North Dakota \u2014 and several physicians challenged the law. The state appealed the 2024 ruling that overturned the ban.",
      "The judge and the Supreme Court each denied requests by the state to keep the abortion ban in effect during the appeal.

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/coast-guard-guidance-nooses-swastikas-hate-symbols/",
    "published": "Fri, 21 Nov 2025 18:25:53 -0500",
    "summary": "A Coast Guard personnel directive updated language identifying symbols of racial or religious hatred, setting off a political firestorm this week.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. Coast Guard is scrambling to clarify proposed internal policy changes that appeared to loosen how the service branch handles the conduct within its ranks involving hate symbols including nooses, swastikas, and other extremist symbols \u2014 touching off a political firestorm inside the nation's smallest military branch after the Space Force.",
      "The controversy centers on a little-noticed personnel directive signed on Nov. 13 by Rear Admiral Charles Fosse, the assistant commandant for personnel, following a report by the Washington Post. The document, titled \"Harassing Behavior Prevention, Response and Accountability,\" contained a provision that proposed replacing longstanding language that explicitly identified swastikas, nooses, Confederate iconography and other symbols of racial or religious hatred as \"incidents of hatred and prejudice.\"",
      "Instead, the Coast Guard's new policy recast those same images as \"potentially divisive,\" a subtle but consequential shift that alarmed lawmakers and civil rights groups when it was first reported this week.",
      "What did the original policy actually change?",
      "The internal guidance that ignited the controversy introduced a few changes. The Coast Guard eliminated the term \"hate incident.\" Instead, conduct previously handled under that category was referred to as harassment \u2014 and only when a specific victim could be identified.",
      "The guidance also raised the threshold for disciplinary action by specifying that public displays of extremist symbols would constitute misconduct only if they could be shown to harm \"good order and discipline, unit cohesion, command climate, morale or mission effectiveness.\"",
      "Further, the policy also allowed symbols \"widely identified with oppression or hatred\" to be displayed in private or non-public settings, including military housing. The policy removed gender identity from the list of protected characteristics altogether, aligning the Coast Guard with Mr. Trump's January executive order barring transgender service.",
      "It also required that harassment be \"severe or pervasive\" and judged by a \"reasonable person.\" And it went out of its way to note that hazing \u2014 even when it involves physical force \u2014 can serve \"a proper military or other governmental purpose,\" a framing that echoes Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's push to cultivate a tougher \"warrior ethos.\"",
      "What was the response?",
      "For years, Coast Guard policy has drawn a bright line on extremist symbols, stating unequivocally that items like nooses and swastikas \"have no place in the Coast Guard.\" The discovery that the service intended to downgrade them to \"potentially divisive\" immediately raised alarms on Capitol Hill.",
      "Democratic Rep. Lauren Underwood of Illinois said she met with the Coast Guard's acting commandant, Adm. Kevin Lunday, to express her concerns and was reassured that the policy would be clarified.",
      "\"He came by the office and assured us that there is an across-the-board prohibition on hate symbols, including swastikas and nooses,\" Underwood remarked in a video statement.",
      "Democratic Rep. Rick Larsen of Washington said in a statement, Thursday, that \"lynching is a federal hate crime. The world defeated the Nazis in 1945. The debate on these symbols is over.\" He added, \"Coast Guard: be better.\"",
      "By removing the \"hate incident\" designation, the Coast Guard appeared to create a narrower pathway for removing racist or extremist imagery from operational facilities, barracks and other training environments. Its new timeline for reporting \u2014 requiring victims to come forward within 45 days \u2014 also raised eyebrows over concerns it might deter reporting and make enforcement harder.",
      "In January, President Trump abruptly removed Adm. Linda Fagan as commandant just a day after taking office, placing Coast Guard leadership under scrutiny.",
      "What is the Coast Guard saying now?",
      "In response to the uproar, Lunday issued a forceful statement just hours after the policy became public, asserting that \"any display, use or promotion of symbols like nooses and swastikas will be thoroughly investigated and severely punished.\"",
      "Later that night, the service released an additional memo declaring that \"divisive or hate symbols and flags are prohibited\" at Coast Guard workplaces \u2014 an even firmer posture. The Coast Guard insisted the new memo was not a reversal but rather a clarification meant to counter \"misinformation\" and reaffirm the service's longstanding stance against extremist imagery.",
      "Still, leadership has not explained why earlier guidance explicitly permitted private displays or eliminated the \"hate incident\" language altogether.",
      "How do harassment cases work under the new framework?",
      "Even with the late clarifications, the underlying mechanics of the directive remain changed in significant ways. Because the term \"hate incident\" has been retired, displays of extremist symbols are not automatically categorized as harassment, and commanders will have to determine whether a specific victim exists and whether the conduct meets the now higher bar of being \"severe or pervasive.\"",
      "Investigations and punishment will use a \"preponderance of the evidence\" standard \u2014 higher than before \u2014 and leaders evaluating an incident must consider how a hypothetical \"reasonable person\" would interpret any alleged misconduct.",
      "The directive does reinforce that any public displays of the Confederate battle flag remain prohibited, except in rare instances of historical or artistic contexts. And although victims have 45 days to file a harassment report, commanders must notify their chain of command within 48 hours if an incident sparks potential interest from the media or Congress.",
      "The Coast Guard occupies a unique middle ground \u2014 subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice but operating under the Department of Homeland Security rather than the Defense Department. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has been outspoken in his intent to roll back what he views as \"woke\" personnel policies, including diversity initiatives and certain extremism-prevention measures.",

    "summary": "The new dummy, known as THOR-05F, contains female-specific proportions, according\u200b to the Transportation Department.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. Department of Transportation introduced a new female crash dummy as it seeks to step up safety for women, who face a higher injury risk in car crashes than men.",
      "The U.S. government has used a dummy model for decades that is based almost entirely on male proportions.",
      "The new dummy, known as THOR-05F, is more human-like and contains female-specific proportions, according to the Transportation Department. The new model could potentially replace the Hybrid III dummy, which has previously been utilized for crash testing.",
      "\"Advances in technology now make it possible to more accurately account for the biological differences between male and female anatomy in crash testing,\" the Department of Transportation said in a statement Thursday.",
      "Women are 73% more likely to be injured in a head-on crash, and they are 17% more likely to be killed in a car crash, than men.",
      "Transportation officials will consider using the new dummy in the government's vehicle crash test five-star ratings once a final rule is adopted, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said Thursday in a news release.",
      "The department also noted that THOR-05F will be available to manufacturers to build models and to the automotive industry, which can begin testing the model in their vehicles.",
      "The road to THOR-05F",
      "The standard crash test dummy used in the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration five-star vehicle testing was developed in 1978 and was modeled after a 5-foot-9 (175-centimeter), 171-pound (78-kilogram) man.",
      "The female dummy is smaller and has a rubber jacket to represent breasts. It's routinely tested in the passenger or back seat but seldom in the driver's seat, even though the majority of licensed drivers are women.",
      "But the change is not guaranteed to happen. Some American automakers have been skeptical and a group representing auto insurers has already said it thinks the current crash test dummies are fine.",
      "The new female dummy endorsed by the department more accurately reflects differences between men and women, including the shape of the neck, collarbone, pelvis, and legs. It's outfitted with more than 150 sensors, the department said.",
      "Maria Weston Kuhn, a law student at New York University, started lobbying members of Congress to pass a law requiring the new female dummy after surviving a 2019 crash in Ireland in which her seat belt slid off her hips and ruptured her intestines. She welcomed Duffy's support but said she won't celebrate until NHTSA incorporates the new model into its testing \u2014 a step that has been delayed numerous times.",
      "\"I fear that with this announcement everybody will throw up their hands and say we've won,\" Kuhn said Friday. \"But we are far from crossing the finish line.\"",
      "Some American automakers have been skeptical, arguing the new model may exaggerate injury risks and undercut the value of some safety features such as seat belts and airbags.",
      "Despite Duffy's announcement, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, a research arm funded by auto insurers, continues to advocate for the current line of dummies used to represent women and has seen dramatic improvements in safety as a result, spokesperson Joe Young said.",
      "\"Certainly, we are going to continue to monitor the new tools and perhaps do some additional research,\" Young said. \"But for now, our researchers are content and confident that the dummies we're using are doing a good job.\"",
      "Lawmakers and transportation secretaries from the past two presidential administrations have expressed support for new crash test rules and safety requirements, but developments have been slow.",
      "U.S. Sens. Deb Fischer, a Republican from Nebraska, and Tammy Duckworth, a Democrat from Illinois, both released statements welcoming the female crash test dummy announcement.",
      "\"Any progress here is good because there's simply no good reason why women are more likely to be injured or die in car crashes,\" Duckworth said.",
      "Fischer introduced legislation, the She Drives Act, that would require the most advanced testing devices available, including a female crash test dummy. Duckworth is a co-sponsor.",
      "\"It's far past time to make these testing standards permanent, which will help save thousands of lives and make America's roads safer for all drivers,\" Fischer said.",

    "story": [
      "Bitcoin continued to slide on Friday, extending a weeks-long slump that has wiped out nearly $800 billion in value since the cryptocurrency hit its 2025 peak last month. The downturn has stripped away all of bitcoin's gains this year \u2014 and raised questions about where it might go from here.",
      "Since closing at almost $125,000 on Oct. 6, its highest price this year, bitcoin has shed about one-third of its value. On Friday, bitcoin sank below $82,000 before rebounding slightly to $83,509 before noon EDT, according to CoinGecko, a cryptocurrency data aggregator.",
      "The cryptocurrency, which is trading at its lowest level since April, is now on track for its worst monthly performance since 2022, when a spate of corporate collapses sparked turbulence in the crypto sector, Bloomberg\u00a0reported\u00a0Friday.",
      "The precipitous drop comes as Wall Street grapples with unease over whether there's a bubble in artificial technology and tech stocks, prompting a shift away from assets that are viewed as carrying more risk, analysts say. Investors are also cautious given signs of weakness in the labor market, and the outlook for the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision next month, with more economists now expecting the Fed to hold off on cutting rates.",
      "\"The future is uncertain. It almost feels like it's moving back to the question: do I even want to hold [bitcoin] in this environment?\" said Thomas Chen, the CEO of cryptocurrency company Function, in an email.",
      "Why is Bitcoin falling?",
      "Concerns about an AI bubble can translate into turbulence for cryptocurrencies because tech stocks tend to move in tandem with bitcoin, experts noted.",
      "\"When tech sneezes, it's natural to expect Bitcoin to catch a cold,\" noted Nic Puckrin, investment analyst and co-founder of The Coin Bureau, in an email.",
      "Aside from pulling back from riskier assets, some investors may be selling bitcoin to cover margin calls. Coinbase, for example, now offers \"perpetual futures,\" a product that lets traders use up to 10-to-1 leverage on bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.",
      "Leveraged positions can force investors to sell because borrowing amplifies every price move \u2014 for both gains and losses. Even a small drop in the underlying asset can lead to an outsized loss on a leveraged trade. But if an asset tumbles and the investor can't meet the margin requirements, the trading platform may automatically liquidate the position, which leads to more selling and downward pressure on its price.",
      "\"When traders borrow heavily to magnify positions, any reversal triggers liquidations that accelerate the move,\" Nigel Green, CEO of deVere Group, a financial advisory organization, said in an email.",
      "Large declines in bitcoin's price aren't unusual, and the cryptocurrency has always rebounded, experts noted.",
      "Brian Vieten, a research analyst at Siebert Financial, said in a Tuesday email that bitcoin has historically experienced around five corrections of 20-30% or more during bull markets, adding that the issues may represent \"temporary headwinds\" as some investors could view lower crypto prices as a buying opportunity.",

    "summary": "The agency's \"Golden Age of Travel\" campaign aims to restore civility to air travel. Experts say they have doubts.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. Department of Transportation on Wednesday unveiled a campaign aimed at bringing more civility to air travel, urging Americans to dress \"with respect\" and remember simple courtesies like saying \"please\" and \"thank you\" to flight attendants. Travel experts say they're skeptical it will make much difference.",
      "The new plan \u2014 called \"The Golden Age of Travel Starts With You\"\u00a0\u2014 is meant to \"jumpstart a nationwide conversation around how we can all restore courtesy and class to air travel,\" the agency said.",
      "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy is rolling out the civility campaign in part as a response to what the agency called a record rise in unruly passenger incidents, including altercations with other travelers and airline staff. The issue isn't new, with U.S. Federal Aviation Administration data showing that incidents with unruly passengers peaked in 2021, although reports remain roughly double their pre-pandemic level.",
      "The Transportation Department didn't define what it meant by \"dressing with respect.\" In a Wednesday social media post, Duffy wrote, \"Dress up to go to the airport, help a stranger out, and be in a good mood.\"",
      "Duffy said he's encouraging air travelers to ask themselves the following five questions to ensure civility:",
      "Are you helping a pregnant woman or the elderly with placing their bags in the overhead bin?Are you dressing with respect?Are you keeping control of your children and helping them through the airport?Are you saying thank you to your flight attendants?Are you saying please and thank you in general?",
      "Are you helping a pregnant woman or the elderly with placing their bags in the overhead bin?",
      "Are you dressing with respect?",
      "Are you keeping control of your children and helping them through the airport?",
      "Are you saying thank you to your flight attendants?",
      "Are you saying please and thank you in general?",
      "Can dressing better improve economy class?",
      "Travel experts are skeptical that the Transportation Department's call to dress up for the airport will result in meaningful changes. Most travelers now prize comfort over formality, especially given the typically tight seating in economy and the likelihood of delays.",
      "In response to Duffy's social media post, some users chimed in with their own ideas \u2014 from widening cramped economy seats to making security checkpoints friendlier for travelers. While some agreed that a little more civility would be welcome, others noted that comfortable clothes make flying more tolerable in such tight quarters.",
      "A few decades ago, when Americans typically dressed up to fly, the travel experience looked a whole lot different.",
      "\"Economy class was actually nice. Now, everyone is wedged together on planes,\" Chris Elliott, a travel expert and consumer advocate, told CBS News.",
      "Sarah Silbert, a strategist at the flight search engine Points Path, said the clothing guideline isn't enforceable and isn't likely to shift traveler behavior.",
      "\"It's more of a soft nudge about travel etiquette,\" she told CBS News. \"Given how cramped and stressful flying can be for most people now, it's easy to see why a message about 'dressing up' will draw pushback.\"",
      "Travelers' interpretations may also vary significantly, experts added.",
      "\"Do I imagine anyone would be able to agree on what the dress code is? No,\" Daniel Green, co-founder of Faye Travel Insurance, told CBS News. He added that he doesn't think there should be a dress code for travelers, either.",
      "\"At the end of the day, I think this is just a well-intentioned messaging campaign about behaving well in public that will likely have no practical or tangible implications for people,\" he said.",
      "Changes in air travel",
      "The rise in unruly passengers stems from several issues, including alcohol, drugs and mental health issues, as well as stress from dealing with crowded airports and problems like flight delays, according to Transport Security International, a travel publication.",
      "Scott Keyes, founder of the flight-deals site Going.com, noted that the \"golden age of travel\" was hardly golden for most Americans. Airfare was so expensive that flying was largely limited to the wealthy. Because flying is more affordable today, air travel has become a more democratized experience, he added.",
      "\"Many more people are traveling today. You see people from all walks of life getting on planes, and this campaign harkens back to a time when air travel was only for the elite,\" he told CBS News.",
      "He also objects to the notion that the \"golden age\" of flying provided a better passenger experience than today's flights.",
      "\"There are many ways in which it was an objectively worse experience. The flights took longer, they didn't have Wi-Fi, and there was cigarette smoke wafting through cabins,\" he said.",
      "Even so, he said he doubts the Transportation Department's civility push will inspire anyone to start dressing to the nines.",
      "\"If you think it's a good thing that most of society today can afford to buy tickets and travel, then you have to accept that people are going to behave how they're going to behave,\" Keyes said. \"I don't think I would want to live in a society that had dress recommendations to be on an airplane.\"",

      "Amazon has started issuing payments to eligible Prime members as part of a $2.5 billion settlement over federal allegations that it misled customers.",
      "The online retailer\u00a0agreed to the payouts in September\u00a0to resolve a 2023 Federal Trade Commission\u00a0lawsuit that accused Amazon of misleading customers into enrolling in Prime and making it hard for them to cancel their membership.",
      "Under the settlement, Amazon agreed to offer $1.5 billion in refunds to customers. However, the e-commerce company neither admitted nor denied the FTC's allegations. In a\u00a0statement\u00a0at the time, the company said that \"Amazon and our executives have always followed the law.\"",
      "Here's what to know about the Amazon refund, including how to determine if you qualify for the payment.",

      "Amazon is issuing settlement refunds to eligible Prime Members, starting with automatic payments issued between Nov. 12 and Dec. 24 (see below for more details on how payments are being made).",
      "\"Our settlement required Amazon to pay those people who clearly qualify without them having to do anything,\" Christopher Bissex, deputy director of public affairs at the FTC, told CBS News. \"So those people are getting the automatic payments.\"",

      "How do I know if I qualify?",
      "Only customers who signed up for Amazon Prime between June 23, 2019, and June 23, 2025, are eligible to receive a refund.",
      "Customers qualify for an automatic payment if they signed up for Prime or unsuccessfully tried to cancel their membership through Amazon's \"challenged enrollment flow,\" defined as \"any version of the Universal Prime Decision Page, the Shipping Option Select Page, Prime Video enrollment flow, or the Single Page Checkout,\" according to a September\u00a0court order.",
      "The FTC also said these customers must have used no more than three \"Amazon Prime Benefits\" in a 12-month period.",
      "How do I get my payment?",
      "Eligible customers will get a refund by PayPal or Venmo, which they must accept within 15 days, according to the FTC. Those who prefer a check should ignore the PayPal or Venmo refund.",

    "story": [
      "Los Angeles \u2014 A vintage blue VW bus that became an unlikely symbol of resilience after it survived a California wildfire made its public debut this week, shiny and like-new after Volkswagen spent months restoring the damaged vehicle.",
      "The bus went viral in January when an Associated Press photographer captured it looking surprisingly unharmed by the deadly Palisades Fire, a spot of blue and white dwarfed by the charred remains of a Malibu neighborhood. Volkswagen saw the accompanying AP story and reached out to the owner, Megan Weinraub. Upon closer inspection, VW technicians discovered that while the bus had survived, it had smoke damage and blistered paint, rust and a window busted by the heat.",
      "In its restoration, the 1977 Type 2 Microbus named Azul - Spanish for the color blue - again brought people together as technicians consulted the broader community of VW enthusiasts in a shared mission to revive what was a quirky middle-aged vehicle.",
      "\"It melted and Volkswagen saved it,\" Weinraub said Thursday at the LA Auto Show, standing with the bus's previous owner, Preston Martin. \"It was a giant relief because it wasn't my first priority with everything going on.\"",
      "While Weinraub calls the microbus \"Azul,\" it became known as the \"Magic bus\" on social media, CBS News Los Angeles points out.",
      "\"I was lucky and grateful to have the opportunity for them to restore it because I wouldn't have been able to restore it myself,\" she told the station.",
      "Weintraub and Martin still can't believe the bus they wrote off as a goner is now ready to take them on another surfing adventure. The last time they saw the pre-burned Azul was two days before the Palisades Fire broke out, when they parked the bus near Weinraub's apartment after surfing.",
      "Mark J. Terrill, the AP photographer who captured the original image, was on hand when Weinraub and Martin saw the bus for the first time after its restoration in late October.",
      "Volkswagen hauled the microbus to its Oxnard facility west of Los Angeles where it houses historic VW vehicles. Vehicle technicians Farlan Robertson and Gunnar Wynarski sourced hard-to-find parts, got creative and reached out to a lot of people.",
      "\"At the bottom of it it was to try to take the vehicle that everyone else saw and do what we could to improve upon it, but not change it,\" said Robertson, \"to actually have it come out and be the revived, resurrected vehicle returned to its former glory.\"",

    "story": [
      "A 1940 self-portrait by famed Mexican artist Frida Kahlo sold Thursday for $54.7 million at a New York art auction, becoming the top sale price for a work by any female artist.",
      "The painting of Kahlo asleep in a bed \u2014 titled \"El sue\u00f1o (La cama)\" or in English, \"The Dream (The Bed)\" \u2014 surpassed the record held by Georgia O'Keeffe's \"Jimson Weed/White Flower No. 1,\" which sold for $44.4 million in 2014.",
      "The sale at Sotheby's also topped Kahlo's own auction record for a work by a Latin American artist. The 1949 painting \"Diego and I,\" depicting the artist and her husband, muralist Diego Rivera, went for $34.9 million in 2021. Her paintings are reported to have sold privately for even more.",
      "Thursday's auction for the painting drew bids from two collectors over 5 minutes before selling \u2014 at more than 1,000 times the price it sold for 45 years ago, according to Sotheby's.",
      "\"When this painting sold at Sotheby's in 1980 for $51,000, few could have imagined it returning 45 years later to command $55 million. This record-breaking result shows just how far we have come, not only in our appreciation of Frida Kahlo's genius, but in the recognition of women artists at the very highest level of the market,\" Anna Di Stasi, head of Latin American art at Sotheby's, said in a news release. \"In El sue\u00f1o, Kahlo confronts her own fragility, yet what emerges is a portrait of extraordinary resilience and strength. It is an enduring testament to one of the most admired and sought-after artists of our time.\"",
      "The self-portrait is among the few Kahlo pieces that have remained in private hands outside Mexico, where her body of work has been declared an artistic monument. Her works in both public and private collections within the country cannot be sold abroad or destroyed.",
      "The painting comes from a private collection, whose owner has not been disclosed, and is legally eligible for international sale. Some art historians have scrutinized the sale for cultural reasons, while others have raised concern that the painting \u2014 last exhibited publicly in the late 1990s \u2014 could again disappear from public view after the auction. It has already been requested for upcoming exhibitions in cities including New York, London and Brussels.",
      "The buyer's identity was not disclosed.",
      "The piece depicts Kahlo asleep in a wooden, colonial-style bed that floats in the clouds. She is draped in a golden blanket and entangled in crawling vines and leaves. Above the bed lies a skeleton figure wrapped in dynamite.",
      "Kahlo vibrantly and unsparingly depicted herself and events from her life, which was upended by a bus accident at 18. She started to paint while bedridden, underwent a series of painful surgeries on her damaged spine and pelvis, then wore casts until her death in 1954 at age 47.",
      "During the years Kahlo was confined to her bed, she came to view it as a bridge between worlds as she explored her mortality.",
      "The painting was the star of a sale of more than 100 surrealist works by artists including Salvador Dal\u00ed, Ren\u00e9 Magritte, Max Ernst and Dorothea Tanning.",
      "Kahlo resisted being labeled a surrealist, a style of art that's dreamlike and centers on a fascination with the unconscious mind.",
      "\"I never painted dreams,\" she once said. \"I painted my own reality.\"",
      "In its catalog note, Sotheby's said the painting \"offers a spectral meditation on the porous boundary between sleep and death.\"",
      "\"The suspended skeleton is often interpreted as a visualization of her anxiety about dying in her sleep, a fear all too plausible for an artist whose daily existence was shaped by chronic pain and past trauma,\" the catalog notes.",

    "story": [
      "Target on Wednesday\u00a0said it's working with OpenAI to let customers shop its products through ChatGPT, a move that comes as the retailer is struggling to convince inflation-weary consumers to stick with it.",
      "Customers will be able to browse Target's selection and make purchases within the ChatGPT app, according to the retailer. The tool will debut next week, providing access to ChatGPT's 800 million weekly active users in time for the holiday shopping season.",
      "Target is leaning on price cuts and a $1 billion investment plan to revive its brand, the retailer said separately Wednesday, as same-store sales fell 2.7% in the latest quarter and profit tumbled 19%. With shoppers increasingly relying on AI to find products online, other big retailers \u2014 including Walmart, which struck a similar partnership with OpenAI last month \u2014 are turning to the technology to boost sales.",
      "Here's how the ChatGPT-powered Target tool will work: Inside the ChatGPT app, consumers can tag Target and ask for ideas, such as if they're planning something like a holiday family movie night. The Target app will then suggest specific products, such as blankets or snacks, and allow users to buy them directly without leaving the ChatGPT interface.",
      "Target said that AI will eventually start to understand and predict what customers want to buy.",
      "A recent Harris Poll\u00a0shows that nearly half of Gen Z consumers would trust AI as a personal shopper that helps them pick out what they buy and find deals. Streamlining the purchasing process could help retailers boost sales, according to retail experts.",

      "Brazil's federal police arrested former President Jair Bolsonaro preemptively on Saturday, days before he was set to begin his 27-year prison sentence for leading a coup attempt, officials said.",
      "A close aide said the embattled former leader was taken to the police force headquarters in the capital, Brasilia, from his house arrest.",
      "The force said in a short statement, which did not name Bolsonaro, that it acted on the request of Brazil's Supreme Court.",
      "Neither Brazil's federal police nor the Supreme Court provided more details.",
      "Bolsonaro's aide Andriely Cirino confirmed to The Associated Press that the arrest took place around 6 a.m. on Saturday.",
      "The 70-year-old former president was taken from his house in a gated community in the upscale Jardim Botanico neighborhood to the federal police headquarters, Cirino said.",
      "Bolsonaro was placed under house arrest in early August, weeks before he was convicted in his coup trial. His lawyers were pleading with Brazil's Supreme Court to keep him at home to serve his sentence, citing his poor health.",
      "Like most of his colleagues, Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes, who oversaw the coup case, rarely carries out decisions on Saturdays, unless there are security risks involved.",
      "Local media reported that Bolsonaro, who was Brazil's president from 2019 to 2022, was expected to begin serving his sentence sometime next week after the far-right leader exhausted all appeals of his conviction for leading a coup attempt.",
      "Saturday's preemptive arrest does not mean Bolsonaro will remain at the federal police headquarters to serve his sentence. Brazilian law requires that all convicts start their sentences in prison.",
      "One of the former president's sons, Sen. Fl\u00e1vio Bolsonaro, has been egging on supporters to take to the streets in defense of his father since Thursday.",
      "Some of Bolsonaro's supporters, who claim he is being politically persecuted, are expected to rally outside the federal police headquarters throughout the weekend.",
      "The former president and several of his allies were convicted by a panel of Supreme Court justices for attempting to overthrow Brazil's democracy following his 2022 election loss to President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva. Prosecutors said the coup plot included plans to kill Lula and to encourage an insurrection in early 2023.",
      "Bolsonaro was also found guilty on charges of leading an armed criminal organization and attempting the violent abolition of the democratic rule of law. Bolsonaro has denied wrongdoing.",
      "He remains a key figure in Brazilian politics, despite being ineligible to run again at least until 2030, after a separate ruling by Brazil's top electoral court. Polls show he would be a strong candidate in next year's vote if allowed to run.",
      "Bolsonaro is an ally of President Trump, who has called his trial a \"witch hunt.\" Bolsonaro was mentioned in a July threat by the U.S. administration to\u00a0raise tariffs on several Brazilian exports by 50%. In late July, Mr. Trump followed through on that threat, raising tariffs by 40%, writing in a July 30 executive order that \"Members of the Government of Brazil are also politically persecuting a former President of Brazil.\"",
      "However, on Thursday, Mr. Trump signed an executive order removing tariffs on Brazilian beef, coffee and other goods.",
      "Mr. Trump cited \"various officials\" whom he said advised him that \"certain agricultural imports from Brazil should no longer be subject\" to the 40% tariff, in part because of progress the U.S. has made in its trade negotiations with Brazil.",
      "The order applies to Brazilian imports to the U.S. on or after Nov. 13, according to the order.",

      "The ministry released video of a sniffer dog reacting to the sacks and images of officers using an electronic device to test the contents. Officials said the seizure prevented the circulation of 35 million doses of cocaine valued at over $388 million.",
      "It was \"the largest seizure by the Colombian police in the last decade,\" said Petro, whose term ends in nine months.",
      "The operation was carried out -- \"without a single death,\" according to Petro -- in the southwestern port of Buenaventura, a strategic departure point for Colombian cocaine.",

      "In an\u00a0exclusive conversation\u00a0with CBS News in October, Petro claimed some of those killed by the U.S. strikes on alleged drug boats have been innocent civilians, and he reiterated his accusation that the attacks violate international law.",

    "story": [
      "The 28-point peace plan proposed by the U.S. for Ukraine is a basis that \"requires additional work,\" Western leaders gathered at the G20 summit in South Africa said.",
      "Group of Seven nations and European leaders met on the sidelines of the summit in Johannesburg\u00a0to discuss the U.S. peace plan for the war in Ukraine, now in its fourth year. The Trump administration boycotted the summit.",
      "\"The initial draft of the 28-point plan includes important elements that will be essential for a just and lasting peace,\" the leaders of the European Union, Germany, France, Britain, Canada, the Netherlands, Spain, Finland, Italy, Japan and Norway said in a joint statement. \"We believe, therefore, that the draft is a basis which will require additional work.\"",
      "The 28-point plan, sent to Kyiv and Moscow this week, includes a framework that would require Ukraine to give up its eastern Donbas region and Crimea, and swear off NATO membership, according to a draft shared publicly by a Ukrainian opposition politician and confirmed by a White House official.",
      "It contains many of Moscow's long-standing demands, while offering limited security guarantees to Kyiv.",
      "The plan sparked alarm in Kyiv and other European capitals, with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy saying Friday\u00a0that his country could face a stark choice between standing up for its sovereign rights and preserving the American support it needs.",
      "German Chancellor Friedrich Merz told reporters at the summit that \"wars cannot be ended by major powers over the heads of the countries affected,\" and insisted Kyiv needed robust guarantees.",
      "President Trump said he wants an answer from Zelenskyy on the plan by Thursday, which is Thanksgiving in the U.S., but says an extension is possible to finalize terms.",
      "On Saturday, Mr. Trump told reporters at the White House that the U.S peace plan is not his final offer for Ukraine.",
      "\"We'd like to get the peace... It should have happened a long time ago. The Ukraine war with Russia should have never happened,\" he said. \"If I were president, it never would have happened. We're trying to get it ended one way or the other. We have to get it ended.\"",
      "Ukrainian envoys will meet a U.S. delegation in Switzerland to discuss the proposal, a top official said Saturday, but European leaders warned against rushing a peace deal.",
      "In their statement on Saturday, Western leaders said they are \"clear on the principle that borders must not be changed by force.\"",
      "\"We are also concerned by the proposed limitations on Ukraine's armed forces, which would leave Ukraine vulnerable to future attack,\" the statement said.",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters on Friday that \"we have a plan\" to address the war, but Zelenskyy still needs to approve it. The president said of the Ukrainian leader: \"At some point, he's going to have to accept something.\"",
      "\"He'll have to like it, and if he doesn't like it, then they should just keep fighting, I guess,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin acknowledged on Friday that Russia had received the text of the 28-point plan \"through existing channels of communication with the U.S. administration.\"",
      "\"I believe it could too form the basis for a final peace settlement,\" he said. \"But this text is not being discussed with us in any substantive way. And I can assume why. I believe the reason is the same: the U.S. administration has so far been unable to secure the consent of the Ukrainian side. Ukraine is against it.\"",
      "Zelenskyy struck a defiant note on Saturday as the country commemorated the \"great famine\" that Soviet leader Josef Stalin imposed on Ukraine in the early 1930s, which led to millions of deaths.",

    "story": [
      "Some U.S. lawmakers criticized the Trump administration's proposed 28-point peace plan designed to end the Ukraine-Russia war on Saturday, saying the framework appears to favor Moscow.",
      "The deal would require Ukraine to give up its eastern Donbas region and Crimea, and swear off NATO membership, according to a draft shared publicly by a Ukrainian opposition politician and confirmed by a White House official. The plan includes feedback from Russian and Ukrainian officials, and diplomatic conversations about it are ongoing. President Trump gave Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy a suggested deadline of Thanksgiving Day to respond to the plan.",
      "Members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, including Democrat Jeanne Shaheen and Republican Thom Tillis, said in a statement on Saturday that they had \"significant concerns over the details of the reported peace plan.\"",
      "\"For over 10 years, Russia has illegally occupied Ukrainian territory and for almost 4 years, Ukraine has admirably defended itself against Russia's attempts to fully occupy Ukraine. No one wants a just and lasting peace more than the Ukrainian people,\" the committee members said in a statement. \"However, we will not achieve that lasting peace by offering Putin concession after concession and fatally degrading Ukraine's ability to defend itself.\"",
      "\"History teaches us that Putin only understands strength and will not abide by any agreement unless it is backed by force,\" the statement continued. \"We must consult closely with our Ukrainian and NATO partners on the path forward. We should put real pressure on Russia to come to the negotiating table. And we must make clear to the Kremlin\u2014and would-be aggressors in Beijing\u2014that America will stand unwaveringly in defense of freedom.\"",
      "Co-chairs of the bipartisan Congressional Ukraine Caucus also criticized the reported peace plan, saying it \"appears to favor the interest of the aggressor,\" Russian President Vladimir Putin, \"over the sovereignty and security of a democratic Ukraine.\"",
      "\"This framework does not offer a genuine path to lasting peace, but instead, demands the surrender and capitulation of Ukraine to Russian aggression,\" the caucus said in a statement shared on Saturday.",
      "The Trump administration's backing of the plan \"raises serious concerns,\" the caucus said.",
      "\"The international community must remain firm in supporting Ukraine, upholding the principles of territorial integrity and self-determination, and rejecting any plan that rewards an aggressor,\" the caucus said. \"Lasting peace comes not from conceding to aggression, but from the strength and unity of free nations that refuse to bow to it.\"",
      "European governments were not involved in drafting the proposal, according to European officials contacted by CBS News. Western leaders gathered at the G20 summit in South Africa said Saturday that the plan needs \"additional work.\"",
      "The plan emerged following recent meetings between the U.S. and officials from both Russia and Ukraine. Mr. Trump's envoy, Steve Witkoff, met with a key adviser to Russian President Vladimir Putin, Kirill Dmitriev, on Oct. 24 in Miami, to develop the plan, CBS News reported Thursday.",
      "Ukrainian envoys are set to meet with a U.S. delegation \u2014 including Secretary of the Army Dan Driscoll, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Witkoff \u2014 in Geneva, Switzerland, to discuss the proposal. Nine Ukrainian officials, including Zelenskyy's chief of staff, are set to take part in the talks, the Associated Press reported.",
      "Ukraine is commemorating its \"great famine\" on Saturday. The famine, imposed by Soviet leader Josef Stalin in the early 1930s, led to millions of deaths from starvation. In a video address, Zelenskyy addressed the country's ongoing fight.",
      "\"We defended, defend and will always defend Ukraine,\" Zelenskyy said. \"Because only here is our home. And in our home, Russia will definitely not be the master.\"",

    "published": "Sat, 22 Nov 2025 11:51:12 -0500",
    "summary": "South Africa promoted it as a victory for the first G20 summit to be held in Africa and its aim to put problems, especially affecting poor countries, at the top of the agenda.",
    "story": [
      "World leaders from\u00a0the Group of 20\u00a0rich and developing economies broke with tradition and adopted a declaration at the start of their summit in South Africa on Saturday despite opposition from the United States, which is\u00a0boycotting the two-day talks\u00a0in a diplomatic rift with the host country.",
      "Vincent Magwenya, the spokesperson for South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, said a leaders' declaration was adopted unanimously by the other members at the start of the talks in Johannesburg. Declarations are usually adopted at the end of G20 summits.",
      "The 122-point declaration urged more global action on issues that specifically affect poor countries, like climate-related disasters and sovereign debt levels, and was promoted by the host country as a victory for the first G20 summit to be held in Africa.",
      "The summit has been overshadowed by the U.S. boycott ordered by President Trump, and the U.S. had put pressure on South Africa not to adopt a leaders' declaration in the absence of an American delegation, South African officials said.",
      "South Africa's summit has an ambitious agenda to make progress on solving some of the long-standing problems that have afflicted the developing world, and leaders and top government officials came together at an exhibition center near the township of Soweto, which was once home to Nelson Mandela.",
      "Many of South Africa's priorities, especially a focus on climate change and confronting global inequality, have met resistance from the U.S. But as he opened the summit, Ramaphosa said that \"consensus has emerged.\"",
      "Then, in comments to leaders that were apparently mistakenly broadcast during what was meant to be the start of closed-door discussions, Ramaphosa could be heard saying leaders would move \"to adopt our declaration now.\"",
      "South Africa's foreign minister walked over and whispered in Ramaphosa's ear, and the South African leader said: \"OK. I'm told that the cameras are still on. They should be off.\"",
      "While Ramaphosa's spokesperson said the declaration was unanimous, Argentina said it did not endorse it. Argentine President Javier Milei also did not attend the summit in solidarity with ally Mr. Trump, and the country was represented by Foreign Minister Pablo Quirno.",
      "An ambitious agenda",
      "South Africa, which gets to set the agenda as the country holding the rotating G20 presidency, wants leaders to agree to more help for poor countries to recover from climate-related disasters, reduce their foreign debt burdens, transition to green energy sources and harness their own critical mineral wealth \u2014 all in an attempt to counter widening global inequality.",
      "\"We'll see,\" United Nations Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said on whether the G20 could prioritize developing world countries and make meaningful reforms. \"But I think South Africa has done its part in putting those things clearly upon the table.\"",
      "The summit will take place without the world's biggest economy after Mr. Trump boycotted over his claims that South Africa is pursuing racist anti-white policies and persecuting its Afrikaner white minority. The Trump administration has also made clear its opposition to South Africa's G20 agenda that focuses on climate change and inequality.",
      "Moving on from the U.S. boycott",
      "The months-long diplomatic rift between the U.S. and South Africa deepened in the buildup to the summit this weekend, but while Mr. Trump's boycott threatened to undercut the agenda, some of the leaders were eager to move on.",
      "\"I do regret it,\" French President Emmanuel Macron said of Mr. Trump's absence, \"but it should not block us. Our duty is to be present, engage and work all together because we have so many challenges.\"",
      "The G20 is actually a group of 21 members that comprises 19 nations, the European Union and the African Union.",
      "The bloc was formed in 1999 as a bridge between rich and poor nations to confront global financial crises. While it often operates in the shadow of\u00a0the Group of Seven\u00a0richest democracies, G20 members together represent around 85% of the world's economy, 75% of international trade and more than half the global population.",
      "But it works on consensus rather than any binding resolutions, and that is often hard to come by with the different interests of members like the U.S., Russia, China, India, Japan, the Western European nations France, Germany and the U.K., and others like Indonesia, Saudi Arabia and South Africa.",
      "G20 summits traditionally end with a leaders' declaration, which details any broad agreement reached by the members. South Africa said the U.S. was exerting pressure on it to tone down the final document to a unilateral statement from the host country.",
      "Ramaphosa responded to that earlier this week by saying, \"we will not be bullied.\"",
      "Even so, the direction of the G20 bloc is likely to change sharply given that the U.S. takes over the rotating presidency from South Africa at the end of this summit.",
      "The only role the U.S. will play at this summit, the White House said, will be when a representative from the United States Embassy in South Africa attends the formal handover ceremony.",
      "South Africa said it's an insult for Ramaphosa to hand over to a junior diplomatic official.",
      "\"We have communicated to the American government that the president will not be handing over to a junior official of the embassy,\" South African Foreign Ministry spokesperson Chrispin Phiri told The Associated Press, adding he didn't expect there would be a handover ceremony on Sunday.",

      "Armed men attacked a Catholic boarding school in northwestern region of Nigeria and abducted several schoolchildren and staff early Friday. It's the latest\u00a0in a spate of abductions in Africa's most populous country and came just days after 25 schoolgirls were kidnapped in a neighboring state. The latest abduction comes as the country is facing scrutiny from the Trump administration amid ongoing concern about violence against Christians in the West African nation.",
      "The attack and abductions took place at St. Mary's School in Niger State. Local officials did not immediately disclose the number of students and staff abducted, nor who might be responsible for the attack. Local Nigerian broadcaster Arise TV said 52 schoolchildren were taken.",
      "The Christian Association of Nigeria said Saturday that 303 children and 12 teachers were taken. Most. Rev. Bulus Dauwa Yohanna, chairman of the Niger state chapter of CAN, said the total was determined \"after a verification exercise and a final census was carried out.\"",
      "Nigerian police officials said the abductions took place in the early hours of Friday and that military and security forces have since been deployed to the community. They described St. Mary's as a secondary school that serves children between the ages of in 12 and 17.",
      "The secretary to the Niger state government, Abubakar Usman, said in a statement that the incident occurred despite prior intelligence warning of heightened threats.",
      "\"Regrettably, St. Mary's School proceeded to reopen and resume academic activities without notifying or seeking clearance from the State Government, thereby exposing pupils and the staff to avoidable risk,\" the statement said.",
      "The abductions took place days after gunmen on Monday attacked a high school and abducted 25 schoolgirls in the neighboring Kebbi state, in Maga, around 105 miles from Papiri. One of the girls later escaped and is safe, the school's principal said.",
      "Nigerian President Bola Tinubu earlier this week postponed his trip to this weekend's Group of 20 summit after promising to intensify rescue efforts.",

Their families, and the families of the kidnapped schoolgirls, are in my prayers,\" Tinubu said in a social media post Wednesday. \"I have directed the security agencies to act swiftly and bring the girls back to Kebbi State.\"",

      "\"If the Nigerian Government continues to allow the killing of Christians, the U.S.A. will immediately stop all aid and assistance to Nigeria, and may very well go into that now disgraced country, \"guns-a-blazing,\" to completely wipe out the Islamic Terrorists who are committing these horrible atrocities. I am hereby instructing our Department of War to prepare for possible action,\" Mr. Trump said in a Truth social post earlier this month.",

      "No group has claimed responsibility for the attacks in Niger and Kebbi states, but analysts and locals say gangs often target schools, travelers and remote villagers in kidnappings for ransom. Authorities say the gunmen are mostly former herders who have taken up arms against farming communities after clashes between them over strained resources.",

      "\"I've had a lot of deadlines, but if things are working well, you tend to extend the deadlines,\" Mr. Trump said in an interview on the Brian Kilmeade Show on Fox News Radio. \"But Thursday is it \u2014 we think an appropriate time.\"",
      "Later Friday, Mr. Trump told reporters \"we have a plan\" to address the Russia-Ukraine war, but Zelenskyy still needs to approve it. The president said of the Ukrainian leader, \"at some point he's going to have to accept something.\"",
      "\"He'll have to like it, and if he doesn't like it, then they should just keep fighting, I guess,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Among its provisions, the plan would require Ukraine to give up a large swath of its eastern territory, limit the size of its military, and be barred from ever joining NATO \u2014 points favorable to demands previously made by Russian President Vladimir Putin.",
      "Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Friday that the U.S. 28-point plan had not been discussed with Russia in detail.",
      "Putin, who appeared on camera on Friday, said Russia had received the text of the 28-point plan \"through existing channels of communication with the U.S. administration.\"",
      "\"I believe it could too form the basis for a final peace settlement,\" he said. \"But this text is not being discussed with us in any substantive way. And I can assume why. I believe the reason is the same: the U.S. administration has so far been unable to secure the consent of the Ukrainian side. Ukraine is against it.\"",
      "European Union ambassadors met with the Ukrainian ambassador in Washington Friday, according to multiple sources familiar with the matter. They discussed the current situation between Russia and Ukraine and recent events, including phone conversations between Zelenskyy and Vance, the Chancellor of Germany and Mr. Trump, as well as between European leaders.",
      "Army Secretary Dan Driscoll separately met with 31 ambassadors of European nations on Friday and discussed U.S. intentions, the urgency and momentum the U.S. has achieved, said Col. Dave Butler, a U.S. military spokesman. He took questions after giving a statement, Butler disclosed.",
      "Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, and war has raged there ever since.",
      "Some European governments were aware that the U.S. was working on a proposal, but were not involved in drafting it, European officials contacted by CBS News said. As of Thursday, officials said European governments had not been briefed on the plan's contents.",
      "\"We are working on the document prepared by the American side. This must be a plan that ensures a real and dignified peace,\" Zelenskyy said on social media Friday after his call with French President Emmanuel Macron, U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz.",
      "\"We are coordinating closely to make sure that the principled stances are taken into account,\" Zelenskyy said, adding that the leaders \"coordinated the next steps and agreed that our teams will work together at the corresponding levels.\"",
      "In a prior social media post late Thursday, Zelenskyy said he had spoken about the plan with a \"high-level delegation\" from the U.S.",
      "\"The American side presented its proposals \u2014 the points of a plan to end the war \u2014 their vision. From the first days of the war, we have upheld one very simple position: Ukraine needs peace. A real peace \u2014 one that will not be broken by a third invasion. A dignified peace \u2014 with terms that respect our independence, our sovereignty, and the dignity of the Ukrainian people. And it is exactly such terms that we must secure. I outlined our key principles. And we agreed that our teams will work on these proposals to ensure it's all genuine,\" Zelenskyy said.",
      "The Ukrainian leader said he expected to speak with President Trump in the coming days.",
      "\"We are fully aware that America's strength and America's support can truly bring peace closer, and we do not want to lose that,\" Zelenskyy said. \"We are also aware that Russia has no real desire for peace \u2014 otherwise they would not have started this war.\"",
      "A German government statement released Friday after the phone call between Zelenskyy, Macron, Starmer and Merz said the four European leaders \"welcomed the United States' efforts to end the war in Ukraine. In particular, they welcomed the commitment to Ukraine's sovereignty and the willingness to provide Ukraine with robust security guarantees.\"",
      "The German statement said the leaders \"pledged to continue pursuing the goal of safeguarding vital European and Ukrainian interests in the long term. This includes, among other things, ensuring that the Line of Contact serves as the starting point for any understanding and that the Ukrainian armed forces remain capable of effectively defending Ukraine's sovereignty.\"",
      "The leaders agreed that any plan affecting the EU, European countries or NATO \"requires the approval of European partners or a consensus among the allies,\" the German statement said.",

    "summary": "Trump administration officials have proposed a 28-point peace plan designed to end the Russia-Ukraine war \u2014 a framework that would require Ukraine to give up territory and swear off NATO membership.",
    "story": [
      "Trump administration officials have proposed a 28-point peace plan designed to end the Russia-Ukraine war\u00a0\u2014 a framework that would require Ukraine to give up its eastern Donbas region and Crimea, and swear off NATO membership, according to a draft shared publicly by a Ukrainian opposition politician and confirmed by a White House official.",
      "The 28-point plan is the most recent working document offered by the administration, reflecting feedback from Russian and Ukrainian officials, the White House official said. It still remains unclear whether both sides will agree to it; diplomatic conversations are ongoing and further changes are being negotiated, according to multiple sources.",
      "While some European governments were aware the U.S. was working on a proposal, they were not involved in drafting it,\u00a0according to European officials contacted by CBS News.",
      "The plan emerged following recent meetings between the U.S. and officials from both Russia and Ukraine. President Trump's envoy, Steve Witkoff, met with a key adviser to Russian President Vladimir Putin, Kirill Dmitriev on Oct. 24 in Miami, to develop the plan, CBS News reported Thursday.",
      "The plan was also presented to a senior member of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's administration, Rustem Umerov, a White House official said. Umerov confirmed on\u00a0X\u00a0that he was party to the talks on a technical level but said, \"I provided no assessments or, even more so, approvals of any points. This is not within my authority and does not correspond to the procedure.\"",
      "On Thursday, Zelenskyy met with U.S. Army Secretary Dan Driscoll in Kyiv, and was presented with what he later characterized in a post on X as \"points of a plan to end the war \u2014 [America's] vision.\" Zelenskyy said he outlined Ukraine's key principles, and the two sides agreed to continue working on the plan's provisions. A White House official told CBS News that Driscoll had two hours of meetings with Ukrainian officials, including 45 minutes of direct talks with Zelenskyy, which they described as \"productive.\"",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement to CBS News: \"This plan was crafted to reflect the realities of the situation, after 5 years of a devastating war, to find the best win-win scenario, where both parties gain more than they must give.\"",
      "Here's how the proposed plan would work:",
      "Immediate ceasefire",
      "The plan says a ceasefire would take effect immediately if both sides agree to the deal.",
      "Ukraine expected to give up its eastern regions",
      "As written, the plan would allow Russia to hold onto much of the Ukrainian territory that it currently occupies \u2014 and take over some Ukrainian-held areas.",
      "The plan calls for the Ukrainian oblasts of Crimea, Donetsk and Luhansk to be recognized by the U.S. and others as de facto Russian territory. Crimea was fully annexed by Russia in 2014, and the Russian military has occupied most of Donetsk and Luhansk \u2014 collectively known as the Donbas \u2014 since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in February 2022. Parts of the Donbas region in eastern Ukraine were first occupied by Russian-aligned forces in 2014.",
      "Crucially, parts of Donetsk that are still under Ukrainian control would also be ceded to Russia, according to the proposal, but would be deemed a neutral buffer zone with no Russian military presence.",
      "The conflict would be frozen at the existing front lines in two other Ukrainian oblasts \u2014 Kherson and Zaporizhia \u2014 effectively allowing Russia to hold onto cities like Mariupol and retain a land connection to Crimea.",
      "Those terms could prove to be a sticking point for Ukraine. Zelenskyy has long refused to give up any new territory or recognize Russian control over Crimea, instead calling for the war to be paused on the existing conflict lines.",
      "Ukraine must cap its military size",
      "The proposal also calls for Ukraine to cap the size of its military at 600,000 people.",
      "Zelensky said in January that the country's military numbered 880,000, according to the Kyiv Independent. Six years earlier, it had roughly 250,000 troops, the Atlantic Council said.",
      "No to NATO membership \u2014 but Ukraine can join the EU",
      "Under the plan, Ukraine would be barred from joining NATO.",
      "The country would be expected to modify its constitution to specify that it will not join the 32-nation bloc, a change of course since the country's NATO aspirations are currently enshrined in its constitution. Ukraine has pursued NATO membership for years, a status that would require the United States and other members to come to the country's defense if it's attacked again.",
      "And NATO is expected to agree not to accept Ukraine into the alliance. In 2008, its member states issued a declaration agreeing that Ukraine would become a member of NATO at some point in the future, but it did not set out a timeline.",
      "The plan also calls for NATO to agree not to send troops to Ukraine \u2014 possibly scuttling any postwar security deal that involves placing allied troops on Ukrainian soil.",
      "Another point in the plan says Russia will not invade neighboring countries and NATO will not expand any further \u2014 a favorable point for Russia, which has long chafed at the alliance's post-Cold War expansions. Sweden and Finland are the alliance's newest members, joining in 2024 and 2023, respectively, partly in reaction to the Russia-Ukraine war.",
      "NATO's longstanding position is that it has an \"open door policy,\" and decisions to admit new countries are made by its members, not any other countries.",
      "But the plan does specify that Ukraine has a right to join the European Union, and that it would get access to the European market in the meantime. Russia has long been wary of further economic and political integration between Ukraine and Europe.",
      "A U.S. guarantee",
      "The plan lays out a security guarantee if Russia reinvades Ukraine, calling for a \"decisive coordinated military response\" and the reinstatement of sanctions on Russia. Other benefits from the agreement, including recognition of new Russian territory, would be called off as well. The plan does not specify what type of military response Russia would face.",
      "The guarantee would be terminated if Ukraine invades Russia, or if it launches missiles at Moscow or St. Petersburg.",
      "Ukrainian elections",
      "Ukraine would be expected to hold elections in 100 days. Ukraine had elections scheduled for early 2024, but they were delayed due to the war. Zelenskyy won the presidency in 2019.",
      "Economic plan for Ukraine, Russian sanctions lifted",
      "The plan calls for a recovery plan for Ukraine, whose economy has been devastated by a yearslong Russian invasion and aerial bombardment. That includes reconstruction of Ukrainian cities, a development fund to boost Ukraine's tech industry and investments in mining and gas.",
      "Some $100 billion in frozen Russian assets would be invested in Ukraine, with the U.S. leading that effort. Europe would contribute an additional $100 billion.",
      "The plan also calls for negotiations on lifting the hefty sanctions that Russia has faced since the invasion began, choking it off from much of the global economy. The sanctions would be lifted in stages, according to the framework. And frozen Russian assets beyond $100 billion would be plowed into a joint U.S.-Russia investment fund.",
      "The overall plan would be monitored and enforced by a Peace Council, to be chaired by President Trump.",
      "Other points in the plan include a Russia-NATO security dialogue, a joint U.S.-Russia security working group and a non-aggression pact between Russia, Ukraine and Europe. It would also extend U.S.-Russia arms control treaties, require Ukraine to be a non-nuclear state and bar Russia from blocking Ukraine from using the key Dnipro river for commercial purposes.",
      "All civilian detainees taken during the war would be returned, including children, and both sides in the conflict would be granted amnesty for their conduct during the war. And both countries would be expected to adopt educational programs to discourage racial prejudice.",
      "The plan also calls for a return of Russia to the Group of Eight, a grouping of powerful countries that kicked Russia out after its 2014 annexation of Crimea.",
      "Leavitt said in her statement: \"As the Trump Administration has clearly said, any deal must provide full security guarantees and deterrence for Ukraine, Europe, and Russia to ensure the end of the war, in addition to financial opportunities for Ukraine to rebuild, and for Russia to rejoin the global economy, to benefit the people in both countries.\"",

      "Machado has expressed interest in attending the ceremony, which will be held in Oslo on December 10.",
      "\"By being outside Venezuela and having numerous criminal investigations, she is considered a fugitive,\" Attorney General Tarek William Saab told the AFP. Saab added that Machado is accused of \"acts of conspiracy, incitement of hatred, terrorism,\" and noted that she is under investigation for her support of the United States' deployment of military forces in the Caribbean.",
      "Machado was awarded the 2025\u00a0Nobel Peace Prize\u00a0last month for \"her tireless work promoting democratic rights for the people of Venezuela and for her struggle to achieve a just and peaceful transition from dictatorship to democracy.\" The Nobel Committee called Machado a \"key, unifying figure in a political opposition that was once deeply divided\" and \"a brave and committed champion of peace.\" It was Venezuela's first Nobel Prize.",
      "Known as Venezuela's \"Iron Lady,\" the 58-year-old Machado has spent more than two decades leading a massive political movement challenging the country's authoritarian leaders. She has been in hiding in Venezuela since the country's 2024 election.",
      "Venezuela has been ruled by an autocratic regime for decades and is currently led by President Nicolas Maduro, whose election in 2024 was widely dismissed as non-democratic. His leadership is not recognized by many nations, including the United States. Instead, the U.S. recognized Senator Edmundo Gonzalez, an opposition politician backed by Machado, as the legitimate winner of the election. Gonzalez has since left Venezuela.",
      "The Trump administration has accused Maduro of working with drug smuggling gangs, and tensions have only grown amid strikes on alleged drug boats and U.S. military assets being moved into the Caribbean.",
      "Machado has supported the efforts, calling the increased military pressure a \"necessary measure\" toward the \"restoration of popular sovereignty in Venezuela.\"",
      "Machado told CBS News\u00a0in an exclusive interview last month that she believed winning the Nobel would give her \"a lot of protection\" from the Maduro regime.",

      "A remarkably well-preserved Roman sarcophagus has been unearthed in Hungary's capital, offering a rare window into the life of the young woman inside and the world she inhabited around 1,700 years ago.",
      "The sarcophagus was untouched by looters and sealed for centuries. It was found with its stone lid fixed in place, secured by metal clamps and molten lead. When researchers carefully lifted the lid, they uncovered a complete skeleton surrounded by dozens of artifacts.",
      "\"The peculiarity of the finding is that it was a hermetically sealed sarcophagus. It was not disturbed previously, so it was intact,\" said Gabriella F\u00e9nyes, the excavation's lead archaeologist.",
      "Archaeologists with the Budapest History Museum discovered the limestone coffin during a large-scale excavation in \u00d3buda, a northern district of the city that once formed part of Aquincum, a bustling Roman settlement on the Danube frontier.",
      "The coffin lay among the ruins of abandoned houses in a quarter of Aquincum vacated in the 3rd century and later repurposed as a burial ground. Nearby, researchers uncovered a Roman aqueduct and eight simpler graves, but none approaching the richness or pristine condition of the sealed tomb.",
      "Keeping with Roman funerary customs, the sarcophagus held an array of objects: two completely intact glass vessels, bronze figures and 140 coins. A bone hair pin, a piece of amber jewelry and traces of gold-threaded fabric, along with the size of the skeleton, point to the grave belonging to a young woman.",
      "The objects, F\u00e9nyes said, were \"items given to the deceased by her relatives for her eternal journey.\"",
      "\"The deceased was buried very carefully by her relatives. They must have really loved who they buried here,\" she said.",
      "Anthropologists are now examining the young woman's remains, which is expected to reveal more about her age, health and origins. But even now, the grave's placement and abundance of artifacts offer strong clues.",
      "The sarcophagus and its contents \"definitely make it stand out,\" said Gergely Kosty\u00e1l, a Roman-period specialist and coleader of the project. \"This probably means that the deceased was well-to-do or of a higher social status.\"",
      "\"It is truly rare to find a sarcophagus like this, untouched and never used before, because in the fourth century it was common to reuse earlier sarcophagi,\" he added. \"It is quite clear that this sarcophagus was made specifically for the deceased.\"",
      "Excavators also removed a layer of mud roughly 4 centimeters, or 1.5 inches, thick from inside the coffin that F\u00e9nyes hoped could contain more treasures.",
      "Pictures showed golden jewelry found at the site, as well as a glass flask, a glass jar and other intact items after they were collected. Images also showed archaeologists examining the skull of the woman, alongside other remains. Other pictures showed workers lifting the lid of the sarcophagus using heavy machinery, after securing it.",
      "For F\u00e9nyes, the discovery of the Roman sarcophagus is not only of scientific significance, but an emotionally resonant insight into the devotion displayed by people in an ancient time.",
      "\"I was very touched by the care and expression of love that we were able to get a glimpse of,\" she said. \"Even now, I shudder to think how painful it must have been for the people at that time to bury this young lady.\"",

      "The Indian Air Force confirmed the crash and said \"the pilot sustained fatal injuries in the accident.\"",
      "\"IAF deeply regrets the loss of life and stands firmly with the bereaved family in this time of grief,\" it said in a statement. It said, \"A court of inquiry is being constituted, to ascertain the cause of the accident.\"",

      "Tejas is India's indigenous fighter aircraft, built by state-run Hindustan Aeronautics Limited.

      "The Indian government also signed a deal with HAL in 2021 for 83 Tejas aircraft. Deliveries, expected last year, have been delayed largely because of shortages of engines that must be imported from the United States.",
      "On Thursday, India's Press Information Bureau rejected some social media claims alleging that a Tejas aircraft had experienced an oil leak while on display at the air show.

    "story": [
      "A cannon, three coins and a porcelain cup were among the first objects Colombian scientists recovered from the depths of the Caribbean Sea where the mythical Spanish galleon San Jos\u00e9 sank in 1708 after being attacked by an English fleet, authorities said Thursday.",
      "The recovery is part of a scientific investigation that the government authorized last year to study the wreckage and the causes of the sinking. Colombian researchers located the galleon in 2015, leading to legal and diplomatic disputes. Its exact location is a state secret.",
      "Dubbed the \"holy grail of shipwrecks,\" the ship is believed to hold 11 million gold and silver coins, emeralds and other precious cargo from Spanish-controlled colonies, which could be worth billions of dollars if ever recovered.",
      "President Gustavo Petro's government has said that the purpose of the deep-water expedition is research and not the treasure's seizure.",
      "Colombia's culture ministry said in a statement Thursday that the cannon, coins and porcelain cup will undergo a conservation process at a lab dedicated to the expedition.",
      "The wreckage is almost 2,000 feet deep in the sea.",
      "\"This historic event demonstrates the strengthening of the Colombian State's technical, professional, and technological capabilities to protect and promote Underwater Cultural Heritage, as part of Colombian identity and history,\" Yannai Kadamani Fonrodona, Minister of Cultures, Arts, and Knowledge, said in a statement.",
      "The ship has been the subject of a legal battle in the United States, Colombia and Spain over who owns the rights to the sunken treasure.",
      "Colombia is in arbitration litigation with Sea Search Armada, a group of U.S. investors, for the economic rights of the San Jos\u00e9. The firm claims $10 billion corresponding to what they assume is worth 50% of the galleon treasure that they claim to have discovered in 1982.",
      "Earlier this year, researchers analyzed intricately designed gold coins found near the\u00a0wreck, confirming they are indeed from the iconic San Jose. The coins feature depictions of castles, lions and crosses on the front and the \"Crowned Pillars of Hercules\" above ocean waves on the back, according to a new study published in the journal\u00a0Antiquity.",
      "In 2024, Colombian authorities said one remotely operated vehicle surveyed the wreck, uncovering\u00a0numerous artifacts, including an anchor, jugs and glass bottles.",
      "The Colombian government announced last year it would begin extractions from the ship off its Caribbean coast, using multiple remotely operated vehicles. The ship's exact location has been kept secret to protect the storied wreck from potential treasure hunters.",
      "Since its discovery, multiple parties have laid claim to the shipwreck, including Colombia, Spain and Indigenous Qhara Qhara Bolivians who claim the treasures on board were stolen from them. The wreck has also been claimed by U.S.-based salvage company Sea Search Armada, which says it first discovered the wreck more than 40 years ago.",
      "The cause of the San Jose's sinking has also been debated. British documents indicate that the ship did not explode,\u00a0according to Colombia's government, but Spanish reports suggest the ship was blown up in battle.",
      "Either way, the ship \u2014 laden with chests of emeralds and about 200 tons of gold \u2014 sank with most of its crew while heading back from the New World to Spain on June 7, 1708.",
      "Among the artifacts spotted by deep-sea cameras so far are an anchor and cargo such as jugs and glass bottles, cast iron cannons, porcelain pieces, pottery and objects apparently made of gold.",
      "Investigators also recovered samples of the sediment accumulated in the ship over the years, which will be analyzed to \"better understand the causes of the shipwreck,\" said Alhena Caicedo, director of the Colombian Institute of Anthropology and History (ICANH).",
      "In May 2024, Colombia\u00a0declared the site\u00a0of the shipwreck a \"protected archeological area.\"",

    "summary": "A 1940 self-portrait by Frida Kahlo has sold for $54.7 million and made auction history at Sotheby's in New York.",
    "story": [
      "A 1940 self-portrait by famed Mexican artist Frida Kahlo sold Thursday for $54.7 million at a New York art auction, becoming the top sale price for a work by any female artist.",
      "The painting of Kahlo asleep in a bed \u2014 titled \"El sue\u00f1o (La cama)\" or in English, \"The Dream (The Bed)\" \u2014 surpassed the record held by Georgia O'Keeffe's \"Jimson Weed/White Flower No. 1,\" which sold for $44.4 million in 2014.",
      "The sale at Sotheby's also topped Kahlo's own auction record for a work by a Latin American artist. The 1949 painting \"Diego and I,\" depicting the artist and her husband, muralist Diego Rivera, went for $34.9 million in 2021. Her paintings are reported to have sold privately for even more.",
      "Thursday's auction for the painting drew bids from two collectors over 5 minutes before selling \u2014 at more than 1,000 times the price it sold for 45 years ago, according to Sotheby's.",
      "\"When this painting sold at Sotheby's in 1980 for $51,000, few could have imagined it returning 45 years later to command $55 million. This record-breaking result shows just how far we have come, not only in our appreciation of Frida Kahlo's genius, but in the recognition of women artists at the very highest level of the market,\" Anna Di Stasi, head of Latin American art at Sotheby's, said in a news release. \"In El sue\u00f1o, Kahlo confronts her own fragility, yet what emerges is a portrait of extraordinary resilience and strength. It is an enduring testament to one of the most admired and sought-after artists of our time.\"",
      "The self-portrait is among the few Kahlo pieces that have remained in private hands outside Mexico, where her body of work has been declared an artistic monument. Her works in both public and private collections within the country cannot be sold abroad or destroyed.",
      "The painting comes from a private collection, whose owner has not been disclosed, and is legally eligible for international sale. Some art historians have scrutinized the sale for cultural reasons, while others have raised concern that the painting \u2014 last exhibited publicly in the late 1990s \u2014 could again disappear from public view after the auction. It has already been requested for upcoming exhibitions in cities including New York, London and Brussels.",
      "The buyer's identity was not disclosed.",
      "The piece depicts Kahlo asleep in a wooden, colonial-style bed that floats in the clouds. She is draped in a golden blanket and entangled in crawling vines and leaves. Above the bed lies a skeleton figure wrapped in dynamite.",
      "Kahlo vibrantly and unsparingly depicted herself and events from her life, which was upended by a bus accident at 18. She started to paint while bedridden, underwent a series of painful surgeries on her damaged spine and pelvis, then wore casts until her death in 1954 at age 47.",
      "During the years Kahlo was confined to her bed, she came to view it as a bridge between worlds as she explored her mortality.",
      "The painting was the star of a sale of more than 100 surrealist works by artists including Salvador Dal\u00ed, Ren\u00e9 Magritte, Max Ernst and Dorothea Tanning.",
      "Kahlo resisted being labeled a surrealist, a style of art that's dreamlike and centers on a fascination with the unconscious mind.",
      "\"I never painted dreams,\" she once said. \"I painted my own reality.\"",
      "In its catalog note, Sotheby's said the painting \"offers a spectral meditation on the porous boundary between sleep and death.\"",
      "\"The suspended skeleton is often interpreted as a visualization of her anxiety about dying in her sleep, a fear all too plausible for an artist whose daily existence was shaped by chronic pain and past trauma,\" the catalog notes.",

    "published": "Thu, 20 Nov 2025 19:14:00 -0500",
    "summary": "Kyiv said it plans to \"work on points of the plan.\" it received from the U.S. that's aimed at restarting diplomatic efforts to end the war in Ukraine.",
    "story": [
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has received a draft plan aimed at ending the war in Ukraine, his office confirmed Thursday.",
      "It said in a statement that he had \"officially received a draft plan from the American side, which, according to the American side, could activate diplomacy.\" The statement went on to say \"it was agreed to work on the points of the plan in such a way as to bring the war to a dignified end.\"",
      "A senior White House official confirmed to CBS News on Thursday that President Trump was backing a 28-point plan drafted by envoy Steve Witkoff and an adviser to Russian President Vladimir Putin to end the war Russia started nearly four years ago with its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, but it's not clear whether this plan is the one that Zelenskyy received.",
      "The plan, according to reports by Axios, the Financial Times and the New York Times, calls for Ukraine to abandon territory, give up some weapons and shrink its army, and while President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Wednesday that the war must end, he reiterated that from Kyiv's perspective, \"there can be no reward for waging war.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's endorsement of the plan was first reported by NBC.",
      "Previously, Ukraine has agreed with the U.S. to a freezing of the battle lines where they stand as a starting point for negotiations, while also making clear that it needs security guarantees from Washington and its Western partners.",
      "Axios, citing a U.S. official, reported Monday that Witkoff was drafting a 28-point peace plan and had \"discussed it extensively\" with Kirill Dmitriev, an adviser to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Dmitriev said in an interview with Axios that he met with Witkoff and other Trump officials for three days in Miami in late October. He expressed optimism about the proposal, saying, \"We feel the Russian position is really being heard.\"",
      "Just days after the Trump administration imposed sanctions on Russian oil and gas in October, Dmitriev traveled to the U.S. to hold previously scheduled talks with Witkoff in an effort to continue to make progress on a proposal to end the war, as a senior U.S. official described it at the time.",
      "Dmitriev is under U.S. sanctions, which had to be waived for him to travel to Florida to meet with Witkoff.",
      "The White House official who spoke with CBS News on Thursday said Witkoff had been working on a proposal quietly for about a month, and said that he consulted with both the Russians and Ukrainians to take their feedback into account. The extent of those consultations with Ukraine was not clear from Kyiv's statement Thursday, but White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters the same day that Witkoff and Rubio \"met with some of the Ukrainians just in the past week to discuss this very plan.\"",
      "Senior Ukrainian official Rustem Umerov was verbally briefed in Miami this week by Witkoff, a source familiar with the conversation told CBS News.",
      "Top European Union official Kaja Kallas, when asked Thursday if Europeans were involved in the process, responded, \"Not that I know of.\" She also reiterated a point that's consistently been made by Ukraine and its supporters that \"for any plan to work, it needs Ukrainians and Europeans on board.\"",
      "Witkoff and Dmitriev have been talking for weeks about a proposal to end the war, gaming out ideas even as Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Treasury chief Scott Bessent criticized Russia, saying Moscow was not serious about ending the war.",
      "\"Ending a complex and deadly war such as the one in Ukraine requires an extensive exchange of serious and realistic ideas,\" Secretary of State Marco Rubio said on X Wednesday. \"And achieving a durable peace will require both sides to agree to difficult but necessary concessions. That is why we are and will continue to develop a list of potential ideas for ending this war based on input from both sides of this conflict.\"",
      "White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller told CBS News Wednesday that he didn't have any announcements to share about a peace plan, but said it was an issue \"the president has continued to put at the forefront of our foreign policy goal.\"",
      "The recent U.S. sanctions appear to be taking a toll on Russia \u2014 a Treasury Department analysis Thursday indicates that the oil sanctions have sent prices there tumbling, choking off a key revenue source that Russia has used to fund its war in Ukraine. The U.S. gas sanctions against Russia go into effect Friday.",
      "Amid the U.S. diplomatic efforts \u2014 which include a visit to Kyiv this week by a delegation led by the U.S. Army secretary \u2014 Russian missiles have continued to pummel Ukraine.",
      "Rescuers were still searching on Thursday for victims of a devastating Russian strike on an apartment building in the western city of Ternopil that killed at least 26 people, including three children, according to Ukrainian authorities.",
      "Shrieking Russian missiles slammed into the building on Wednesday, burning at least 19 people to death in the apartments.",

    "published": "Thu, 20 Nov 2025 16:57:00 -0500",
    "summary": "The bust, in the port outside of Peru's capital, Lima, led to the arrest of three men tied to a transnational criminal network involved in illegal fishing and wildlife smuggling, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.",
    "story": [
      "U.S. authorities have assisted the Peruvian government in seizing an estimated 10,000 individual shark fins destined for China \u2014 one of the largest wildlife trafficking operations in Latin American history.",
      "The bust, on Nov. 10 at an industrial port outside of Lima, led to the arrest of three men tied to a transnational criminal network involved in illegal fishing and wildlife smuggling, according to the United States Fish and Wildlife Service.",
      "The cruelty behind the shark fin trade is well-documented. Shark finning often involves slicing fins off live sharks and discarding the mutilated animals back into the ocean, where they die from blood loss, suffocation or predation. The practice is banned in many countries but persists due to weak enforcement and high profits.",
      "Shark fins are prized in Chinese cuisine, particularly for shark fin soup, which is associated with status and celebration, according to the nonprofit Shark Stewards. It's a dish that can sell for $100 a bowl and continues to drive a lucrative black market.",
      "Despite growing awareness and some regulatory crackdowns, the global demand for shark fins remains strong. The United Nations estimates the illegal wildlife trade generates up to\u00a0$20 billion annually, rivaling the drug and arms trades in scale and sophistication.",
      "\"The billion-dollar fin and meat trade is driving the extinction of iconic shark and ray species. Now, more than ever, critical action must be taken before it's too late,\" Luke Warwick, director of Shark and Ray Conservation for the Wildlife Conservation Society, told CBS News.",
      "The operation was led by Peru's Organized Crime Investigation Division of the Environmental. The fins, valued at more than $11.2 million, were sourced from threatened species including blue sharks, pelagic thresher sharks and common thresher sharks.",
      "Authorities say the criminal network purchased fins from Ecuadorian fishermen and laundered them through falsified documents claiming the catch originated in Peruvian waters. Once dried and stored in Callao, Peru, outside Lima, the fins were prepared for export to China.",
      "\"The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, in close partnership with the Peruvian National Police, is taking decisive action to dismantle the illegal shark fin trade. Together, we are committed to protecting sharks, and preserving the health of our oceans, for future generations,\" Doug Ault, assistant director of the office of\u00a0law enforcement at the USFWS, told CBS News.",
      "Sharks play a critical role in maintaining healthy marine ecosystems. As apex predators, their decline can trigger cascading effects, including the collapse of coral reefs and fisheries. Many shark species reproduce slowly, making them especially vulnerable to overexploitation.",
      "While the bust marks a significant victory for law enforcement, it also highlights the scale of the challenge. The black market for wildlife products continues to thrive, driven by international demand, corruption and limited oversight, according to the\u00a0U.N.\u00a0For now, the 9.3 tons of fins seized in Peru represent a stark reminder of the global cost of environmental crime.",

    "story": [
      "London \u2014\u00a0Over 95% percent of the world's internet traffic and voice and communication data flows through a vast network of fiber optic cables laid across the floors of oceans and seas. The cables are faster, more reliable and cheaper data carriers than alternatives such as satellites, and they have become indispensable to modern life.",
      "They are the veins and arteries that link our deeply interconnected world, transmitting data for everything from sensitive government and military information and text messages between friends, to trillions of dollars worth of financial transactions every day, underpinning the global economy.",
      "But our reliance on these undersea cables is a vulnerability, and one that rogue actors have allegedly already tried to exploit, including some adversaries of the United States.",
      "Russia has been accused recently by America's NATO allies of increasing \"hybrid warfare\" against Europe, and analysts say it has shown a clear interest in targeting things like undersea infrastructure.",
      "\"That's quite explicitly a part of Russian thinking regarding modern warfare,\" said Sidharth Kaushal, a senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, a British military think tank, in an interview with CBS News earlier this year.",
      "He said that sabotaging \"critical nodes on which society functions\u2026 [has been] illustrated in real time in the last few years.\"",
      "Since President Vladimir Putin ordered the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Russia has regularly conducted military strikes against Ukrainian energy and transport facilities. But beyond the battlefield, Russia has also been accused of targeting the infrastructure \u2014 including undersea cables \u2014 that's vital to other countries, including many of the United States' NATO allies.",
      "\"The sabotage events, they are a new phenomenon,\" Gabrielius Landsbergis, the former foreign minister of Lithuania, told CBS News. \"They are directly associated with this later stage of Russia's militarization and aggressive action \u2014 not just against Ukraine, but also against the West.\"",
      "Russia has denied allegations of interfering with undersea cables and called accusations it has carried out acts of sabotage in Europe \"Russophobia.\"",
      "What is happening in the Baltic Sea?",
      "The Baltic Sea is a nearly enclosed body of water surrounded by eight NATO countries and Russia.",
      "Relatively few undersea cables connect some of the Baltic NATO members, such as Lithuania, to the rest of Europe and the wider world.",
      "\"Baltic states are, you know, not entirely an island, but pretty much so,\" Landsbergis told CBS News. \"That means that for us [Baltic states] to connect to the Western infrastructure, it's a rather difficult task. So most of our connections, a big part of our connections, go through the Baltic Sea.\"",
      "The Baltic Sea is relatively shallow, meaning ships only need to drag their anchors along the bottom to cause potentially serious damage to cables. That increases the possibility of accidental damage, but also lends plausible deniability to malign actors who would like to carry out sabotage operations there.",
      "And Russia's \"shadow fleet\" of vessels, with hazy registration and insurance documentation that allows it to continue transporting oil and other energy products around the world despite Western sanctions imposed over its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, has increased its plausible deniability.",
      "When Finland and Sweden joined NATO, many in the West hoped the Baltic Sea would effectively become a \"NATO lake.\" Over the last few years, there have been several incidents of alleged Russian sabotage of underwater cables in the sea.",
      "\"It is clearly a spike,\" Landsbergis told CBS News. \"We have never seen almost any incidents during the last, I don't know, 20 years, and suddenly after [Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine] started, they're basically recurring every month.\"",
      "Targeting the \"anthropogenic shell of modern society\"",
      "RUSI's Kaushal said the apparent sabotage operations in the Baltic are an example of the hybrid warfare tactics being increasingly adopted by U.S. adversaries.",
      "\"Ever since the 90's and early 2000's, the Russians have talked about how the so-called anthropogenic shell of modern society \u2014 basically the fragile infrastructure on which it depends \u2014 is its Achilles heel,\" he told CBS News earlier this year. \"Attacks on undersea cables are one major part of that, along with missile attacks (like on infrastructure in Ukraine) and cyberattacks.\"",
      "Landsbergis told CBS News that he believes Russia's objective in disrupting undersea cables is to intimidate local populations, as well as to \"test the reactions \u2014 you know, how do politicians react? How do militaries react? Whether there is a response or not.\"",
      "With the Trump administration pushing hard for its European NATO allies to rely less on the U.S. for their security, \"it's not the question about how we see NATO, but it's the question how Putin sees NATO,\" Landsbergis told CBS News.",
      "He said without a firm, unified response to the sabotage, Putin could determine \"NATO is not the alliance that it has been before Trump,\" and that could lead the Russian autocrat to \"say, OK, maybe this is the time that I intend to test it.\"",
      "What is NATO doing about it?",
      "At the start of this year, NATO launched \"Baltic Sentry,\" a new operation \"to strengthen the protection of critical infrastructure.\"",
      "\"By working together with all Allies, we will do what it takes to ensure the safety and security not only of our critical infrastructure but of all that we hold dear,\" NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said in a statement announcing Baltic Sentry in January.",
      "The operation involves maritime patrols, aircraft and naval drones, as well as national surveillance assets, according to NATO. The Alliance said it would also work with industry to improve the resilience of undersea cables.",
      "Sweden, another country that shares a Baltic coastline with Russia, broke with its centuries-old policy of military non-alignment and became NATO's newest member last year, in direct response to Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine.",
      "It staged military exercises earlier this month to practice countering covert espionage and sabotage missions carried out by adversaries in the Baltic Sea.",
      "\"We're not at peace, but not at war,\" Swedish submarine flotilla Commander Paula Wallenburg told CBS News during the exercise.",
      "Wallenburg said the current circumstances look \"pretty close to\" those seen during the Cold War, when the nuclear-armed U.S. and then-Soviet Union tested each other's resolve in a face off that never quite turned into a full-scale military conflict.",
      "\"It's a very serious situation when it comes to security here in this area,\" she said.",
      "Below is a look at some recent incidents in the Baltic Sea in which Russia-linked vessels have been alleged to have been involved in damaging, or seen loitering around, undersea cables.",
      "Case study: Eagle S",
      "On Christmas Day 2024, an electricity cable and four telecommunications cables linking Finland and Estonia suffered unplanned outages, reducing the two countries' interconnectivity. Finland's National Bureau of Investigation later discovered a 60-mile drag mark near the Estlink 2 cable.",
      "The Eagle S, a crude oil tanker sailing under the flag of the Cook Islands and officially registered to a UAE company, left Russia's Baltic port of Ust-Luga on the morning of the outages, with its destination listed as Turkey, according to ship tracking data from MarineTraffic.",
      "The ship sailed over one of the Estlink submarine cables in the Gulf of Finland around the time a power failure was reported by the country's electric grid operators.",
      "The ship's anchor was later discovered near the point where the drag mark ended.",
      "Finnish border guards detained the ship and its crew, led by a Georgian national.",
      "The Eagle S was released to international waters in March, but Finland pursued criminal charges against the crew. The case was dismissed in October, when the court ruled prosecutors had failed to prove intent, but prosecutors said they would appeal.",
      "Case study: Two Russian trawlers tracked in area when Svalbard cable cut",
      "In February 2022, Norwegian police told local media they believed \"human impact\" was to blame for damage to one of a pair of undersea telecommunications cables connecting the country's mainland with its northern archipelago of Svalbard a month earlier.",
      "Space Norway, which operates the Svalbard Undersea Cable System, told CBS News the two cables \u2014 which were laid as a redundant pair in the event one suffered damage \u2014 are the world's northernmost subsea cable systems.",
      "Space Norway said it detected an outage in the Greenland Sea on Jan, 7.",
      "The damage occurred in an area where the cables descend steeply from a depth of 980 feet to nearly 9,000 feet, the operator told CBS News.",
      "Generally, the cables are buried approximately six feet deep, although there may be variations due to the nature of the seabed, the state-owned company explained, while declining to go into detail about the seabed conditions where the damaged cables were buried.",
      "There was never a loss of service for users in Svalbard, a Space Norway spokesperson said, and the investigation into the cut was eventually closed due to a lack of evidence.",
      "But a report from Norway's public broadcaster NRK and open-source information showed Russian fishing trawlers made more than a dozen passes over the area before the damage occurred.",
      "Other evidence of \"hybrid warfare\"",
      "This week, Poland's top diplomat accused Russia of carrying out an \"act of state terror\" by blowing up a railway line over the weekend.",
      "\"It was an act of not only subversion, as happened before, but an act of state terror as its clear intention was to cause human casualties,\" Polish foreign minister Radek Sikorski said.",
      "Poland's Prime Minister Donald Tusk said two Ukrainian citizens believed to have been working with Russia's secret services were suspected of carrying out the attack, which he called an \"unprecedented act of sabotage.\"",
      "The explosion took place on a rail line linking the Polish capital, Warsaw, to Ukraine, and Polish officials said it was used to transport aid to Ukraine.",
      "Russia dismissed allegations that it was involved in the explosion, calling them \"Russophobia.\"",
      "\"The latest sabotage in Poland that could have become a mass casualty event brings even more heightened dimension to the debate,\" Landsbergis told CBS News on Thursday.",
      "\"Imagine if there would be 100 casualties \u2014 would we be still talking about hybrid? Or we would drop the hybrid and just call it war and ask for Article 5?\" Landsbergis said, referring to the mutual-defense agreement among NATO members. \"The question points to a fact that Russians are pushing the escalation lines even further, forcing us to ask ourselves: Aren't we at war already?\"",
      "The incident came amid a spate of airspace violations, including some near airports and military bases, in Western European nations, usually involving unidentified drones, but also, in at least two instances, Russian warplanes.",
      "Holly  Williams\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "summary": "Moss spores survived in outer space for a majority of 2022, and could even reproduce when they were eventually returned to Earth, according to a new study.",
    "story": [
      "Moss spores survived in outer space for a majority of 2022, and could even reproduce as usual when they were eventually returned to Earth, according to a new study from researchers who say their findings \"reveal the potential of terrestrial plants to endure extreme environments\" \u2014 including the extraterrestrial kind.",
      "\"Climate change highlights the importance of understanding life's survival limits for addressing global challenges and supporting future human habitation beyond Earth,\" reads the introductory text of the study, conducted by scientists at Hokkaido University in Japan. \"Understanding the resilience of Earth-born organisms in extreme and unfamiliar conditions, such as the space environment, is a crucial step toward expanding human habitats other than Earth like the Moon or Mars.\"",
      "The full text was published Thursday in the online journal iScience. It describes a pioneering effort to study bryophyte plants, such as moss, with the intent to learn more about the limits of their survival skills and gauge their adaptability. Although the plants' resilience was already well-known in environments on Earth, research on their survival limits more widely is still in its early stages, the study's authors said.",
      "For nine months, moss withstood the markedly harsh conditions of space \u2014 which very few Earthly creatures have ever done \u2014 while affixed to the outside of the International Space Station. While the spores' chlorophyll, which gives them their green color, did degrade during the experiment, scientists said more than 80% of them retained their viability after nine months outside of the space station.",
      "Different types of moss spores had individual strengths, like one that may protect against ultraviolet rays, heat and intensive light stresses, and another that \"could be used for planetary greening and life support systems,\" the authors said.",
      "Bryophytes have existed on Earth since at least 500 million years ago, when they began to advance from water onto land, scientists say. The plants continue to exist today despite the fact that Earth has changed considerably, and they have become known for their tolerance to desiccation, freezing and radiation, all of which made them good candidates to be studied in an extraterrestrial setting.",
      "In addition to surviving the 9-month period, the spores could still germinate after the experiment ended and scientists returned them back down to Earth, according to the study.",

    "story": [
      "Hurricane Melissa's wind gusts reached a record-breaking speed shortly before the storm made landfall in the Caribbean last month, according to data recorded during the deadly event.",
      "The data was collected when a NOAA Hurricane Hunter airplane dropped a fleet of weather instruments into the raging storm, according to a news release from the U.S. National Science Foundation National Center for Atmospheric Research. The devices, called dropsondes, have small parachutes attached and between two and four readings per second before falling into the ocean.",
      "Dropsondes are the only devices that can record information on pressure, temperature, humidity and wind at once. The data is used in forecasts and weather warnings, including emergency alerts.",
      "\"When you're looking at a category 4 or 5 hurricane, you're not going to have an airplane flying that close to the surface \u2013 that would be totally unsafe \u2013 but you need to know what is happening near sea level because that's where people and property are most affected,\" said NSF NCAR engineer Terry Hock, who manages the Dropsonde program, in the news release. \"The dropsonde gets you information you can't get any other way and that's why it's been around for decades.\"",
      "One dropsonde used during Hurricane Melissa clocked a wind gust of 252 miles per hour shortly before falling into the ocean.",
      "NOAA researchers contacted the NSF NCAR to confirm that it was the highest wind speed ever recorded by a dropsonde.",
      "\"NOAA looped us in when they saw the high wind speed and asked, 'Are these numbers any good?'\" said Holger V\u00f6mel, an NSF NCAR senior scientist who works with the organization's Dropsonde Program.",
      "To verify the data, V\u00f6mel and other researchers reviewed the numbers with a quality control software. They also confirmed that the reported 252 mile wind gust would have been physically possible, and that it tracked with the hurricane's behavior, as well as previous storm patterns. The review confirmed that the wind gust measurement was accurate.",
      "The previous fastest wind gust recorded by a dropsonde was in 2010, when Typhoon Megi unleashed a 248 mile per hour blast while over the western Pacific Ocean. During Hurricane Katrina, researchers thought they had recorded an even stronger gust, but the data had substantial issues, the NSF NCAR said.",
      "\"They have pilots and researchers literally putting their lives on the line to get these measurements. They're the heroes, and it's a privilege we get to play a role in making sure the measurements they acquire are accurate,\" V\u00f6mel said.",

      "ESA's Juice spacecraft, bound for Jupiter, has been training its cameras and scientific instruments on the comet all month, particularly after it made its closest pass to the sun.

      "President Trump said Tuesday he will designate Saudi Arabia as a major non-NATO ally, marking a step up in defense ties between the United States and the Gulf monarchy.",
      "Mr. Trump announced the move at a black-tie dinner at the White House in honor of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the de facto leader of Saudi Arabia. The two leaders signed a new strategic defense deal earlier in the day, and Mr. Trump said Monday the U.S. will sell F-35 fighter jets to Saudi Arabia.",
      "The designation could open the door to further collaboration between Saudi Arabia and the U.S. military, including easier access to U.S.-made military equipment. It's also a symbolic move: Mr. Trump said in brief remarks Tuesday evening that it would take \"our military cooperation to even greater heights.\"",
      "There are currently 20 major non-NATO allies, including other Middle Eastern countries like Israel, Qatar, Kuwait, Bahrain, Egypt, Tunisia and Jordan.",
      "\"A stronger and more capable alliance will advance the interests of both countries, and it will serve the highest interests of peace,\" Mr. Trump said during Tuesday's dinner.",
      "The U.S.'s close relationship with Saudi Arabia dates back eight decades, bookended by a meeting between King Abdulaziz Ibn Saud and former President Franklin Delano Roosevelt aboard a U.S. Navy cruiser in 1945. The two countries have long cooperated on defense, and in recent decades, they have been bound together in part by a mutual rivalry with Iran.",
      "During Tuesday's meetings \u2014 marked by elaborate White House ceremonies and a military flyover \u2014 Mr. Trump pressed for even further military and economic cooperation with the Gulf state. The White House said\u00a0Tuesday that Saudi Arabia will buy hundreds of tanks and fighter jets and will partner with the U.S. on artificial intelligence and civil nuclear issues, while bin Salman pledged to invest nearly $1 trillion in the U.S., up from $600 billion.",
      "Members of Mr. Trump's family also have some business interests in the country. Mr. Trump insisted earlier Tuesday he has \"nothing to do\" with those deals, and \"they've done very little with Saudi Arabia, actually.\"",

      "Sydney Sweeney proved she's good for business, despite online hate that seems to follow Hollywood's latest \"It Girl.\"",
      "Sweeney's American Eagle ad campaign boosted the jeans company's shares by 10%, according to data from Brokerchooser. The controversial ad campaign, titled \"Sydney Sweeney Has Great Jeans,\" added roughly $400 million in market value and amplified the brand's web traffic by 100%.",
      "Branding and crisis-reputation experts explained why controversy can lead to coverage as Sweeney's star power and strategic PR turned negative attention into measurable success.",
      "\"To be clear, in the current \u2018Attention Economy\u2019 clicks and coverage are not the same thing; AE\u2019s \u2018good genes\u2019 campaign drew the latter,\" branding expert Doug Eldridge told Fox News Digital.",

      "\"In this case, controversy led to coverage, which created sustained attention and interest, all of which produced increased investment. The uptick in the AE stock price speaks for itself,\" Eldridge explained. \"A 10% increase \u2014 which was almost entirely attributable to one, standalone, campaign \u2013 is incredible. They\u2019ve always made the same jeans, they just didn\u2019t have the same \u2018go to market\u2019 approach when it came to brand messaging.\"",
      "\"Sydney Sweeney was (and is) more than a dorm-room pinup or the proverbial \u2018it girl\u2019 of the moment that we\u2019ve seen so many times in the past,\" the founder of Achilles PR said. \"She has an authentic, unapologetic sense of self that is rarely seen in Young Hollywood.\"",
      "Sweeney's \"true value\" was showcased in \"how she comported herself in the media\" after the American Eagle campaign, Eldridge explained.",
      "\"She didn\u2019t grovel or backpedal; there was no performative mea culpa from the starlet. She shut down criticism, not with witty banter or overly defensive conjecture; she simply smiled and said nothing,\" the branding expert said. \"Her near silence was worth a thousand words and tens of millions of dollars. That type of stoic sincerity is hard to find, given the scourge of cancel culture, pressure campaigns, and the endless lists of -ists and -isms that are often attached to those who tack against the tide of the \u2018mainstream morality police.' AE might\u2019ve been the big financial winner, but Sweeney emerged the champion.\"",

      "Sweeney's collaboration with American Eagle for it's fall clothing campaign, titled \"Sydney Sweeney Has Great Jeans,\" sparked mixed reactions. In one version of the ad, Sweeney stated: \"Genes are passed down from parents to offspring, often determining traits like hair color, personality and even eye color. My jeans are blue.\"",
      "While some dubbed the campaign as \"tone-deaf\" due to the alleged racial undertones, others praised the actress for killing \"woke\" advertising. According to Salon, the term \"great genes\" was historically used to \"celebrate whiteness, thinness and attractiveness.\"",
      "American Eagle defended Sweeney amid the backlash but removed the controversial video from the brand's social media accounts. \"'Sydney Sweeney Has Great Jeans' is and always was about the jeans,\" the statement said. \"Her Jeans. Her Story. We'll continue to celebrate how everyone wears their AE jeans with confidence, their way.\"",

      "\"It is unlikely that a single marketing campaign would drive stock performance on its own. However, in the short term, with the increased awareness this campaign generated by going viral on social media, coupled with extensive discussion in the press, it\u2019s no wonder that increased awareness would lead to a boost in online traffic which would, in turn, boost sales,\" the president of EDQ Strategies, a crisis and reputation management firm, told Fox News Digital.",
      "\"It remains to be seen whether a brand that is typically associated with young people will see these customers remain,\" Quast added. \"American Eagle isn\u2019t helped in the long-term when conservative culture warriors, including the President, go out of their way to publicly praise the campaign, thereby taking a stand in the controversy that is unlikely to resonate with a majority of the company\u2019s customer base.\"",

      "FIRST ON FOX: The Democratic Party's candidate seeking to win a House seat in Tennessee's upcoming special election has a lengthy record of anti-police rhetoric, which she espoused repeatedly on a now-deleted social media account and in interviews prior to becoming a state legislator in 2023.",
      "Aftyn Behn, who is running against Republican Matt Van Epps in Tennessee's 7th Congressional District special election, also worked as a regional organizing director for the nonprofit activist group Indivisible prior to becoming a state legislator. The radical left-wing entity was also a frequent advocate for stripping funding from police departments, calling it \"critical\" at the height of the defund movement.",
      "\"Where's the proposal that dissolves @MNPDNashville?\" Behn asked on an old social media account, which has since been deleted, in response to a separate social media post from a Nashville City Council member indicating local officials had submitted a \"substitute budget proposal\" aiming to strip Nashville police of $2.6 million in funding.",
      "KAMALA HARRIS RETURNS TO CAMPAIGN TRAIL IN TRUMP COUNTRY TO BACK \u2018AOC OF TENNESSEE\u2019",
      "\"If it's been difficult for all of you to imagine a world without police \u2026 we can do it and there is a world,\" Behn subsequently said during an interview with a local Nashville advocacy group.",
      "Behn posted most of her comments at the height of the \"defund the police\" movement in 2020 and 2021 after the death of George Floyd at the hands of police in Minneapolis. Amid violent protests that often devolved into dangerous rioting and looting after Floyd's death, Behn also downplayed the violence and ridiculed White people for criticizing the looting, stating it was simply how minority communities were expressing their grief over Floyd's death.",
      "Democratic congressional nominee Aftyn Behn, a Tennessee state representative, is running in a Dec. 2 special election for a vacant U.S. House seat.\u00a0 (Aftyn For Congress)",
      "\"Looks like Aftyn is getting a visit from the Ghost of Wokeness Past,\" quipped Republican strategist Matt Gorman. \"Democrats over and over have been haunted by their past positions they thought they could hide from. Ask Kamala Harris about her advocacy of taxpayer-funded sex change surgeries for illegal immigrant convicts on how that goes.\"",
      "Behn did not respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment. However, Democrat strategist Eric Koch argued that attacks on Behn have been surging because \"Republicans are getting worried in a district that Trump won by over 20 points,\" adding that Democrats making this race competitive shows they are in good shape to take back the House in the midterms next year. The special election is scheduled for Dec. 2.",
      "While popular in the immediate aftermath of Floyd's death, the push to \"defund the police\" has become a political liability for many Democrats running in recent elections. New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani faced criticism in the lead-up to his victory for his past anti-police rhetoric and went on Fox News to apologize. Earlier this month, a progressive candidate for U.S. Senate in Michigan was reported to have quietly deleted old social media posts in support of defunding the police.",

      "\"If it\u2019s been difficult for all of you to imagine a world without police, please tune in to, maybe not this episode, but the next one. Because I\u2019ll talk about things I\u2019m learning and growing as an organizer.

The same year, the group called on people to phone their local, state and federal lawmakers to demand policies and budgets that steer money away from police departments and toward \"Black communities.\"",

The precinct burned to the ground, and police were forced to abandon the precinct.",
      "Amid the chaos spurred by the death of Floyd that resulted in billions of dollars in damage and multiple lives lost, Behn was also co-hosting a podcast at the time. During one of the episodes, \"Black Lives Matter,\" Behn argued it \"is not for us to decide as privileged White people how marginalized communities express their suffering and their pain and their grieving.\"",
      "She was referring to the looting and rioting taking place, calling it \"a trope\" for White people to say the looting was bad.",
      "\"I would really challenge all of you when you see these stories of looting, and you revert to this law and order type of response, I really challenge you to step back from that and think about what's driving that,\" Behn added of the rioting. \"You should not condemn it because you don\u2019t know the first thing about being where they come from and what their generational trauma that has been inflicted upon them by the police, by institutional racism.\"",

      "For example, Behn responded to a post, claiming \"the Los Angeles teachers union\" was demanding a commitment to \"defund the police\" before it would commit to returning to in-person learning for students, with a response that called on teachers in her state to do the same. The post Behn was responding to also called for more similar demands across the country.",
      "\"Let's go Tennessee teachers! We have your back!!!!,\" Behn wrote in response to the post.",

      "Archer Aviation, a leading developer of electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft, just made one of its boldest moves yet. The company agreed to acquire Hawthorne Airport for $126 million in cash.",
      "According to Archer's latest shareholder letter, the deal includes the remaining 30 years on the airport's master lease and an exclusive option to take a controlling stake in the on-site fixed-base operator, subject to city approval.",
      "This historic 80-acre site includes about 190,000 square feet of terminals, office space and hangars. Its location near LAX and major Los Angeles destinations makes it a prime spot for an air taxi network that aims to change how people move in crowded cities.",

      "PENNSYLVANIA BILL SEEKS TO LEGALIZE FLYING CARS",
      "A rendering of Archer\u2019s development plans for Hawthorne Airport in Los Angeles. (Archer Aviation)",
      "Why Hawthorne Airport matters for the new air taxi network",
      "Archer Aviation plans to use the airport as the main operational hub for its LA air taxi network. The company also plans to prepare the site to support transportation during the LA28 Olympic and Paralympic Games. This includes managing everything from takeoff scheduling to ground operations. In its shareholder letter, Archer frames Hawthorne as a \"plug-and-play\" anchor hub for its LA28 Olympic plans, saying it expects to ramp up aircraft testing, storage, maintenance and charging on-site as it prepares for commercial service.",
      "The airport will also become a test bed for next-generation AI-powered aviation systems. These tools will help Archer develop smarter air traffic management, faster turnaround times and safer operations in crowded airspace.",
      "Archer outlines a two-phase plan in the letter. Phase 1 focuses on redeveloping up to 200,000 square feet of hangars and locking in control of the FBO, while Phase 2 layers in AI air traffic and ground management, smart sensor-embedded runways and a more digital, streamlined passenger experience.",
      "United Airlines CFO Michael Leskinen praised the move and said,\u00a0\"Archer's trajectory validates our conviction that eVTOLs are part of the next generation of air traffic technology that will fundamentally reshape aviation. Their vision for an AI-enabled operations platform isn't just about eVTOLs, it's also about leveraging cutting-edge technology to better enable moving people safely and efficiently in our most congested airspaces. Through United's investment arm, United Airlines Ventures, we're investing in companies like Archer that pioneer technologies that will define and support aviation infrastructure for decades to come.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Hawthorne Mayor Alex Vargas celebrated the deal on social media, writing\u00a0\"WELCOME ARCHER TO THE CITY OF HAWTHORNE!\"",
      "Archer plans to turn Hawthorne Airport into the main hub for its LA air taxi network. (Archer Aviation)",
      "Neighbors outraged over \u2018AI air taxi\u2019 takeover",
      "Not everyone is cheering Archer's plan to turn Hawthorne into a flagship hub for AI-guided flying taxis. A local group called Hawthorne Quiet Skies, made up of residents living around the airport, says it was blindsided by the $126 million takeover and that no one from the company or city bothered to engage it before announcing a \"test bed for AI-powered aviation technologies\" over homes.",
      "Neighbors who live just across the street and within a couple of blocks of the runway describe Hawthorne as one of the most tightly packed airports in the country, with homes on three sides and years of complaints about deafening jet and helicopter noise. The city's own 2021 noise study identified more than 160 homes and roughly 480 people already exposed to unhealthy noise levels, yet residents say there has been \"zero progress\" on mitigation even as the airport shifted from small private planes to commercial traffic and now an around-the-clock eVTOL hub.",
      "The group is also raising alarms about Archer's AI ambitions, pointing to academic research that current machine-learning systems in aviation still struggle to handle unusual conditions and lack formal safety guarantees.",
      "They argue that whatever the promises of cleaner, futuristic air taxis, Hawthorne is being used as a live test site without clear safeguards, updated federal noise rules or any serious plan to compensate families if nonstop eVTOL traffic makes their homes too loud to live in.",
      "CHINA\u2019S FIRST MASS-PRODUCED FLYING CAR DEBUTS",
      "How Archer Aviation is funding growth and expanding its air taxi program",
      "Alongside the airport news, Archer reported major financial momentum. The company raised an additional $650 million in equity, which boosted its total liquidity to more than $2 billion. The company's Midnight aircraft also hit new flight milestones, including a 55-mile flight at over 126 mph and a climb to 10,000 feet.",
      "Archer also expanded its global technology footprint. It completed the acquisition of Lilium's patent portfolio, which pushes Archer's total intellectual property to more than 1,000 global assets. Those patents cover ducted fans, high voltage systems, flight controls and other key technologies.",
      "International expansion is underway, too. Archer began test and demo flights in the UAE and secured new partnerships with Korean Air and with Japan Airlines and Sumitomo's JV in Osaka and Tokyo.",
      "The airport will serve as a test bed for next-generation AI aviation systems designed to manage busy airspace more safely. (Archer Aviation)",
      "What this means for you",
      "Archer's airport deal suggests that air taxis are moving closer to everyday use. This shift could mean shorter trips across major cities at a fraction of today's travel time. It could also bring quieter aircraft over neighborhoods compared to helicopters.",
      "For Los Angeles residents, Hawthorne Airport may become a central point for fast point-to-point travel once certification moves forward. Visitors flying in for major events like the LA28 Olympics could see air taxis as a smooth alternative to gridlocked freeways.",
      "Businesses may gain new options for rapid transport across the region. The move also signals more investment and jobs in advanced aviation, automation and clean electric travel.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Archer's acquisition of Hawthorne Airport marks a major milestone in the race to build a real air taxi network, giving the company the aircraft, funding and prime location it needs to push the industry forward. Its focus on AI-driven operations shows how automated aviation may soon play a much bigger role in daily life, even as regulators are still working out how to safely integrate these aircraft into crowded cities. At the same time, the move is already sparking backlash from neighbors who worry about more noise and safety risks and being turned into a test site for AI-guided aircraft without a real say. If Archer can win over regulators, investors and the communities living just beyond the fence line, this step could make the future of urban flight feel much closer, for better or worse.",

    "story": [
      "\u2018The CyberGuy\u2019 Kurt Knutsson joins \u2018Fox & Friends Weekend\u2019 to discuss the potential effects of artificial intelligence software like ChatGPT on the brain.",
      "App stores are supposed to be reliable and free of malware or fake apps, but that's far from the truth. For every legitimate application that solves a real problem, there are dozens of knockoffs waiting to exploit brand recognition and user trust. We've seen it happen with games, productivity tools and entertainment apps. Now, artificial intelligence has become the latest battleground for digital impostors.",
      "The AI boom has created an unprecedented gold rush in mobile app development, and opportunistic actors are cashing in. AI-related mobile apps collectively account for billions of downloads, and that massive user base has attracted a new wave of clones. They pose as popular apps like ChatGPT and DALL\u00b7E, but in reality, they conceal sophisticated spyware capable of stealing data and monitoring users.",

      "Fake AI apps pose as trusted tools like ChatGPT and DALL\u00b7E while secretly stealing user data. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What you need to know about the fake AI apps",
      "The fake apps flooding app stores exist on a spectrum of harm, and understanding that range is crucial before you download any AI tools. Take the \"DALL\u00b7E 3 AI Image Generator\" found on Aptoide. It presents itself as an OpenAI product, complete with branding that mimics the real thing. When you open it, you see a loading screen that looks like an AI model generating an image. But nothing is actually being generated.",
      "Network analysis by Appknox showed the app connects only to advertising and analytics services. There's no AI functionality, just an illusion designed to collect your data for monetization.",
      "Then there are apps like WhatsApp Plus, which are far more dangerous. Disguised as an upgraded version of Meta's messenger, this app hides a complete malware framework capable of surveillance, credential theft and persistent background execution. It's signed with a fake certificate instead of WhatsApp's legitimate key and uses a tool often used by malware authors to encrypt malicious code.",
      "Once installed, it silently requests extensive permissions, including access to your contacts, SMS, call logs, device accounts and messages. These permissions allow it to intercept one-time passwords, scrape your address book and impersonate you in chats. Hidden libraries keep the code running even after you close the app. Network logs show it uses domain fronting to disguise its traffic behind Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud endpoints.",
      "Not every clone is malicious. Some apps identify themselves as unofficial interfaces and connect directly to real APIs. The problem is that you often can't tell the difference between a harmless wrapper and a malicious impersonator until it's too late.",
      "Clones hide spyware that can access messages, passwords and contacts. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Users and businesses are equally at risk",
      "The impact of fake AI apps goes far beyond frustrated users. For enterprises, these clones pose a direct threat to brand reputation, compliance and data security.",
      "When a malicious app steals credentials while using your brand's identity, customers don't just lose data but also lose trust. Research shows customers stop buying from a brand after a major breach. The average cost of a data breach now stands at 4.45 million dollars, according to IBM's 2025 report. In regulated sectors like finance and healthcare, such breaches can lead to violations of GDPR, HIPAA and PCI-DSS, with fines reaching up to 4% of global turnover.",

      "While the threat landscape continues to evolve, there are practical measures you can take to protect yourself from malicious clones and impersonators.",
      "A quality mobile security solution can detect and block malicious apps before they cause damage. Modern antivirus programs scan apps for suspicious behavior, unauthorized permissions and known malware signatures. This first line of defense is especially important as fake apps become more sophisticated in hiding their true intentions.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at Cyberguy.com.",
      "Apps like WhatsApp Plus specifically target credentials and can intercept passwords typed directly into fake interfaces. A password manager autofills credentials only on legitimate sites and apps, making it significantly harder for impostors to capture your login information through phishing or fake app interfaces.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",

      "Given that malicious clones can steal personal information, intercept SMS verification codes and even impersonate users in chats, identity theft protection provides an additional safety net. These services monitor for unauthorized use of your personal information and can alert you if your identity is being misused across various platforms and services.",
      "Identity theft companies can monitor personal information like your Social Security number (SSN), phone number and email address and alert you if it is being sold on the dark web or being used to open an account. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals.",

      "PROTECTING KIDS FROM AI CHATBOTS: WHAT THE GUARD ACT MEANS",
      "While some sophisticated malware can intercept SMS codes,\u00a02FA still adds a critical layer of security. Use authenticator apps rather than SMS when possible, as they're harder to compromise. Even if a fake app captures your password, 2FA makes it significantly more difficult for attackers to access your accounts.",
      "Security patches often address vulnerabilities that malicious apps exploit. Regular updates to your operating system and legitimate apps ensure you have the latest protections against known threats. Enable automatic updates when possible to stay protected without having to remember manual checks.",
      "Stick to the Apple App Store and Google Play Store rather than third-party marketplaces. While fake apps can still appear on official platforms, these stores have security review processes and are more responsive to removing malicious applications once they're identified. Third-party app stores often have minimal or no security vetting.",
      "Check the developer name carefully. Official ChatGPT apps come from OpenAI, not random developers with similar names. Look at the number of downloads, read recent reviews and be suspicious of apps with few ratings or reviews that seem generic. Legitimate AI tools from major companies will have verified developer badges and millions of downloads.",
      "Even if you avoid downloading fake apps, your personal information may already be circulating on data broker sites that scammers rely on. These brokers collect and sell details like your name, phone number, home address and app usage data, information that cybercriminals can use to craft convincing phishing messages or impersonate you.",
      "A trusted data removal service scans hundreds of broker databases and automatically submits removal requests on your behalf. Regularly removing your data helps reduce your digital footprint, making it harder for malicious actors and fake app networks to target you.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

You can now remove an app from any of your devices directly from your main phone. This eliminates the need to pick up each device and remove the app one by one.

That long-winded method still works, but the new shortcut saves time and effort.

We let our guard down when we're rushed, distracted or excited by a deal. Staying alert during the holiday season can help you avoid data exposure and financial losses. Here are some of the most common scams you should be aware of.",
      "The surge of promotions during the holiday season is the perfect time for \"phantom stores\" to thrive. It's a fraudulent store that mimics the interface and products of a well-known brand. Once you purchase from such a website, you'll never receive your order as the store doesn't actually exist.",
      "Real-world example: Fake IKEA websites appeared with URLs spelled \"ikeaa-sale.com\" and \"ikea-blackfriday.shop,\" mimicking the official ikea.com interface with copied product images, logos and discount banners.",
      "They lured shoppers with huge discounts and clearance offers to steal credit card data. Eventually, they were reported and taken down, but the damage has been done.",
      "What to do?\u00a0Always check the URL of the store you shop at and only click links from the store's official website or social media.",

They can easily find your contact information and order details to text \"Your order couldn't be delivered.\" Each text contains a phishing link that can install malware on your device or steal your personal information. That's why Temu warns its users about the couriers they partner with.",
      "What to do?\u00a0Make sure the texts you receive come from a legit courier service and double-check it on the store's website.",
      "Some scammers use sophisticated phishing tactics to lure victims. They engineer emails from well-known brands, use an urgent tone, place malicious links and urge you to click on your order status. In reality, there is no order status \u2013 they're stealing your data.",
      "Real-world example: Amazon is one of the biggest online retailers worldwide, and that makes the brand easy to mimic. Scammers send emails on behalf of Amazon to try to steal customers' personal data because it's highly likely that their victims have used Amazon, making it less suspicious. However, phishing emails have some telltale signs you can look out for.",
      "What to do?\u00a0Never click on any suspicious links and always check the sender's contact information.",
      "When you shop online, you should be aware of the data you share, including your contact information, shopping habits, credit card details and more. All stores collect some type of data about you. However, some companies collect more than you think.",
      "Real-world example: The infamous Target controversy in 2012 revealed how big retailers use data analysis to predict your shopping behavior. The company collected shopping data and managed to produce a predictive model for soon-to-be mothers.",
      "They sent out brochures with baby clothes, vouchers for baby formula and more before the customers even knew they were pregnant. Thankfully, modern shopping looks a bit different. You can opt out of certain data collection and exercise your right to remove personal information from websites that collect it.",

      "Imagine you're browsing for gifts online. Within minutes, your activity generates data points \u2013 device info, IP address, browsing habits that feed into online databases. At the same time, data brokers already have your full profile: age, income, address history, family members and even shopping behavior. These profiles are sold to marketers and often leak into criminal databases.",
      "That's why scam calls, texts and emails often feel so \"real.\" They use your name, the right retailer, even your city. They're not guessing. They've bought your digital footprint.",

    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.",
      "A major national security debate is unfolding, and it affects more than government networks. It touches your home, your devices and the Wi-Fi your family uses every day. The Commerce Department has proposed blocking new sales of TP-Link products after a months-long review into the company\u2019s ties to China, citing a growing TP-Link security risk.",
      "Multiple agencies, including the Departments of Homeland Security and War, supported that proposal. They believe the company\u2019s connections could expose American networks to foreign influence.",
      "Security experts warn that foreign-backed hackers have targeted home and office routers for years. These devices often act as silent steppingstones that help attackers move deeper into sensitive systems. When compromised, they can expose everything connected to them, including computers, smart home gear, military devices used on base and more.",
      "This potential ban would be one of the biggest consumer tech actions in U.S. history. It comes as lawmakers raise fresh alarms about Chinese-made cameras, routers and connected home products sold on military exchanges and in homes across the country.",

      "CHINESE HACKERS BREACH US NUCLEAR SECURITY AGENCY IN CYBERATTACK OPERATION, OFFICIALS SAY",
      "The proposed TP-Link ban stems from growing concerns that foreign-linked routers and cameras could expose American homes and networks to outside influence. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why military families are even more vulnerable",
      "Lawmakers from both parties say military households face extra risk. Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, who leads a bipartisan group of 23 lawmakers, warns that TP-Link cameras and networking devices sold on Army, Navy and Air Force exchange sites could expose sensitive footage from base housing and dorms. Rep. Ashley Hinson, R-Iowa, echoed that concern, saying these devices could act as a backdoor for Chinese intelligence to collect information on service members and their families. Even when products appear out of stock, officials worry they remain popular in military communities.",
      "These lawmakers say Chinese laws could force companies to share data or push hidden software changes that weaken U.S. networks. They argue that this creates a real risk for households on or near military installations. While TP-Link disputes every allegation and states that it stores U.S. data inside America, lawmakers want a deeper investigation.",
      "\"China will use any way to infiltrate us, and we must ensure they cannot access our homeland or military bases,\" said Ernst. \"High-tech security cameras sending video and audio directly back to Beijing must be treated like the grave threat that they are. We have seen this playbook from China before, with Huawei Technologies, and need the Trump administration to investigate and determine if TP-Link is a Trojan horse compromising our national security.\"",
      "10M AMERICANS HIT IN GOVERNMENT CONTRACTOR DATA BREACH",
      "How Congress is responding to TP-Link security risks",
      "Ernst is pressing the Commerce Department to finish its investigation by Nov. 30. Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., who chairs the Senate Intelligence Committee, says TP-Link could give the Chinese government access to American networks and wants faster action. Their concerns reflect past decisions involving Huawei and Kaspersky, which lost access to the U.S. market due to national security risks.",
      "Congressional leaders say foreign-made smart home devices sold on military bases should face strict scrutiny. They see routers, cameras and other connected home gear as critical targets in a time when cyberthreats continue to grow.",
      "We reached out to TP-Link Systems Inc., and a spokesperson provided CyberGuy with the following statement:",
      "\"TP-Link Systems Inc. (TP-Link), an American company based in California, refutes the claims in this letter. This letter repeats false and misleading media reports and attacks that have been thoroughly debunked.\"",
      "\"TP-Link emphatically objects to any allegation it is tied to the Communist Party of China, dependent on the Chinese government, or otherwise subject to interference under Chinese national security laws,\" the TP-Link spokesperson said. \"The company is not controlled by any government, foreign or domestic. TP-Link has split from and has no affiliation with the China-based TP-LINK Technologies Co. Ltd., which is separately owned and operated.",
      "Lawmakers warn that TP-Link devices sold on military bases may put service members and their families at greater risk, especially inside base housing. (John Moore/Getty Images)",
      "\"This letter has nothing to do with security and everything to do with a competitor trying to remove TP-Link Systems\u2019 products from the marketplace. The \u2018open source information\u2019 the members reference is actually a manufactured echo chamber of false and misleading attacks that the media has parroted over the past year. Instead of directly engaging with TP-Link Systems, these members essentially pressed \u2018copy and paste\u2019 on unsubstantiated claims about our American company.",
      "\"TP-Link has not been contacted by policymakers to discuss the alleged concerns, but if we were to meet with them, they would learn that TP-Link has located its core security functions and data infrastructure in the United States. U.S. user data is securely stored on Amazon Web Services infrastructure in Virginia, under the full control of the company\u2019s U.S. operations.",
      "\"TP-Link Systems currently holds a very small share of the U.S. security camera market, representing approximately 3% of the consumer market segment according to Circana checkout data. The company has virtually no business presence in the enterprise segment. Additionally, TP-Link Systems' router market share in the U.S. has been inaccurately reported as being much higher than it actually is. Recent market research from Dell\u2019Oro Group, Inc., found that TP-Link Systems' market share of residential Wi-Fi router sales in North America is under 10%.",
      "\"TP-Link does not enable foreign surveillance of U.S. networks or users. The company\u2019s operations are built to prevent potential attempts to subvert its business by outside influence. TP-Link\u2019s substantial security investments cover its entire product portfolio, including security cameras and routers.",
      "\"TP-Link continually monitors its products and services and takes timely and appropriate action to address vulnerabilities it becomes aware of. TP-Link has not identified any reliable information regarding new vulnerabilities in its products in connection with this letter.\"",

      "Cybercriminals targeted Hyundai AutoEver America\u2019s systems, exposing sensitive data. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why this Hyundai AutoEver America breach matters",
      "The exposed data reportedly includes names, Social Security numbers and driver's license numbers, making this breach far more serious than one involving passwords alone. Experts warn that these details can be used for long-term identity theft and financial fraud. Because Social Security numbers cannot easily be changed, criminals have more time to create fake identities, open fraudulent accounts and launch targeted phishing attacks long after the initial breach.",
      "Experts warn that stolen Social Security and driver\u2019s license information could be used for identity theft and fraud. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Who was affected in the Hyundai AutoEver America data incident",
      "AEA manages select IT systems tied to Hyundai Motor America's employee operations, along with broader technology functions for Hyundai and Genesis across North America. Its role includes supporting connected-vehicle infrastructure and dealership systems.",
      "According to the company, this incident was limited to employment-related data and primarily affected approximately 2,000 current and former employees of Hyundai AutoEver America and Hyundai Motor America. No customer information or Bluelink driver details were exposed. While some filings reference sensitive data types such as Social Security numbers or driver's license information, the incident did not involve Hyundai customers or the millions of connected vehicles HAEA supports.",
      "Earlier reports suggested that 2.7 million individuals were affected, but Hyundai says that figure is unrelated to the breach. Instead, 2.7 million is the estimated number of connected vehicles that Hyundai AutoEver America helps support across North America. None of that consumer or vehicle data was accessed.",
      "GENESIS PREVIEWS G70 SPORTS SEDAN WITH NEW YORK CONCEPT",
      "Hyundai also clarified that the United States has about 850 Hyundai dealerships and emphasized that the scope of this incident was narrow and contained.",
      "We reached out to HAEA for a comment, and a representative for the company provided CyberGuy with this statement:",
      "\"Hyundai AutoEver America, an IT vendor that manages certain Hyundai Motor America employee data systems, experienced an incident to that area of business that impacted employment-related data and primarily affected current and former employees of Hyundai AutoEver America and Hyundai Motor America. Approximately 2,000 primarily current and former employees were notified of the incident. The 2.7 million figure that is cited in many media articles has no relation to the actual security incident. The 2.7 million figure represents the alleged total number of connected vehicles that may be supported by Hyundai AutoEver America across North America.

    "story": [
      "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.",
      "A Skagit County Superior Court judge ruled that images from Flock Safety automated license plate reader cameras in Stanwood and Sedro-Woolley qualify as public records under Washington's Public Records Act.",
      "Judge Elizabeth Yost Neidzwski said the images are \"not exempt from disclosure\" and explained that an agency does not need to physically hold a record for it to fall under the law.",
      "The request that led to the ruling",
      "The case began when Washington resident Jose Rodriguez asked Stanwood for one hour of Flock camera images. That request prompted Stanwood and neighboring Sedro-Woolley to ask the court to declare that vendor-stored data did not count as public records.",

      "Judge Neidzwski rejected that argument. She said the cities' ALPR images support a government purpose and meet the definition of a public record.",
      "SEATTLE ELECTS DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST KATIE WILSON AS MAYOR",
      "Flock Safety cameras use AI to capture license plate images in real time, tracking vehicles as they move through neighborhoods. (Flock Safety)",
      "However, Rodriguez will not receive the specific images he sought. The city had already allowed the footage to auto-delete after 30 days, and it expired before the ruling.",
      "We reached out to Flock Safety, and a spokesperson provided CyberGuy with the following statement:",
      "\"The Court merely declined to exempt these records from disclosure under Washington's extremely broad public records law. Nothing changed in the status quo in Washington as a result of this ruling \u2014 these records were covered by the law before the ruling, and remain so following the ruling. Unfortunately, some individuals in Washington have abused the breadth of the public records law to extort significant settlements from Washington communities for technical violations of the disclosure requirements, which we cannot believe is the intent of the law. We are supporting efforts to enact a legislative fix to this situation, which is costing Washington communities tens of thousands of dollars to stave off frivolous lawsuits.\"",
      "The Washington court ruling marks a major step toward transparency in how police collect and store surveillance data. (Flock Safety)",
      "Why the decision matters for transparency",
      "Flock's automated license plate reader cameras capture multiple still images of passing vehicles along with time, location and license plate information. Cities use the system to assist law enforcement with investigations, relying on stored images to identify vehicles connected to crimes or alerts.",
      "The court's ruling raises broader questions about how local agencies manage these images once they're created. By finding that the images qualify as public records, the decision forces cities to examine how long they retain this data, how it is stored and who may request access under state law.",
      "Privacy advocates say the ruling highlights the need for clear policies around retention and transparency, while law enforcement groups argue that access rules must still protect ongoing investigations.",
      "AI DASHCAMS ENHANCE TRUCKER SAFETY WHILE RAISING PRIVACY CONCERNS",
      "The debate continues as communities weigh the balance between public safety, privacy and the right to know what\u2019s being recorded. (Flock Safety)",
      "How this ruling impacts privacy and surveillance",
      "For years, cities and police agencies have argued that data stored by third-party vendors falls outside public records laws. They often make this claim even when the data documents activity on public roads. The Washington ruling did not settle broader questions about surveillance, but it rejected the idea that Flock camera images are exempt simply because a vendor stores them. This decision exposes a growing tension between how agencies use surveillance tools and what the public can access under state law.",
      "Beryl Lipton of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit dedicated to defending digital privacy, free expression and transparency in technology, told Cyberguy,\u00a0\"The use of third-party vendors for surveillance and data storage is widespread and growing across the country, and allowing this to undermine the public\u2019s right to know is very dangerous. The government's primary obligation should be to its constituents, which includes protecting their rights under public records laws, not to the private vendors that they choose to employ while conducting mass surveillance. Whether an agency stores images and information on their own devices or on the private server of a vendor should not affect the appropriate disclosure of these records under public records laws. If the use of these devices makes it too difficult for a city to comply with the law, then the response should not be to circumvent the laws they find inconvenient, but rather it should be to only use vendors that won\u2019t get in the way of a city\u2019s ability to fulfill its responsibilities to their citizenry. Otherwise, they should not use these tools at all.\"",
      "What this means for you",
      "If your town uses Flock or other automated license plate readers, this ruling shows how Washington courts may handle future records requests. It confirms that ALPR images can count as public records, even when a vendor stores the data.",
      "The debate over privacy and safety continues. Supporters say public access builds trust and oversight. Critics worry that releasing vehicle data could expose sensitive details without strong safeguards or redactions.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "This ruling shows how courts may handle data from automated license plate readers. It also reveals how much vehicle information cities collect. As a result, it raises new questions about who should access these records. In addition, the decision may guide future transparency debates in Washington.

      "How the flight cancellation text scam works",
      "The scam starts with a text that looks like it's from your airline. It may include your name, flight number and a link or phone number. The message includes urgent language that says your flight is canceled or delayed and tells you to \"call this number\" or \"click to rebook.\"",
      "PILOT WARNS \u2018SHORT-HANDED, STRESSED\u2019 AIR TRAFFIC DELAYS WILL LINGER AFTER SHUTDOWN",
      "Scammers send fake flight cancellation texts that look official, using real airline names, flight numbers and logos to trick travelers into calling them. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Once you do, you're talking to a scammer pretending to be an airline agent. They'll offer to \"help\" rebook your flight for a fee. They might ask for payment details or personal information like your birth date or passport number.",
      "In some cases, they'll send confirmation emails that look official to make the lie more believable.",
      "AI-generated messages make these scams harder to spot, mimicking airline alerts so well that even frequent flyers can be fooled during busy travel seasons. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why the scam feels real",
      "Scammers use real airline names, logos and flight numbers to make their messages look official. Many now use AI tools to generate convincing language and fake confirmations that mimic real airline alerts. These messages often arrive during busy travel seasons or storm delays, which makes them feel even more believable.",
      "The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) warns that criminals impersonate airline customer service through fake texts and calls that say your flight is canceled. They use that panic to push you into rebooking or sharing personal details.",
      "Meanwhile, the Better Business Bureau (BBB) reports a surge in fake cancellation notices that include phony phone numbers leading straight to scammers.",
      "Because these alerts look real and use urgent language, even experienced travelers can mistake them for genuine updates. Staying calm and verifying directly with the airline is the best defense.",
      "Staying calm and verifying through official airline apps or websites is the safest way to protect your money and personal information before you take action. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Steps to stay safe from fake flight cancellation texts",
      "Scammers use fear and urgency to trick travelers into clicking bad links or calling fake numbers. Follow these steps to keep your trip and information safe.",
      "Always confirm flight updates using the airline's official website or mobile app. Log in directly instead of clicking on links from unexpected texts or emails. Scammers design fake links that look real, but one tap can expose your personal information.",
      "PILOT GOES VIRAL FOR REVEALING REAL REASON YOU NEED TO SET YOUR PHONE TO AIRPLANE MODE BEFORE FLYING",
      "If you need to call customer service, use the number listed in your booking confirmation, the airline's app or on its verified website. Never trust a phone number sent by text or social media message. Real airlines will never change their contact information mid-trip.",
      "Scammers count on panic. Messages that say \"call now,\" \"act fast\" or \"your seat will be canceled\" are meant to rush you. Slow down and verify before responding. Taking a minute to check the official flight status can prevent you from losing money or data.",
      "Legitimate airline staff will not ask for gift card numbers, wire transfers or your bank login. Use a strong antivirus program to block phishing sites and malware designed to steal personal data if you accidentally click a bad link.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "Use a data-removal service to help scrub your personal details from people-search websites. These sites make it easier for scammers to target travelers by name, location and phone number. Keeping your information private reduces your risk.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice. They aren't cheap, and neither is your privacy. These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet. By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

It works automatically in the background and learns your recent activity to predict when extra power will be needed. When active, it can make small adjustments, such as lowering screen brightness, limiting background activity or turning on Low Power Mode when your battery reaches 20%.",

It balances performance and power consumption throughout the day, helping your phone last longer without noticeable slowdowns. It trims energy use in high-demand moments, like recording videos, editing photos or multitasking, without disrupting what you're doing. When it activates, you might see a small notification letting you know it's working, but otherwise, it operates quietly in the background.",
      "The Adaptive Power feature uses on-device intelligence to adjust brightness, limit background tasks and keep performance balanced throughout the day. (Apple)",
      "Make sure you have iOS 26 installed",
      "To use Adaptive Power, your iPhone must be running iOS 26. If you're unsure, here's how to check and update:",

      "You may not see dramatic gains every day, but the effect adds up. Adaptive Power could extend the lifespan of your iPhone just by updating to iOS 26. Even though you might still need to charge overnight, the feature can buy you extra hours when you're away from an outlet. Just remember: battery life often dips briefly after major updates while your system re-indexes data, but it levels out in a few days.",
      "Pro tip: Use strong antivirus software",
      "Use trusted antivirus software as an extra layer of protection for your iPhone. While Apple's built-in defenses are strong, security threats evolve fast. Installing strong antivirus software adds real-time protection against phishing, unsafe links and rogue apps. Keep it updated and run regular scans to catch potential risks early. This extra step helps your device stay clean, fast and fully protected between iOS updates.",

Because the Chinese could exploit through intel, getting capability off that, but I\u2019m not as worried as some,\" Wald said during a briefing at JINSA this week.",

      "A U.S.-led peace plan that mirrors several key Russian demands has sent ripples across Europe, with leaders voicing concerns that it could leave Ukraine vulnerable and calling for changes to the proposals.",
      "European leaders and key allies met on the sidelines of the G20 summit in South Africa and said in a joint statement that the plan requires additional work, adding that they are \u201cconcerned by the proposed limitations on Ukraine\u2019s armed forces, which would leave Ukraine vulnerable to future attack.\u201d",
      "The statement was signed by leaders of Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Finland, Ireland, the Netherlands, Spain and Norway, as well as the European Union Commission and the E.U. Council. Japan\u2019s and Canada\u2019s leaders also signed on to the statement, which warns that \u201cborders must not be changed by force.\u201d",
      "President Donald Trump has set Thanksgiving as the deadline for Ukraine to agree to the 28-point framework, which suggests that Russia could be granted more territory than it holds and would place limits on Ukraine\u2019s army and prevent Kyiv from ever joining NATO \u2014 Moscow\u2019s long-sought demands.",
      "The U.S. proposals do include a security guarantee modeled on NATO\u2019s Article 5, which would commit the U.S. and European allies to treat a future attack on Ukraine as an attack on the entire trans-Atlantic community, according to a U.S. official, though there are few specifics on what that would entail.",
      "Top Ukrainian and U.S. officials will meet in Switzerland to discuss \u201cpossible parameters of a future peace,\u201d Rustem Umerov, the secretary of Ukraine\u2019s National Security and Defense Council, wrote on Telegram Saturday. Separately, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy\u2019s office said Saturday that the delegation has been confirmed for the talks, which \u201cwill take place in the coming days.\u201d",
      "The White House has described the plan as \u201cthe best win-win scenario, where both parties gain more than they must give,\u201d saying the proposals were crafted with input from Russia and Ukraine.",
      "However, analysts say the plan could amount to a dangerous capitulation for Ukraine, which has previously rejected plans that would require recognizing Russia\u2019s illegal annexations of the entire eastern Donetsk region and Crimea.",
      "\u201cEven if parts of this plan were to be shoved down Ukraine\u2019s throat, it would be the end of Ukraine as we know it. It\u2019s a real capitulation,\u201d Michael Bociurkiw, a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council\u2019s Eurasia Center, who was in Johannesburg, told NBC News by phone.",
      "The U.S. was facilitating a \u201cpotentially disastrous surrender for Ukraine,\u201d said Keir Giles, a senior consulting fellow at Chatham House, a London-based think tank.",
      "\u201cAnd now we will see yet another panicked scramble by European leaders to head off an outcome that would be disastrous for their own security,\u201d he said, adding that the European response toward \u201crepeated disastrous peace plans has been in words, not action.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere should be nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine,\u201d Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, said Friday in a post on X, adding European leaders will also meet in Angola next week.",
      "Ukraine must have a \u201cdecisive voice in peace talks,\u201d Polish President Karol Nawrocki said late Friday on X. \u201cThe price of peace cannot in any way be the achievement of strategic goals by the aggressor, and the aggressor was and remains the Russian Federation,\u201d he added.",
      "As European leaders mulled over the plan on the G20 summit\u2019s sidelines, notably absent was Trump, who is boycotting the event over his unfounded claims that South Africa\u2019s white minority is subject to hate crimes and land grabs.",
      "While Trump initially said Vice President JD Vance would attend, he later said there would be no U.S. delegation taking part. Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has an International Criminal Court warrant calling for his arrest, is also not attending.",
      "How much Europe will actually be able to influence the plan without U.S. involvement remains an open question, and one with implications for both Ukraine\u2019s borders and peace for the broader continent.",
      "\u201cThey can\u2019t influence this,\u201d said Bociurkiw. \u201cIt makes NATO and Europe look weak, and Putin will go on and on to cause more disruptions.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like a speed train and you have Putin and Trump on it, and then you have Zelenskyy on the departure platform and Europe stuck at the check-in counter,\u201d he added.",
      "Giles said the military aspects of the peace plan leave Ukraine effectively defenseless against a future Russian attack.",
      "\u201cAnd since Ukraine forms the front line of the defense of Europe, this is a potentially disastrous outcome for the continent as a whole,\u201d Giles said.",
      "Lawmakers in Ukraine aren\u2019t particularly happy with the plan either, with Victoria Podgorna from Zelenskyy\u2019s political party saying it was giving Russia \u201camnesty for launching a brutal war.\u201d",
      "Zelenskyy said Friday he had spoken with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and his counterparts in Germany and France, adding that he would also talk to Washington to ensure Kyiv\u2019s \u201cprincipled stances are taken into account.\u201d",
      "\u201cUkraine may now face a very difficult choice, either losing its dignity or the risk of losing a key partner, either the difficult 28 points, or a very difficult winter,\u201d Zelenskyy said, warning his country of a \u201cvery difficult, eventful\u201d week ahead.",
      "His warning also came as Ukraine suffers setbacks on the battlefield and Zelenskyy tries to contain the fallout from a $100 million corruption scandal implicating his top officials.",
      "On Saturday, the Russian defense ministry said it had captured two additional villages in eastern Ukraine, one in the Donetsk region and another in Zaporizhzhia.",
      "Russia's gains, both on the battlefield and in the proposed plan, have drawn a positive response from the Kremlin, where Putin has said it could \u201cform the basis of a final peace settlement,\u201d though adding it was not \u201csubstantively\u201d discussed with Russia.",
      "Meanwhile, two people were killed in Russia\u2019s southern city of Syzran in a Ukrainian strike on energy facilities, the regional governor, Vyacheslav Fedorishchev, said Saturday on Russia\u2019s state-backed Max messenger app."

    "summary": "As the UN Climate Change Conference was happening in Brazil, the Trump administration released proposals to open up offshore drilling and roll back protections for wetlands and endangered animals.",
    "story": [
      "As representatives from nearly 200 nations were wrapping up talks at the United Nations\u2019 COP30 climate summit this week, the United States was not only absent, but the Trump administration also introduced a series of sweeping proposals to roll back environmental protections and encourage fossil fuel drilling.",
      "The United Nations Climate Change Conference ended Friday in the Brazilian city of Bel\u00e9m, where delegates gathered to hammer out a road map to phase out fossil fuels, boost climate action and limit global warming.",
      "For the first time in the summit\u2019s history, the U.S. \u2014 one of the top emitters of greenhouse gases \u2014 did not send a delegation. Instead, the Trump administration this week announced a plan to open up new oil drilling off the coasts of California and Florida for the first time in decades and proposed rule changes to weaken the Endangered Species Act and limit the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s authority to protect wetlands and streams.",
      "\u201cThese rules double down on the administration\u2019s refusal to confront the climate crisis in a serious way and, in fact, move us in the opposite direction,\u201d said Jessie Ritter, associate vice president of waters and coasts for the National Wildlife Federation, a conservation group.",
      "The White House told NBC News on Friday that this week\u2019s \u201chistoric\u201d announcements aim to \u201cfurther President Trump\u2019s American energy dominance agenda.\u201d",
      "\u201cPresident Trump is reversing government overreach, restoring energy security, and protecting American jobs by rolling back excessive, burdensome regulations and creating new opportunities to \u2018DRILL, BABY, DRILL,\u2019\u201d White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said in a statement. \u201cPresident Trump serves the American people, not radical climate activists who have fallen victim to the biggest scam of the century.\u201d",
      "Ritter said the new proposals signal to the world just how much the U.S. has stepped back from any meaningful climate action.",
      "\u201cI doubt that this surprises folks who have been watching in the international arena,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it\u2019s unfortunate, given the example the U.S. sets and what our leadership, or lack thereof, emboldens other countries to do.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration's announcement on Thursday that it intends to open up roughly 1.27 billion acres of coastal U.S. waters for oil drilling drew bipartisan pushback.",
      "Although the American Petroleum Institute, a trade association for the oil and gas industry, hailed the program as a \u201chistoric step toward unleashing our nation\u2019s vast offshore resources,\u201d Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., pushed to uphold the current moratorium on drilling, which Trump extended during his first term.",
      "\u201cI have been speaking to @SecretaryBurgum and made my expectations clear that this moratorium must remain in place, and that in any plan, Florida\u2019s coasts must remain off the table for oil drilling to protect Florida\u2019s tourism, environment, and military training opportunities,\u201d Scott wrote Thursday on X, referring to Interior Secretary Doug Burgum.",
      "Across the country, California Gov. Gavin Newsom wrote on X that \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s idiotic proposal to sell off California\u2019s coasts to his Big Oil donors is dead in the water.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe will not stand by as our coastal economy and communities are put in danger,\u201d he said.",
      "The drilling directive came just three days after the Trump administration proposed major limits to the Clean Water Act of 1972 that would undo protections from pollution and runoff for most of the country\u2019s small streams and wetlands. The rule would narrow the definition of which bodies qualify as \u201cwaters of the United States\u201d under the act.",
      "If finalized, the changes would mean that the smallest share of freshwater resources would be under federal protection since the law was enacted, according to Jon Devine, who heads the water policy team at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental advocacy group.",
      "\u201cBy EPA\u2019s own estimate, only about 19% of the country\u2019s wetlands would be protected against unregulated destruction and development if this were finalized,\u201d Devine said.",
      "Wetlands act as buffers against flooding by absorbing and storing water during extreme rainfall and other high-runoff events. As the world warms, coastal and inland flooding is expected to become more frequent and severe.",
      "\u201cMany of the places that we already have in the U.S. that are increasingly flood-prone due to climate change are going to be even more in harm\u2019s way,\u201d Devine said.",
      "Wetlands and streams also feed into other bodies of water that serve as critical drinking water supplies across the country, so critics fear the policy could make drinking water unsafe in some communities.",
      "The third major environmental rollback announced this week was a set of four rules that would erode protections under the Endangered Species Act of 1973. The proposed changes aim to make it easier to remove species classified as threatened or endangered and harder to add new protected species and their habitats to the list. The rules, if passed, would also allow the government to consider \u201ceconomic impacts\u201d in decisions to list or delist species.",
      "Taken together, Ritter said, these three proposals are consistent with the Trump administration\u2019s deregulatory agenda.",
      "\u201cThese decisions prioritize short-term gain, often for a few industries and special interests, at the expense of things that have been widely bipartisan and important issues for people for decades,\u201d Ritter said.",
      "The impacts of the changes might not all be apparent right away, she added, but the scale of the long-term consequences could be immense.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s truly not an exaggeration that this is going to touch all Americans in some way,\u201d she said. \u201cEverything is connected, and it\u2019s hubris to think that we can have these massive negative effects on our streams and wetlands, our animals, our coastal waters, without impacts to humans.\u201d"

      "The 35-year-old has acute myeloid leukemia, with a rare mutation called Inversion 3.",
      "Schlossberg said she was diagnosed on May 25, 2024, the same day she gave birth to her second child. Hours after delivery, her doctor noticed her abnormally high white-blood-cell count and moved her to another floor for further testing.",
      "She initially dismissed the possibility of cancer and was stunned when the diagnosis was confirmed, saying she had considered herself \"one of the healthiest people\" she knew.",
      "\u201cThis could not possibly be my life,\u201d she wrote.",
      "Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a cancer that starts in the bone marrow and quickly moves into the blood, according to the American Cancer Society (ACS). General symptoms include weight loss, fatigue, fever, night sweats and loss of appetite.",
      "There are several subtypes of AML that are important in determining a person's prognosis, according to the ACS. Schlossberg's subtype \u2014an inversion of chromosome 3 \u2014 is listed as an unfavorable abnormality of AML on the ACS website.",
      "Schlossberg spent five weeks at Columbia Presbyterian after her daughter\u2019s birth before her blast-cell count dropped enough for her to begin chemotherapy at home. Her care later moved to Memorial Sloan Kettering, where she underwent a bone-marrow transplant and spent more than 50 days before returning home for more treatment.",
      "In January, Schlossberg joined a clinical trial for CAR T-cell therapy. She wrote that much of the treatment unfolded from her hospital bed as her cousin, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., was nominated and confirmed as secretary of health and human services, a role she believes he was unqualified for.",
      "Schlossberg thanked her husband and her family for their support and for countless days spent at her bedside.",
      "\u201cMy parents and my brother and sister, too, have been raising my children and sitting in my various hospital rooms almost every day for the last year and a half,\u201d she added.",
      "Her brother, Jack Schlossberg, announced earlier this month that he is running for Congress. The 32-year-old is running for the New York City seat that has long been held by Democratic Rep. Jerry Nadler, who in September announced he will not seek re-election.",
      "Despite all of Tatiana Schlossberg\u2019s treatments, she said, the cancer continued to return.",
      "\u201cDuring the latest clinical trial, my doctor told me that he could keep me alive for a year, maybe,\u201d she wrote. \u201cMy first thought was that my kids, whose faces live permanently on the inside of my eyelids, wouldn\u2019t remember me.\u201d",
      "Schlossberg is now trying her best to be in the present with her children.",
      "By profession a writer, for several years Schlossberg was a reporter for the science section of The New York Times, where she covered climate change and the environment.",
      "Schlossberg\u2019s essay comes on the 62nd anniversary of her grandfather\u2019s assassination, adding her diagnosis to a long history of tragedy within the Kennedy family.",
      "John F. Kennedy\u2019s son, John F. Kennedy Jr., and his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, died in a plane crash in 1999.",

    "summary": "An NBC News analysis of one month of Musk\u2019s social media posts shows what\u2019s been on his mind, including a broad cross-section of fringe political topics.",
    "story": [
      "Elon Musk can\u2019t stop posting about the political fringe.",
      "In recent weeks, the world\u2019s wealthiest person used X to post about immigrants to Britain, saying they will cause the country\u2019s collapse. He posted about examples of violent crime in Minnesota and South Carolina \u2014 where he does not live \u2014 and about judges in California and New York he believes are too lenient. Musk also smeared trans people, complained about Black-on-white crime, stoked fear about the end of civilization and shared his thoughts about the race of child actors.",
      "Musk posted about all those topics and more in a recent one-month period, during which NBC News tracked and analyzed all of his posts for an in-depth look at where the tech billionaire focuses his attention online.",
      "Musk left his role in the second Trump administration in May to focus on his companies, and since then he has continued to share a torrent of content on his social media site. Between Sept. 17 and Oct. 17, Musk posted, replied to or shared content 1,716 times on his X account \u2014 about 55 times a day, on average.",
      "Some of his messages invoke extreme ideas, like the antisemitic \u201cgreat replacement\u201d conspiracy theory, which says there is a top-down plot organized by Jewish people to replace the white populations of the United States and Europe with nonwhite people. Musk backed the same false theory two years ago, causing a backlash among X advertisers. Though he later said he was \u201caspirationally Jewish\u201d and not antisemitic, he continues to share the conspiracy theory. He also shared the baseless conspiracy theory that the FBI staged the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.",
      "An NBC News analysis of his online activity shows that while Musk may have shifted some of his day-to-day attention back to his companies, his public presence on X is a mix of promoting his business and weighing in on issues that are typically the focus of the far right.",
      "Nearly half of his posts, 49%, during the period reviewed by NBC News were about politically charged topics. NBC News classified a post as political if it related to a government official, a political commentator or a policy debate.",
      "Musk\u2019s presence on X serves to maintain his political influence as he considers whether and how to become involved in the 2026 midterms or the presidential campaign that will follow.",
      "Musk did not respond to a request for comment on the NBC News analysis.",
      "\u201cHe can make himself inescapable,\u201d said Thad Kousser, a political science professor at the University of California, San Diego.",
      "\u201cRegardless of his links at any time to Donald Trump or to Democrats, he still has the potential to capture eyeballs and thus potentially votes,\u201d he said.",
      "About 41% of his posts during the same time period were about his companies. His AI startup, xAI, was his most frequent business topic, coming up in 21% of his posts. He touched on automaker Tesla in about 11% of posts and on rocket company SpaceX about 6% of the time.",
      "Taken together, the posts offer a near real-time look at what is on the mind of one of the richest and most powerful people in the world as he oversees buzzy companies that fulfill major government contracts or move markets as part of the \u201cmagnificent seven.\u201d This month, Tesla shareholders approved a new CEO pay package that could be worth up to $1 trillion if the company meets a series of benchmarks. Musk counts more than 229 million followers on X, and his posts regularly get millions of views.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s not just the wealthiest person alive. He\u2019s also one of the most influential, even if he has no formal role in government,\u201d said Rob Lalka, a business professor at Tulane University who studies the tech industry\u2019s impact on politics.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s both really good at spotting what will soon be trending and also being one of the people who is defining that in this cultural moment,\u201d he said.",
      "During the month that NBC News analyzed, Musk engaged with ideas on the fringe of politics, including an unapologetic attitude toward past British colonialism and a proposed nationwide purge of judges based on a Central American precedent. In an offhand remark, he appeared to claim Mars as legal territory of the United States.",
      "\u201cThat is not what most average people are sitting around spending their time on, especially in an economy where real wages are not great,\u201d Lalka said. \u201cMost Americans are worried about the price of eggs right now.\u201d",
      "Musk, who said he voted for Democrats in 2016 and 2020, has shifted sharply to the right in recent years. During last year\u2019s campaign, he aligned himself with Trump, made appearances in key swing states and poured more than $290 million into Republican efforts. He then joined Trump\u2019s administration as a White House adviser and the head of Trump\u2019s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).",
      "Musk\u2019s foray into government was rough. He repeatedly clashed with other Trump administration officials over the extent of his authority, DOGE did not drastically affect the federal budget deficit, and the cuts it did make have been blamed by public health researchers for hundreds of thousands of deaths worldwide.",
      "Tesla, where he is CEO, became a political target, and shares of the company took a beating. In May, he said he was leaving the administration to spend his time at Tesla and limit any more government work to a day or two a week. When he left the White House, Tesla investors cheered.",
      "With his White House stint in the rearview mirror, Musk said in September that he was \u201cburning the midnight oil\u201d at work, with weekend meetings related to Tesla and xAI as he crisscrossed the country to visit employees in person.",
      "\u201cDaddy is very much home,\u201d he wrote on Sept. 15.",
      "Musk also took to his social media platform. One in eight of his posts in the month NBC News reviewed were about crime \u2014 slightly more than the share devoted to Tesla \u2014 even as crime rates continued to fall. In a Gallup poll in October, only 6% of Americans listed crime as the most important problem facing the country.",
      "His posts were often targeted at influencing current events. In early October, before Trump decided against sending federal troops to San Francisco, Musk helped to fuel a narrative that crime was out of control in the city. He posted about crime there 13 times over two days, despite San Francisco experiencing the fewest homicides since 1954.",
      "\u201cI think he is mostly speaking to people who already agree with him,\u201d said Darren Linvill, a co-director of Clemson University\u2019s Media Forensics Hub. \u201cHe\u2019s not necessarily persuading anyone to come join him. But that still serves a function to maintain his influence and presence as a political actor.\u201d",
      "Musk has gone after judges and prosecutors who he said were too lenient. He posted about judges 52 times, including twice when he called for the wholesale removal of \u201ccorrupt\u201d judges and cited purges in El Salvador as a model for the United States.",
      "Often, Musk focused on cases where the criminal defendants were Black, immigrants or both, and where the victims were white, appearing to play into narratives about interracial crime that are common in conservative media. Experts say there is no evidence of a migrant-driven crime wave, and most violent crime occurs between a victim and a perpetrator of the same race, according to Justice Department survey data.",
      "In the 31 days that NBC News analyzed, Musk posted about violent crime every day but two.",
      "Immigration was the second-most frequent political topic on Musk\u2019s mind. About 8% of his posts touched on the subject, often aligning with the Trump administration\u2019s own harsh language. He shared immigration-related posts from Vice President JD Vance four times, from the official White House account twice and from White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller once. Musk also accused officials in Democratic-led cities of \u201ctreason\u201d for resisting immigration enforcement.",
      "Musk\u2019s opposition to immigration was global, criticizing politicians in Europe and Asia for allowing in migrants. He warned that mass immigration would \u201cdestroy Japan\u201d and lead to \u201cthe end of Britain.\u201d Musk, a native South African who became a U.S. citizen in 2002, is an immigrant himself.",
      "Joan Donovan, an assistant professor of journalism and emerging media studies at Boston University, said Musk\u2019s frequent posts related to the decline of Western civilization are a thinly veiled callout to racial politics.",
      "\u201cThis is, of course, a dog whistle about white identity politics and for people who are expressly proud of being white and unapologetic about their own beliefs in white supremacy,\u201d she said.",
      "She said that Musk\u2019s embrace of fringe topics, such as a purge of judges, is the kind of content that used to be confined to the internet\u2019s darkest corners.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s really reflective of some of the grossest places on Reddit or the type of posting you\u2019d see on 4chan. It\u2019s become a reality-distortion machine,\u201d she said.",
      "But lately, racist rhetoric has been surging in the open, with white nationalists such as Nick Fuentes finding more mainstream footing on Musk\u2019s X and in other venues.",
      "Race was a major theme in Musk\u2019s posts. Musk, or those whose posts he shared, often depicted Black people in a negative light, and they often did so regardless of the topic at hand.",
      "Photos of Black criminal defendants appear to get Musk\u2019s attention. Forty-one times during the month \u2014 more than once a day, on average \u2014 Musk shared or replied to a post that had an image of a Black person charged with a crime.",
      "He posted about alleged Black criminals in Florida, Germany, Minnesota, New York, North Carolina and elsewhere, and in many of the cases the defendants were charged with harming white victims. Sometimes, Musk would include an ominous warning such as, \u201cHe will kill again.\u201d One post from another user, the actor James Woods, had eight photos: four Black defendants and four white victims. Woods wrote: \u201cSad.\u201d Musk replied: \u201cYes.\u201d",
      "Once, when an account denounced six amendments to the U.S. Constitution, including the post-Civil War 15th Amendment, which guarantees the right to vote regardless of race, and the 19th Amendment, which guarantees the right to vote regardless of sex, Musk responded with the \u201ctears of joy\u201d emoji. And on five occasions, Musk replied to or shared content from two accounts that regularly post white supremacist views.",
      "There were six posts where Musk portrayed Black people in a positive light: two from a Black influencer saying that Democrats had failed Black Americans, and four posts in which Black people praised conservative influencer Charlie Kirk after his death.",
      "Musk spent a lot of time posting about perceived enemies: About 1 in 5 of his posts during the month, or 21%, fell into that category, which for Musk included the news media, civil rights organizations, Hollywood, OpenAI and numerous people who identify as transgender.",
      "Beyond politics, one of Musk\u2019s frequent topics is himself. About 6% of his posts during the month referenced his own quotes, videos of interviews he has given or other bits of his life story and the mythology surrounding it. Sometimes he engages in conversation with accounts such as @ElonClipsX, @muskonomy or @muskosophy.",
      "When the account @muskosophy posted a quote of his in September \u2014 \u201cYou don\u2019t have a soul, you are a soul\u201d \u2014 Musk responded, \u201cYes.\u201d"

      "The National Women's Soccer League final is set to be a grudge match between NY/NJ Gotham FC and the Washington Spirit, a fierce regional rivalry known for its high-energy play on the field.",
      "The East Coast opponents will meet at PayPal Park in San Jose, California, at 8 p.m. ET Saturday (CBS/Paramount+) in the culmination of a highly competitive season for the women's league. It's their fourth matchup this year, in what fans have dubbed the \"District v. Empire\" feud.",
      "Spirit defender Tara McKeown said after the semifinal that every time her team faces NY/NJ, \"something crazy happens.\"",
      "For the Spirit, it is a chance at redemption after having fallen short in the championship game last year.",
      "Gotham, meanwhile, aims to prove the naysayers wrong after a major offseason shake-up. It will also look to avenge its loss to a Spirit team that knocked it out of contention last year in a nail-biting playoff semifinal that ended in a penalty shootout. Gotham defeated the Spirit 3-0 this season, and the following two matches this year ended in draws.",
      "The Spirit moved on from Gotham last year to play the championship game against the Orlando Pride after a strong season that ended riddled with injuries. It ended up as a Cinderella story for the Pride, which won its first title, but a devastating blow for the capital city's squad.",
      "A roster full of talent has allowed the team to remain consistent even though it started its season without its 2024 NWSL Rookie of the Year, Croix Bethune, and with star forward Trinity Rodman struggling with injury through the year.",
      "Forward Gift Monday, who signed a three-year deal with the Spirit in March, has been an unexpected star for the team as she has led the squad with 10 goals in the regular season. Monday, 23, rejoined the team for the playoffs this month after having attended her father's funeral in Nigeria.",
      "She scored in both of the team's playoff games, dedicating the goals to her late father.",
      "Gotham's road to the NWSL finals was paved with bumps as it navigated the loss of stars such as Lynn Biyendolo, Crystal Dunn, Yazmeen Ryan and Jenna Nighswonger during the offseason. It also started the year without national star Rose Lavelle and lost its captain, Tierna Davidson, to an ACL tear in the third game of its season.",
      "But the team was buoyed by Spanish national Esther Gonzalez, who was second in the NWSL's golden boot race, and 2024 NWSL Goalkeeper of the Year Ann-Katrin Berger.",
      "Reconfiguring both its attack and its defense, Gotham has had something of an erratic year as it jumped up and down the standings. Though the team was third in the league in September, it dropped to eighth \u2014 the last spot for the playoffs \u2014 in November.",
      "Gotham defeated the Kansas City Current, the top NWSL team this year, in a shocking quarterfinal upset and went on to defeat the Pride on Sunday. Both games featured goals by midfielder Jaedyn Shaw, whom Gotham acquired from the North Carolina Courage in September in a record-setting $1.25 million transfer deal.",
      "Shaw called out Gotham's doubters, saying \"underdogs my ass\" at a team news conference after the Current game. She told ESPN on Sunday after she scored a game-winning free kick that she was happy to be going to the finals with Gotham.",
      "\"This team is so gritty; this team fights to the very end,\" she said. \"This team plays for each other, and it's contagious.\""

      "This article was published in partnership with Bloomberg Law.",
      "Dozens of pregnant women who are jailed, often for petty crimes, are miscarrying or giving birth in excruciating pain into cell toilets and on filthy jail floors. Their babies are suffering infections and long-lasting health issues. Some die.",
      "Bloomberg Law and NBC News analyzed federal lawsuits and found at least 54 pregnant women or their families alleged severe mistreatment or medical neglect in county jails from 2017 to 2024. The catastrophes they describe signal a much larger problem, since filing a federal lawsuit is difficult, experts said.",
      "Most of the women in these cases were arrested on nonviolent charges that included probation violations, theft and drug possession. They were housed in jails, largely intended for short-term detention as criminal cases unfold, not prisons, which are for punishment after convictions.",
      "Here is a look at their cases:",
      "There\u2019s no way to be certain whether the pregnancy complications the women experienced occurred because of their time behind bars. About 10% to 20% of known pregnancies end in miscarriage. Stillbirths occur in about 1 out of 175 births.",
      "But unsanitary conditions and limited access to prenatal care, medical providers and critical medication are factors that can affect a healthy birth or contribute to preterm labor.",

    "summary": "Oscar-winning actor, Michelle Yeoh, talks \"Wicked: For Good,\" what it took to transform into Madame Morrible and the \"sisterhood\" she shares with her co-stars.",
    "story": [
      "Warning: Spoilers ahead for \"Wicked\" and \"Wicked: For Good.\"",
      "According to Michelle Yeoh, the real witches in \"Wicked\" aren't the ones you immediately think of. And she'd know, because she's one of them.",
      "\"There were only two witches in the Land of Oz,\" Yeoh tells TODAY.com in a sit-down interview. \"It was Madame Morrible and Elphaba.\"",
      "That may come as a surprise to fans of the \"Wizard of Oz\" who think that when it comes to \"Wicked's\" witches, that distinction belongs to the Wicked Witch of the West, Elphaba (Cynthia Erivo), and Glinda the Good Witch (Ariana Grande).",
      "But to know the musical is to remember that the only two people with any sort of magical ability in Oz are, in fact, Elphaba and Morrible, not Glinda and definitely not The Wizard.",
      "That's why Yeoh says her character, Madame Morrible, initially aligns herself with Elphaba, before ultimately becoming her biggest adversary.",
      "\"She didn't have quite the gift and talent as Elphaba did. But at that moment, she thought, 'I found my muse. I couldn't do it, but now I have someone who can help me get to where I think it's for the goodness of Oz,'\" explains Yeoh of Madame Morrible's less-than-honorable intentions for the young sorcerer.",
      "If that's not enough to convince you that Morrible is the true wicked witch of the story, consider her initials: \"MM.\" Turn them upside down and what have you got? \"WW,\" which stands for \u2014 you guessed it \u2014\u00a0Wicked Witch.",
      "Without revealing too much, it's safe to say that Madame Morrible gets the ending she deserves in \"Wicked: For Good.\" Even so, it's hard not to wonder if, in spite of her malicious intent, there's anything redeeming about the character.",
      "\"I think the lesson to be learned here is don't get corrupted by your own desires and ambition,\" says Yeoh. \"Because (Madame Morrible) forgot about compassion and kindness, which is something she had right at the beginning. And then she got lost in her own tempest.\"",
      "Bringing the 'Scary' to Madame Morrible",
      "Fresh off the heels of her Oscar win for \"Everything Everywhere All At Once\" in 2023, Yeoh stepped into the shoes of the \"Wicked\" character. To portray Madame Morrible, Yeoh says she drew on past experience to give Shiz\u2019s imposing headmistress her commanding presence.",
      "\"I think everything that I've done, especially in the physicality of my life, whether ... from ballet, to contemporary dance, to sports, to diving, to all these kind of things, helped me focus the stillness rather than the chaotic movement.\"",
      "Instead of playing Morrible as an over-the-top villain, Yeoh says she took a more subtle approach and worked at curating Morrible's icy but alluring appeal.",
      "\"This is how she would command respect and awe. It's like, how does she charm them? She draws them in,\" explains Yeoh. \"That's the most scary of all \u2014 when they're charming and personable and they listen to you and it seems like you're the only one in her world.\"",
      "\"With Madame Morrible, this was an art form that she needed to have to have that gravitas,\" she continues.",
      "Morrible's high-collared costumes and elaborate up-dos also contributed to her intimidating stature, Yeoh says.",
      "\"It was the combination of everything that helped me build Madame Morrible to when she walks out, you go back and go, 'Alright, not going to mess with you!'\"",
      "It's not the first time Yeoh has used her inner stillness to bring a character to life. She says she also channeled it for her work in  \"Memoirs of a Geisha\" and the hit 2018 rom-com, \"Crazy Rich Asians,\" which was also directed by Jon M. Chu.",
      "\"The mother, Mrs. Eleanor Young, is also a very commanding figure without being loud, she never raises her voice, but when she speaks with her tone, every gesture is measured with intention. It's not frivolous. It's nothing like that,\" Yeoh says.",
      "\"So, when she stops to look at you, you go, \"Okayyyy,\" she adds.",
      "Forging a Sisterhood",
      "Based on the 1995 Gregory Maguire book, \"Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West,\" bringing the films \"Wicked\" and \"Wicked: For Good\" to the big screen has been a decades-long endeavor that began back in the early 2000s.",
      "Yeoh joined the cast in 2022 and filmed the original and sequel simultaneously along with the rest of the cast, including Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo.",
      "\"You will miss (them), because at the end of the day, you've built up such a great bond and it's a family,\" says Yeoh, who explains that while goodbyes can be hard, they're also an inevitable part of the business.",
      "\"This is how it is, but the good news is if you really bonded, they'll always be there. I'm still in touch with Jamie Lee Curtis, and it's been so many years. And 'Crazy Rich Asians,' we still have a group chat,\" she says.",
      "As for Grande and Erivo, Yeoh says that even though the films are done, what she takes away from her co-stars is a lasting sisterhood.",
      "\"We champion each other. We believe in each other. We support each other. No questions asked, let's just go forward, up and above, let's just do it together,\" Yeoh says.",
      "\"And when we're not with each other, we don't forget that will always have the bond.\""

She yells at Elphaba for trying to help animals instead of her. As a result, Elphaba opens her Grimmerie and casts a spell on Nessarose, giving her the ability to fly.",
      "Fans of the stage musical remember that in this scene, Elphaba\u2019s spell gives Nessarose, who uses a wheelchair, the ability to walk.",
      "Marissa Bode is the first actor to play Nessarose and use a wheelchair off-screen. She previously told TODAY that the change from walking to flying in \u201cWicked: For Good\u201d represents \u201cless of a case of my character wanting to be fixed, and more of her just taking in the magic itself.\u201d",
      "Glinda Performs \u2018Wonderful\u2019 With the Wizard",
      "After trying to get her sister\u2019s support, Elphaba goes directly to the Emerald City to try and take on the Wizard.",
      "There, he again tries to get her to join forces with him via a song called \u201cWonderful.\u201d",
      "But in the film, Glinda joins the pair for the song. \u201cWonderful\u201d becomes a duet between Glinda and the Wizard as they both try to convince Elphaba to return to the public\u2019s good graces.",
      "Glinda and Fiyero Almost Get Married",
      "In the stage musical, Glinda and Fiyero are engaged before he ultimately abandons her to run off with Elphaba. In \u201cWicked: For Good,\u201d they almost made it down the aisle.",
      "When Elphaba goes to the Emerald City, it turns out to be on Glinda and Fiyero\u2019s wedding day.",
      "After Elphaba\u2019s almost been convinced to join Glinda and the Wizard through their rendition of \u201cWonderful,\u201d she asks the Wizard to free the flying monkeys she accidentally created in Part 1. He complies \u2014 but then she uncovers a secret crevice where the Wizard had kept in cages dozens of animals, including Elphaba\u2019s former professor Dr. Dillamond, preventing them from speaking. Outraged, Elphaba frees all the animals, interrupting Glinda as she walks down the aisle.",
      "\u201cWe wanted the stakes to be higher,\u201d Chu says of the change. \u201cWe wanted to make this sort of intercut parallel between her getting married and (Elphaba\u2019s) reality of finding these animals in cages. The fact that these two, dream and nightmare, could collide at this intersection was really important to break the story.\u201d",
      "When Fiyero, who\u2019s captain of the guard, later finds Elphaba, he decides to escape with her, breaking Glinda\u2019s heart.",
      "Viewers See Dorothy \u2014 But Never Her Face",
      "\u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d and its characters are intertwined with \u201cWicked\u2019s\u201d story. For example, Boq and Fiyero famously become the Tin Man and the Scarecrow, while the cub that Fiyero and Elphaba rescue as students grows up to be the Cowardly Lion. But what about Dorothy?",
      "In the stage musical, Dorothy is merely seen as a shadow throwing water on Elphaba in the film\u2019s finale. But \u201cWicked: For Good\u201d cast Bethany Weaver to play the part.",
      "Throughout the film, viewers can see Dorothy, her brunette pigtails and her blue plaid dress, but only from the back. Her face is never seen.",
      "That decision was easy, says Chu.",
      "\u201cThere was a mantra that we were taught when we first started this from the people who did the stage show, and they said, \u2018The key is it\u2019s about the girls, stupid.\u2019 ... That has guided our way the whole time,\u201d he says.",
      "\u201cWhen it comes to Dorothy and all these other characters, those are really fun things, but in movie language, if you see her face, you\u2019re going to want to know who she is, where she comes from, what does she want \u2014 and then the story takes a way left turn,\u201d he adds. \u201cAnd this is \u2018about the girls, stupid.\u2019\u201d",
      "Glinda Formally Takes Over as a Leader of Oz",
      "After witnessing Fiyero\u2019s capture and Madame Morrible\u2019s cruelty, Glinda weighs whether to do something or stay complacent in the film\u2019s second brand new song, \u201cGirl in the Bubble.\u201d",
      "\u201cPart of deconstructing the fairy tale \u2014 which is sort of the point of \u2018Wicked,\u2019 to see this American fairytale in a new way, through a new perspective \u2014 part of that was understanding not just what what Elphaba was going through, but also what it means for somebody in a bubble of privilege when the truth is coming out,\u201d Chu says.",
      "\u201cAt what point does someone who doesn\u2019t have to be affected by this, what kind of courage does it take to actually pop your own bubble and engage and help somebody else? I think that that\u2019s such an important lesson in these days, that courage \u2014 no matter where you missed the moment \u2014 courage has no expiration date, and that we still have time to be the people who we see ourselves as,\u201d he adds.",
      "She ultimately chooses to go to Elphaba\u2019s side. The best friends briefly reconcile with \u201cFor Good\u201d before Elphaba fakes her own death. After escaping, Glinda returns to the Emerald City, forces the departure of the Wizard, arrests Madame Morrible and takes over as a leader of Oz.",
      "And in a slight expansion from the musical, we see exactly what she does with that newfound power: Free the animals.",
      "The Grimmerie Opens for Glinda",
      "Finally, the very end of \u201cWicked: For Good\u201d introduces a scene that is meant to spark discourse. As Elphaba and Fiyero escape to the Lands Beyond Oz, Glinda looks out over the Emerald City. The magic book, the Grimmerie, which Elphaba entrusted to her before her \u201cdeath,\u201d suddenly comes alive and opens beside Glinda.",
      "There are theories about what the Grimmerie\u2019s opening means, even among the cast and crew. Some think it represents Glinda finally having the potential to be a true witch, while others say it\u2019s a message from Elphaba to Glinda.",
      "\u201cWhat I think is great about this book of knowledge, the Grimmerie, I mean, it can be interpreted as many things,\u201d Chu says."

      "\"We needed it in the story and how we wanted to really dive into each character,\" he says in an interview with TODAY.com.",
      "Both songs were written by the original composer and lyricist for \"Wicked,\" Stephen Schwartz, and both are ballads. In \"No Place Like Home,\" Elphaba tries to get the animals to change their minds about fleeing Oz.

      "Throughout the film, Glinda's ability to trust the Wizard and Madame Morrible is tested. After her fianc\u00e9, Fiyero (Jonathan Bailey), and Elphaba run away together on Glinda's wedding day, she helps draw Elphaba out of hiding by targeting her sister, Nessarose (Marissa Bode).",

Glinda escapes on horseback, shrouded in a black cape. (Yes, Glinda was the mysterious figure we saw escaping a castle in the very first scene of the first \u201cWicked\u201d movie.) She goes on to assume power in Oz as she mourns her best friend\u2019s death.",
      "Only Elphaba isn\u2019t dead. She\u2019s hiding in a trapdoor, waiting for her beloved Fiyero (Jonathan Bailey) to meet her before they leave for the Land Beyond Oz together.",
      "From there, viewers get a bit of a twist before the movie concludes. Here\u2019s what happens.",
      "How \u2018Wicked: For Good\u2019 Ends",
      "The stage version of \u201cWicked\u201d ends with Elphaba and Fiyero leaving Oz, and Glinda stepping into a position of power.",
      "But in \u201cWicked: For Good,\u201d viewers see what happens to Glinda after she becomes Oz\u2019s leader. First, she officially declares the land welcome to all animals again.",
      "In the final scene, Glinda looks over the Emerald City as Elphaba and Fiyero trek through a desert to leave Oz. Elphaba looks back for a brief moment. Then Elphaba\u2019s book of spells, the Grimmerie, flutters to life before Glinda\u2019s eyes. Elphaba had given the book to Glinda before Elphaba\u2019s encounter with Dorothy.",
      "As established in the first film, the Grimmerie only opens for and can be read by a true witch, something that, as much as she tried \u2014  whether through begging Madame Morrible (Michelle Yeoh) for sorcery lessons or twirling her practice wand \u2014 Glinda decidedly was not.",
      "So what does the Grimmerie opening mean?",
      "We asked the team behind \u201cWicked: For Good\u201d for their takes on the final scene. See what director Jon M. Chu and stars Cynthia Erivo, Jeff Goldblum and Jonathan Bailey had to say.",
      "How \u2018Wicked: For Good\u2019 Stars Interpret the Ending",
      "Chu declines to say \u201cexactly what (the ending) is\u201d by his intention.",
      "But he points to all the different interpretations of what the Grimmerie, \u201ca book of knowledge,\u201d could be, relative to both Glinda and Elphaba.",
      "\u201cWhether (Glinda) finally gets to be who she\u2019s meant to be, that she\u2019s not reliant on this image in this mirror,\u201d Chu says. \u201cShe didn\u2019t say, \u2018I\u2019m going to be good.\u2019 She says, \u2018I\u2019m going to try to be good.\u2019",
      "\u201cJust the effort of trying to be who we\u2019re supposed to be opens and unlocks our unlimited possibilities,\u201d he adds.",
      "The spontaneous opening of the Grimmerie could also relate to the film\u2019s theme of pursuing the truth amid propaganda. By the end of the film, Elphaba\u2019s reputation as the Wicked Witch of the West as told in \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d is upended by political lies told by the nonmagical Wizard of Oz and, as actor Michelle Yeoh says, the true wicked witch, Madame Morrible. But while viewers know the truth, in the world of the movie, Ozians do not, after Elphaba tells Glinda not to clear her name.",
      "\u201cIt could also be, Cynthia could be Jesus giving us, the humans, this Bible and saying, you know the truth, now what are you going to do with it?\u201d Chu says.",
      "\u201cI think it is a challenge to us as the audience, whereas maybe movie one was more of an answer. This is more a question and challenge for us to see how we\u2019re going to tell our story to the next generation,\u201d he adds.",
      "Erivo says Elphaba leaving the Grimmerie behind represents her entrusting it to Glinda.",
      "\u201cI think Elphaba\u2019s powers exist independent of the Grimmerie, and because she has certain powers, she\u2019s able to read the Grimmerie. It\u2019s like she and Grimmerie have an intrinsic relationship, and so the Grimmerie answers to her,\u201d she explains.",
      "\u201cBut her leaving it behind and trusting it to Glinda essentially tells the Grimmerie, \u2018You\u2019re in new hands, trust this person,\u2019\u201d she adds.",
      "But that doesn\u2019t mean Elphaba\u2019s lost her connection with the book. She says she believes Elphaba in fact can see the Grimmerie opening for Glinda.",
      "\u201cShe has visions, so I think she can see what happens, and she can feel it. And it opening means to her that, one, Glinda\u2019s made the right decision, and two, the Grimmerie trusts Glinda now, so everything\u2019s going to be fine,\u201d she says.",
      "But does Glinda know Elphaba is watching over her?",
      "\u201cI think she\u2019s aware that Elphaba has something to do with it (opening), but I don\u2019t think she\u2019s aware that Elphaba\u2019s alive,\u201d Erivo says.",
      "As for Goldblum, who stars as the Wizard of Oz, he is curious what leaving the Grimmerie behind means for Elphaba\u2019s powers. He also wonders: Why couldn\u2019t Elphaba trust Glinda with the knowledge that they survived?",
      "\u201cWhy couldn\u2019t she trust that, \u2018Hey we\u2019re going to be OK, don\u2019t try to contact us ... Don\u2019t tell anybody that we faked it.\u2019 I don\u2019t know,\u201d Goldblum says. \u201cOr, is the loss that (Glinda) experiences the portal, the thing that triggers her power. Her ability to go through that loss of the greatest love that she\u2019s ever had with Elphaba, does that trigger her ability to power?\u201d",
      "As for the opening of the Grimmerie, Goldblum says it\u2019s possible for Elphaba to \u201ctelepathically\u201d \u201ccommune\u201d with Glinda across space.",
      "\u201cDoes Glinda go, \u2018I don\u2019t think I did that. Are you out there somewhere. Are you OK?\u2019\u201d he adds. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s meant to be ambiguous.\u201d",
      "Like Goldblum, Bailey believes there\u2019s a chance the opening of the Grimmerie was Elphaba sending Glinda a message.",
      "\u201cI think that the answers always lie in the Grimmerie, and I do think it\u2019s particularly thrilling to see the Grimmerie come alive for someone ... (with) the absolute knowledge that she has no magic and that she has no power,\u201d he says.",
      "\u201cTo see the Grimmerie come alive feels to me like a transference and a conversation between the two women.\u201d",
      "He believes this, even if it\u2019s not so literal of a conversation or message.",
      "\u201cAs we know with grief as well, those people do always exist in a different form, don\u2019t they? In a metaphysical sense, they are still living on together,\u201d he adds.",
      "Holzman, who wrote the book for \u201cWicked\u201d and co-wrote the screenplays for both films with writer Dana Fox, says the goal for the ending was to create a \u201cmystical moment.\u201d",
      "\u201cWith something mystical, it\u2019s not like the whole point is you know the answer, it\u2019s that it pulls something out of you, like a spiritual feeling,\u201d she says.",
      "One interpretation of the Grimmerie opening, Holzman says, has to do with the evolution of Glinda\u2019s character.",
      "\u201cShe was willing to let go ... of all the need to be admired in this empty way. And she was willing to be humble, to be a student, to say, \u2018I don\u2019t know everything,\u2019\u201d Holzman says.",
      "Fox adds that the moment Glinda \u201cearns\u201d the Grimmerie opening is when she admits her \u201cdeepest shame\u201d to Elphaba: that she can\u2019t read the Grimmerie and perform spells.",
      "\u201cShe wanted so much to be that magical creature who could make magic happen, and she\u2019s going to end up being that, but it\u2019s going to take hard work,\u201d Holzman says. \u201cAnd to me, the Grimmerie opening is like the Grimmerie saying, \u2018OK, you\u2019re ready.\u2019\u201d",
      "But the question remains: Does Elphaba know?",
      "\u201cI think the thing that really is up to interpretation that everyone should just talk about amongst themselves is, Does Elphaba know? Did she have anything to do with it? I think that is something that just everyone should decide for themselves,\u201d Fox says."

      "On Nov. 20, the 40-year-old musician uploaded a vlog to YouTube, marking his \u201clong overdue\u201d comeback to the video style that he used during the early days of his career. The 15-minute clip began with footage of him on his Nashville farm and ended with Jelly Roll deciding to shave his beard for the first time in over a decade.",
      "He shared that he wanted to shave his beard as he continues his weight loss journey.",
      "\u201cAt this point, I\u2019m sure some of y\u2019all are exhausted about hearing about my weight loss. But a lot of things change when you start losing weight. You realize things. One of the things I realized is I don\u2019t know what I look like. I\u2019ve had a beard to try to cover up my double chin,\u201d he said.",
      "Jelly Roll added, \u201cThe last time my face was shaved I was fresh out of jail.\u201d",
      "He predicted that he might resemble a Ninja Turtle after shaving his facial hair, but said he wanted to go through with it so he could surprise his family with his new appearance.

      "\u201cI don\u2019t care what artists say. I don\u2019t care what artists act like. I\u2019m going to tell you the real truth. There\u2019s not an artist in the world that didn\u2019t grow up watching the Grammys when they were a kid and walk in their bedrooms afterwards and rehearse their speech,\u201d he said. \u201cGod will take something that\u2019s either normal and make it extremely abnormal or he will take something that\u2019s already incredible and make it absolutely mesmerizing, and that\u2019s the case here.\u201d",
      "He said that now he gets to celebrate this achievement while in \u201cthe best headspace.\u201d",
      "\u201cI see all my friends in this category. But then I just see standing there is this album called \u2018Beautifully Broken,\u2019\u201d he added. \u201cMan, if that doesn\u2019t represent what\u2019s happening in the world right now. I think more than ever\u2026 I think we can find beauty in what\u2019s happening. Win, lose or draw. Holy f---, dude, we won.\u201d",

      "\u201cI thought my chin went at least a half inch further than it actually went, f---. I didn\u2019t know. Failed science experiment, y\u2019all!\u201d he said.",
      "Jelly Roll uploaded the snippet of his newly shaven face to Instagram, too. Celebrity friends complimented him about his Grammy nominations beneath the post.",
      "Charlie Puth said, \u201cVery inspiring man.\u201d",
      "Country singer Carly Pearce echoed that sentiment, calling Jelly Roll \u201can inspiration.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, fans gave their approval of his look.",

      "\u201cHey i love ninja turtles,\u201d a third wrote.",
      "This is the latest dramatic transformation Jelly Roll has shared with his fans. Over the past year, he has also opened up repeatedly about losing weight.",
      "While appearing on \u201cJimmy Kimmel Live!\u201d in April, he said his goal was to be under 250 pounds before explaining why losing weight is important to him.",
      "\u201cTo do all the fun stuff in life, you\u2019ve gotta be under 250,\u201d he told host Jimmy Kimmel before mentioning skydiving, riding a rollercoaster, riding a bull and wrestling an alligator. \u201cI\u2019ve got a list of things I want to do.\u201d",
      "He gave a progress update in August while giving a speech to the Tennessee Titans. \u201cI lost 200 pounds,\u201d he said. \u201cI told coach I\u2019m getting a contract if I lose another 50.\u201d"

      "The couple learned that they had a few key personality differences when Josh expressed how passionate he was about attending music festivals, namely Burning Man. Jalyn didn't share the same interest and wasn't sure that she'd feel comfortable attending the event.

      "When decision time arrived, Both Jalyn and Josh decided to stay married and expressed confidence in the way they had addressed obstacles in their relationship so far.",

      "How it went: Meghann and Derrek encountered a few issues throughout the experiment. For instance, Derrek thought Meghann was too defensive in their conversations, and she wanted him to be more vulnerable. They also had misaligned expectations on their household roles and duties.",
      "When Meghann discovered that she was pregnant, their relationship shifted for the better, with both of the newlyweds committing to their connection.",

      "\"There's never a good time to do it. It's always going to be hard. I knew that this wasn't the right person for me. I had to be true to myself and be true to Meghann,\" Derrek said.",
      "Meghann offered her take on the breakup, saying, \"When he broke up with me, something in my head changed and I couldn't remember anything good from our relationship. I just remembered all the bad. And then I watched (the show) and then I remembered all the good and that was hard.\"",

      "How it went: Once they started diving deeper in their relationship, Rhonda and Pat hit a few roadblocks.

      "When it came time to share their decisions, Rhonda said she suspected that Pat didn't want to stay married based on his closed off body language. He then explained that he ignored red flags in his first marriage and didn't want to do that this time around.",
      "\"I do not trust that I will be seen and heard as my authentic self,\" he said.",
      "Rhonda wasn't sure what he meant, so Pat explained that he had struggled hearing her repeatedly allege he didn't care about her.",
      "The relationship experts on hand encouraged the couple to talk through their issues. Rhonda apologized to Pat but said her emotional needs hadn't been met.",
      "\"I just think I've been really, really frustrated with you and my frustration pushes you away. And that's not my intention. I'm struggling on how to deal with it. So I would (like to) apologize for making you feel like I'm pushing you away,\" she said.",
      "Pat thanked his wife and said he went into the discussion not wanting to move forward, but was now thinking he may be \"being too rigid.\"",
      "Ultimately, Pat decided he wanted to continue to work on their marriage. Rhonda said she didn't feel \"as open or hopeful\" as she did going into the discussion, but wasn't ready to give up on their relationship.",
      "Are they still together? No. During the reunion, Rhonda said she and Pat stayed together for nine months after decision day. At that point, Pat went to Europe for a month on his own. He did invite her to go, but she'd already taken a lot of time off from work and decided to stay home.",
      "When Pat returned home, Rhonda said she was \"on cloud nine\" for a period of 10 days. One day, she saw him listening to a meditation about anger and asked if he was angry that they hadn't slept together since he got home. He was, and at dinner that night he told Rhonda he was done with their relationship.",
      "During the reunion, Pat said he'd felt that way \"for quite some time.\" Rhonda then explained that he was \"very insecure\" and said \"that insecurity was a complete turnoff romantically.\"",
      "Rhonda suggested that Pat only wanted a wife, and not necessarily her, adding that he wanted physical intimacy that would turn into a romantic connection. However, she wanted a connection and said intimacy would be the icing on the cake.",
      "Belynda and Chad",
      "How it started: When Belynda and Chad got married, it was a slow burn at first. However, they both seemed committed to exploring their connection and shared some sweet moments as they got to know each other.",
      "How it went: Chad repeatedly expressed frustration with Belynda's dog sleeping in their bed throughout the experiment. He also grew tired of the filming schedule and said \"I don't give a f--- about this show\" during one heated moment. Still, the couple's connection grew over time.",
      "Before decision day, Belynda said she was doubtful that she'd want to stay married based on Chad's recent aggressive behavior.",
      "How it ended in the season finale: Belynda described her husband as \"kind, funny and sweet\" on decision day but admitted that her marriage had been \"a little exhausting at times.\"",
      "\u201cI just don\u2019t want to lose my voice. I can\u2019t lose myself in a marriage and I feel like I need to remember that I\u2019m also there and that I also matter,\u201d she said.",
      "In a confessional interview, Chad said he wanted to be with his wife and couldn't \"imagine my life without Belynda.\"",
      "He also acknowledged that he had \"hurt\" his wife at times with his impatience and said he needed \"to find healthier ways to burn off some steam.\"",
      "When the moment to make a decision arrived, Chad went first, saying, \"I genuinely care about you and I believe you care about me. And I don't think there's anything we can't figure out as long as (we keep that in mind).\"",
      "Chad said he was willing to do \"whatever it takes\" to make their marriage work and asked if Belynda was willing to stay together.",
      "\"I mean, I think if anything, if I had a reason to walk away it would just be because we weren't working on it the way we committed and said we were going to. But I know that if we're working on it, we can get through it, so yes, I will stay married to you,\" she replied.",
      "Are they still together? No. During the reunion special, Belynda and Chad announced that they were no longer married.",
      "They both recalled an incident with his cat and her dog after they returned home from decision day, saying Chad was triggered by the animals' behavior and his anxiety came out as he began to yell at Belynda, saying her dog wasn't trained.",
      "Belynda said the incident reminded her of a prior marriage when her ex-husband would yell. She decided to grab her things and left with the dog.",
      "While reflecting on their relationship, Belynda also said Chad's drinking issues were an obstacle for her to overcome.",
      "Brittany and Will",
      "How it started: Brittany and Will had a sweet connection after  they met for the first time at the altar. However, things were understandably a bit awkward at first.",
      "How it went: While getting to know each other, Brittany and Will struggled with communication issues. Brittany wanted her husband to open up and be more expressive with his emotions, but he was slow to show his vulnerable side.",
      "How it ended in the season finale: On decision day, Brittany was \"hopeful\" when she woke up. Then Will called her to say his answer was no. Still, they both showed up to the discussion to talk things out.",
      "Will arrived first and told the relationship experts he intended to leave his marriage.",
      "\"I think that throughout this, her not thinking I'm trying, her not thinking that I'm doing anything, her not feeling anything from what I'm doing, that was the theme,\" he said.",
      "Will went on to say that his wife \u201ctries to compare things to how she feels them\u201d and said \u201cif it\u2019s not how she feels, then it doesn't matter and it's not validated.\u201d",
      "When Brittany arrived, she apologized to her husband for not being able to \"express how important\" he was to her. She then called him \"the most kind, genuine, thoughtful person.\"",
      "\"I'm just so sorry if I haven't made you feel that way, if I haven't made you feel like you're important to me and your feelings are important to me, because they are,\" she said.",
      "\"I'm thankful that I was able to make you feel those things in those ways. I didn't know,\" Will replied.",
      "Will said he needed more time and walked away to gather his thoughts. When he returned, Will decided to give their marriage another try.",
      "\"Yes, I do want to be with you and I do want to continue this and I want to learn with you,\" he said.",
      "Are they still together? No. During the reunion, Brittany revealed that she and Will hadn't spoken together since the show ended. She recalled how he went away for work for a week after the finale then ended things when he returned.",
      "Will shared his side of the story, saying he did \"adore\" Brittany and decided to stay with her in the heat of the moment since he didn't want to see her sad. However, she said she \"had an inkling\" that they would break up when he returned home."

      "Colleen Hoover says the legal saga involving \u201cIt Ends With Us\u201d stars Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni has been tough for her to process.",
      "Hoover is the author of the 2016 book that was the basis for the 2024 film of the same name. The movie has been tainted with controversy since late last year, when Lively filed a lawsuit against Baldoni, in which she accuses him of sexual harassment on the set, as well as creating a smear campaign against her. Baldoni\u2019s $400 million countersuit against Lively and a defamation suit he filed against The New York Times was dismissed in June.",
      "The legal issues have cast a shadow over the movie, while Hoover told Elle magazine in a Nov. 20 article that the matter is \u201cunfortunate\u201d and \u201cdisappointing.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt feels like a circus,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen there are real people involved, with real feelings and emotions. This actually truly has impacted some of the actors\u2019 careers in huge ways. And I just find it all around sad.\u201d",

      "\u201cI\u2019m just trying to stay removed from the negativity. I have my own story I could tell \u2026 but I don\u2019t want to bring attention to it, and I don\u2019t want to have to put someone else down to lift myself up. So I\u2019d rather just ignore it and let people think and say what they\u2019re going to say,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cI feel like it\u2019s so big at this point that there\u2019s nothing anyone can say to change whatever opinion people have of it, even though no one has the actual truth. Not even me.\u201d",
      "A New York judge on Oct. 31 formally ended Baldoni\u2019s countersuit against Lively and the Times when Baldoni and his legal team missed a deadline to file an amended complaint. Attorneys for Lively and Baldoni did not respond to a request for comment from NBC News at the time.",
      "Lively\u2019s lawsuit against Baldoni goes to trial in March 2026.",
      "\u201cIt Ends With Us\u201d centers on florist Lily Bloom (Lively), whose relationship with neurosurgeon Ryle Kincaid (Baldoni, who also directed the film) unfurls into domestic violence, following a pattern of abuse Lily witnessed by her father toward her mother.",
      "The basis of \u201cIt Ends With Us\u201d was drawn from Hoover\u2019s mother\u2019s own experience. The author says the controversy takes away from what she has had to endure.",
      "\u201cThe book was inspired by her story, and now it gives us PTSD to think about it,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel awful because I almost feel like she\u2019s gone through more with the aftermath of this film, more pain than she went through with my dad, just seeing the ugliness of it.\u201d",

      "\u201cI can\u2019t even recommend it anymore. I feel like (the lawsuit) has overshadowed it,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m almost embarrassed to say I wrote it. When people ask what I do, I\u2019m just like, \u2018I\u2019m a writer. Please don\u2019t ask me what I wrote.\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cThe more time that passes, the easier everything gets for all of us,\u201d she continued. \u201cBut it is sad, because I was very proud of that book. And I\u2019m still proud of it, but less publicly so. Maybe I need therapy, I don\u2019t know.\u201d"

    "summary": "Ted Danson and Mary Steenburgen talk about playing on-screen love interests and the creator Mike Schur teases more Season 2 twists.",
    "story": [
      "How do you solve the case of a college president being blackmailed if every member of the faculty is a suspect? You need a man on the inside. It also helps if that man is a former professor-turned private investigator.",
      "Created by Mike Shur and based the 2020 Chilean documentary \u201cThe Mole Agent,\u201d the Netflix comedic mystery \"Man on the Inside\" follows Charles Nieuwendyk (Ted Danson), an engineering professor who turns to solving mysteries.",
      "In Season 2, out Nov. 20, he investigates a cryptic blackmailer who is threatening Jack Berenger (Max Greenfield), the president of Wheeler College, and the proposed $400 million donation made by billionaire alumni Brad Vinick (Gary Cole).",
      "To complicate matters even further, the detective starts falling for one of his suspects, a vibrant music teacher named Mona (Mary Steenburgen).",
      "After Charles solved the case of a missing ruby necklace at Pacific View Retirement Community in Season 1, he finds himself in an investigative rut. Catching a man having an affair might be interesting the first time around, but after the ninth, Charles is ready to never encounter a cheating man again. That\u2019s why, when he hears about Berenger\u2019s case, he jumps at the chance to go undercover.",
      "As soon as Charles steps foot on the campus of Wheeler College, he assembles a long list of possible suspects, all of whom have a reason to detest the billionaire graduate who is known for flying his dog on a private jet every day from San Francisco to Aspen.",
      "While Charles is busy gathering evidence, his boss Julie (Lilah Richcreek Estrada) must seek help from a precarious source \u2014 who just also happens to be her estranged mother, Vanessa (Constance Marie).",
      "One theme that Shur wanted to examine in \u201cA Man on the Inside\u201d was the need for connection and how the dynamic relationship between adult children and their aging parents evolve over time.",
      "In Season 1, Charles grew distant from his daughter Emily (Mary Elizabeth Ellis) following the death of his wife.",
      "\u201cThey loved each other and were close, but drifted apart because of a tragedy that happened,\u201d Shur tells TODAY.com. Over the course of the first season, Charles learned how to communicate his shared grief with Emily.",
      "That same theme of familial reconciliation can be seen with Julie and her mother. Because Julie never discussed her personal life with Charles, Shur described how this new season was a chance for viewers to get to know Julie and her past.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a reason this woman is a private investigator,\u201d Shur says. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason that she\u2019s so guarded and mistrustful of people \u2014 almost borderline paranoid. We thought, \u2018What if the story is her mom was a con artist and was arrested when she was a kid?\u2019 That explains a lot about that character. But then what if that woman is still in her life in a very tangential way? It was a wonderful story to tell about making amends with a parent.\u201d",
      "While Season 1 explored Charles\u2019 loneliness and heartache after his late wife\u2019s death, Season 2 adds a romantic twist for Charles. Who better to play a love interest opposite Danson than Steenburgen, his actual wife of 30 years?",
      "Speaking with TODAY.com, Danson shared how his character changed because of his newfound relationship with Mona.",
      "\u201cThe fact that you are willing to take a chance at something so vulnerable as opening your heart back up to another person takes courage,\u201d Danson says. \u201cA lot of times, people would rather not risk loss again. They play safe and rock back on their heels. It was exciting for me to play something that I believe is worth putting out in the world, which is to stay curious and go for it because life\u2019s not over.\u201d",
      "Steenburgen and Danson have been married for 30 years, but their characters only came together in their 70s. In one scene, Mona talks about how, at their age, both she and Charles have experienced terrific highs and terrible lows, but she\u2019s learned to not get stuck in the past or worry about the future. Instead, her goal is to capture the joy of the present.",

      "Mary steenburgen",
      "Steenburgen tells TODAY.com how age has helped her find those moments of bliss her character described.",
      "\u201cPart of it is that so much of my younger life was about other people,\u201d Steenburgen says. \u201cI was nurturing children. I was taking care of my parents. But now is a time where I\u2019ve gotten to grow as a person.\u201d",
      "Referencing Dylan Thomas\u2019 poem, \u201cDo not go gentle into that good night,\u201d Steenburgen adds that age isn\u2019t a time to \u201cslow down but live faster and harder.\"",

      "Trump added that if Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy doesn\u2019t agree to the peace plan, \u201cthen he can continue to fight his little heart out.\u201d",
      "Earlier this week, Trump said that he wants Zelenskyy \u2014 who has hesitations about the proposal \u2014 to accept the peace plan by Thanksgiving.",
      "Key points of the proposal include allowing Russia to keep more Ukrainian territory than it currently holds, forcing Ukraine to limit the size of its army and agreeing that Ukraine will never join NATO.",
      "Ukrainian lawmakers have criticized the plan as conceding too much to Russia\u2019s demands, though the Trump administration has said that the plan, which has 28 points, was drafted with input from both sides of the conflict.",
      "\u201cUkraine may now face a very difficult choice, either losing its dignity or the risk of losing a key partner, either the difficult 28 points, or a very difficult winter,\u201d Zelenskyy said in a video about the plan earlier this week.",

      "\u201cWhile there are many good ideas in the proposed Russia-Ukraine peace plan, there are several areas that are very problematic and can be made better. The goal of any peace deal is to end the war honorably and justly \u2014 and not create new conflict,\u201d Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., wrote in a post on X Saturday morning. Later, the South Carolina senator posted that he was confident Trump would garner a peace deal by pushing both countries and would ensure Ukraine remains free and able to defend itself from future aggression.",

And any assurances provided to Putin should not reward his malign behavior or undermine the security of the United States or allies.\u201d",
      "The proposal includes a security guarantee with a commitment that U.S. and European allies to Ukraine would treat any future attack on Ukraine as an attack on the broader trans-Atlantic community, a U.S. official told NBC News, with few additional details about what the commitment would entail.",
      "Ukrainian leaders aren\u2019t the only ones voicing concerns about the plan. On the sidelines of the G20 summit in South Africa, European leaders have said the proposal, if agreed to, could \u201cleave Ukraine vulnerable to future attack.\u201d",

      "TOKYO \u2014 As Japan\u2019s first female prime minister, Sanae Takaichi has broken new ground in a country that struggles with gender equality. But she has quickly run up against a tradition that may be immovable.",
      "Trophies for sumo wrestling, Japan\u2019s national sport, are sometimes presented by the country\u2019s top leader \u2014 most recently in January, when Shigeru Ishiba, the prime minister at the time, awarded the winner\u2019s trophy at the New Year Grand Sumo Tournament in Tokyo.",
      "But awkward questions arose ahead of the Kyushu Grand Sumo Tournament, which concludes Sunday in the Japanese city of Fukuoka. Takaichi is prohibited from entering the ring according to the rules of sumo, which consider women impure.",
      "Takaichi will have a chance to sidestep the issue as the Japanese leader is expected to attend the G20 summit in South Africa this weekend amid a diplomatic spat with China.",
      "But the dilemma could resurface during the New Year\u2019s tournament in Tokyo.",
      "In Japan, sumo is not just a sport but a 1,500-year-old tradition that is held sacred in the nation of over 100 million people. It has deep roots in Shinto, Japan\u2019s Indigenous religion.",
      "Experts suggested Takaichi, a hard-line conservative elected last month whose policies are not seen as particularly pro-women, is likely to avoid the issue altogether so as not to challenge tradition, and send another high-ranking government official instead.",
      "\u201cShe doesn\u2019t want to upset her supporters or conservatives,\u201d said Hiromi Murakami, an expert on Japanese politics at Temple University in Japan.",
      "\u201cThey don\u2019t want to even see a discussion around the topic,\u201d she said.",
      "Minoru Kihara, the Japanese government\u2019s top spokesperson, said last week that Takaichi \u201cholds the view that Japan\u2019s sumo culture is a traditional art form that should be cherished.\u201d",
      "She \u201cintends to respect the traditions of sumo culture,\u201d he later told reporters in Tokyo.",
      "Reached for comment this week, the Japan Sumo Association said it had not received any request from Takaichi\u2019s office regarding her involvement. The association told the Asahi Shimbun newspaper this month, \u201cWe believe it is our mission to pass down the traditional culture of sumo.\u201d",
      "This is not the first time there have been questions as to whether a high-ranking female official would be allowed to enter the sumo ring, also known as the dohyo.",
      "In 1990, Mayumi Moriyama became Japan\u2019s first female chief Cabinet secretary, who often represents the government at sumo trophy ceremonies. The sumo association did not allow her to do so.",
      "The association rejected another request in 2000 by Japan\u2019s first female governor, Fusae Ohta, to enter the sumo ring at a tournament in the city of Osaka. She ultimately presented the trophy on a walkway next to the dohyo.",
      "In 2018, a female mayor, Tomoko Nakagawa of the city of Takarazuka, was denied a request to make a speech in the ring. That same year, the association apologized after two women were ordered out of the ring when they rushed to the aid of a mayor who had collapsed inside it.",
      "Such incidents underscore the challenges that continue to face women in Japan, which ranked 118th out of 148 countries in the World Economic Forum\u2019s 2025 Global Gender Gap Report.",
      "Sumo wrestling has also proved popular on the rare occasion a competition is held outside Japan. Last month, tickets sold out for the Grand Sumo Tournament at London\u2019s Royal Albert Hall, which hosted the event for the first time in 34 years.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s quite interesting that they went to the U.K.,\u201d Murakami said. \u201cIf there\u2019s a female political leader who wants to give the trophy, what would happen then?\u201d",
      "Arata Yamamoto reported from Tokyo, and Jay Ganglani from Hong Kong."

      "\"The number is expected to rise as the airstrikes continue, and some of the wounded are in critical condition,\" Khalil al-Daqran, spokesperson for the Ministry of Health, told NBC News.",
      "The Israeli strikes came as international momentum was building on Gaza, with the U.N. Security Council on Monday approving the U.S. blueprint to secure and govern the territory. It authorizes an international stabilization force to provide security, approves a transitional authority to be overseen by President Donald Trump and envisions a possible future path to an independent Palestinian state.",
      "Israel has previously carried out similar waves of strikes after reported attacks on its forces. At least 33 Palestinians were killed over a 12-hour period Wednesday and Thursday, mostly women and children, health officials said.",
      "One of Saturday's strikes targeted a vehicle, killing 11 and wounding over 20 Palestinians in Gaza City's Rimal neighborhood, said Rami Mhanna, managing director of Shifa Hospital, where the casualties were taken. The majority of the wounded were children, director Mohamed Abu Selmiya said. Associated Press video showed children and others inspecting the blackened vehicle, whose top was blown off.",
      "Another strike targeting a house near Al-Awda Hospital in central Gaza killed at least three people and wounded 11 others, according to the hospital. It said a strike on a house in Nuseirat camp in central Gaza killed at least seven people including a child and wounded 16 others.",
      "And a strike targeting a house in Deir al-Balah in central Gaza killed three people, including a woman, according to Al-Aqsa Hospital.",
      "\"Suddenly, I heard a powerful explosion. I looked outside and saw smoke covering the entire area. I couldn't see a thing. I covered my ears and started shouting to the others in the tent to run,\" said Khalil Abu Hatab in Deir al-Balah. \"When I looked again, I realized the upper floor of my neighbor's house was gone.\"",
      "He added: \"It's a fragile ceasefire. This is not a life we can live. There's no safe place.\"",
      "Israel's military in a statement said it launched attacks against Hamas after an \"armed terrorist\" crossed into an Israeli-held area and shot at troops in southern Gaza. It said no soldiers were hurt. The military said the person had used a road on which humanitarian aid enters the territory, and called it an \"extreme violation\" of the ceasefire.",
      "In separate statements, the military said soldiers killed five \"terrorists\" in the Rafah area, and two others after firing at four people who crossed into Israeli-held areas in northern Gaza and advanced toward soldiers in two separate incidents.",
      "The war began with the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, that killed some 1,200 people and took over 250 hostage. Almost all of the hostages or their remains have been returned in ceasefires or other deals.",
      "Gaza's Health Ministry says 69,733 Palestinians have been killed and 170,863 injured in Israel's retaliatory offensive. The toll has gone up during the ceasefire both from new Israeli strikes and from the recovery and identification of bodies of people killed earlier in the war.",
      "The ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its figures but has said women and children make up a majority of those killed. The ministry, part of the Hamas-run government and staffed by medical professionals, maintains detailed records viewed as generally reliable by independent experts."

      "Two people were critically injured, two were seriously injured, and seven others were treated at the scene Thursday afternoon in the small community of Bella Coola, BC Emergency Health Services said in a statement.",
      "On Saturday, the BC Conservation Officer Service said the search for the bear expanded to include two additional grizzlies witnesses said were nearby during the incident.",
      "At a news conference Friday, Tamara Davidson, minister of environment and parks in the Canadian province, said that three children and one adult were seriously injured and remained hospitalized. Their relatives did not want to release the patients' latest conditions, she said.",
      "\"I want to recognize the teachers who took great risk to protect their students,\" Davidson said. \"Their actions deserve our greatest respect and gratitude. They were well prepared, and they are the true heroes.\"",
      "Inspector Kevin Van Damme of the Conservation Officer Service said the teachers used bear spray and small noisemakers called bear bangers to repel the animal.",
      "\u201cDuring a school outing, the group had stopped along a trail near the community where a single grizzly bear emerged from the forest and attacked,\u201d he said. \u201cTeachers put themselves in harm\u2019s way to protect the children. They definitely avoided worse injuries.\u201d",
      "Authorities were collecting evidence from the attack site to help identify and capture the bear, Van Damme said. In the meantime, residents and visitors in the area, known for outdoor activities, were told to stay indoors.",
      "\"I really need to stress how dangerous this situation is with this bear at large,\" Van Damme said, adding later during the news conference: \"I have not seen an attack like this \u2014 with a large group of people.\"",
      "He added that an incident involving more than a dozen people is \"extremely rare.\"",
      "The Nuxalk Nation of Indigenous people in the region asked everyone in the area to \"avoid all trails.\"",
      "Residents of the 4 Mile area in Bella Coola were told to remain indoors on Saturday, and potential visitors were advised to stay away. Additional conservation officers joined the search alongside a Royal Canadian Mounted Police helicopter crew with heat imaging technology, the Conservation Officer Service said in a statement on Saturday.",
      "The board and administration of Acwsalcta School, an independent institution run by the Nuxalk Nation in Bella Coola, said in a statement that school would remain closed Monday and that counseling would be available.",
      "Parent Veronica Schooner told The Associated Press that, among the many who tried to halt the attack, one teacher \u201cgot the whole brunt of it\u201d and was transported to a hospital.",
      "Schooner said her 10-year-old son Alvarez was in the class of fourth and fifth graders attacked by the bear and was close enough that \u201che even felt its fur.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe said that bear ran so close to him, but it was going after somebody else,\u201d Schooner said.",
      "She added that some children were hit with the bear spray.",
      "The British Columbia Assembly of First Nations, an umbrella organization for the 204 First Nations of Indigenous people in the province, said the attack should inspire reconsideration of measures to prevent such incidents.",
      "\"This event raises important questions about safety protocols, community preparedness and the respect for First Nations\u2019 knowledge in managing wildlife,\" the organization said in a statement that also expressed solidarity with the Nuxalk Nation.",
      "The B.C. Wildlife Federation, a nonprofit that works toward environmental preservation, said Friday that a 2017 province ban on hunting grizzlies correlates to a rise in such attacks because the bears, plentiful in Bella Coola, have been freer to learn behavior dangerous to humans.",
      "Since the prohibition started, the federation said in a statement  Friday, the number of bear reports to the British Columbia Conservation Officer Service has doubled.",
      "\u201cWith no hunting pressure, grizzlies and humans will increasingly occupy the same spaces with inevitable consequences,\u201d BC Wildlife Federation Executive Director Jesse Zeman said.",

      "A U.S.-led peace plan that mirrors several key Russian demands has sent ripples across Europe, with leaders voicing concerns that it could leave Ukraine vulnerable and calling for changes to the proposals.",
      "European leaders and key allies met on the sidelines of the G20 summit in South Africa and said in a joint statement that the plan requires additional work, adding that they are \u201cconcerned by the proposed limitations on Ukraine\u2019s armed forces, which would leave Ukraine vulnerable to future attack.\u201d",
      "The statement was signed by leaders of Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Finland, Ireland, the Netherlands, Spain and Norway, as well as the European Union Commission and the E.U. Council. Japan\u2019s and Canada\u2019s leaders also signed on to the statement, which warns that \u201cborders must not be changed by force.\u201d",
      "President Donald Trump has set Thanksgiving as the deadline for Ukraine to agree to the 28-point framework, which suggests that Russia could be granted more territory than it holds and would place limits on Ukraine\u2019s army and prevent Kyiv from ever joining NATO \u2014 Moscow\u2019s long-sought demands.",
      "The U.S. proposals do include a security guarantee modeled on NATO\u2019s Article 5, which would commit the U.S. and European allies to treat a future attack on Ukraine as an attack on the entire trans-Atlantic community, according to a U.S. official, though there are few specifics on what that would entail.",
      "Top Ukrainian and U.S. officials will meet in Switzerland to discuss \u201cpossible parameters of a future peace,\u201d Rustem Umerov, the secretary of Ukraine\u2019s National Security and Defense Council, wrote on Telegram Saturday. Separately, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy\u2019s office said Saturday that the delegation has been confirmed for the talks, which \u201cwill take place in the coming days.\u201d",

      "However, analysts say the plan could amount to a dangerous capitulation for Ukraine, which has previously rejected plans that would require recognizing Russia\u2019s illegal annexations of the entire eastern Donetsk region and Crimea.",
      "\u201cEven if parts of this plan were to be shoved down Ukraine\u2019s throat, it would be the end of Ukraine as we know it. It\u2019s a real capitulation,\u201d Michael Bociurkiw, a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council\u2019s Eurasia Center, who was in Johannesburg, told NBC News by phone.",
      "The U.S. was facilitating a \u201cpotentially disastrous surrender for Ukraine,\u201d said Keir Giles, a senior consulting fellow at Chatham House, a London-based think tank.",
      "\u201cAnd now we will see yet another panicked scramble by European leaders to head off an outcome that would be disastrous for their own security,\u201d he said, adding that the European response toward \u201crepeated disastrous peace plans has been in words, not action.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere should be nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine,\u201d Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, said Friday in a post on X, adding European leaders will also meet in Angola next week.",
      "Ukraine must have a \u201cdecisive voice in peace talks,\u201d Polish President Karol Nawrocki said late Friday on X. \u201cThe price of peace cannot in any way be the achievement of strategic goals by the aggressor, and the aggressor was and remains the Russian Federation,\u201d he added.",
      "As European leaders mulled over the plan on the G20 summit\u2019s sidelines, notably absent was Trump, who is boycotting the event over his unfounded claims that South Africa\u2019s white minority is subject to hate crimes and land grabs.",
      "While Trump initially said Vice President JD Vance would attend, he later said there would be no U.S. delegation taking part. Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has an International Criminal Court warrant calling for his arrest, is also not attending.",
      "How much Europe will actually be able to influence the plan without U.S. involvement remains an open question, and one with implications for both Ukraine\u2019s borders and peace for the broader continent.",
      "\u201cThey can\u2019t influence this,\u201d said Bociurkiw. \u201cIt makes NATO and Europe look weak, and Putin will go on and on to cause more disruptions.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like a speed train and you have Putin and Trump on it, and then you have Zelenskyy on the departure platform and Europe stuck at the check-in counter,\u201d he added.",
      "Giles said the military aspects of the peace plan leave Ukraine effectively defenseless against a future Russian attack.",

    "summary": "As the UN Climate Change Conference was happening in Brazil, the Trump administration released proposals to open up offshore drilling and roll back protections for wetlands and endangered animals.",
    "story": [
      "As representatives from nearly 200 nations were wrapping up talks at the United Nations\u2019 COP30 climate summit this week, the United States was not only absent, but the Trump administration also introduced a series of sweeping proposals to roll back environmental protections and encourage fossil fuel drilling.",
      "The United Nations Climate Change Conference ended Friday in the Brazilian city of Bel\u00e9m, where delegates gathered to hammer out a road map to phase out fossil fuels, boost climate action and limit global warming.",
      "For the first time in the summit\u2019s history, the U.S. \u2014 one of the top emitters of greenhouse gases \u2014 did not send a delegation. Instead, the Trump administration this week announced a plan to open up new oil drilling off the coasts of California and Florida for the first time in decades and proposed rule changes to weaken the Endangered Species Act and limit the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s authority to protect wetlands and streams.",
      "\u201cThese rules double down on the administration\u2019s refusal to confront the climate crisis in a serious way and, in fact, move us in the opposite direction,\u201d said Jessie Ritter, associate vice president of waters and coasts for the National Wildlife Federation, a conservation group.",
      "The White House told NBC News on Friday that this week\u2019s \u201chistoric\u201d announcements aim to \u201cfurther President Trump\u2019s American energy dominance agenda.\u201d",
      "\u201cPresident Trump is reversing government overreach, restoring energy security, and protecting American jobs by rolling back excessive, burdensome regulations and creating new opportunities to \u2018DRILL, BABY, DRILL,\u2019\u201d White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said in a statement. \u201cPresident Trump serves the American people, not radical climate activists who have fallen victim to the biggest scam of the century.\u201d",
      "Ritter said the new proposals signal to the world just how much the U.S. has stepped back from any meaningful climate action.",
      "\u201cI doubt that this surprises folks who have been watching in the international arena,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it\u2019s unfortunate, given the example the U.S. sets and what our leadership, or lack thereof, emboldens other countries to do.\u201d",
      "The Trump administration's announcement on Thursday that it intends to open up roughly 1.27 billion acres of coastal U.S. waters for oil drilling drew bipartisan pushback.",
      "Although the American Petroleum Institute, a trade association for the oil and gas industry, hailed the program as a \u201chistoric step toward unleashing our nation\u2019s vast offshore resources,\u201d Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., pushed to uphold the current moratorium on drilling, which Trump extended during his first term.",
      "\u201cI have been speaking to @SecretaryBurgum and made my expectations clear that this moratorium must remain in place, and that in any plan, Florida\u2019s coasts must remain off the table for oil drilling to protect Florida\u2019s tourism, environment, and military training opportunities,\u201d Scott wrote Thursday on X, referring to Interior Secretary Doug Burgum.",
      "Across the country, California Gov. Gavin Newsom wrote on X that \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s idiotic proposal to sell off California\u2019s coasts to his Big Oil donors is dead in the water.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe will not stand by as our coastal economy and communities are put in danger,\u201d he said.",
      "The drilling directive came just three days after the Trump administration proposed major limits to the Clean Water Act of 1972 that would undo protections from pollution and runoff for most of the country\u2019s small streams and wetlands. The rule would narrow the definition of which bodies qualify as \u201cwaters of the United States\u201d under the act.",
      "If finalized, the changes would mean that the smallest share of freshwater resources would be under federal protection since the law was enacted, according to Jon Devine, who heads the water policy team at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental advocacy group.",
      "\u201cBy EPA\u2019s own estimate, only about 19% of the country\u2019s wetlands would be protected against unregulated destruction and development if this were finalized,\u201d Devine said.",
      "Wetlands act as buffers against flooding by absorbing and storing water during extreme rainfall and other high-runoff events. As the world warms, coastal and inland flooding is expected to become more frequent and severe.",
      "\u201cMany of the places that we already have in the U.S. that are increasingly flood-prone due to climate change are going to be even more in harm\u2019s way,\u201d Devine said.",
      "Wetlands and streams also feed into other bodies of water that serve as critical drinking water supplies across the country, so critics fear the policy could make drinking water unsafe in some communities.",
      "The third major environmental rollback announced this week was a set of four rules that would erode protections under the Endangered Species Act of 1973. The proposed changes aim to make it easier to remove species classified as threatened or endangered and harder to add new protected species and their habitats to the list. The rules, if passed, would also allow the government to consider \u201ceconomic impacts\u201d in decisions to list or delist species.",
      "Taken together, Ritter said, these three proposals are consistent with the Trump administration\u2019s deregulatory agenda.",
      "\u201cThese decisions prioritize short-term gain, often for a few industries and special interests, at the expense of things that have been widely bipartisan and important issues for people for decades,\u201d Ritter said.",
      "The impacts of the changes might not all be apparent right away, she added, but the scale of the long-term consequences could be immense.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s truly not an exaggeration that this is going to touch all Americans in some way,\u201d she said. \u201cEverything is connected, and it\u2019s hubris to think that we can have these massive negative effects on our streams and wetlands, our animals, our coastal waters, without impacts to humans.\u201d"

      "Diana Loginova, the 18-year-old student and street musician, has emerged as an unlikely \u2014 and perhaps unwilling \u2014 voice of defiance in wartime Russia.",
      "Known by her stage name Naoko, the teen gained popularity over the summer with viral videos taken around St. Petersburg of her band Stoptime performing songs by musicians who have spoken out against Vladimir Putin\u2019s war in Ukraine. Inevitably, in a country where nearly all forms of dissent have been crushed, Russian authorities quickly took notice.",
      "Naoko was first detained last month for organizing a \u201cmass simultaneous gathering of citizens\u201d during a performance, which authorities said disrupted public order, and was sentenced to 13 days behind bars. She has since been rearrested twice on the same charges, as well as for petty hooliganism, and put back in prison. Her fellow band members have also served back-to-back sentences, although one has since been released.",
      "\u201cWhat is happening is what we call carousel arrests,\u201d Dmitrii Anisimov, a human rights activist and spokesperson for the OVD-Info protest monitoring group, told NBC News. \u201cTheoretically, it can continue forever,\u201d he said. In practice, it could mean months in detention, and there is legal precedent for this, he added.",
      "\u201cIt looks like Russian authorities want to use the persecution of Naoko, as with many other public cases, to intimidate others,\u201d said Anisimov.",
      "Loginova\u2019s lawyer, Maria Zyryanova, told NBC News she wouldn\u2019t discuss the case while the singer is behind bars. Her current sentence expires Sunday.",
      "Naoko\u2019s case has been extensively covered by Russian state news agencies and exiled independent media, while supporters have spread leaflets calling for her freedom.",
      "In an interview published in August, months before her imprisonment, Naoko said she was \u201cscared\u201d to be detained but felt she \u201chad to do it.\u201d",
      "\u201cI understand that art is now the only language \u2014 at least in Russia \u2014 through which you can express your thoughts. I\u2019ve chosen it and don\u2019t want to speak any other,\u201d she told St. Petersburg news outlet Bumaga.",
      "Others have taken up that language in Loginova\u2019s absence.",
      "On a bench near the Kiyevskaya metro station in central Moscow, musician Vasily told NBC News that Naoko\u2019s case had \u201clit a fire\u201d in him, inspiring his own street performances as a way to support the jailed singer.",
      "\u201cHer freedom was taken away for her singing,\u201d said Vasily, whose last name NBC News chose not to reveal for his safety. \u201cThat got me mad.\u201d",
      "Valentina, a professional musician from the city of Yaroslavl, about 380 miles southeast of St. Petersburg, has been singing on both the streets and social media in support of Naoko.",
      "Inspired after seeing Naoko\u2019s performances on TikTok, she has been posting videos where she performs the same songs. One gained more than 600,000 views on Instagram, which scared her because she did not want to get on authorities\u2019 radar, said Valentina, who did not want her last name revealed for fear of repercussions. \u201cWhen I saw the news about Naoko, it felt like my last hope was taken away,\u201d she said. \u201cI did not feel sorry for myself. I just really wanted to help. I thought, \u2018Why do I berate people who keep silent and don\u2019t say anything in our country when I am also remaining silent and scared?\u2019\u201d",
      "Loginova is still a child, noted Vasily \u2014 himself only 19. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s touched people, that this little girl is not afraid to get on the streets and sing the songs of foreign agents.\u201d",
      "He\u2019s referencing the status of exiled singer Monetochka and rapper Noize MC, both slapped with the official designation often reserved for public figures whose views have set them at odds with the Kremlin.",
      "It was a song by Noize MC, who has openly spoken out against the war and Putin\u2019s regime, that Loginova performed before she first landed in jail.",
      "The rapper\u2019s lyrics that appear to have gotten her in the most trouble appear innocuous on the surface: \u201cI want to watch a ballet, let the swans dance.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s a reference to the failed 1991 coup attempt against the last Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, during which state TV showed the \u201cSwan Lake\u201d ballet on a continuous loop. It has since come to symbolize something dangerous in Putin\u2019s Russia \u2014 change.",
      "A video of the band\u2019s cover of the song, which Loginova has said they performed rarely and not for the cameras, drew the ire of war supporters who questioned why the band was allowed to perform the songs of \u201ctraitors\u201d and whether their performances were, in fact, concealed protests.",
      "A representative for Noize MC said in an email that the rapper \u201cprefers not to give interviews or public comments regarding this case \u2014 primarily to avoid any risk of unintentionally affecting those directly involved.\u201d",
      "Monetochka, whose songs the band also performed, hailed them as \u201cheroes\u201d in a statement on social media, saying that Loginova was bringing \u201cmusic and freedom\u201d into the world rather than \u201cviolence and war.\u201d She did not respond to NBC News\u2019 request for comment.",
      "NBC News has reached out to Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov for comment on the case.",
      "Kremlin critic Boris Nadezhdin, who was barred from running against Putin in last year\u2019s election, said he had been in communication with Loginova\u2019s mom, Irina, and was fundraising to cover the band\u2019s legal costs.",
      "He has also been raising awareness on social media and said people\u2019s emotional reactions were palpable. \u201cShe is young, she is a female, and she is not at all a politician or journalist. People are used to repressions against opposition politicians and journalists, but this is a new low,\u201d said Nadezhdin.",
      "The people who came to listen to the band were also young, he added, a red flag for the Kremlin because of its predominantly older support base. \u201cSo they need to have an exemplary reprisal against some young singer,\u201d he said, \u201cso that others get fearful.\u201d",
      "While she garners sympathy at home and abroad, Loginova remains behind bars for her singing. Nadezhdin said he was not optimistic about her chances of performing again anytime soon.",
      "\u201cThey won\u2019t leave her alone quickly,\u201d he said. \u201cI am telling them to get ready for a long ride ahead.\u201d"

      "The first Group of 20 summit to be held in Africa opened on Saturday with an ambitious agenda to make progress on solving some of the long-standing problems that have afflicted the world's poorest nations.",
      "Leaders and top government officials from the richest and leading emerging economies came together at an exhibition center near the famous Soweto township in South Africa, once home to Nelson Mandela, to try and find some consensus on the priorities set out by the host country.",
      "Many of South Africa's priorities for the group, especially a focus on climate change and its impact on developing countries, have met resistance from the United States, which is boycotting the talks.",
      "As he opened the summit, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said in his speech that \"consensus has emerged\" and appeared to indicate that a declaration would be adopted in the absence of the U.S. and despite its opposition.",
      "South Africa's agenda",
      "South Africa, which gets to set the agenda as the country holding the rotating presidency, wants leaders to agree to more help for poor countries to recover from climate-related disasters, reduce their foreign debt burdens, transition to green energy sources and harness their own critical mineral wealth \u2014 all in an attempt to counter widening global inequality.",
      "\"We'll see,\" United Nations Secretary-General Ant\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdnio Guterres said on whether the G20 could prioritize developing world countries and make meaningful reforms. \"But I think South Africa has done its part in putting those things clearly upon the table.\"",
      "The two-day summit will take place without the world's biggest economy after U.S. President Donald Trump ordered a U.S. boycott of the summit over his claims that South Africa is pursuing racist anti-white policies and persecuting its Afrikaner white minority.",
      "The Trump administration has also made clear its opposition to South Africa's G20 agenda from the start of the year, when South Africa began hosting G20 meetings. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio skipped a G20 foreign ministers meeting in February, calling the agenda all about diversity, equity and inclusion and climate change",
      "Rubio said he would not waste American taxpayers' money on that.",
      "Diplomatic rift",
      "The monthslong diplomatic rift between the U.S. and South Africa deepened in the buildup to the main summit this weekend, but while Trump's boycott dominated the pre-talks discussions in Johannesburg and threatened to undercut the agenda, some of the leaders were eager to move on.",
      "\"I do regret it,\" French President Emmanuel Macron said of Trump's absence, \"but it should not block us. Our duty is to be present, engage and work all together because we have so many challenges.\"",
      "The G20 is actually a group of 21 members that includes 19 nations, the European Union and the African Union.",
      "The bloc was formed in 1999 as a bridge between rich and poor nations to confront global financial crises. While it often operates in the shadow of the Group of Seven richest democracies, G20 members together represent around 85% of the world's economy, 75% of international trade and more than half the global population.",
      "But it works on consensus rather than any binding resolutions, and that is often hard to come by with the different interests of members like the U.S., Russia, China, India, Japan, the Western European nations France, Germany and the U.K., and others like Indonesia, Saudi Arabia and South Africa.",
      "Guterres cautioned that rich nations have often failed to make the concessions required to strike effective climate or global financial reform agreements.",
      "Doubts over a declaration",
      "G20 summits traditionally end with a leaders' declaration, which details any broad agreement reached by the members, but even that was proving hard to come by in Johannesburg.",
      "South Africa said the U.S. was exerting pressure on it not to issue any leaders' declaration in the absence of the U.S. and instead tone down the final document to a unilateral statement from the host country.",
      "South African President Cyril Ramaphosa responded to that by saying \"we will not be bullied\" and has promised a declaration from all members present at the close of the summit on Sunday, with or without U.S. input.",
      "Even so, the direction of the G20 bloc is likely to change sharply given that the U.S. takes over the rotating presidency from South Africa at the end of this summit, as the Trump administration has derided the focus on climate change and inequality. Trump has said the U.S. will stage next year's summit at his golf club in Doral, Florida.",
      "The only role the U.S. will play at this summit, the White House said, will be when a representative from the United States Embassy in South Africa attends the formal handover ceremony at the end to accept the G20 presidency.",
      "South Africa said it's an insult for Ramaphosa to hand over to what it considers to be a junior diplomatic official.",
      "\"We have communicated to the American government that the president will not be handing over to a junior official of the embassy,\" South African Foreign Ministry spokesperson Chrispin Phiri told The Associated Press. \"And so, as a result, we don't anticipate that there'll be any form of handover here (at the summit).\""

      "\"We agreed to work together with the U.S. and Europe at the level of national security advisors to make the path to peace truly doable,\" Zelenskyy said. \"Ukraine has always respected and continues to respect U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s desire to put an end to the bloodshed, and we view every realistic proposal positively.\"",

      "The 28 points, published by Axios and confirmed to NBC News as accurate by a source familiar with the matter who has seen different drafts of the plan, suggest that Russia would be granted even more Ukrainian territory than it already holds, and that Ukraine would have to limit the size of its army and agree to never join NATO.",
      "The White House insists that the plan is fair, and that it was drafted in consultation with both sides.",
      "Rustem Umerov, the secretary of Ukraine\u2019s National Security and Defense Council, downplayed any involvement in preparing the plan during a recent visit to the U.S.",
      "Later on Friday, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that while Russian officials had not been sent text ahead of time, they had now received it and it could be the basis for a final resolution.",
      "The U.S. plan \u201clooks less like a genuine peace framework and more like a set of proposals that align predominantly with the interests of the Russian Federation,\u201d Victoria Podgorna, a lawmaker with  Zelenskyy\u2019s Servant of the People political party, said in an interview. \u201cThe question is: Why these proposals seem to be based almost entirely on Russia\u2019s demands?\u201d",
      "Jessica Berlin, a senior fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis, characterized the proposals as \u201cessentially the Kremlin\u2019s wish list\u201d that had been \u201camateurishly formulated.\u201d It would show that \u201cRussia can invade a sovereign nation\u201d and \u201cwalk away victorious with territorial gains, military concessions and sanctions relief,\u201d she added.",
      "Not everyone on the continent shares such a grim assessment.",
      "The plan says Ukraine would \u201creceive reliable security guarantees,\u201d a central European demand in any deal, and that if Russia invades again, there would be \u201ca decisive coordinated military response.\u201d",
      "\u201cAs a starting point for something that could stop the killing, it has some promise,\u201d Mark Galeotti, the British-based director of the consultancy Mayak Intelligence, posted on X, acknowledging this would \u201cbe an unpopular opinion.\u201d",
      "Here\u2019s what is in the latest plan:",
      "Territorial concessions",
      "The most contentious point in the draft is that \u201cCrimea, Luhansk and Donetsk will be recognized as de facto Russian, including by the United States.\u201d"

      "Convicted Israeli spy Jonathan J. Pollard downplayed the controversy around his private meeting with U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee, telling NBC News the visit was \u201cpersonal\u201d and \u201cwasn\u2019t done surreptitiously.\u201d",
      "The \u201cmain point\u201d of the meeting at the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem in July, Pollard said, was to \u201cthank\u201d the ambassador for \u201chis efforts on my behalf during my incarceration.\u201d",
      "Pollard, a former American intelligence analyst, spent 30 years in prison on espionage charges after being found to have passed critical security documents to Israeli intelligence in the 1980s. Israel made Pollard a citizen during his lengthy prison term, and he moved there in 2020, five years after his release on probation.",
      "During Pollard\u2019s detention, Huckabee was among several pro-Israeli politicians who advocated for his release, arguing that the sentence was too severe for someone who had been spying for an ally.",
      "Pollard described his meeting as more of a social call and insisted the two didn\u2019t discuss politics or Gaza. But the meeting comes amid a growing list of episodes in which the ambassador, a fierce champion of Israel, has appeared to deviate from official White House policy as the Trump administration deepens its involvement in Middle East diplomacy and peacekeeping.",
      "The New York Times first revealed the meeting Thursday. In a statement, a spokesperson for the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem said the article \u201cis filled with inaccuracies\u201d and said Huckabee \u201chas meetings each day with numerous people and as a matter of general policy we don\u2019t comment as to the content of conversations.\u201d",
      "The embassy offered no further information and declined to offer a comment from the ambassador himself.",
      "\u201cThe White House was not aware of that meeting but the president stands by our ambassador,\u201d press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Thursday.",
      "Pollard said the meeting was \u201ca simple story\u201d that \u201cgot far more complicated than it deserved.\u201d",
      "He told NBC News that he had arranged the visit simply by phoning up the ambassador\u2019s office. \u201cHe had nothing to hide and I had nothing to hide,\" Pollard said, adding that it was an \u201cintensely personal visit to thank him\u201d for his work while he was incarcerated.",
      "But there were questions across the political spectrum for Huckabee over his decision to meet the notorious spy, whose long imprisonment drove a wedge between the U.S. and Israel.",
      "Rep. Joaquin Castro, D-Texas, who sits on the House Intelligence Committee, said in a post on X that Huckabee should not have met with \u201ca convicted traitor,\u201d while former Fox News host Tucker Carlson said Huckabee\u2019s conduct was \u201cshocking behavior from a United States ambassador.\u201d",
      "But this isn\u2019t the first time that Huckabee, a two-time presidential candidate, former governor of Arkansas and self-described Christian Zionist, has ruffled feathers on policy.",
      "The ambassador told Israeli media in early September that the U.S. would not stop Israel from annexing the occupied West Bank. The White House and several senior administration officials have since made it clear that the U.S. would oppose such a move.",
      "Earlier this year, he told the Bloomberg news agency that the U.S. was no longer pursuing the goal of Palestinian statehood, which has long stood as a central feature of American diplomacy in the Middle East. A U.S.-backed plan for Gaza approved by the United Nations earlier this month restated support for a future \u201ccredible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood.\u201d",
      "Huckabee has regularly used the religiously loaded term \u201cJudea and Samaria\u201d to refer to the West Bank, the mostly Palestinian enclave that Israel has occupied since 1967. In 2008, he said that \u201cthere is no such thing as a Palestinian\u201d and that Palestinian nationhood is just a \u201cpolitical tool to try and force land away from Israel.\u201d",
      "In an interview with NBC News on Sunday before news of the Pollard meeting broke, he downplayed talk of a rift with the White House and struck a decidedly more obedient tone.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t get to make the policy. I simply carry it out as an ambassador,\u201d Huckabee said. \u201cI\u2019ve had some very strong opinions on it, but my job here is not to be the chemist making the medicine. My job is simply to be the pharmacist and dispense it.\u201d"

      "The competition was further plunged into disarray when two of its judges resigned, one of whom accused the organizers of rigging and threatened a lawsuit.",
      "It came as Miss Universe, which makes its revenue from licensing its broadcasting rights to various countries, has faced declining viewership in part from concerns over what some see as its objectification of women and declining relevance.",

      "\u201cIt seems to me that it is an example of how women should raise our voices,\u201d Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, the country\u2019s first female leader, told reporters, referring to Bosch standing up to one of the hosts.",
      "\u201cWe women look more beautiful when we raise our voice and participate, because that has to do with the recognition of our rights,\u201d she said, adding that she wanted to give \u201crecognition\u201d to Bosch for voicing her disagreement in a \u201cdignified\u201d way.\u201d",
      "Miss Thailand Praveener Singh, 29, was crowned the first runner-up, followed by Miss Venezuela Stephany Adriana Abasali Nasser, 25.",
      "The pageant is seldom devoid of controversy, with sexual harassment and rigging complaints almost every year. And this year was no exception.",
      "Nawat, the Thai national director, hectored Bosch for not following the promotional activities guidelines in a livestreamed sashing ceremony on Nov. 4 and called security when the Mexican delegate stood up for herself.",
      "Bosch refused to be silenced and walked out unbowed, joined by others, including last year\u2019s winner, Denmark\u2019s Victoria Kj\u00e6r Theilvig.",
      "\u201cWhat your director did is not respectful: he called me dumb,\u201d Bosch told Thai reporters then. \u201cIf it takes away your dignity, you need to go.\u201d",
      "The public embarrassment for the organizers was palpable, prompting Miss Universe\u2019s co-owner, Mexican businessman Ra\u00fal Rocha Cant\u00fa, to call out Nawat, saying he won\u2019t let contestants be \u201chumiliated.\u201d",
      "Nawat later offered a teary apology.",
      "\u201cIf anyone (was) affected and not comfortable it happened, I am so sorry,\u201d he said with the contestants behind him. He then turned to them and said, \u201cIt\u2019s passed. OK? Are you happy?\u201d",
      "Then, Omar Harfouch, a Lebanese-French composer, stepped down from the eight-member jury panel, saying Tuesday that there had been a \"secret vote\" by people not officially part of the jury to preselect the top 130 contestants out of 136.",
      "Hours later, another judge, former French soccer star Claude Mak\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9, announced he was stepping down, citing \u201cunforeseen personal reasons.\u201d",
      "Harfouch on Wednesday said he was considering suing the Miss Universe Organization, which runs the competition, citing emotional trauma and reputational damage.",

      "The world-first law comes as lawmakers across the globe wrestle with the impacts of teens\u2019 internet access, with the European Union also considering age restrictions on social media use, while the U.K. has imposed mandatory age checks for sites likely to contain adult content.",
      "Australia has earned a reputation for confrontations with Silicon Valley giants, with a past showdown forcing tech companies to pay for news content used on social media. The country has also weighed rules punishing tech giants for spreading misinformation, and has rejected calls for AI-friendly changes to copyright law.",
      "Meta said in a statement Thursday that it would kick off users it understands to be under the age of 16 using \u201cage assurance methods\u201d by Dec. 10, when Australia\u2019s new law comes into effect. Teenage users can have their access restored once they turn 16, the company said.",

      "Users above 16 who are mistakenly affected can verify their age by uploading a government-issued ID or a video selfie, similar to the age check tools already rolled out in the U.K.",
      "Australian lawmakers cited the impact of excessive use on children\u2019s physical and mental health as they pushed through the law cutting off social media access to under-16s last year. A YouGov poll last year found that 77% of Australians supported the legislation.",
      "Under the ban, social media platforms bear sole responsibility for enforcement, with systemic failures punishable by fines of up to $33 million.",
      "About 96% of children ages 10 to 15 in Australia have used social media, according to a July report by the eSafety Commissioner. Nearly 350,000 Australian kids ages 13-15 use Instagram, official data showed.",

      "He added, \"We can impose further economic costs if Russia continues to ignore calls for a ceasefire. We will also continue to make weapons available for Ukraine\u2019s defense.\"",
      "But the swirling sense that the plan may resemble a Russian wish list threatened a nightmare scenario for Ukraine at a moment of particular peril, with its government mired in a corruption scandal and its military struggling to hold off damaging battlefield setbacks.",
      "Zelenskyy has come under intense pressure this week from his political opponents, who are extremely wary of any deal that would necessitate the country\u2019s capitulation.",

      "In Kyiv, the timing of the plan was viewed as no coincidence, the source close to the Ukrainian government said, most likely an attempt by the Kremlin to take full advantage at an acutely challenging time: Not only do the drones keep falling on its cities, but Russian forces also appear poised to overrun the strategic town of Pokrovsk, a key battlefield victory that could open up the rest of Ukraine\u2019s Donbas heartland to the Russian war machine \u2014 if it isn\u2019t dealt away under pressure from Washington.",

      "Indeed, it\u2019s not just Ukrainians who find the proposals alarming. Many European governments see the idea of ceding territory to Russia and placing future limits on Ukraine\u2019s capacity to defend itself as not only rewarding Putin\u2019s aggression, but also emboldening him to strike elsewhere in Europe.",
      "That\u2019s why the reported terms of Trump\u2019s plan create \u201can extremely dangerous international precedent,\u201d according to Danylo Metelskyi, the director of the Center of Social Transformations, a nongovernmental organization based in Kyiv. \u201cIf territories seized by force remain under the control of the aggressor state, it undermines the entire postwar global order.\u201d",

      "The question now is: Will this \u201cgo the way of previous attempts at a peace process? Rejected by Ukraine and Europe,\u201d Nixey added. \u201cOr will the pressure \u2014 battlefield pressure, societal pressure, U.S. pressure \u2014 be too much for Ukraine and it has to de facto surrender? Because that is what this is.\u201d",

      "A U.S. retiree held in Saudi Arabia over critical tweets has been freed months ahead of schedule, his son said, a day after Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman appeared hand in hand with President Donald Trump at the White House.",
      "\"Our family is overjoyed that, after four long years, our father, Saad Almadi, is finally on his way home,\" his family said in a statement his son Ibrahim posted Wednesday on X.",
      "Riyadh authorities jailed and then banned Saad Almadi, 75, from leaving the country two years ago, downgrading his previous 19-year sentence, which was handed down in 2021.",
      "Ibrahim told CNN that his father, originally from Boca Raton, Florida, was arriving in Philadelphia on Thursday, crediting the Trump administration for his release.",
      "\"This day would not have been possible without President Donald Trump and the tireless efforts of his administration,\" the family said in a statement, also thanking Trump official Sebastian Gorka.",
      "\"No American Left Behind. That is President @realDonaldTrump\u2019s promise from Day One. @WhiteHouse,\u201d Gorka said, reposting the family statement.",
      "The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Trump has touted his dealmaking abilities, having freed several Americans imprisoned in other countries, including six Americans from Venezuela and others from Russia, Afghanistan and Belarus.",
      "Almadi's release came as Trump bolstered U.S. ties with Saudi Arabia, the once deeply conservative, oil-dependent theocracy that the 40-year-old crown prince is trying to transform into a modern and more moderate global power.",
      "Trump was attending a Saudi investment conference in Washington as the news that Almadi was free emerged.",
      "Almadi, a retired project manager who immigrated to the United States in the 1970s, had written over a dozen tweets critical of the Riyadh government.",
      "He was arrested in November 2021 during a visit to Saudi Arabia for a medical procedure and sentenced to prison on terrorism-related charges.",
      "The kingdom freed him after more than a year in prison, dropped his charges to \"cyber crimes\" and prevented him from leaving the country until next March.",
      "One of the tweets Saudi authorities confronted Almadi over discussed the killing of Jamal Khashoggi, his family has said.",
      "His early release comes after Trump defended the crown prince over the murder of Khashoggi, the Washington Post columnist, disavowing the findings by his own intelligence agencies and telling reporters in the Oval Office that the crown prince \u201cknew nothing about it.\u201d",
      "The CIA concluded that he had ordered the killing.",
      "The crown prince has cracked down on internal criticism, with human rights defenders inside and outside the country warning about unfair trials, arbitrary arrests and executions.",
      "While Almadi may have been released, hundreds of people remain jailed or detained in the kingdom, including journalists, activists, scholars and aid workers, human rights groups say.",
      "Crown Prince Mohammed has worked hard to repair his country's image on the global stage, pressing his modernization drive while wielding the kingdom\u2019s power as the world\u2019s largest oil producer and a growing diplomatic player.",
      "On Tuesday, he made his first visit to the White House since the murder and received an elaborate welcome that included a military flyover and an honor guard on horseback \u2014 as well as Trump's rhetorical defense.",
      "Despite the crown prince's success in partially modernizing Saudi society and the economy, the country of 33 million people remains a monarchy where expressing dissent can be dangerous.",
      "Asked about Khashoggi's murder Tuesday, the crown prince promised that \u201cwe are doing our best that this doesn\u2019t happen again.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been painful for us in Saudi Arabia,\u201d he said."

    "summary": "Kate, the Princess of Wales, gave a speech to business leaders and joined Prince William at the Royal Variety Performance after cancer and Prince Andrew scandal shook the royal family.",
    "story": [
      "LONDON \u2014 Shaken by a scandal that saw King Charles III heckled in the streets before banishing his brother, the British royal family finally has some good news: Princess Kate is back.",
      "Consistently rated one of Britain\u2019s most popular royals, Kate appears to have eased into a fuller return to public duties this week.",
      "She made her first in-person speech Monday since she shared her cancer diagnosis 18 months ago.",
      "\u201cThe love we feel in our earliest years fundamentally shapes who we become and how we thrive as adults,\u201d Kate said, addressing business leaders at the Future Workforce Summit in London about the importance of early childhood, a cause she has championed for years.",
      "\u201cLove is the first and most essential bond.\u201d",
      "The princess has made a growing number of public appearances since she announced this year that her cancer was in remission, but the speech appears to bring her back into the royal fold more permanently.",
      "\"Welcome back, Princess,\" beamed the Daily Telegraph front page.",
      "She drew more positive coverage after a further appearance Wednesday evening for one of the most joyful events on the royal calendar, the annual Royal Variety Performance, telling well-wishers it was \u201cso nice to be back\u201d at the event, according to British media.",
      "She returns after weeks of torrid headlines for the family, with the king stripping his brother Andrew of his princely title last month amid growing scrutiny over his ties to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.",
      "\u201cWhat you see and hear about Catherine is the monarchy doing the sort of work that it should be doing today,\u201d said Craig Prescott, who teaches law at Royal Holloway, University of London, and specializes in the constitutional and political role of the monarchy.",
      "He told NBC News that the speech focusing on early childhood was a \u201cgood moment\u201d for the family, reflective of its role taking on \u201cinteresting but not directly political causes.\u201d",
      "The focus has been on anything but the family\u2019s normal load of public engagements and ribbon cutting in recent years as the royals have endured a stream of uncertainty and upheaval since Queen Elizabeth II's death in 2022.",
      "The royal family was shaken early last year by the announcement that Charles, then 75, had been diagnosed with cancer after just two years on the throne, for which he is still undergoing treatment.",
      "Relations with the media were then undercut by a damaging saga when Kate, then largely absent from the public eye, admitted having altered a family photo released by the palace. Weeks later, Kate announced her diagnosis and said she was undergoing chemotherapy.",
      "The king has also been working to heal a rift with his son Prince Harry, who stepped down from his royal duties in 2020. They met for a private tea in September, their first meeting in almost two years; William was not present.",
      "It was the king\u2019s younger brother Andrew who generated what Prescott called the first significant crisis of Charles\u2019 reign, with fresh revelations about his ties to Epstein last month spurring the king to strip his royal titles and eject him from his home in Windsor.",
      "Earlier this month, 16 Democrats on the House Oversight Committee wrote to ask the former prince, now Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, to cooperate with their inquiry into Epstein. Thursday is the deadline for Andrew to respond.",
      "Now, with Kate seemingly back on the royal front line, there appears to be an opportunity to refocus, royal observers said.",
      "\u201cThis was Kate\u2019s first speech in two years, and she looked very polished, very calm and confident, and she is clearly in a really good place,\u201d said Emily Nash, royal editor at HELLO! Magazine. \u201cWe can expect to see a lot more of this going forward.\u201d",
      "Kate regularly polls as one of the most popular members of the royal family.",
      "Her favorability rating stood at 73% in October, according to a poll by YouGov, just below that of her husband, Prince William, at 76%. The royal family in general had a 59% favorability rating.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a feeling that she\u2019s never put a foot wrong,\u201d Prescott said. A sense of affection and support for William after his mother, Princess Diana, died in a car crash extended to Kate after she married into the royal family and \u201cgave her a good platform from which to build,\u201d he added.",
      "Like the late queen, she is someone who takes her role as a member of the royal family very seriously and understands the concept of duty, Prescott said."

    "story": [
      "Two judges have resigned from the Miss Universe international beauty pageant, with one making accusations of rigging and considering a lawsuit as the annual competition nears its end in Bangkok.",
      "Omar Harfouch, a Lebanese-French composer, was the first to step down from the eight-member panel, saying Tuesday on Instagram that there had been a \u201csecret vote\u201d by people not on the official jury to preselect the top 30 contestants out of 136.",
      "On Wednesday, Harfouch said he was considering suing the Miss Universe Organization, which runs the competition, citing emotional trauma and reputational damage.",
      "\u201cI was misled and publicly used to give credibility to an election process that was already compromised,\u201d he said on Instagram, adding that a member of the unofficial group had a romantic relationship with one of the contestants.",
      "The Miss Universe Organization denied Harfouch\u2019s accusations, saying Tuesday on Instagram that there was no impromptu jury and that all competition evaluations continued to follow the organization\u2019s \u201cestablished, transparent, and supervised\u201d protocols.",
      "It said the group of people Harfouch was referring to was the official selection committee for a separate social impact initiative.",
      "The Miss Universe Organization did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "A second judge, former French soccer star Claude Mak\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9, also stepped down Tuesday, citing \u201cunforeseen personal reasons.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis was a difficult decision, as I hold Miss Universe in the highest regard,\u201d he said on Instagram.",
      "The pageant, which began Nov. 5 and concludes Friday, also made headlines this month when several contestants walked out after Nawat Itsaragrisil, a Thai businessman who is co-owner of the Miss Universe Organization, chided Miss Mexico, F\u00e1tima Bosch, for not taking part in promotional activities.",
      "Nawat later apologized and was admonished by his fellow owner, Raul Rocha Cant\u00fa, who said he would not let contestants be \u201chumiliated.\u201d",
      "Miss Jamaica, Gabrielle Henry, is also recovering at a hospital after she fell offstage Wednesday during the preliminary evening gown round.",
      "Founded in 1952 by a California swimwear brand, Miss Universe quickly became a lucrative business, passing through the ownership of mostly male executives, including President Donald Trump, who owned the rights either in part or in full from 1996 until 2022.",
      "The competition, which generates most of its revenue from licensing regional broadcasting rights, was sold to Anne Jakkaphong Jakrajutatip, a Thai businesswoman, for $20 million in 2022.",
      "Over the years, Miss Universe has suffered from slumping viewership as criticism over its objectification of women rose.",
      "While the competition has made modest strides under Jakrajutatip\u2019s ownership, such as allowing married women and mothers to compete, complaints of sexual harassment and rigging have continued across almost every iteration."
