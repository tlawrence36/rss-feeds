    "story": [
      "The Vietnam War produced some of the most classic films of the late 1970s and 1980s",
      "\u201cMe love you long time,\u201d a Vietnamese sex worker tells the U.S. troops, swiveling her hips as she hawks her services. \u201cYou party?\u201d The first female character in Stanley Kubrick\u2019s Vietnam War classic \u201cFull Metal Jacket,\u201d she appears for just a moment \u2014 and halfway through the film.",
      "Likewise, it\u2019s an hour into Francis Ford Coppola\u2019s \u201cApocalypse Now\u201d when a helicopter suddenly deposits three women onto a stage. They're scantily clad Playboy Bunnies, choppered in to rile up the troops. They, too, appear for just a few minutes.",
      "The Vietnam War produced some of the most unforgettable films of the late 1970s and 1980s, as top Hollywood filmmakers like Kubrick, Coppola, Oliver Stone and others grappled with its painful legacy. Few, however, had classic, or even three-dimensional, female characters \u2014 with the notable exception of \u201cComing Home,\u201d which won Jane Fonda an Oscar.",
      "But while these films were almost exclusively about how war dehumanized men \u2014 with female characters mere devices to tell that story \u2014 the opposite was often true of Vietnamese films about the conflict. Many of these were told from a female viewpoint \u2014 the stories of brave and loyal women, for example, left to hold families together.",
      "Here are some ways that classic Vietnam War films used female characters to tell their stories:",
      "Michael Cimino\u2019s multi-Oscar-winning \u201cThe Deer Hunter\u201d focuses on three lifelong buddies from a Pennsylvania steel town who go off to fight, with traumatic results.",
      "Since the 1978 drama starts and ends at home, there\u2019s room for a female character in Meryl Streep\u2019s Linda, girlfriend of Nick (Christopher Walken) who also connects with Michael (Robert De Niro). An early-career Streep was such a magnetic presence as Linda \u2014 earning an Oscar nomination \u2014 that it disguised a fairly thin role that mainly advanced the men's narrative.",
      "A rare contrast was Hal Ashby\u2019s \u201cComing Home\u201d the same year, in which Fonda and Jon Voight both won Oscars for the tale of a Marine wife embroiled in an intense affair with a wounded veteran at the rehab center where she volunteers.",
      "\u201cThis is the only Hollywood film set during the Vietnam War that\u2019s told from the point of view of a female character,\u201d says filmmaker Tony Bui, who also teaches Vietnam War cinema at Columbia University. \u201cThat's really saying something.\u201d",
      "Its tortured journey to the screen is a drama in itself, but 1979's \u201cApocalypse Now,\u201d with Martin Sheen as an army captain tasked with assassinating a renegade U.S. colonel (Marlon Brando), is considered a masterpiece of the genre. As in many Hollywood Vietnam films, women are extras in villages, screaming and running from gunfire and deadly explosions \u2014 or killed brutally for no reason at all.",
      "Then there are the Playboy Bunnies, who gyrate to \u201cSuzy Q\u201d as the troops become increasingly frenzied with erotic excitement and eventually storm the stage.",
      "Lan Duong, assistant professor of cinema studies at the University of Southern California, sees Coppola trying to make a connection between sex, warfare and masculinity.",
      "\u201cWith American white women in particular, they\u2019re seen as part of the American mythology around manhood,\u201d Duong says. Full-blooded manhood with raging hormones, she says, is \u201cas American as apple pie.\u201d",
      "In 1986's \u201cPlatoon,\u201d Stone's Oscar-winning depiction of jungle warfare, representation of women comes in a horrific scene in which U.S. troops kills hundreds of innocent villagers, evoking the real-life My Lai massacre. During the slaughter, idealistic soldier Chris (Charlie Sheen) comes upon soldiers raping young women. \u201cShe\u2019s a human being!\u201d he screams. They reply: \u201cYou don\u2019t belong in \u2019Nam, man.\u201d",
      "These women are given no voice. They appear \u201conly in relation to the violence inflicted by men,\u201d Bui says.",
      "In Brian de Palma\u2019s \u201cCasualties of War\u201d (1989), the tragic rape victim actually becomes a central character in the plot. This does not mean, however, that we learn much of anything about this Vietnamese girl (Thuy Thu Le).",
      "Based on a real event, the film follows five soldiers whose leader (Sean Penn) devises a sickening plan: The group will kidnap a young girl for \u201crecreation\u201d during a mission.",
      "Only Pvt. Eriksson (Michael J. Fox) objects. The four others not only rape the girl, but eventually pump her with bullets. Eriksson takes the case to superiors, who advise him to drop it. But Eriksson persists, and the men earn punishment.",
      "Though important, this brutalized girl is again voiceless. \u201cShe goes from suffering, to suffering more, and then gets killed \u2014 that\u2019s her arc,\u201d says Bui, who includes the movie in a Criterion Channel collection he has curated on Vietnam films.",
      "Kubrick\u2019s memorable 1987 \u201cFull Metal Jacket\u201d contains two brief, stereotypical scenes involving sex workers. But the most interesting scene involving a female character comes during battle, where a sniper targeting U.S. troops turns out to be a terrified girl in pigtails. As she lies mortally wounded, she begs quietly, \u201cShoot me.\u201d The soldiers oblige.",
      "The stereotypical nature of the sex worker scenes is, for Bui, redeemed somewhat by the character of the sniper (Ngoc Le), whose courage is acknowledged.",
      "In Bui's own \u201cThree Seasons,\u201d a 1999 Vietnamese-American production, sex worker Lan (Diep Bui) is central to the story, an exploration of postwar life in Ho Chi Minh City. A cyclo driver falls in love with Lan and trails her around the city, trying to help her find a better life.",
      "Bui says his research has found that more than half of Vietnamese films about the conflict have female protagonists. One of the most famous, H\u1ea3i Ninh\u2019s landmark \u201cThe Little Girl of Hanoi\u201d (1974), follows a young girl (Lan H\u01b0\u01a1ng) searching for her family in bombed-out Hanoi.",
      "Another, \u0110\u1eb7ng Nh\u1eadt Minh\u2019s \u201cWhen the Tenth Month Comes\u201d (1984), tells the story of Duyen (L\u00ea V\u00e2n), a young wife and mother in the rural north whose husband goes to war. Her ailing father-in-law asks frequently why the soldier has not written home. Duyen learns one day that her husband's been dead for a year and enlists a local schoolteacher to help her hide that by forging eloquent letters.",
      "The character is emblematic of the way Vietnamese culture has long portrayed the woman: fierce, loyal and resilient in the face of adversity, argues Duong.",
      "\u201cShe is beautiful. She\u2019s suffering. She\u2019s loyal to the memory of her dead husband,\u201d notes Duong. \u201cIt\u2019s been argued by \u0110\u1eb7ng Nh\u1eadt Minh himself ... that she's a symbol for the nation itself. So it becomes a really rich metaphor for filmmakers.\u201d",
      "The risk, she adds, is that such characters, serving as symbols, can also lack dimension.",
      "Stone is one of the only directors to have explicitly addressed the minimal role of women in his Vietnam works, saying \u201cPlatoon\u201d was deliberately a male-driven narrative.",
      "But with his third and last Vietnam War film, \u201cHeaven & Earth\u201d (1993), Stone shifted to the perspective of a real-life Vietnamese woman: Le Ly (Hiep Thi Le), who endures rape and torture as a young woman, then moves to California with her troubled American military husband (Tommy Lee Jones).",
      "\u201cThere is some truth to the criticism of my treatment of women,\u201d Stone said while making the film. \u201cI have a lot to learn about everything, not just women.\u201d",
      "Making his point crystal clear, Stone dedicates the film at the end to his mother, Jacqueline Stone.",

      "Organizers and the Kennedy Center have canceled a week\u2019s worth of events celebrating LGBTQ+ rights for this summer\u2019s World Pride festival in Washington, D",
      "WASHINGTON -- Organizers and the Kennedy Center have canceled a week\u2019s worth of events celebrating LGBTQ+ rights for this summer\u2019s World Pride festival in Washington, D.C., amid a shift in priorities and the ousting of leadership at one of the nation\u2019s premier cultural institutions.",
      "Multiple artists and producers involved in the center\u2019s Tapestry of Pride schedule, which had been planned for June 5 to 8, told The Associated Press that their events had been quietly canceled or moved to other venues. And in the wake of the cancellations, Washington\u2019s Capital Pride Alliance has disassociated itself from the Kennedy Center.",
      "\u201cWe are a resilient community, and we have found other avenues to celebrate,\u201d said June Crenshaw, deputy director of the alliance. \u201cWe are finding another path to the celebration \u2026 but the fact that we have to maneuver in this way is disappointing.\u201d",
      "The Kennedy Center\u2019s website still lists Tapestry of Pride on its website with a general description and a link to the World Pride site. There are no other details.",
      "The Kennedy Center did not respond to a request from the AP for comment.",
      "The move comes on the heels of massive changes at the Kennedy Center, with President Donald Trump firing both the president and chairman in early February. Trump replaced most of the board with loyalists, who then elected him the new Kennedy Center chairman.",
      "The World Pride event, held every two years, starts in just under a month \u2014 running from May 17 through June 8 with performances and celebrations planned across the capital city. But Trump administration policies on transgender rights and comments about Kennedy Center drag performances have sparked concern about what kind of reception attendees will receive.",
      "\u201cI know that D.C. as a community will be very excited to be hosting World Pride, but I know the community is a little bit different than the government,\u201d said Michael Roest, founder and director of the International Pride Orchestra, which had its June 5 performance at the Kennedy Center abruptly canceled within days of Trump\u2019s takeover.",
      "Roest told the AP he was in the final stages of planning the Kennedy Center performance after months of emails and Zoom calls. He was waiting on a final contract when Trump posted on social media Feb. 7 of the leadership changes and his intention to transform the Kennedy Center\u2019s programming.",
      "Immediately the Kennedy Center became nonresponsive, Roest said. On Feb. 12, he said, he received a one-sentence email from a Kennedy Center staffer stating, \u201cWe are no longer able to advance your contract at this time.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey went from very eager to host to nothing,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have not since heard a word from anybody at the Kennedy Center, but that\u2019s not going to stop us.\u201d",
      "In the wake of the cancellation, Roest said he managed to move the International Pride Orchestra performance to the Strathmore theater in nearby Bethesda, Maryland.",
      "Crenshaw said some other events, including a drag story time and a display of parts of the AIDS Memorial Quilt, would be moved to the World Pride welcome center in Chinatown.",
      "Monica Alford, a veteran event planner with a long history of working with the Kennedy Center, was scheduled to organize an event June 8 as part of Tapestry of Pride, but said she also saw communication abruptly end within days of Trump\u2019s takeover.",
      "Alford organized the first ever drag brunch on the Kennedy Center rooftop in 2024, and said she regarded the institution \u2014 and its recent expansion known as The Reach \u2014 as \u201cmy home base\u201d and \u201ca safe space for the queer community\u201d",
      "She said she was still finalizing the details of her event, which she described as \u201cmeant to be family-friendly, just like the drag brunch was family-friendly and classy and sophisticated.\u201d",
      "She said she mourns the loss of the partnership she nurtured with the Kennedy Center.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re doing our community a disservice \u2014 not just the queer community but the entire community,\u201d she said.",
      "Roest said he never received an explanation as to why the performance was canceled so late in the planning stages. He said his orchestra would no longer consider performing at the Kennedy Center, and he believes most queer artists would make the same choice.",
      "\u201cThere would need to be a very, very public statement of inclusivity from the administration, from that board, for us to consider that,\u201d he said. \u201cOtherwise it is a hostile performance space.\u201d",

      "The Vietnam War cast a long shadow across one of the most fertile periods of American filmmaking, and has led filmmakers for the half-century since to reckon with its complicated legacy.",
      "These 10 films, assembled to mark the 50th anniversary of the fall of Saigon, range from indelible anti-war classics to Vietnamese portraits of resistance, capturing the vastness of the war\u2019s still-reverberating traumas.",
      "The war was more than a decade in and some eight years from its conclusion when a 25-year-old Martin Scorsese made this six-minute short. In it, a man simply shaves himself before a sink and a mirror. After a few knicks and cuts, he doesn\u2019t stop, continuing until his face is a bloody mess \u2014 a neat but gruesome metaphor to Vietnam.",
      "A young girl (Lan H\u01b0\u01a1ng) searches for her family in the bombed-out ruins of Hanoi in H\u1ea3i Ninh\u2019s landmark of Vietnamese cinema. It\u2019s a work of wartime propaganda (it begins with the intro: \u201chonoring the heroes of Hanoi who defeated the American imperialist B-52 bombing raid\u201d) but also of aching humanity. Set against the December 1972 bombing raids on Hanoi, \u201cThe Little Girl of Hanoi\u201d is cinema made in the very midst of war.",
      "Controversy greeted Peter Davis\u2019 landmark documentary around its release, but time has only proved how soberly clear-eyed it was. Newsreel clips and homefront interviews are contrasted with the horrors on the ground in Vietnam in this penetrating examination of the gulf between American policy and Vietnamese reality. Its title comes from President Lyndon B. Johnson\u2019s line, said when escalating the war, that \u201cthe ultimate victory will depend on the hearts and minds of the people who actually live out there.\u201d",
      "It's arguably the preeminent American film about the Vietnam War. No other movie more grandly or tragically charts the American evolution from innocence to disillusionment than Michael Cimino\u2019s devastating epic about working-class friends (Robert De Niro, Christopher Walken, John Savage) from a Pennsylvania steel town drafted into war. The final sing-along scene to \u201cGod Bless America,\u201d after their lives have irrevocably changed, remains a powerfully poignant gut punch.",
      "Francis Ford Coppola wagered everything he had on his masterpiece \u2014 and nearly lost it. \u201cApocalypse Now,\u201d which transposes Joseph Conrad\u2019s \u201cHeart of Darkness\u201d to the Vietnam War, is an epic of madness that teeters on the brink of hallucination. Shot in the Philippines and more faithful to Conrad than to Vietnam, \u201cApocalypse Now\u201d doesn\u2019t so much illuminate the chaos and moral confusion of the war as elevate it to grandiose nightmare.",
      "The 1980s saw a wave of Hollywood films about Vietnam, including \u201cFirst Blood,\u201d \u201cHamburger Hill,\u201d \u201cGood Morning Vietnam,\u201d \u201cCasualties of War\u201d and \u201cBorn on the Fourth of July.\u201d Foremost among them is the Oscar best picture-winning \u201cPlatoon,\u201d which Oliver Stone wrote based on his own experiences as an infantryman in Vietnam. Widely acclaimed for its realism, Stone\u2019s film remains among the most intensely vivid and visceral dramatizations of the war.",
      "Stanley Kubrick should be more often thought of as the supreme anti-war moviemaker. His devastating World War I film \u201cPaths of Glory\u201d and the subversive satire \u201cDr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb\u201d are classics in their own right. \u201cFull Metal Jacket\u201d carries those films\u2019 themes of dehumanization into an even more brutal place. Split between the harrowing boot-camp tyranny of R. Lee Ermey\u2019s drill instructor and the urban violence of the 1968 Tet Offensive, \u201cFull Metal Jacket\u201d fuses both ends of the war machine.",
      "How former soldiers lived with their experience in Vietnam has been a subject of many fine films, from Hal Ashby\u2019s \u201cComing Home\u201d (1978) to Spike Lee\u2019s \u201cDa 5 Bloods\u201d (2020). In Werner Herzog\u2019s nonfiction gem, he profiles the astonishing story of German-American pilot Dieter Dengler. In the film, which Herzog later remade as 2007\u2019s \u201cRescue Dawn\u201d with Christian Bale, Dengler recounts \u2014 and sometimes reenacts \u2014 his experience being shot down over Laos, being captured and tortured and then escaping into the jungle.",
      "Not long after the turn of the century, former U.S. defense secretary and Vietnam War architect Robert S. McNamara sat for interviews with documentarian Errol Morris. The result is a chilling reflection on the thinking that led to one of American\u2019s greatest follies. It\u2019s not a mea culpa but a thornier and more disquieting rumination on how rationalized ideology can lead to the deaths of millions \u2014 and still not yield an apology. Of McNamara\u2019s lessons, No. 1 is \u201cempathize with the enemy.\u201d",
      "Steven Spielberg\u2019s stirring film dramatizes the Washington Post\u2019s 1971 publishing of the Pentagon Papers, a collection of classified documents that chronicled America\u2019s 20-year involvement in Southeast Asia. While government analyst Daniel Ellsberg (a moving participant in \u201cHearts and Minds\u201d) could be considered the hero of this story, \u201cThe Post\u201d turns its focus to Washington Post publisher Katharine Graham (Meryl Streep) and the wartime role of the Fourth Estate.",

      "A former roommate of one of Harvey Weinstein's accusers has testified the woman told her in July 2006 that the then-movie mogul had forcibly performed oral sex on her",
      "NEW YORK -- Hovering in the doorway of her roommate's bedroom one evening in July 2006, TV production assistant Miriam Haley said Harvey Weinstein \u2014 her boss \u2014 had forcibly performed oral sex on her, her then-roommate testified Thursday at the ex-movie mogul's retrial.",
      "\u201cI said, \u2018Miriam, that sounds like rape. I think you should call a lawyer,\u2019\u201d but a shaken Haley seemed disinclined to do so, recalled the ex-roommate, Elizabeth Entin.",
      "If secondhand, it was the first testimony jurors have gotten so far about any of the alleged sexual assaults at the heart of the retrial, which opened Wednesday. Haley and two other accusers are expected to testify later in the weekslong proceeding.",
      "Weinstein, 73, maintains that he has never sexually assaulted or raped anyone. His lawyers argue that his accusers consented to sexual encounters with the Oscar-winning producer in hopes of getting ahead in the entertainment business.",
      "Weinstein was transformed in 2017 from a Hollywood tycoon into the #MeToo movement's archvillain, after a series of sexual misconduct allegations against him became public.",
      "He was convicted in 2020 of raping Jessica Mann, who was once an aspiring actor, and sexually assaulting Haley, who worked on the Weinstein-produced \u201cProject Runway.\u201d But New York's highest court overturned his conviction last year, finding that the trial judge had allowed prejudicial testimony.",
      "The reversal led to the retrial, which includes an additional allegation of forcible oral sex on a different woman, former model Kaja Sokola. Weinstein has pleaded not guilty to all the charges.",
      "Entin was among the witnesses who are returning to the stand five years after testifying in the landmark #MeToo case. But prosecutors, some defense lawyers and the judge are different \u2014 and so are the contours of the testimony and evidence being elicited.",
      "For instance, this time Entin didn't give any details of what she said Haley told her about the alleged sexual assault.",
      "And Entin wasn't asked about a recollection that made for a memorable and rare light moment at the first trial \u2014 a time when she said Weinstein showed up uninvited and was chased around the women's apartment by Entin's pet Chihuahua.",
      "Farber had indicated he didn't think that having Entin describe the purported episode was fair game for the trial.",
      "In another measure of the looping trajectory of the case, Entin found herself testifying about what she has said and written about the first trial itself. The fashion startup founder and consultant has reflected on the case in a book, on podcasts and some interviews.",
      "Weinstein attorney Jennifer Bonjean confronted her with instances in which Entin referred to her participation in the first trial as her \u201c15 minutes of fame\u201d and compared gearing up for testifying to preparing for battle.",
      "Entin responded tensely that being cross-examined was a form of \u201cvery civilized battle.\u201d",
      "The voluble Entin said that her writing style was sometimes \u201cmildly hyperbolic,\u201d but that she'd been describing how she girded herself for a daunting experience.",
      "The Associated Press does not identify people who allege they have been sexually assaulted unless they agree to be named. Haley, Mann and Sokola have done so.",

      "If you wanted to find the Vietnam War in American television shows, you mostly had to wait until it was long over",
      "The evening news brought the Vietnam War into American living rooms, but once the news was over, so was the war. Prime-time shows brought nary a mention of it as networks looked to bring uncontroversial content to the broadest possible audience. But the war simmered below the surface as subtext, and when enough years passed, television would finally take it on as a subject.",
      "\u201cGomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.\u201d premiered on CBS six weeks after the 1964 Gulf of Tonkin resolution authorized U.S. combat troops in Vietnam, and the daft comedy was among the chief images of the military in American homes through the peak of U.S. involvement in 1969. Naturally, the show about a country rube in the Marine Corps never directly mentioned the war. But most of the real-life Marines who marched in its introduction would soon be fighting in Vietnam. Star Jim Nabors later said watching that intro was difficult, knowing some of those men had died.",
      "It would take \u201cAll in the Family\u201d to bring the war into prime-time discourse. The Norman Lear-created CBS comedy owed its popularity to timely political bickering between cantankerous patriarch Archie Bunker (Carroll O\u2019Connor) and his liberal-minded son-in-law Michael \u201cMeathead\u201d Stivic (Rob Reiner). Vietnam was the sole subject of a landmark 1976 episode where a draft-dodging fugitive friend of Michael\u2019s comes to Christmas dinner, and an explosive argument ensues. \u201cWhen the hell are you going to admit that the war was wrong?!\u201d Michael shouts. A friend of Archie\u2019s whose son died in the war shocks him by taking his son-in-law\u2019s side.",
      "Set in the Korean War of the early 1950s, \u201cM(asterisk)A(asterisk)S(asterisk)H,\u201d the CBS dramedy about wisecracking U.S. Army doctors, was among the most popular shows in the country during the Vietnam War\u2019s final years. It was heavy with anti-military, anti-war sentiment, evoking the zeitgeist of a Vietnam-exhausted populace. \u201cWar isn\u2019t Hell,\u201d Hawkeye Pierce, played by Alan Alda, says in a typical line. \u201cThere are no innocent bystanders in Hell, but war is chock full of them.\u201d (The Robert Altman film the show stemmed from deliberately minimized references to Korea to maximize its unspoken commentary on Vietnam.)",
      "Television's first regular portrayal of Vietnam veterans came in the form of a cartoonish crew of daring mercenaries that reflected the era of Reagan and Rambo. NBC\u2019s \u201cThe A-Team,\u201d whose members included a mohawked-and-gold-chained Mr. T and a cigar-chomping George Peppard, were a \u201ccrack commando unit\u201d who were innocent fugitives from military justice and worked as mercenaries pulling off weekly capers. Explosions and jumping cars abounded. In a fourth-season episode, the team returns to Vietnam for a job. Peppard\u2019s Hannibal momentarily struggles with dark war memories before getting back to the lighthearted action.",
      "HBO aired and helped organize a 1987 charity concert dubbed \u201cWelcome Home\u201d that billed itself as the warm celebration Vietnam War veterans never got upon their return. Performers included James Brown, Linda Ronstadt and Stevie Wonder. The July Fourth concert was not a militaristic affair, and had a hate-the-war, love-the-troops vibe. Some of the most anti-war songs of the \u201960s were performed by artists like John Fogerty and Crosby, Stills & Nash. The event would be a harbinger of a wave of cultural nostalgia and reckoning as baby boomers began turning 40 and were in the mood to reflect.",
      "With \u201cTour of Duty,\u201d the Vietnam War finally came to prime time. The CBS series that premiered in 1987 showed actual combat and the young men who fought and died in it. It might have been called \u201cPlatoon: The Series,\u201d after the Vietnam film that had just won best picture at the Oscars. Surprisingly gory and gritty for a network show, it had all the hallmarks of the era\u2019s many Vietnam movies. But executives seeking lower costs and higher ratings \u2014 which never came \u2014 eventually moved production from Hawaii to California and introduced romances and soapy plotlines typical of TV dramas.",
      "And suddenly, there were two Vietnam series on TV. ABC\u2019s \u201cChina Beach\u201d was part-\u201cM(asterisk)A(asterisk)S(asterisk)H,\u201d part-\u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy,\u201d part-\u201cMad Men.\u201d Set in a wartime evacuation hospital \u2014 the title was the Americans\u2019 nickname for My Khe Beach in \u0110\u00e0 N\u1eb5ng \u2014 it focused on Army medics and civilians. It was festooned with \u201960s songs whose copyrights have kept the series off streaming services. Beloved by critics, \u201cChina Beach\u201d made a star and a best-actress Emmy winner of Dana Delany, but never found a mass audience. With its cancellation, network TV depictions of the war would disappear for years.",
      "\u201cThe Wonder Years\u201d was baby boomer nostalgia in its purest form. The ABC series, narrated by an adult Kevin Arnold (voiced by Daniel Stern, played as a child by Fred Savage), depicts his boyhood feelings and experiences with the backing of sentimental \u201960s songs. The specter of Vietnam dominates its first season, which sees Kevin\u2019s hero \u2014 the big brother of his neighbor and crush Winnie Cooper \u2014 die in the war. In a 2021 reboot, the story shifts to a Black family in Alabama, with narrator Dean Williams\u2019 brother a returning Vietnam vet who faces racism at home.",
      "The NBC miniseries \u201cThe \u201960s\u201d was a roundup of the decade\u2019s cliches that by then had been well-established in movies and TV. The 1999 two-night event was billed as \u201cthe movie event of a generation.\u201d Its subjects were three Chicago siblings who each go on very 1960s journeys. For Jerry O\u2019Connell\u2019s high-school quarterback character, that meant serving in Vietnam. He enlists in a gung-ho moment, but by the show\u2019s second night, he\u2019s back home with an Army jacket and long hair, drinking to bury his trauma. The show drew a big audience at a time when NBC was ratings king.",
      "The time-hopping, tear-jerking NBC family drama \u201cThis Is Us\u201d used the Vietnam War to delve into the psyche of Jack Pearson (Milo Ventimiglia), who refused to talk about his experience as a soldier with his wife and kids before his premature death. In dual plotlines that run through its third season, with the emotional themes and folk-acoustic soundtrack that are hallmarks of \u201cThis Is Us,\u201d Jack is shown enlisting to try to protect his drafted younger brother. Decades later, his son Kevin (Justin Hartley) travels to Vietnam to find out what happened to his father and uncle.",
      "In a docuseries that ran over 10 nights on PBS, the Vietnam War got the same hallowed treatment Ken Burns brought nearly 30 years earlier to the Civil War. Burns and Lynn Novick's \u201cThe Vietnam War\" was not as soft or sentimental as his reputation might have suggested. It was a rare PBS show with a TV-MA rating, and its tone, with a modern soundtrack from composers Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, matched the messiness of the conflict. The show went to lengths to include a North Vietnamese perspective along with American and South Vietnamese vets and historians.",
      "It took until 2024 before a fictional television show would attempt a Vietnamese perspective of the war\u2019s end and its aftermath, though it brought mixed reactions from Vietnamese American viewers. HBO\u2019s \u201cThe Sympathizer\u201d was based on Viet Thanh Nguyen\u2019s Pulitzer Prize-winning novel. The first two episodes of the black-comic limited series depict a harrowing flight during the fall of Saigon. Actors of Vietnamese descent played most of its main roles, including lead Hoa Xuande. But much of the attention given to it \u2014 and its only Emmy nomination \u2014 went to Robert Downey Jr. for his portrayal of four different white American men.",

      "Harvey Weinstein is on trial again after an appeals court threw out the ex-studio-boss' 2020 rape conviction in a case that was a watershed for the #MeToo movement",
      "NEW YORK -- Opening statements began Wednesday in Harvey Weinstein \u2019s rape retrial, five years after his original #MeToo trial delivered a searing reckoning for one of Hollywood\u2019s most powerful figures.",
      "Emphasizing the former studio boss's onetime influence in the movie industry, prosecutor Shannon Lucey said Weinstein used \u201cdream opportunities as weapons\u201d to prey on the three accusers in the case. He is charged with raping one and forcing oral sex on the other two.",
      "\u201cThe defendant wanted their bodies, and the more they resisted, the more forceful he got,\u201d Lucey said.",
      "The case is being retried because an appeals court threw out the landmark 2020 conviction.",
      "The retrial is happening at the same Manhattan courthouse as the first trial, and two accusers who testified then are expected to return.",
      "Weinstein\u2019s retrial is playing out at a different cultural moment than the first, which happened during the height of the #MeToo movement. Along with the charges being retried, he faces an additional allegation from a woman who wasn\u2019t involved in the first case.",
      "The jury counts seven women and five men \u2014 unlike the seven-man, five-woman panel that convicted him in 2020 \u2014 and there's a different judge.",
      "The #MeToo movement, which exploded in 2017 with allegations against Weinstein, has also evolved and ebbed.",
      "At the start of Weinstein\u2019s first trial, chants of \u201crapist\u201d could be heard from protesters outside.",
      "TV trucks lined the street, and reporters queued for hours to get a seat in the packed courtroom. His lawyers decried the \u201ccarnival-like atmosphere\u201d and fought unsuccessfully to get the trial moved from Manhattan.",
      "This time, over five days of jury selection, there was none of that.",
      "Those realities, coupled with the New York Court of Appeals\u2019 ruling last year vacating his 2020 conviction and 23-year prison sentence \u2014 because the judge allowed testimony about allegations Weinstein was not charged with \u2014 are shaping everything from retrial legal strategy to the atmosphere in court.",
      "Weinstein, 73, is being retried on a criminal sex act charge for allegedly forcibly performing oral sex on a movie and TV production assistant, Miriam Haley, in 2006 and a third-degree rape charge for allegedly assaulting an aspiring actor, Jessica Mann, in a Manhattan hotel room in 2013.",
      "Weinstein also faces a criminal sex act charge for allegedly forcing oral sex on a different woman at a Manhattan hotel in 2006. Prosecutors said that the woman, who hasn\u2019t been named publicly, came forward days before his first trial but wasn\u2019t part of that case. They said they revisited her allegations when his conviction was thrown out.",
      "The Associated Press does not generally identify people alleging sexual assault unless they consent to be named, as Haley and Mann have done.",
      "Weinstein has pleaded not guilty and denies raping or sexually assaulting anyone. His acquittals on the two most serious charges at his 2020 trial \u2014 predatory sexual assault and first-degree rape \u2014 still stand.",
      "Lindsay Goldbrum, a lawyer for the unnamed accuser, said Weinstein\u2019s retrial marks a \u201cpivotal moment in the fight for accountability in sex abuse cases\u201d and a \u201csignal to other survivors that the system is catching up \u2014 and that it\u2019s worth speaking out even when the odds seem insurmountable.\u201d",
      "This time around, the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office is prosecuting Weinstein through its Special Victims Division, which specializes in such cases, after homicide veterans helmed the 2020 version. At the same time, Weinstein has added several lawyers to his defense team \u2014 including Jennifer Bonjean, who is involved in appealing his 2022 rape conviction in Los Angeles. She helped Bill Cosby get his conviction overturned and defended R. Kelly in his sex crimes case.",
      "\u201cThis trial is not going to be all about #MeToo. It\u2019s going to be about the facts of what took place,\u201d Weinstein\u2019s lead attorney, Arthur Aidala, said recently. \u201cAnd that\u2019s a big deal. And that\u2019s the way it\u2019s supposed to be.\u201d",
      "But there has already been some talk of #MeToo. A prosecutor asked prospective jurors whether they'd heard of the movement. Most said they had, but that it wouldn't affect them either way.",
      "Others went further.",
      "A woman opined that \u201cnot enough has been done\u201d as a result of #MeToo. A man explained that he had negative feelings about it because his high school classmates had been falsely accused of sexual assault.",
      "Another man said he viewed #MeToo like other social movements: \u201cIt\u2019s a pendulum. It swings way one way, then way the other way, and then it settles.\u201d",
      "None of them is on the jury.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Oscar voters will no longer be able to skip watching some of the nominated films.",
      "The Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences on Monday announced that members will from now on be required to watch all nominated films in each category to be eligible to vote in the final round of Oscar voting. Up until now, Oscar voters had only been encouraged to watch the nominees, and vote in categories they felt qualified in.",
      "But in recent years, what films get watched by academy members has been increasingly seen as a significant factor in what wins. At the same time, the publication of anonymous Oscar ballots has often featured members confessing that they didn't get around to watching some notable films or not finishing lengthier nominees.",
      "On Monday, the academy also put forth a handful of new regulations on issues including AI, refugee filmmakers and the newly launched casting category.",
      "In the best international film category, the academy will now allow filmmakers with refugee or asylum status to be represented by a country not their own. The rule change keeps in place the broad apparatus of how international nominees are submitted through countries, but it tweaks eligibility.",
      "The regulation now reads: \u201cThe submitting country must confirm that creative control of the film was largely in the hands of citizens, residents, or individuals with refugee or asylum status in the submitting country.\u201d",
      "Critics have long called on changes to the nominating process for best international film because it leaves the submission process in the hands of governments, not the academy. That's left dissident filmmakers working under authoritarian or undemocratic regimes with limited pathways to reaching the Oscars.",
      "Last year, for instance, the Iranian filmmaker Mohammad Rasoulof fled Iran before he was to be flogged and imprisoned for eight years in order to release his film \u201cThe Seed of the Sacred Fig.\u201d Germany, where Rasoulof settled, submitted it for the Oscars and it was nominated. But other filmmakers, including Rasoulof's friend and countryman Jafar Panahi, have released films without a mechanism for submission.",
      "The rule change notably won't alter the Oscar prospects for filmmakers who haven't fled their home countries or change anything for films passed over by their nation's selection committees.",
      "The academy also ruled that the use of generative artificial intelligence tools \u201cneither help nor harm the chances of a nomination.\u201d How significantly AI is used in filmmaking has, as in other industries, been a much-debated topic in Hollywood. In this year's Oscar race, Brady Corbet's \u201cThe Brutalist\u201d was a subject of some controversy after its editor said that AI had been used to enhance the Hungarian dialogue of stars Adrien Brody (who ultimately won best actor ) and Felicity Jones (who was nominated for best supporting actress).",
      "\u201cThe academy and each branch will judge the achievement, taking into account the degree to which a human was at the heart of the creative authorship when choosing which movie to award,\u201d the academy said Monday.",
      "The film academy also set down some rules for its new achievement in casting Oscar. After a preliminary round of voting to determine a shortlist of 10 films, members of the casting branch will be invited to a \u201cbake-off\u201d presentation from the shortlisted films, including a Q&A with nominees.",
      "Earlier in April, the academy announced a new category for stunt design, but that award won't begin until the 2028 Oscars.",
      "Next year's Academy Awards will be held March 15, 2026, with Conan O'Brien returning to host the ABC telecast.",

      "But creator Tony Gilroy says he and his collaborators felt little pressure from Disney and Lucasfilm as they sought to tell the story of a growing revolutionary resentment against the Galactic Empire and the birth of the Rebel Alliance leading up to the events of the 2016 film he scripted, \u201cRogue One.\u201d",

He told The Associated Press that \u201cI\u2019ve never had this much freedom before, even in final-cut films that I worked on. The latitude was astonishing.\u201d",

      "\u201cI start small,\u201d Gilroy said. \u201cI work teaspoon by teaspoon.\u201d",
      "That includes a season-opening scene that starts with Cassian giving a young imperial mechanic the courage to help him in a major heist. He sells her on the ecstatic feelings of destiny rebellion can bring.",

      "\u201cHe doesn\u2019t believe in withholding information as power,\u201d said Adria Arjona, who plays Andor's partner Bix Caleen. \u201cBefore I read episode one, I knew the end. It\u2019s just unheard-of.\u201d",
      "Her character's arc in particular brings real-world elements including addiction and even darker forms of trauma unlike anything \u201cStar Wars\u201d has shown before.",
      "Gilroy said he didn't have to fight over the galaxy's canon at all. He had to get used to certain elements when he first worked within the franchise \u2014 no paper, no hinged doors, no knives, for example. But it's not necessarily held as sacred.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve seen canon stretch so much,\" he said. \"It was really tight on \u2018Rogue.\u2019 But a lot of things have changed since then.\u201d",

      "Other elements, like the route Mon Mothma (Genevieve O\u2019Reilly) takes from respectable senator to leader of the rebellion, were not predetermined. They were discovered in the writing and in the performances.",
      "Her early-season path includes a wedding ceremony full of rituals \u2014 and dances \u2014 new to \u201cStar Wars\u201d that Gilroy invented out of whole cloth. He said one of the pleasures of getting to make something so large and sprawling is that he has gotten to use nearly every writing thought he has had.",
      "\u201cAll I did for five years was just max out my imagination,\" Gilroy said.",
      "Mothma is among the \u201cRogue One\u201d characters who appeared in the first season and return for the second, along with Forest Whittaker's radical rebel Saw Gerrera, who this season gives a spine-tingling call to arms that is teased in the trailer: \u201cRevolution,\" he preaches to an underling, \"is not for the sane!\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- Opening statements are set for Wednesday in former movie mogul Harvey Weinstein\u2019s rape retrial, this time with a majority-female jury deciding the landmark #MeToo case.",
      "After a dayslong selection process yielded a seven-woman, five-man jury and five alternate jurors by Monday, prosecutors and Weinstein\u2019s lawyers finished choosing a sixth and final alternate on Tuesday. Alternates step in if a member of the main panel can\u2019t see the trial through.",
      "The main jury is more female than the five women and seven men who convicted Weinstein at his first trial five years ago. The verdict marked a signature moment for the #MeToo movement against sexual misconduct, which had been fueled in 2017 by a slew of allegations against Weinstein, then a high-flying movie producer of a string of Oscar winners including \u201cPulp Fiction\u201d and \u201cShakespeare in Love.\u201d",
      "But in a reversal that dismayed #MeToo activists, New York\u2019s highest court last year overturned Weinstein\u2019s 2020 conviction and 23-year prison sentence. The court found that the original trial judge allowed prejudicial testimony. That judge\u2019s term expired in 2022, and he is no longer on the bench.",
      "Weinstein, 73, has pleaded not guilty and denies raping or sexually assaulting anyone.",
      "Drawn from Manhattan\u2019s jury pool, the 12 members of the main jury for the New York retrial include a physics researcher, a photographer, a dietitian, a therapist, an investment bank software engineer and a fire safety director. Others have experience in real estate, TV commercials, debt collection, social work and other fields.",
      "One has a high school equivalency degree. Others have master\u2019s degrees. Some have served as jurors or grand jurors multiple times before; others, never.",
      "Hundreds of other potential jurors were excused for reasons ranging from language barriers to strong opinions about Weinstein \u2014 \u201cthe first word that came in my head was \u2018pig,\u2019\u201d said one man who was soon let go.",
      "Those chosen were quizzed about their backgrounds, life experiences and various other points that could relate to their ability to be fair and impartial about the highly publicized case.",
      "\u201cYou may hear sexual allegations here of a salacious nature \u2014 graphic, perhaps. Would hearing that indicate that \u2026 Mr. Weinstein must be guilty?\u201d defense attorney Mike Cibella asked one prospective juror on Monday. The woman, who ultimately was chosen, answered no.",
      "Prosecutor Shannon Lucey sought assurances that prospective jurors could put aside any position or feelings they had about the #MeToo movement.",
      "\u201cIs there anyone who is going to think of the movement and think, \u2018OK, that\u2019s just something that I have to keep in the back of my mind when I\u2019m deciding this case\u2019? Everyone can put that aside?\u201d Lucey asked a group of 24 possible jurors. All indicated they could do so.",
      "Weinstein\u2019s rape and sexual assault retrial involves accusations from three women: an aspiring actor who said he raped her in 2013, and two women who made separate allegations of forced oral sex in 2006. One of the two wasn\u2019t part of the original trial.",
      "Meanwhile, Weinstein is challenging a separate 2022 rape conviction in Los Angeles.",

      "The Tennessee Board of Parole has recommended a pardon for country music star Jelly Roll, a Nashville native who has spoken openly about his criminal history and what it has taken to overcome it",
      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- The Tennessee Board of Parole on Tuesday recommended a pardon for country music star Jelly Roll, a Nashville native who has spoken openly about his criminal record and what it has taken to overcome it. The board's action leaves the final decision on a pardon up to Gov. Bill Lee.",
      "The rapper-turned-country singer wants to be able to travel internationally to perform and share his message of redemption, after spending time behind bars as a young person.",
      "The board issued its nonbinding recommendation unanimously after a hearing that lasted about an hour and 45 minutes with several witnesses, including Nashville Sheriff Daron Hall, advocating for the 40-year-old musician named Jason DeFord. One board member recused themselves from voting.",
      "Jelly Roll broke into country music with the 2023 album \u201cWhitsitt Chapel\u201d and crossover songs like \u201cNeed a Favor.\u201d He has won multiple CMT Awards, a CMA Award and earned four Grammy nominations, including for new artist of the year.",
      "\u201cThis was incredible,\u201d he said of the board's decision. \u201cI pray this goes through. But today was special for me, regardless.\u201d",
      "His most serious convictions include a robbery at age 17 and drug charges at 23. In the first case, a female acquaintance helped Jelly Roll and two other young men enter a house in 2002. Both of the others were carrying guns, although Jelly Roll was unarmed. They demanded money, and received $350 and a wallet with no money in it. Because the victims knew the female acquaintance, she and Jelly Roll were arrested right away. He was sentenced to serve a year in prison and additional time on probation.",
      "Later, in 2008, police on patrol found both marijuana and crack cocaine in his car. He was sentenced to eight years of court-ordered supervision.",
      "He also has two misdemeanor offenses for driving without a license and possession of drug paraphernalia.",
      "Lee, a Republican, said every case seeking clemency, such as pardons, is equally important and goes through a thorough process.",
      "\u201cThe reporting on Jelly Roll, that\u2019s encouraging for his situation, but there are steps yet to happen in that case,\u201d he told reporters Tuesday.",
      "Jelly Roll told the board that while in a detention center, he fell in love with songwriting. \u201cIt started as a passion project that felt therapeutic and would end up changing my life in ways that I never dreamed imaginable and opened doors that I\u2019ve never thought possible.\u201d",
      "These days, he often visits jails and rehabilitation centers before performing concerts. He has bought restaurants out for the day to feed people who are homeless and played basketball with kids at a youth center the same day that he performed in Winnipeg. He said he generally doesn't seek out news coverage when he makes these visits.",
      "As a part of the pardon application, friends and civic leaders wrote to the board about Jelly Roll\u2019s transformation and generosity. Hall, who runs Nashville\u2019s jail, wrote that Jelly Roll had an awakening in one of the jails he managed. Live Nation Entertainment CEO and President Michael Rapino also wrote in his favor, pointing out all the money he's given from his performances to charities for at-risk youth.",
      "One of the reasons Jelly Roll gave for needing a pardon is to be able to travel to Canada to perform, which his criminal record makes difficult. Currently, he would need to apply for a special permit that can include long wait times for a decision, according to a letter from an immigration attorney submitted with his clemency packet.",
      "\u201cI want to be an inspiration for people who are now where I used to be \u2014 to let them know that change is truly possible,\" Jelly Roll told the board. \u201cOne of the reasons I\u2019m asking for your recommendation for this pardon is because I\u2019m looking to take my message of redemption through the power of music and faith through the rest of the world.\u201d",
      "He said he would use the pardon for much more than going on tour, though.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll still be using this same pardon, God willing, to go do missionary work in my 50s and 60s,\u201d he said.",
      "Due to his criminal record, he told the board that every time he travels it \u201ctakes a team of lawyers and a mountain of paperwork to secure my entry into those countries.\u201d He said he recently was able to make his first tour in Canada and took his first trip to the United Kingdom, where he spoke about a rehabilitation program.",
      "The parole board began considering Jelly Roll's pardon application in October 2024, which marks at least five years since his sentence expired.",
      "Lee has issued more than 90 pardons since taking office in 2019, all of them since 2021.",

      "SAN FRANCISCO -- Reeling from drug overdose deaths and scenes of people smoking fentanyl on sidewalks, San Francisco moved closer Thursday to adopting a \u201crecovery first\u201d drug policy that sets abstinence from illicit drugs as its primary goal, a proposal that has prompted heated debate in the city that pioneered harm reduction.",
      "Opponents of Supervisor Matt Dorsey's proposal say its emphasis on stopping drug use alienates those who are not ready to quit, while proponents say the city has been far too permissive and making drug use safer does not help break the cycle of addiction.",
      "Dorsey, himself recovering from alcohol and drug addiction, amended the proposal in his public safety committee to clarify that distributing safer-use paraphernalia and linking people to social services regardless of whether they are using remain critical to the city's response.",
      "But more than an hour of public comment with cheers and boos from both sides underscored just how touchy the issue remains.",
      "\u201cNo one dies from harm reduction,\u201d Patt Denning said. \u201cPeople die from conventional abstinence-based treatments because they\u2019re either left out or kicked out if they don\u2019t comply with abstinence.\u201d",
      "Brendan Harris, who said he has been clean for six years, countered that harm reduction tactics cannot go on forever and people need a firm if compassionate push into treatment.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t just keep enabling drugs over and over again,\u201d he said.",
      "In recent years San Francisco's public health department advised people who use drugs to do so with friends to try to prevent overdose deaths. Critics said that sent the wrong message.",
      "Mayor Daniel Lurie, who took office in January, has vowed to solve the city's fentanyl crisis. Last year more than 600 people died from accidental overdoses.",
      "He ordered city-funded nonprofits to offer treatment or counseling options before giving out certain paraphernalia such as foil and pipes, and they will no longer be allowed to distribute those items in parks and on sidewalks.",
      "As amended, Dorsey's proposal states that the \u201clong-term remission of substance use disorders for individuals, with the help of fully supported and staffed evidence-based recovery and behavioral health services, shall be the primary goal.\u201d",
      "It also defines recovery as \u201cthe process by which an individual suffering from substance use disorder strives to make positive changes that become part of a voluntarily adopted healthy lifestyle.\u201d",
      "Dorsey said aspiring to live a healthy life free from illicit drug use should not be a controversial goal, and abstention can mean receiving methadone as part of a medication assisted treatment program. San Francisco offers an array of services to help people addicted to drugs, but many residents only see the free foil and pipes, he said.",
      "\u201cWe're losing the battle on harm reduction when people think that\u2019s all we\u2019re doing,\u201d he said after the hearing.",
      "The San Francisco Marin Medical Society, which represents more than 3,500 physicians, proposed the amendments.",
      "The full Board of Supervisors votes on the proposal next month. It is expected to pass, with seven of the 11 members sponsoring or cosponsoring.",

      "The Agriculture Department says it is withdrawing a plan to limit salmonella bacteria in poultry products",
      "The Agriculture Department will not require poultry companies to limit salmonella bacteria in their products, halting a Biden Administration effort to prevent food poisoning from contaminated meat.",
      "The department on Thursday said it was withdrawing a rule proposed in August after three years of development. Officials with the USDA\u2019s Food Safety and Inspection Service cited feedback from more than 7,000 public comments and said they would \u201cevaluate whether it should update\u201d current salmonella regulations.",
      "The rule would have required poultry companies to keep levels of salmonella bacteria under a certain threshold and test for the presence of six strains most associated with illness, including three found in turkey and three in chicken. If the levels exceeded the standard or any of those strains were found, the poultry couldn\u2019t be sold and would be subject to recall, the proposal had said.",
      "The plan aimed to reduce an estimated 125,000 salmonella infections from chicken and 43,000 from turkey each year, according to USDA. Overall, salmonella causes 1.35 million infections a year, most through food, and about 420 deaths, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "The withdrawal drew praise from the National Chicken Council, an industry trade group, which said the proposed rule was legally unsound, misinterpreted science, would have increased costs and create more food waste, all \u201cwith no meaningful impact on public health.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe remain committed to further reducing salmonella and fully support food safety regulations and policies that are based on sound science,\u201d said Ashley Peterson, the group's senior vice president of science and regulatory affairs.",
      "But the move drew swift criticism from food safety advocates, including Sandra Eskin, a former USDA official who helped draft the plan.",
      "The withdrawal \"sends the clear message that the Make America Healthy Again initiative does not care about the thousands of people who get sick from preventable foodborne salmonella infections linked to poultry,\" Eskin said in a statement.",
      "The proposed rule had been regarded as a food safety victory similar to a 1994 decision to ban certain strains of dangerous E. coli bacteria from ground beef after deadly outbreaks, said Sarah Sorscher, of the Center for Science in the Public Interest.",
      "\u201cMake no mistake: Shipping more salmonella to restaurants and grocery stores is certain to make Americans sicker,\u201d Sorscher said.",
      "Earlier this month, the USDA said it would delay by six months the enforcement of a final rule regulating salmonella levels in certain breaded and stuffed raw chicken products. Enforcement, which was set for May 1, now begins Nov. 3.",
      "That covers foods such as frozen chicken cordon bleu and chicken Kiev dishes that appear to be fully cooked but are only heat-treated to set the batter or coating. Such products have been linked to at least 14 salmonella outbreaks and at least 200 illnesses since 1998, according to the CDC.",

      "The evidence is anecdotal, but psychologists and flight attendants say they are seeing and hearing increased worries about flying",
      "NEW YORK -- Adelynn Campbell\u2019s last plane trip ended with a panic attack that she got through largely with the help of a kind flight attendant.",
      "That was last year \u2014 before 67 people died in January when an American Airlines jet collided with a helicopter over Washington, D.C., in the deadliest U.S. air disaster in almost a quarter century.",
      "Now, Campbell is even more hesitant to book a flight.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s definitely spiked my concern about getting on a plane and it\u2019s making the whole situation a little more stressful than it used to be,\u201d said Campbell, 30, who manages a coffee shop in San Diego.",
      "Being at least a little nervous about flying is understandable. As Mel Brooks once said: \u201cIf God wanted us to fly, He would have given us tickets.\u201d But for some people it causes deep anxiety that could require professional help.",
      "Here's a look at air travel anxiety and ways to cope with it.",
      "The evidence is anecdotal, but psychologists and flight attendants say they\u2019ve seen and heard increased worries \u2014 and not only in people who already had anxieties about flying.",
      "\u201cEven people who didn\u2019t have a fear of flying are talking about it, given recent events,\u201d said Jennifer Dragonette, a California-based psychologist who treats people with air travel anxieties.",
      "U.S. air travel was down in March and early April compared with last year, according to TSA statistics. Airlines have attributed the decline to economic uncertainty, a decline in government and corporate travel and \u2014 yes \u2014 concern about recent aviation incidents.",
      "FAA officials recently acknowledged they weren\u2019t doing enough to ensure air safety. Recent polling by the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research shows that fewer Americans report feeling safe about flying this year.",
      "Flight attendants who work planes out of the Washington, D.C., airport were particularly rattled by the January collision, said Sara Nelson, president of the Association of Flight Attendants union. Some asked for time off to process their emotions, and at least one flight attendant left the job, she said.",
      "Fear of flying \u2014 sometimes called aerophobia \u2014 goes beyond just being nervous about a flight. It is an intense form of anxiety that centers on certain aspects of air travel. Many aerophobes get most rattled during take-off and landing, or when they think about being locked in a plane.",
      "Some research has suggested it affects about 25 million U.S. adults. Psychologists say it often surfaces in adulthood, developing in people who didn\u2019t mind flying as kids but grew more rattled as they aged.",
      "In many cases, it starts when people are in their 20s or 30s, at a time they are experiencing big life changes and new responsibilities \u2014 like getting married or becoming a parent \u2014 and they start to think that \u201ceverything counts,\u201d said David Carbonell, a Chicago-based psychologist who authored a workbook to help people cope with flying fears.",
      "A bad flight with heavy turbulence or some other problem may trigger an anxiety that persists, he said.",
      "Campbell, who has other forms of anxiety, developed a fear of flying a few years ago. She is transgender, and said travel can be stressful because of concerns about how she\u2019ll be treated by airport security or in other interactions.",
      "Aerophobia can be complicated, Carbonell said. For many people, it\u2019s not so much a fear of crashing as it is claustrophobic feelings of being in an enclosed cabin and not having control.",
      "Campbell said that\u2019s what she experiences: \u201cfeeling trapped and unable to breathe.\u201d",
      "Nelson said flight attendants regularly deal with suffering passengers: \u201cWe\u2019ve had people have panic attacks, and we\u2019ve had to give them oxygen. It can be quite intense.\u201d",
      "Statistics have long shown that airliners are probably the safest way to travel. According to the National Safety Council, the odds of dying in an airplane crash are too low to be calculated, based on 2023 statistics \u2014 making them far, far lower than of being killed in a motor vehicle crash or, for that matter, walking on a sidewalk or crossing a street.",
      "But experts say you can\u2019t really reason your way out of an anxiety disorder.",
      "Carbonell spends little time on statistics, telling patients: \u201cI know you already looked at them all, and they\u2019re not helping you.\u201d",
      "For people with milder levels of aerophobia, deep breathing often works. Longer exhales help the body relax, said Dragonette, who counseled Campbell for aerophobia and other anxiety disorders at a Newport Healthcare residential facility in Temecula, California.",
      "People suffering more extreme cases can be helped with exposure therapy. It can start by simply getting patients to become comfortable looking at photos of planes, watching videos of planes flying safely, or putting on a virtual reality headset that shows recordings of being inside a plane, Dragonette said.",
      "It\u2019s a matter of getting patients to learn to live with their feelings and better handle them.",
      "Carbonell recommends patients take practice flights that do not involve work trips or any other responsibilities. When they have symptoms, he recommends they keep a written inventory.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019re keeping a simple count,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re using counting as a proxy for acceptance.\u201d",
      "Nelson, who was a longtime United Airlines flight attendant, says: \u201cI\u2019ve had situations where I\u2019d sort of sit in the aisle and hold someone\u2019s hand.\"",
      "On a Frontier Airlines flight last year from Detroit to San Diego, Campbell tried breathing and other coping skills, but they didn\u2019t halt her panic attack. The passenger next to her noticed she was increasingly anxious, and summoned a flight attendant.",
      "The flight attendant took deep breaths with Campbell and helped her get through it, and also took down Campbell\u2019s phone number and checked on her a day later.",
      "\u201cI was really impressed,\u201d she said.",

    "story": [
      "Health officials in the Gaza Strip say more than 400 dialysis patients have died during the 18-month Israel-Hamas war because of lack of proper treatment",
      "DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip -- Twice a week, Mohamed Attiya\u2019s wheelchair rattles over Gaza\u2019s scarred roads so he can visit the machine that is keeping him alive.",
      "The 54-year-old makes the journey from a temporary shelter west of Gaza City to Shifa Hospital in the city\u2019s north. There, he receives dialysis for the kidney failure he was diagnosed with nearly 15 years ago. But the treatment, limited by the war's destruction and lack of supplies, is not enough to remove all the waste products from his blood.",
      "\u201cIt just brings you back from death,\u201d the father of six said.",
      "Many others like him have not made it. They are some of Gaza\u2019s quieter deaths from the war, with no explosion, no debris. But the toll is striking: Over 400 patients, representing around 40% of all dialysis cases in the territory, have died during the 18-month conflict because of lack of proper treatment, according to Gaza's Health Ministry.",
      "That includes 11 patients who have died since the beginning of March, when Israel sealed the territory's 2 million Palestinians off from all imports, including food, medical supplies and fuel. Israeli officials say the aim is to pressure Hamas to release more hostages after Israel ended their ceasefire.",
      "COGAT, the Israeli military body in charge of coordinating aid, declined to comment on the current blockade. It has said in the past that all medical aid is approved for entry when the crossings are open, and that around 45,400 tons of medical equipment have entered Gaza since the start of the war.",
      "Attiya said he needs at least three dialysis sessions every week, at least four hours each time. Now, his two sessions last two or three hours at most.",
      "Israel\u2019s blockade, and its numerous evacuation orders across much of the territory, have challenged his ability to reach regular care.",
      "He has been displaced at least six times since fleeing his home near the northern town of Beit Hanoun in the first weeks of the war. He first stayed in Rafah in the south, then the central city of Deir al-Balah. When the latest ceasefire took effect in January, he moved again to another school in western Gaza City.",
      "Until recently, Attiya walked to the hospital for dialysis. But he says the limited treatment, and soaring prices for the mineral water he should be drinking, have left him in a wheelchair.",
      "His family wheels him through a Gaza that many find difficult to recognize. Much of the territory has been destroyed.",
      "\u201cThere is no transportation. Streets are damaged,\u201d Attiya said. \u201cLife is difficult and expensive.\u201d",
      "He said he now has hallucinations because of the high levels of toxins in his blood.",
      "\u201cThe occupation does not care about the suffering or the sick,\u201d he said, referring to Israel and its soldiers.",
      "Six of the seven dialysis centers in Gaza have been destroyed during the war, the World Health Organization said earlier this year, citing the territory\u2019s Health Ministry. The territory had 182 dialysis machines before the war and now has 102. Twenty-seven of them are in northern Gaza, where hundreds of thousands of people rushed home during the two-month ceasefire.",
      "\u201cThese equipment shortages are exacerbated by zero stock levels of kidney medications,\u201d the WHO said.",
      "Israel has raided hospitals on several occasions during the war, accusing Hamas of using them for military purposes. Hospital staff deny the allegations and say the raids have gutted the territory's health care system as it struggles to cope with mass casualties from the war.",
      "The Health Ministry says over 51,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, have been killed in Israel's offensive, without saying how many were civilians or combatants. Hamas-led militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted 251 in the Oct. 7, 2023 attack that triggered the war.",
      "At Shifa Hospital, the head of the nephrology and dialysis department, Dr. Ghazi al-Yazigi, said at least 417 patients with kidney failure have died in Gaza during the war because of lack of proper treatment.",
      "That\u2019s from among the 1,100 patients when the war began.",
      "Like Attiya, hundreds of dialysis patients across Gaza are now forced to settle for fewer and shorter sessions each week.",
      "\u201cThis leads to complications such as increased levels of toxins and fluid accumulation \u2026 which could lead to death,\u201d al-Yazigi said.",
      "Mohamed Kamel of Gaza City is a new dialysis patient at the hospital after being diagnosed with kidney failure during the war and beginning treatment this year.",
      "These days, \u201cI feel no improvement after each session,\u201d he said during one of his weekly visits.",
      "The father of six children said he no longer has access to filtered water to drink, and even basic running water is scarce. Israel last month cut off the electricity supply to Gaza, affecting a desalination plant producing drinking water for part of the arid territory.",
      "Kamel said he has missed many dialysis sessions. Last year, while sheltering in central Gaza, he missed one because of an Israeli bombing in the area. His condition deteriorated, and the next day he was taken by ambulance to Al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital.",
      "\u201cThe displacement has had consequences,\u201d Kamel said. \u201cI am tired.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The head of the Environmental Protection Agency says his agency will be providing Mexico a list to complete to stop the flow of sewage from Tijuana",
      "SAN DIEGO -- The head of the Environmental Protection Agency said Tuesday that Mexico must stop the flow of billions of gallons of sewage and toxic chemicals from Tijuana that has polluted the Pacific Ocean off neighboring Southern California, closing beaches and sickening Navy SEALs who train in the water.",
      "Lee Zeldin made the demand during an Earth Day trip to the California-Mexico border, where he toured a plant in San Diego County that treats the sewage as a secondary facility and flew along the frontier to see the Tijuana River. He also was scheduled to meet with SEALs.",
      "Zeldin said that in the next day or so, his agency will present Mexico a to-do list of projects to resolve the decades-long environmental crisis, but he stopped short of specifying how the Trump administration would hold Mexico accountable if it does not act.",
      "The problem is \u201ctop of mind\u201d for President Donald Trump, Zeldin said, while adding that they have not talked about possibly imposing tariffs if nothing is done.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to know whether or not Mexico is going to do its part to resolve it, and then we\u2019ll go from there, as far as strategy and tactics,\u201d Zeldin said.",
      "Alicia B\u00e1rcena, Mexico's Environment and Natural Resources secretary, said her country also wants to resolve the problem. She met with Zeldin the previous evening and said they made progress in finding solutions.",
      "\u201cWe are here because we want to solve this,\u201d B\u00e1rcena said in a statement in Spanish. \u201cNot only so there is no untreated wastewater on Mexican beaches, but in the United States as well.\u201d",
      "The 120-mile (195 km)-long Tijuana River runs near the coast in Mexico and crosses into Southern California, where it flows through Navy-owned land and out to the Pacific.",
      "As Tijuana\u2019s wastewater treatment plants have aged and its population and industry have boomed, an increasing amount of toxins have made their way into the river and into San Diego County \u2014 since 2018, more than 100 billion gallons of raw sewage laden with industrial chemicals and trash.",
      "The pollution has sickened not only swimmers, surfers and lifeguards but also schoolchildren, Border Patrol agents and others who do not even go in the water. Scientists say the sewage is vaporized when it foams up and enters the air people breathe.",
      "The Navy is reviewing whether to relocate its training site for SEAL candidates after the Naval Special Warfare Center reported 1,168 cases of acute gastrointestinal illnesses of its recruits from 2019 to 2023.",
      "California beaches near the border have been closed more often than not over the past four years.",
      "Since 2020 more than $653 million in funds have been allocated to address the issue, but the crisis has continued largely because of delays by the Mexican government, Zeldin said. He added that he and Trump are hopeful that will change under the relatively new administration of President Claudia Sheinbaum, who took office last October.",
      "Zeldin said that after meeting with Mexico officials in San Diego for 90 minutes, he was left with the impression that Sheinbaum and her environmental secretary want to have a \u201cstrong collaborative relationship.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s being communicated by the new Mexican president is an intense desire to fully resolve this situation,\u201d Zeldin said. But he made clear that he wants Mexico to step up.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s no way that we are going to stand before the people of California and ask them to have more patience and just bear with all of us as we go through the next 10 or 20 or 30 years of being stuck in 12 feet of raw sewage and not getting anywhere,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we are all out of patience.\u201d",
      "Flanked by lawmakers from both parties, Zeldin noted that cleanup efforts have rare bipartisan support.",
      "Zeldin visited the South Bay International Wastewater Treatment Plant, which was built with funds from both countries to treat 25 million gallons per day as a secondary plant on the U.S. side.",
      "Mexico is working on several wastewater treatment projects to reduce the flow and make major upgrades to its existing plants. B\u00e1rcena said the now-repaired San Antonio de los Buenos plant, which went back to operating at full capacity this month, should make a difference.",
      "But Zeldin said Mexico must complete a number of other projects, including installing floodgates to collect trash in Tijuana. Another one being considered would divert 10 million gallons of sewage away from the shore.",

A box containing two doses of naloxone nasal spray costs between $45 and $70 from regular pharmacies and online marketplaces.",
      "Opioid overdose deaths, which are caused by heroin, fentanyl and oxycodone, have increased dramatically in California and across the country in recent years, reaching 7,847 in the state in 2023. But California officials say they have started to see a decline in these deaths.",
      "The move is part of a broader push by California Gov. Gavin Newsom to try to force drug companies to lower their prices by offering cheaper, competing versions of medication under the state's CalRx label.",

      "De Meyer runs a program in the southern African country of Namibia that harnesses the power but also the gentleness of horses to help children with learning disabilities and conditions like ADHD and autism.",
      "Each weekday morning, de Meyer's dusty paddock just outside the capital, Windhoek, is enlivened by a group of eight to 10 children from one of the special schools she helps. The children ride the horses, groom them, stroke them and often, de Meyer says, talk to them.",
      "De Meyer grew up on a farm surrounded by horses and they've always been part of her life. She said they have a quality that is invaluable: They don't judge the children, no matter how different they are.",
      "\u201cThe horse is the hero in this whole situation because these kids don\u2019t want to be around a lot of people,\" de Meyer said.",
      "De Meyer's program, \"Enabling Through the Horse,\" is supported by the Namibian Equestrian Federation and won an award last year from the International Equestrian Federation because it \u201cunderlines the wonderful characteristics of the horse in exuding sensitivity and intuition.\u201d",
      "Horse therapy has been promoted by autism groups and those that work with children with learning disabilities as having a positive impact. And animal therapy in general has been found to be useful in many instances, like dogs that help military veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder and therapy cats that are taken to hospitals and nursing homes.",
      "Some survivors of the devastating 2023 Hawaii wildfires found relief in horse therapy while grieving loved ones they had lost.",
      "De Meyer jokes she has \u201ctwo-and-a-half horses.\u201d These include two Arabians \u2014 a white mare named Faranah and a brown gelding, Lansha \u2014 while the \u201chalf\u201d is a miniature horse called Bonzi, who is about head-high for a 5-year-old.",
      "The Arabians are often the most useful for the children's therapy because of their size, de Meyer said.",
      "\u201cIt gives them self-esteem. When they stroke the horse, the therapy starts because this is a very big animal compared to their height, and they are not scared to stroke the horse ... and then to ride it and tell the horse what they want,\u201d she said.",
      "De Meyer works with children with a range of conditions or disabilities, including autism, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, Down syndrome, those who are nonverbal or touch sensitive, and some who were born with fetal alcohol syndrome and have developmental problems.",
      "She has received interest from other countries in Africa and Asia to start similar programs there.",
      "\u201cThe changes that I\u2019ve seen with the learners are significant,\u201d said Chriszell Louw, a teacher at Dagbreek School, which says it is one of just two government schools in Namibia for children with intellectual disabilities. \u201cWe have a learner that likes to talk a lot. When we come here, she knows she has to keep quiet. She sits in her place.\u201d",

      "A single white rose was placed on the tomb that said \u201cFranciscus\" \u2014 the pope's name in Latin. A light cast its warm glow over the tomb and a reproduction of the late pontiff's pectoral cross on the wall above it.",

      "\u201cPope Francis for me was an inspiration, a guide,\u201d said Elias Caravalhal.",
      "Caravalhal lives in Rome but was unable to pay his respects to Francis when he was lying in state in St. Peter's Basilica after his death on Easter Monday at the age of 88. He said he visited the tomb to bid farewell to him, and \u201cto thank him for what he has done.\u201d",

      "Yunice Abbas, 71, who has publicly acknowledged his participation in the heist, is among 10 suspects facing charges including armed robbery and kidnapping.",
      "\u201cI will apologize,\u201d Abbas told The Associated Press. \u201cI mean it sincerely.\u201d",
      "Kardashian, 44, is expected to testify in person at the trial scheduled to run through May 23. In interviews and on her family\u2019s reality TV show, she has described being terrified as robbers pointed a gun at her to steal millions of dollars worth of jewelry in an apartment where she was staying for Paris Fashion Week. She said she thought she was going to be raped and killed.",
      "Abbas said he acted as a lookout at the reception area on the ground floor, ensuring the escape route was clear. He said he was unarmed and did not personally threaten Kardashian, but acknowledged he shared responsibility for the crime.",
      "He was arrested in January 2017 and he spent 21 months in prison before being released under judicial supervision. In 2021, he co-authored a French-language book titled \u201cI Sequestered Kim Kardashian.\u201d",
      "In her account to investigators, Kardashian described two men forcing their way into her bedroom and pointing a gun towards her, asking for her ring. She said she was tied up with plastic cables and tape while the intruders were looking for jewels, including her engagement ring worth millions of dollars.",
      "In a 2020 appearance on David Letterman\u2019s Netflix show, she tearfully recalled thinking: \u201cThis is the time I\u2019m going to get raped. I\u2019m like, \u2018What is happening? Are we gonna die? Just tell them I have children. I have babies, I have a husband, I have a family\u2019.\u201d",
      "She told investigators the men brought her in the bathroom before they ran off and she managed to free herself.",
      "The residency\u2019s concierge, held at gunpoint and forced to lead the robbers to her apartment, also suffered psychological impact.",
      "Investigators found Abbas' DNA on plastic ties used to tie the hands of the concierge.",
      "Asked about the trauma Kardashian suffered, Abbas said : \u201cIt\u2019s true, I didn\u2019t think about it. I recognize that because I did not brutalize her myself\u2026 I was not blaming myself regarding this aspect, and yet I\u2019m responsible for it too.\u201d",
      "According to Abbas, minutes after the raid started, his accomplices came down from Kardashian's apartment and gave him a bag of jewelry.",
      "As he was fleeing the scene on a bicycle, he saw a police car, but officers were not yet aware of the robbery. Abbas said as he rode the bicycle the bag containing the jewelry became caught in the front wheel and he fell to the ground, spilling the contents of the bag. \u201cI picked the jewels up and left,\u201d he said.",
      "The following morning, a passerby found a diamond-encrusted cross in the street and handed it to police. That was the only jewel from the robbery that was ever recovered.",
      "French justice estimated stolen items to be worth $6 million in total.",
      "Abbas said he didn\u2019t know Kardashian\u2019s identity at the time of the robbery.",
      "\u201cI was told about a famous person, a rapper\u2019s wife. That\u2019s all the information I had,\u201d he said. \u201cUntil the next morning, when I heard on TV about the influencer. That\u2019s when I understood who she was.\u201d",
      "He said he will detail his role during the trial, which will be conducted with a jury, a procedure in France reserved for the most serious crimes \u2013 yet he would not denounce his accomplices.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m only an outsider. I\u2019m not the one who masterminded the case. I take my share of responsibility,\u201d he said.",
      "Most of the suspects have denied involvement, except for Abbas and another man whose DNA was also found at the scene.",
      "Thierry Niemen, the journalist who co-authored Abbas' book, said Abbas approached him because he wanted to \u201ctell his own truth\u201d amid what he saw as inaccurate or sensationalized accounts.",
      "The book also revealed investigative details, including how the FBI helped French police identify Abbas\u2019 DNA despite him wearing gloves.",

      "U.S. and Philippine forces separately unleashed a barrage of missile and artillery fire that shot down several drones acting as hostile aircraft in live-fire drills on Sunday in Zambales province facing the disputed South China Sea.",
      "The mock battle scenarios over the weekend in the annual Balikatan exercises between the U.S. and its oldest treaty ally in Asia, the Philippines, not only simulated real-life war. They were also staged near major geopolitical hotspots, which have become delicate frontlines in the regional rivalry between China and the U.S. under former President Joe Biden and now Donald Trump.",
      "About 9,000 American and 5,000 Filipino military personnel took part in the combat maneuvers. At least 260 Australian personnel also joined, with smaller observer delegations from Japan and other countries.",
      "China has fiercely opposed the combat drills as provocative. Its aircraft carrier group sailed by a few days earlier near Batanes, where the U.S. military had deployed the Navy Marine Expeditionary Ship Interdiction System on Saturday on Batan near the Bashi Channel just south of Taiwan, a critical trade and military route that the U.S. and Chinese militaries have tried to gain strategic control of.",
      "\"The introduction of NMESIS into the first island chain for sea denial, sea control is another step in our force design journey,\u201d U.S. Marine Lt. Gen.

      "Asked if U.S. forces would pull out the anti-ship missile system from Batanes after the combat drills, Cederholm did not reply clearly.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t broadcast when we\u2019re going in, when we\u2019re coming out and how long things are going to stay,\u201d Cederholm said. \u201cAll I\u2019ll say is we\u2019re here at the invitation and with the support of the Philippine government.\u201d",
      "\"But I\u2019m glad it\u2019s here,\u201d he said.",
      "Additionally, China had repeatedly expressed its strong opposition to the U.S. Army deployment last year of a mid-range missile system in the Philippines for joint exercises.",
      "The U.S. Army launcher with at least 16 Standard Missile-6 and the Tomahawk Land Attack Missiles was repositioned in January from an international airport in northern Laoag city to a northwestern coastal area facing the Scarborough Shoal, where China\u2019s forces have used water cannons and dangerous blocking maneuvers against Philippine coast guard and fishery ships and fired flares near Manila\u2019s patrol planes, a Philippine official then told The AP.",
      "The official spoke on condition of anonymity due to a lack of authority to discuss the delicate issue publicly.",
      "Tomahawk missiles can travel over 1,000 miles (1,600 kilometers), which places China within their target range.",
      "During the combat exercises from April 21 to May 9, American and Filipino forces will also practice jointly defending Philippine islands by repelling hostile forces attempting to assault from the sea in the western Philippine province of Palawan, which faces the South China Sea, and in northern Cagayan province near Batanes.",
      "Philippine Brig. Gen. Michael Logico said the combat exercises were crucial to strengthening deterrence against aggression in the Bashi Channel.",
      "\"A peaceful region can only be maintained through a proper balance of strength between opposing forces until such time that \u2026 both countries decide that it\u2019s not going to be worth it to fight over this area,\u201d Logico said.",
      "Early this month, the Chinese military staged largescale drills in the waters around Taiwan and renewed a warning to the self-ruled democracy not to seek independence. Chinese navy, air, ground and rocket forces staged the drills.",
      "The Philippines used to host two of the largest U.S. Navy and Air Force bases outside the American mainland. The bases were shut down in the early 1990s after the Philippine Senate rejected an extension, but American forces returned for large-scale combat exercises with Filipino troops under a 1999 agreement.",
      "Cederholm cited the tens of thousands of U.S. military personnel, along with Filipino scouts, buried in the vast American cemetery in Manila as proof of Washington\u2019s commitment to help defend the Philippines beyond the U.S. bases era in the Philippines.",

      "The U.S. president's trade war and threats to make Canada the 51st state have infuriated Canadians and led to a surge in nationalism that has helped the Liberal Party flip the narrative heading into Monday's parliamentary election, at least in opinion polls.",
      "\u201cTrump is the campaign,\u201d former Quebec Premier Jean Charest said. \u201cThe ballot question is who is the person we are going to choose to face Trump. Everything has changed.\u201d",
      "Foreign policy hasn't affected a Canadian election this much since 1988, when, ironically, free trade with the United States dominated the political discourse.",
      "Prime Minister Mark Carney, the Liberal leader who was sworn in on March 14 following Justin Trudeau\u2019s resignation, led in the polls heading into Monday, marking a dramatic turnaround for a party that seemed destined for a crushing defeat until Trump started launching broadsides at Canada\u2019s economy and sovereignty.",

President Trump is threatening Canada, he\u2019s threatening our companies, he\u2019s threatening our workers, he\u2019s threatening the savings our our retirees,\u201d Carney said Tuesday. \u201cThis threat is not only an economic threat, it is an existential threat.\u201d",
      "Until a few months ago, Conservative Party leader Pierre Poilievre was seen as a shoo-in to become the next prime minister by shepherding his opposition faction back into power for the first time in a decade.",

      "\u201cIn the White House, they should sit down and think about the effect Trump has in the world,\" he added.",
      "Carney has accused Trump of severing the close relationship that Canada and the U.S. long enjoyed.",
      "Poilievre, meanwhile, would be \u201cvery much in sync\u201d with the \u201cnew direction in America,\u201d said Alberta Premier Danielle Smith, a Conservative ally.",
      "As such, Poilievre has offered a more muted response to Trump's rhetoric and economic maneuvering, imploring Canadians to deny the Liberals a fourth-straight term after what he described as \u201ca lost Liberal decade.\u201d",
      "Trump has threatened to slap steep tariffs on Canadian goods, and both Carney and Poilievre said that, if elected, they would accelerate renegotiations of the countries' free trade deal in an effort to end the uncertainty hurting both of their economies.",

      "KYIV, Ukraine -- A peace proposal by the Trump administration that includes recognizing Russian authority over Crimea shocked Ukrainian officials, who say they will not accept any formal surrender of the peninsula, even though they expect to concede the territory to the Kremlin, at least temporarily.",
      "Giving up the land that was illegally annexed by Russia in 2014 is also politically and legally impossible, according to experts. It would require a change to the Ukrainian constitution and a nationwide vote, and it could be considered treason. Lawmakers and the public are firmly opposed to the idea.",
      "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean anything,\u201d said Oleksandr Merezkho, a lawmaker with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy\u2019s party. \u201cWe will never recognize Crimea as part of Russia.\u201d",
      "Unlike a territorial concession, a formal surrender would permanently relinquish Crimea and abandon the hope that Ukraine could regain it in the future.",
      "The Ukrainian public largely understands that land must be ceded as part of any armistice because there is no way to retake it militarily. Polls indicate a rising percentage of the population accepts such a trade-off.",
      "But much of the public messaging about land concessions has suggested that they are not necessarily permanent, as when Kyiv Mayor Vitalii Klitschko told the BBC recently that Ukraine may need to temporarily give up land as part of a peace deal.",
      "Saying otherwise would effectively admit defeat \u2014 a deeply unpopular move, especially for Ukrainians living under Russian occupation who hope to be liberated and reunited with their families one day. It also would call into question the sacrifices made by tens of thousands of Ukrainian service members who have been killed or wounded.",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump underscored the Crimea proposal in an interview published Friday in Time magazine: \u201cCrimea will stay with Russia. Zelenskyy understands that, and everybody understands that it\u2019s been with them for a long time.\u201d",
      "His comments offered the latest example of the U.S. leader pressuring Ukraine to make concessions to end the war while it remains under siege. Trump has also accused Zelenskyy of prolonging the war by resisting negotiations with Russian President Vladimir Putin.",
      "Crimea, a strategic peninsula along the Black Sea in southern Ukraine, was seized by Russia years before the full-scale invasion that began in 2022. The Russian takeover followed large protests that ousted former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, who had refused to sign an association agreement with the European Union.",
      "In the lead-up to peace talks, Ukrainian officials told The Associated Press for months that they expect Crimea and other Ukrainian territory controlled by Russia to be among Kyiv\u2019s concessions in the event of any deal. But Zelenskyy has said on multiple occasions that formally surrendering the land has always been a red line.",
      "Elements of Trump\u2019s peace proposal would see the U.S. formally recognizing Crimea as Russian and de facto accepting Moscow\u2019s rule over occupied Ukrainian territories, according to a senior European official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomatic discussions.",
      "Whether the U.S. formally recognizes Crimea as Russian is out of Zelenskyy\u2019s hands. But many obstacles prevent the Ukrainian president from doing so, even under immense pressure. He cannot unilaterally sign any such proposal, and he could be reprimanded by future governments for even attempting it, experts said.",
      "Ukraine began to accept that it would not regain its lost territories after the failure of the country's 2023 summer counteroffensive. From then on, the Ukrainian military concentrated on defending the territory it still held.",
      "In return for territorial concessions, Ukraine wants robust security guarantees that ideally would include NATO membership or concrete plans to arm and train its forces against any future Russian invasion with the pledged support of allies. One scenario envisions European boots on the ground, which Russia rejects.",
      "Zelenskyy has said negotiations over occupied Ukrainian territory will be drawn out and will not likely occur until a ceasefire is in place. In late March, he told reporters after a call with Trump that the U.S. president \u201cclearly understands that legally we will not recognize any territories.\u201d",
      "He said giving up territory would be \u201cthe most difficult question\u201d and \u201ca big challenge for us.\u201d",
      "Formal recognition of Crimea would also amount to political suicide for Zelenskyy. It could expose him to legal action in the future, said Tymofiy Mylovanov, president of the Kyiv School of Economics and a former economics minister.",
      "Signing a potentially unconstitutional document could be interpreted as high treason, Mylovanov said.",
      "The Ukrainian government cannot act either. It has no constitutional means to accept a violation of its territorial integrity, and altering the territorial makeup of the country requires a nationwide referendum.",
      "If Ukrainian lawmakers were even to entertain the idea of surrendering Crimea, it would trigger a long, drawn-out legal debate.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s why Russia is pushing it, because they know it\u2019s impossible to achieve,\u201d Mylovanov said.",
      "\u201cAnything related to constitutional change gives so much policy and public communication space to Russia,\" he added. \"This is all they want.\u201d",

      "Globally, more than 350 million people live with rare diseases, most of them caused by a misstep hidden within their genes. Some conditions can be caught early and treated\u2014but in parts of Africa where population data and resources are scarce, many people go undiagnosed. Rodriguez is trying to change that by connecting patients with genetic testing and medical support, while gathering key data from those patients and their families.",
      "\u201cMost rare disease data has been collected from people of European ancestry, so we have very little knowledge about what\u2019s happening in other parts of the world, mainly in Africa,\u201d Rodriguez said.",
      "His research is funded by organizations including the La Caixa Foundation in Spain and the National Ataxia Foundation in the United States. And he has consulted with scientists in China, France, Boston, and elsewhere around the world, documenting rare diseases and novel disease-causing gene variants.",
      "That research is creating a library of genetic data for scientists and clinicians. Patients in Senegal are benefiting, too, with a path to diagnosis.",
      "In Guediawaye, Fatoumata Binta San\u00e9\u2019s daughter Aissata has glutaric acidemia type I, an inherited disorder in which the body can\u2019t process certain proteins properly. Her arms and legs are tightly drawn up towards her chest. She can\u2019t walk or reach for things, speak, sit on her own or hold her head up. San\u00e9 cradles Aissata in her arms constantly, and the 8-year-old smiles at the sound of her mother\u2019s voice.",
      "In the U.S., newborns are screened for treatable genetic conditions. In Senegal, newborn screening is not routine. Infants who appear healthy at birth might go undiagnosed and experience irreversible decline. Glutaric acidemia type I, for example, can cause brain damage, seizures, coma and early death.",
      "San\u00e9 is waiting for genetic testing results for Aissata\u2019s one-year-old sister Aminata. Patients can live long, healthy lives if they start treatment before the onset of symptoms. That includes following a strict diet, avoiding protein-rich foods like nuts, fish and meat and taking the supplement L-carnitine. Though consultation with Rodriguez was free, lifelong treatment is not. If Aminata shares her sister\u2019s disease, San\u00e9 will need government assistance to buy medication.",
      "Dr. Moustapha Ndiaye, head of the neurology department at Fann, hopes young physicians will graduate prepared to assist rare disease patients not just in Senegal but in other African countries.",
      "\u201cStudents travel from across Africa to study here,\u201d Ndiaye said.",
      "At the start of her career, Dr. Henriette Senghor saw patients who were hospitalized for months. Some died, and no one knew why.",
      "\u201cThere was this problem\u2014there was this void,\u201d said Senghor, who\u2019s now training with Rodriguez.",
      "In 2021, Rodriguez established a partnership between the Cheikh Anta Diop University of Dakar and the Center for National Center for Genomic Analysis in Barcelona. Rodriguez collects patients\u2019 blood samples and delivers them to Barcelona, where scientists analyze the extracted DNA, storing the answers it holds in a large database. Almost 1,300 participants\u2014patients and families\u2014have enrolled in his study of rare disease in West Africa.",
      "In the Gambia, Fatou Samba\u2019s sons Adama, 8, and Gibriel, 4, like to play soccer and feed the sheep in their backyard. On a recent afternoon, they took turns playing with a toy airplane and a globe. Adama, who hopes to be a pilot, pointed to where he wanted to go: the U.S. Outside, he started to climb a pile of bicycles propped up against the wall, and Gibriel followed.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re climbing Mount Everest,\u201d Adama said.",
      "Standing on a bicycle wheel, Adama hesitated. Samba reached for him, setting him down on solid ground. There is a tiny scar on his forehead where broken skin has been stitched back together. Last year, Samba couldn\u2019t explain his frequent falling, so she sought answers in Dakar. Rodriguez confirmed Adama had Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Gibriel's genetic test results are pending. Children often lose the ability to run or climb stairs first, and later can\u2019t walk or raise their arms. In adulthood, they develop heart and breathing problems.",
      "Both boys are taking corticosteroids, which can slow disease progression for patients diagnosed early.",
      "\u201cWithout the medication, it would have been terrible. Once we started, after a few weeks we saw improvement,\u201d Samba said. \u201cDoctors are destined to investigate (the disease) and find a cure \u2026 I pray doctors will find a cure.\u201d",
      "Back at Fann Hospital, Rodriguez and Senghor consult with Woly Diene, 25, and her mother and brother. When Diene was 15, she started falling at school. Soon, she felt pain throughout her body. She couldn\u2019t move. She lost her hearing, the strength in her hands and control of the muscles in her face.",
      "Diene, who comes from a rural village in Senegal, has riboflavin transporter deficiency. High doses of vitamin B2\u2014a supplement available on Amazon\u2014can slow, stop and even reverse damage from this condition that is fatal without treatment.",
      "Diene took her first dose when she was diagnosed in August 2023. She still has some difficulty hearing, but Diene is walking again. She has regained the strength in her face and hands. Diene\u2019s brother Thierno said vitamin B2 is expensive, but he knows his sister needs it for the rest of her life.",
      "\u201cI am happy,\u201d Diene said, smiling. \u201cI hope to keep improving.\u201d",
      "While efforts like these help patients, they also allow doctors to collect data\u2014and that\u2019s vital for rare disease research, policy and drug development, said Lauren Moore, chief scientific officer at the National Ataxia Foundation.",
      "\u201cThe most prevalent diseases get the most attention and the most funding,\u201d she said. \u201cData \u2026 really is the first step.\u201d",
      "A $50,000 grant from the foundation allows Rodriguez and colleagues to enroll study participants in Senegal and Nigeria with inherited ataxias\u2014which can lead to muscle weakness, loss of mobility, hearing and vision difficulties and life-shortening heart problems.",
      "The USAID cuts have not affected his research, but grant awards are limited. Rodriguez, Senghor and Dr. Rokhaya Ndiaye, professor of human genetics at the University of Dakar, are making plans to ensure genetic testing continues in Senegal.",
      "Global collaboration is essential, said Ndiaye\u2014and strengthening local infrastructure is just as important.",
      "\u201cThe need is there,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd we have a lot of hope.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Cardinals this week will start in-depth discussions on planning the conclave to choose Pope Francis' successor",
      "VATICAN CITY -- One of Pope Francis\u2019 enduring legacies was that he greatly expanded the diversity of cardinals who will elect his successor, naming \u201cprinces of the church\u201d from faraway countries that had never had one before.",
      "That legacy is now throwing a wrench in the traditional sport of speculating about the next pope, since these far-flung cardinals don't know one another well and haven\u2019t coalesced into clear voting blocs going into the conclave, the centuries-old ritual to elect a new pope.",
      "As a result, all that is certain about the upcoming conclave is that there is no certainty.",
      "As the Oscar-nominated film \u201cConclave\u201d made clear, the election of a pope is a Hollywood-worthy drama steeped in mystery, secrecy and faith. But real-world politics and personal calculations come into play and will weigh on the 130-plus cardinals when they enter the Sistine Chapel to cast their ballots.",
      "No date has yet been set for the conclave, but it must start by May 10. After Francis\u2019 funeral Saturday, the cardinals who have flocked to Rome will meet regularly this week, sizing one another up as they discuss the needs of the 1.4 billion-strong Catholic Church following Francis\u2019 revolutionary papacy.",
      "Francis' 12-year pontificate was characterized by a focus away from doctrinaire rules to making the church more inclusive and welcoming. For progressives, it was a refocusing of mission back to the Gospel\u2019s mandate to care for poor people and feed the hungry. For conservatives, Francis sowed confusion by introducing wiggle room in hot-button cultural issues such as the church\u2019s teaching on marriage and homosexuality.",
      "As a result, the cardinals face a fundamental decision when looking for a successor: Does the church need someone to continue Francis\u2019 legacy, focusing on the marginalized as Jesus did? Or does it need a course correction to rebuild unity, after Francis\u2019 radical reforms alienated some?",
      "One question is whether the conservative wing, which counts cardinals from Africa, Eastern Europe and part of the U.S., has enough votes to swing the pendulum back to the doctrinaire papacies of St. John Paul II and Pope Benedict XVI.",
      "Beyond that, the cardinals will consider more practical matters: Pick someone in his 60s and you might have a pope for 20-plus years, for better or worse. Pick a pope from where the church is alive and growing \u2013 Asia or Africa \u2013 and you might bring more upheaval to the Vatican's Italian-heavy bureaucracy that is still smarting from the Argentine pope\u2019s go-it-alone style.",
      "Pick a relatively unknown pope and he\u2019s just that, unknown.",
      "Chatbots and bookmakers\u2019 predictions aside, it\u2019s really anyone\u2019s guess, said Alberto Melloni, a church historian.",
      "\u201cThey barely know each other,\u201d Melloni said, recalling that in his last batch of cardinals alone, in December, Francis added 20 new voters to the conclave. These cardinals hailed from Algeria, Argentina and Australia and points in between, and may have first met the day they got their red hats.",
      "Of course there are some leading candidates. They stand out as front-runners simply because they are the most well-known.",
      "- Cardinal Pietro Parolin is a leading Italian, by nature of his office: He was Francis\u2019 secretary of state, the Vatican No. 2, so known to every cardinal in the Sistine Chapel.",
      "- The top candidate to be history\u2019s first Asian pope is also on everyone\u2019s short list because he\u2019s got a similarly high-profile Vatican job: Filippino Cardinal Luis Tagle, who heads the Vatican\u2019s evangelization office responsible for the Catholic Church in much of the developing world.",
      "- A leading candidate representing more of the conservative wing of the church is Hungarian Cardinal Erdo, 72, the archbishop of Budapest.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t see in this moment real front-runners, because to be a front-runner, you need already to have behind you a packet of votes,\u201d said longtime Vatican watcher Marco Politi, whose upcoming book \u201cThe Unfinished\u201d explores Francis' unfinished business.",
      "Because the cardinals don\u2019t know each other well, no one is seen to have secured the packet of votes, suggesting it might take several rounds of voting to get a two-thirds majority.",
      "Melloni said cardinals shouldn't be afraid to let the conclave drag on, even if it sends a message of division as black smoke day after day signals a lack of consensus.",
      "\u201cCertainly the church is divided. The problem is to find the one who unites, not pretend that it isn't divided,\" Melloni said.",
      "The lack of front-runners has made the \u201ckingmakers\u201d more important in this conclave.",
      "These are the influential figures who themselves may not be considered \u201cpapabile\u201d but can rally votes from other cardinals in a particular direction. They include New York Cardinal Timothy Dolan, German Cardinal Reinhard Marx and Congolese Cardinal Fridolin Ambongo Besungu, the Franciscan archbishop of Kinshasa who heads the African bishops\u2019 conference.",
      "While 108 of the voting-age cardinals were created by Francis, they may not necessarily follow his mercy-over-morals line: Some may support Francis\u2019 call for the church to be more inclusive, but oppose women priests, Politi said.",
      "\u201cMaybe they agree with the issue of giving Communion to divorced and remarried people, but they don\u2019t want to bless a homosexual couple,\u201d he said. \u201cSo this makes this conclave very difficult.\u201d",
      "Marx said the global outpouring of grief after Francis\u2019 death shows support for a pope who will continue his ministry focusing on people who are marginalized and against war.",
      "\u201cPeople long for a voice that goes beyond national interests, beyond polarizations, beyond discussion about who overwhelms whom and who defeats whom,\" Marx told reporters after the funeral.",
      "One question is whether Cardinal Angelo Becciu, once one of the most powerful cardinals at the Vatican, will be allowed to cast a vote.",
      "Francis in 2020 forced Becciu to resign and relinquish his rights and privileges as a cardinal over alleged financial misconduct. The Sardinian prelate was later convicted of finance-related crimes by the Vatican criminal tribunal.",
      "He is appealing the convictions and has participated in Vatican events since his downfall. At 76, he is under the voting age limit of 80. However, official Vatican statistics list him as a \u201cnon elector.\u201d He and his supporters maintain that he didn\u2019t lose his primary duty of electing a pope.",
      "Another question is where the cardinals will sleep.",
      "The Vatican\u2019s Domus Santa Marta hotel was built in 1996 specifically to house cardinals during a conclave, so they could all be in one place and sequestered.",
      "At the time, St. John Paul II had decreed that there could only be 120 cardinal electors who could participate in a conclave, and the hotel was built to accommodate their numbers. But Francis and his predecessors regularly breached the 120-man threshold and the electors now number 135.",
      "Also, Room No. 201, where Francis chose to live after his 2013 election, is under seal and must remain so until a new pope is elected.",
      "Asked if the cardinals would be asked to double-up in hotel rooms, Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni noted that such accommodations would be fitting.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a great opportunity to create community,\u201d Bruni said.",

      "BUCHAREST, Romania -- Romanians are confronting a deluge of online disinformation ahead of a fraught presidential election redo next week, including ominous claims that the NATO member country is surging toward \u201cimminent war\u201d with Russia.",
      "The campaign, attributed to unidentified anti-government and pro-Russian actors, underscores how large social media platforms can be exploited to fuel distrust and spin anti-Western narratives.",
      "It's also a somber lesson for other democracies across the European Union.",
      "Romania\u2019s political landscape was shaken last November when Calin Georgescu, a little-known, far-right populist, won the most votes in the first round of the presidential election, advancing to the runoff against reformist Elena Lasconi of the progressive Save Romania Union party.",
      "Soon, allegations emerged of electoral violations and a Russian campaign promoting Georgescu, following declassified intelligence showing a highly-sophisticated, coordinated campaign via TikTok. Moscow denied it meddled.",
      "Romania\u2019s Constitutional Court then annulled the vote and ordered a redo.",
      "Georgescu, who has praised Russian President Vladimir Putin and criticized NATO and the EU, is now under criminal investigation. In March, he was barred from running in the May 4 election redo, prompting chaos on the streets of Romania's capital, Bucharest, as his incensed supporters staged protests that descended into violence.",
      "What happened in Romania unnerved Brussels and raised questions about foreign interference.",
      "The EU Commission responded by launching an ongoing probe into TikTok to determine whether it had violated the EU\u2019s Digital Services Act in failing to deal with risks to Romania\u2019s election. Some 8.5 million Romanians aged 18 and above use the platform in the country of about 19 million.",
      "For its part, TikTok said it dismantled in December covert influence networks targeting Romanians, removing over 27,000 accounts that posted comments via a \u201cfake engagement vendor\u201d promoting the far-right Alliance for the Unity of Romanians party and Georgescu. It also removed more than 1,100 accounts impersonating presidential candidates of all stripes.",
      "TikTok also said it has taken steps to protect Romania\u2019s election integrity, including expanding its team of Romanian-speaking content moderators, partnering with a local fact-checking group, and in-app tools linking to official election information.",
      "But the disinformation didn't stop and it wasn't just confined to TikTok. The declassified intel indicated other platforms \u2014 Telegram, Facebook and YouTube \u2014 were also used, though to a lesser extent.",
      "Unlike misinformation, which covers any false information, including honest mistakes and misunderstandings, disinformation refers to misinformation created and spread intentionally, mainly to confuse or mislead.",
      "According to Funky Citizens, a Romanian nongovernmental organization, those behind disinformation use emotional triggers \u2014 such as claims of betrayal, injustice or existential threat \u2014 \u201cto erode trust in democratic institutions\u201d and \u201ccreate a parallel political reality.\u201d",
      "The NGO warned in April of a \u201cvast ecosystem\u201d of false narratives around Georgescu, who is now being promoted in this online sphere as \u201cthe legitimate president of Romania.\u201d",
      "Some of the narratives claim that annulling the election was a coup, supported by the \u201cEU, globalist elites, and intelligence agencies\u201d and portray Romania as a \"victim of European or Western control.\u201d",
      "Others warn of \u201cimminent war\u201d with Russia or predict that conscription and martial law are next. A post on TikTok, now removed, tells Romanians that within a month, their \u201dchildren will be sent to war.\u201d",
      "What has complicated matters is that many Romanians feel the authorities have failed to sufficiently explain what led to the annulment of the November election, Elena Calistru, who runs Funky Citizens, told The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cThe fact that we didn\u2019t have this kind of post-mortem of what happened, as well as the lack of accountability, is also fueling distrust,\u201d she said.",
      "Expert Forum, a Romanian think-tank, said this week that online political campaigning has \u201centered a new era, dominated by an industry of political promotion through inauthentic networks.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe are witnessing an explosion of masked, coordinated and candidate-friendly content, created with the aim of simulating popular support and influencing public perception,\u201d it said.",
      "Cristian Andrei, a political consultant in Bucharest, says \u201cdisinformation is here to stay\u201d and won't magically disappear ahead of Sunday's rerun.",
      "The EU\u2019s diplomatic service has labelled foreign interference, including disinformation, a \u201cgrowing security and foreign policy threat.\u201d",
      "Last year, online disinformation surged ahead of the EU\u2019s parliamentary elections and Moldova, an EU candidate country, also faced an alleged onslaught of Russian interference in two key ballots last fall.",
      "Cyabra, an AI-powered platform that uncovers online disinformation, fake accounts, and influence campaigns, analyzed the discourse on X in Romania related to the pro-Georgescu protests between March 6 and April 6.",
      "Sharing its findings with the AP, it said it has determined that 45% of 639 accounts were fake \u2014 well above the usual 7\u201310% baseline.",
      "Cyabra's CEO Dan Brahmy said these accounts \"created a fake consensus, making it seem like everyone was outraged \u2014 when half of that \u2018everyone\u2019 didn\u2019t even exist.\u201d",
      "In a 2024 report, X said its human moderators \u201cproactively conduct manual content reviews\u201d in high-priority categories \u2014 such as election-related content, as part of its compliance with EU rules.",
      "Still, critics argue that under Elon Musk 's ownership, X has become a hotbed of disinformation.",
      "Calistru, of Funky Citizens, expects \u201chybrid attacks on our electoral system\u201d to intensify in Romania ahead of next Sunday's vote. Eleven candidates are vying for the top job and if none wins more than 50% of the ballots, a runoff will be held two weeks later.",
      "Adding to the storm were remarks by U.S. Vice President JD Vance, and Musk, who like Moscow criticized Romania for voiding last year\u2019s election and barring Georgescu from the May vote.",
      "\u201cIf your democracy can be destroyed with a few hundred thousand dollars (euros) of digital advertising from a foreign country \u2014 then it wasn\u2019t very strong to begin with,\u201d Vance said at the Munich Security Conference in February.",
      "Between April 13 and April 20, Romania's Central Election Bureau stepped up enforcement. It approved 153 complaints and ordered the removal of more than 500 online posts \u2014 including unverified content from anonymous accounts, mislabeled ads by politicians and posts by people who don't hold public office but could possibly influence the electorate.",
      "It's a difficult balancing act \u2014 protecting freedom of expression and defending democracy against disinformation. Some of the election bureau's removals drew criticism and accusations of silencing political views of private citizens, which it denies.",
      "Lasconi, who was to face Georgescu in the runoff and is running in Sunday's election, said she was mocked when she warned of interference last year.",
      "\u201cNo one took me seriously,\" she said. \u201cIt turns out I was right.\u201d",

      "A lettercard penned by one of the Titanic\u2019s most well-known survivors from onboard the ship days before it sank has sold for 300,000 pounds ($399,000) at auction",
      "LONDON -- A lettercard penned by one of the Titanic's most well-known survivors from onboard the ship, days before it sank, has sold for 300,000 pounds ($399,000) at auction.",
      "In the note, written to the seller's great-uncle on April 10, 1912, first-class passenger Archibald Gracie wrote of the ill-fated steamship: \u201cIt is a fine ship but I shall await my journeys end before I pass judgment on her.\u201d",
      "The letter was sold to a private collector from the United States on Saturday, according to auction house Henry Aldridge & Son in Wiltshire, England. The hammer price far exceeded the initial estimate price of 60,000 pounds.",
      "The letter is believed to be the sole example in existence from Gracie from onboard the Titanic, which sank off Newfoundland after hitting an iceberg, killing about 1,500 people on its maiden voyage.",
      "Auctioneer Andrew Aldridge described it as an \u201cexceptional museum grade piece.\u201d",
      "Gracie, who jumped from the ship and managed to scramble onto an overturned collapsible boat, was rescued by other passengers onboard a lifeboat and was taken to the R.M.S. Carpathia. He went on to write \u201cThe Truth about the Titanic,\" an account of his experiences, when he returned to New York City.",
      "Gracie boarded the Titanic in Southampton on April 10, 1912, and was assigned first-class cabin C51. His book is seen as one of the most detailed accounts of the events of the night the ship sank, Aldridge said. Gracie did not fully recover from the hypothermia he suffered, and died of complications from diabetes in late 1912.",

      "They came from around the world to rejoice in the naming of the first millennial saint, but they ended up bidding farewell to Pope Francis instead",
      "VATICAN CITY -- Thousands of young people from around the world had come to Rome expecting to rejoice this weekend in the canonization of the first millennial saint during the Vatican\u2019s Holy Year. They ended up bidding farewell to Pope Francis instead, with their exuberance giving an uplifting tone to Saturday's otherwise somber funeral.",
      "\u201cHe always said you have to be joyful about life, you have to live life in a similar way,\u201d said Marco Falchi, who traveled from his home near Perugia with his wife and 11-year-old son. He and his wife credit Francis with reviving their spirituality, and they named their son, Francesco, after him.",
      "The family is also devoted to the cause of sainthood for Carlo Acutis, a young Italian who died in 2006 from leukemia and inspired faith in many young Catholics. They planned their trip to Rome around that.",
      "The canonization of Acutis had been scheduled for Sunday during the first-ever Jubilee of Adolescents, dedicated to teens. It was suspended after Francis\u2019 death.",
      "Falchi was struck by the lack of deep mourning at the funeral for the pope. \u201cEspecially since this was the jubilee for adolescents, he certainly didn\u2019t want a day of mourning but he wanted a day of joy,\u201d he said.",
      "There was a clear blue sky over St. Peter\u2019s Square. Some people camped out the night before to get a good spot. Many stood respectfully, their hands folded, as they followed the Mass on large screens. Radio broadcasts in multiple languages added to the hum of humanity. They applauded when Francis\u2019 simple wooden coffin was moved outdoors.",
      "Tens of thousands of Catholic faithful had planned their trips before the pope's death on Monday at age 88 following a long hospitalization.",
      "\u201cI bought my ticket for Carlo,\u201d said Reyes Arribas, a 23-year-old from Valencia, Spain. \u201cAnd then suddenly Pope Francis died, so I came to the funeral.\u201d",
      "She confessed that while she admired Francis, she felt a closer affinity to his predecessors, St. John Paul II and Benedict XVI. Her feelings for Acutis, however, are very strong. She excitedly praised him as \u201cthe first saint of young people\u201d because he was immersed in the technological world of today.",
      "Even those who were disappointed by the suspended canonization were gratified that they could celebrate Francis, loved by many for his humility and concern for the poor.",
      "\u201cI feel I grew up with Pope Francis,\u201d said Jessica Naranjo, a 27-year-old from Austin, Texas. \u201cHe advocated for social justice. This was a big loss for me.\u201d",
      "Ana Kalen, a 22-year-old medical student, traveled to Rome for the Acutis canonization with a group from Sarajevo, Bosnia.",
      "\u201cThe plans have changed, but we are still so glad to be here for this historical moment,\u201d Kalen said, a Bosnian flag draped over her shoulders.",
      "\u201cWe are sad about each death,\u201d Kalen said. \u201cBut we do believe that Pope Francis is in a better place.\u201d",
      "After St. John Paul II died in 2005, the mood was different. The faithful made pilgrimages from his Polish homeland and elsewhere to mourn a towering figure of the 20th century in a spirit of deep sadness and loss.",
      "Francis had a different style. During his 12-year papacy, he urged people to maintain a sense of humor, and that spirit seemed to guide many participants Saturday.",
      "Groups of young people filled St. Peter\u2019s Square before the funeral Mass. One from a parish in Cassano Magnago in the northern Italian province of Varese danced in circle and sang religious songs.",
      "The pope\u2019s death during Easter season filled them with a sense of peace, one teenager said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a good sign,\u201d said 16-year-old Matteo Cozzi. \u201cThe death of a pope at Easter is a sign of hope.\u201d",

      "Zelenskyy\u2019s office had said teams were making arrangements for the leaders to talk again Saturday, but Trump went directly to the Rome airport after the funeral and boarded Air Force One for the 10-hour flight back to the United States, which seemed to rule out a second in-person conversation.",
      "The White House said their discussion was \u201cvery productive\u201d and that more details would be released later. The meeting lasted about 15 minutes inside St. Peter\u2019s Basilica at the Vatican just before they took their seats for the outdoor funeral service.",
      "Zelenskyy said \u201cgood meeting\u201d on social media after the funeral.",
      "\u201cWe discussed a lot one on one. Hoping for results on everything we covered. Protecting lives of our people. Full and unconditional ceasefire. Reliable and lasting peace that will prevent another war from breaking out,\u201d he wrote. \u201cVery symbolic meeting that has potential to become historic, if we achieve joint results. Thank you.\"",
      "The meeting took place hours after Trump said on social media, after he arrived in Italy late Friday, that Russia and Ukraine should meet for \u201cvery high level talks\u201d on ending the three-year war sparked by Russia\u2019s invasion.",
      "Trump has pressed both sides to agree to a ceasefire. His special envoy, Steve Witkoff, had met earlier Friday with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow, and Trump said both sides were \u201cvery close to a deal.\u201d",
      "Putin did not attend Francis' funeral. He faces an arrest warrant issued by the International Criminal Court, which has accused him of war crimes stemming from Moscow\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.",
      "Meanwhile, in a statement Friday night, Zelenskyy said \u201cvery significant meetings may take place\u201d in coming days, and that an unconditional ceasefire was needed.",
      "\u201cReal pressure on Russia is needed so that they accept either the American proposal to cease fire and move towards peace, or our proposal \u2014 whichever one can truly work and ensure a reliable, immediate, and unconditional ceasefire, and then \u2014 a dignified peace and security guarantees,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cDiplomacy must succeed. And we are doing everything to make diplomacy truly meaningful and finally effective.\u201d",
      "There was no immediate word on whether Trump and Zelenskyy spoke again after they paid their respects to the pope, who had repeatedly pressed for an end to the conflict.",

      "Social media videos showed black billowing smoke after the blast. Others showed glass blown out of buildings kilometers (miles) away from the epicenter of the explosion.",
      "Authorities have offered no cause for the explosion yet. Industrial accidents happen in Iran, particularly at its aging oil facilities that struggle for access to parts under international sanctions. But Iranian state TV specifically ruled out any energy infrastructure as causing or being damaged in the blast.",

      "ISTANBUL -- Police in Istanbul detained 47 people Saturday in dawn raids linked to a corruption investigation that saw the city\u2019s mayor imprisoned last month, leading to Turkey\u2019s largest protests in more than a decade.",
      "Among those arrested in Istanbul, the neighboring province of Tekirdag and the capital, Ankara, were senior officials from Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality, local media reported.",
      "The March 19 detention of Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu, who is the main challenger to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s 22-year rule, saw hundreds of thousands of people flood the streets of Turkish cities to protest what many consider a politically motivated case. The government insists Turkey\u2019s judicial system is independent.",
      "In a statement, the Istanbul Chief Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office said simultaneous operations were conducted against 53 suspects, six of whom remain at large. Searches were continuing at homes and workplaces, it added.",
      "Demonstrations against Imamoglu\u2019s jailing and wider democratic backsliding saw more than 2,000 people arrested for taking part in banned protests last month. Many of them were students but journalists and trades unionists were also among the detainees.",
      "Imamoglu, who also faces terror-related charges in a parallel investigation launched last month, was nominated the presidential candidate for his Republican People\u2019s Party, or CHP, while in prison. Elections are due in 2028 but could come earlier.",
      "The cases against him, which include several others that pre-date the March investigations, could see him banned from politics.",
      "The CHP-supporting Cumhuriyet newspaper reported that Saturday\u2019s arrests included the deputy secretary general of Istanbul municipality, Imamoglu\u2019s private secretary and the head of the city\u2019s water company. Gokhan Gunaydin, a senior CHP lawmaker, said the municipality was being \u201ceffectively rendered inoperable\u201d by the arrests.",

      "Pope Francis died on Easter Monday at the age of 88 after a 12-year papacy",
      "NEW YORK -- Pope Francis died on Easter Monday at the age of 88. His death set off mourning across the Catholic world and days of ritual at the Vatican. Here are the key things to know about the funeral of the first Latin American pontiff in the church's history:",
      "His funeral is being held on Saturday in St. Peter\u2019s Square. Francis will then be buried, according to his will: in a simple underground tomb at St. Mary Major Basilica. The church is home to his favorite icon of the Virgin Mary, to whom he was particularly devoted.",
      "The night before the funeral, the camerlengo presided over the closing and sealing of the coffin, in the presence of other senior cardinals. A white cloth was placed over Francis' face.",
      "A bag containing coins minted during his papacy was placed in the coffin along with a one-page written account of his papacy \u2014 known in Italian as a \u201crogito,\u201d a word indicating an official deed. It was read aloud by the master of liturgical ceremonies and then rolled up and slipped inside a cylindrical tube that was placed inside the coffin. Another copy is kept in the Vatican archives. The covers of both the zinc coffin and the wooden one bear a cross and Francis' papal coat of arms.",
      "Francis had said he wanted to be buried not in St. Peter\u2019s Basilica or its grottoes, where most popes are buried, but in the St. Mary Major Basilica across town. His choice reflects his veneration of an icon of the Virgin Mary that is located there, the Salus Populi Romani (Salvation of the people of Rome).",
      "Before and after every foreign trip, Francis would go to the basilica to pray before the Byzantine-style painting that features an image of Mary, draped in a blue robe, holding the infant Jesus who in turn holds a jeweled golden book.",
      "Heads of state, including U.S. President Donald Trump, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and French President Emmanuel Macron, are among those expected for the funeral. Others dignitaries include: Prince William, German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier and European Council President Ant\u00f3nio Costa.",
      "Pope Francis had a 12-year papacy during which he charmed the world with his humility and concern for the poor. But the Argentina-born pope also alienated conservatives with critiques of capitalism and climate change.",
      "The death of a pope starts a centuries-old ritual to elect a new one, involving sacred oaths by the cardinals, the piercing of ballots with a needle and thread after they\u2019re counted, and then burning them to produce either the white or black smoke to signal if there\u2019s a new leader for the world\u2019s 1.4 billion Catholics.",
      "With the burial, the Catholic Church begins nine days of official mourning, known as the \u201cnovemdiales\u201d. The date of the conclave to elect a new pope has not yet been announced.",
      "In the conclave, the cardinals will vote in secret sessions, and the ballots will be burned in a special stove after each session. Black smoke indicates no pope has been elected; white smoke says the cardinals have chosen the next head of the Catholic Church.",
      "Any baptized Catholic male is eligible, though only cardinals have been selected since 1378. The winner must receive at least two-thirds of the vote from those cardinals under age 80 who are eligible to participate.",
      "Francis appointed the vast majority of electors, often tapping men who share his pastoral priorities, which suggests continuity rather than rupture.",
      "While it\u2019s impossible to predict who the next pope will be, some cardinals are considered to have better chances than others.",
      "Yes and no. \u201cConclave\u201d the 2024 film, introduced many laypeople to the ancient selection process with its arcane rules and grand ceremony, albeit with a silver screen twist packed full of palace intrigue and surprise.",
      "Vatican experts say the movie excels at re-creating the look and feel of a conclave. But there are discrepancies, errors and some outlandish storylines in the Hollywood version. And while the voting process was depicted accurately, the ballots are burned not after each vote, but after each session.",
      "Francis was known for his personal simplicity, from the choice of his name Francis in honor of St. Francis of Assisi, who renounced wealth to help the poor, to the outward symbols and priorities of his papacy.",
      "He chose to live in the Vatican's Domus Santa Marta hotel instead of the Apostolic Palace and wore his old orthotic shoes and not the red loafers of the papacy.",
      "In his teachings, he focused on concern for refugees and other marginalized people. His first trip outside Rome as pope in 2013 was to the Sicilian island of Lampedusa to meet with newly arrived migrants. His plea for welcome put him at odds with U.S. and European policies.",
      "He also also signaled a more welcoming stance toward LGBTQ+ people, while also making the fight against climate change a priority. Francis became the first pope to use scientific data in a major teaching document and made care for God\u2019s creation a hallmark of his papacy.",
      "He eschewed the grandiose even in his departure, lying in state in a simple coffin made of wood.",

The area to the left of the main altar, up the basilica steps, is reserved for celebrants and Catholic hierarchy, while world leaders and royalty will be seated on the right.",
      "Many ran toward the square as barricades opened. Some carried banners for the Jubilee Holy Year that Francis opened in December and will continue despite his death Monday following a stroke.",

      "Canadians will vote for a new government in an election that has been upended by U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s trade war and threats to make Canada the 51st state",
      "TORONTO -- Canadians will vote for a new government on Monday in an election that has been upended by U.S. President Donald Trump 's trade war and his threats to make Canada the 51st state.",
      "Prime Minister Mark Carney and the governing Liberal Party appeared poised for a historic election defeat until Trump slapped heavy tariffs on Canada and began threatening its sovereignty.",
      "Trump's attacks have infuriated Canadians, who are canceling trips to their southern neighbor and avoiding buying American goods when they can. The surge in Canadian nationalism has bolstered the Liberals' poll numbers.",
      "The opposition Conservative Party had hoped to make the election a referendum on former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, whose popularity cratered as food and housing prices rose and immigration surged. But after decades of bilateral stability, the vote is now expected to focus on who is best equipped to deal with Trump.",
      "Voters nationwide will elect all 343 member of the House of Commons, one for each constituency. There are no primaries or runoffs \u2014 just a single round of voting.",
      "Like the U.K., Canada uses a \u201cfirst-past-the-post\u201d voting system, meaning the candidate who finishes first in each constituency will be elected, even if they don\u2019t get 50% of the vote.",
      "This has generally cemented the dominance of the two largest parties, the Liberals and Conservatives, because it\u2019s difficult for smaller parties to win seats unless they have concentrated support in particular areas.",
      "The party that commands a majority in the House of Commons, either alone or with the support of another party, will form the next government and its leader will be prime minister.",
      "Carney replaced Trudeau, who announced his resignation in January but remained in power until the Liberal Party elected a new leader, Carney, on March 9.",
      "Carney was sworn in as Canada\u2019s 24th prime minister on March 14. He hopes to retain the job and avoid becoming one of Canada\u2019s shortest-serving prime ministers.",
      "Carney, 60, is one of the two main candidates. He successfully navigated financial crises when he headed the Bank of Canada and later ran the Bank of England, becoming the first non-U.K. citizen to do so since its 1694 founding.",
      "A highly educated economist, Carney worked for 13 years for Goldman Sachs in London, Tokyo, New York and Toronto, before being appointed deputy governor of the Bank of Canada in 2003. He has financial industry and public service credentials.",
      "Pierre Poilievre, the leader of the Conservatives, is Carney\u2019s main challenger. He and the party seemed headed for a big victory in the election until Trump's near-daily trade and annexation threats derailed them.",
      "Poilievre, 45, is a career politician and firebrand populist who says he will put \u201cCanada first.\u201d For years his party\u2019s go-to attack dog, he frequently criticizes the mainstream media and vows to defund Canada\u2019s public broadcaster.",
      "There are two other parties that have official status in Parliament. If the Liberals or Conservatives secure the most seats in the House of Commons but fail to win a majority, they would need to rely on either the New Democrats, a progressive party, or the separatist Quebec party Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois to pass legislation.",

      "Pope Francis is being laid to rest in ceremony reflecting his priorities as pope and wishes as pastor",
      "VATICAN CITY -- VATICAN CITY (AP) \u2014 Pope Francis is being laid to rest Saturday in a ceremony reflecting his priorities as pope and wishes as pastor: Presidents and princes will attend his funeral in St. Peter\u2019s Square, but prisoners and migrants will usher him into the basilica where he will be buried.",
      "As many as 200,000 people are expected to attend the funeral, which Francis choreographed himself when he revised and simplified the Vatican\u2019s rites and rituals last year. His aim was to emphasize the pope\u2019s role as a mere priest and not \u201ca powerful man of this world,\u201d the Vatican said.",
      "It was a reflection of Francis\u2019 12-year project to radically reform the papacy, to emphasize its pastors as servants, and to construct \u201ca poor church for the poor.\u201d It was a mission he articulated just days after his 2013 election and explained the name he chose as pope, in honor of St. Francis of Assisi, \u201cwho had the heart of the poor of the world,\u201d according to the official decree of the pope's life that was placed in his coffin Friday night.",
      "Nevertheless, the powerful will be in attendance Saturday. U.S. President Donald Trump, French President Emmanuel Macron, the U.N. chief and European Union leaders are joining Prince William and the Spanish royal family in leading official delegations. Argentine President Javier Milei had the pride of place given Francis' Argentine nationality, even if the two didn't particularly get along and Francis alienated many Argentines by never returning home.",
      "Francis is breaking with recent tradition and will buried in the St. Mary Major Basilica, near Rome's main train station, where a simple underground tomb awaits him with just his name: Franciscus. As many as 300,000 people are expected to line the 4-kilometer (2.5 mile) motorcade route that will bring Francis\u2019 casket from the Vatican through the center of Rome to the basilica after the funeral.",
      "Francis, the first Latin American and first Jesuit pope, died Easter Monday at age 88 after suffering a stroke while recovering at home from pneumonia.",
      "With his funeral, preparations can now begin in earnest to host the centuries-old process of electing a new pope, a conclave that will likely begin in the first week of May. In the interim, the Vatican is being run by a handful of cardinals, key among them Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re, the 91-year-old dean of the College of Cardinals who is presiding at the funeral and organizing the secret voting in the Sistine Chapel.",
      "Over three days this week, more than 250,000 people stood for hours in line to pay their final respects while Francis\u2019 body lay in state in St. Peter\u2019s Basilica. The Vatican kept the doors open through the night to accommodate them.",
      "\u201cHe was an excellent, humble person who changed many laws and always for the better,\u201d said a pilgrim from his native Argentina, Augustin Angelicola, as he waited on line. \u201cNow it is a sad thing for the whole world that all this has happened. We did not expect it, it had to happen but not so soon.\u201d",
      "But even with the expanded hours, it wasn't enough. When the Vatican closed the doors to the general public at 7 p.m. on Friday, mourners were turned away in droves.",
      "Even before he became pope, Francis had a particular affection for St. Mary Major. It is home to a Byzantine-style icon of the Madonna, the Salus Popoli Romani, to which Francis was particularly devoted, such that he would go pray before it before and after each of his foreign trips as pope.",
      "He decided to have his tomb located in a niche next to the chapel housing the icon, with a reproduction of his simple silver pectoral cross over the marble tombstone.",
      "The choice of the basilica is also symbolically significant given its ties to Francis\u2019 Jesuit religious order. St. Ignatius Loyola, who founded the Jesuits, celebrated his first Mass in the basilica on Christmas Day in 1538.",
      "The Vatican said 40 special guests would greet his casket on the piazza in front of the basilica, reflecting the marginalized groups Francis prioritized pope: homeless people and migrants, prisoners and transgender people.",
      "\u201cThe poor have a privileged place in the heart of God,\u201d the Vatican quoted Francis as saying in explaining the choice. The actual burial will be private, presided over by cardinals and a few close aides.",

      "ROME -- President Donald Trump will be among more than 50 heads of state and other dignitaries attending Saturday's funeral for Pope Francis, where he'll personally pay his respects to the Roman Catholic leader who pointedly disagreed with him on a variety of issues.",
      "Trump told reporters he was going to the funeral \u201cout of respect\u201d for the pontiff, who died Monday after suffering a stroke at the age of 88.",
      "The president and first lady Melania Trump arrived in Rome late Friday for the service at St. Peter\u2019s Basilica in Vatican City on Saturday morning. Francis will be laid to rest during a private burial at St. Mary Major Basilica outside the Vatican\u2019s walls.",
      "Francis sharply disagreed with Trump's approach on issues including immigration, the treatment of migrants and climate change. The Argentine pontiff and the American president sparred early in their relationship over immigration. In 2016, Francis, alluding to then-candidate Trump and his campaign slogan of \"Build the wall,\" called anyone who builds a wall to keep out migrants \u201c not Christian.\u201d Trump said the comment was \u201cdisgraceful.\u201d",
      "But after Francis' death, the Republican president praised him as a \u201cgood man\u201d who \u201cworked hard\u201d and \u201cloved the world.\u201d Trump also directed that U.S. flags be flown at half-staff in Francis' honor.",
      "Trump had said on a couple of occasions before leaving Washington that he would have \u201ca lot\u201d of meetings with counterparts on the sidelines of the funeral. But he seemed to back away from that as he flew to Rome.",
      "\u201cFrankly, it's a little disrespectful to have meetings when you're at the funeral of a pope,\u201d the president told reporters accompanying him aboard Air Force One. Nonetheless, Trump said: \u201cI'll be talking to people. I'll be seeing a lot of people.\u201d",
      "The leaders of France, the United Kingdom, Spain, Hungary and Argentina are among those expected to attend.",
      "One person Trump didn't expect to interact with is former President Joe Biden, who planned to attend the funeral with his wife, Jill. Trump said he wasn't aware his Democratic predecessor would be at the funeral. Asked if they'd meet, Trump said: \u201cIt\u2019s not high on my list. It\u2019s really not.\u201d",
      "The pope's funeral will not be one of those occasions that bring together the current and former U.S. presidents. Former Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush are not attending, their offices said. A spokesperson for former President Bill Clinton did not respond to an inquiry about his plans.",
      "Trump didn't elaborate when asked if he\u2019d just be meeting leaders in passing or holding more in-depth talks. He suggested he might have meetings at Villa Taverna, the U.S. ambassador's residence, where he spent the night.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a little tough because we don\u2019t have much time,\" Trump said, noting his late arrival in Rome. He was scheduled to head back to the United States immediately after the funeral.",
      "\u201cI think that we\u2019re going to try and see a couple of people that are important in what we\u2019re doing,\" said Trump, who is trying to broker a ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine and negotiate trade agreements with multiple countries.",
      "He posted on Truth Social shortly after arriving in Rome that Ukraine and Russia should meet for \u201cvery high level talks\u201d on ending the bloody three-year war sparked by Russia's invasion. His envoy, Steve Witkoff, met with Russian President Vladimir Putin earlier Friday, and Trump said both sides were \u201cvery close to a deal.\u201d",

      "SEOUL, South Korea -- SEOUL, South Korea (AP) \u2014 North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has unveiled a new naval destroyer, claiming it as a significant advancement toward his goal of expanding the operational range and preemptive strike capabilities of his nuclear-armed military, state media said Saturday.",
      "North Korea\u2019s state-run Korean Central News Agency said Kim attended the launching ceremony for the 5,000-ton warship on Friday at the western port of Nampo.",
      "Kim framed the arms buildup as a response to perceived threats from the United States and its allies in Asia, who have been expanding joint military exercises amid rising tensions over the North\u2019s nuclear program. He added that the acquisition of a nuclear-powered submarine would be his next big step in strengthening his navy.",
      "The new \u201cmultipurpose\u201d destroyer, touted by state media as the first in a new class of heavily armed warships, is designed to handle various weapons systems, including anti-air and anti-naval weapons, as well as nuclear-capable ballistic and cruise missiles, Kim said. He said the destroyer will be handed over to the navy early next year and begin active duty.",
      "Kim criticized recent efforts by the United States and South Korea to expand joint military exercises and update their nuclear deterrence strategies, portraying them as preparations for war. He vowed to \u201crespond decisively to this geopolitical crisis and ongoing developments,\u201d according to his speech carried by KCNA.",
      "South Korea\u2019s military didn\u2019t immediately comment on the North Korean claims about its new warship. North Korea\u2019s unveiling of the new warship follows its March revealing of a purported nuclear-powered submarine under construction. However, some experts question whether the impoverished and largely isolated nation could develop such advanced capabilities without foreign assistance.",
      "Nuclear-powered submarines were among a broad list of advanced weapons that Kim pledged to develop at a major political conference in 2021, citing growing U.S.-led threats. His wish list also included solid-fueled intercontinental ballistic missiles, hypersonic weapons, spy satellites, and multi-warhead missiles. Since then, North Korea has conducted a series of tests aimed at acquiring these capabilities.",
      "Regional tensions have increased as Kim continues to flaunt his military nuclear capabilities and align with Russia over President Vladimir Putin\u2019s war on Ukraine.",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump has said he would reach out to Kim again to revive diplomacy, but the North has not responded to that offer. While the two leaders met three times during Trump\u2019s first term, negotiations broke down over disagreements on easing U.S.-led sanctions in exchange for steps toward the North's denuclearization.",
      "Kim\u2019s foreign policy focus has since shifted to Russia, which he has supplied with weapons and military personnel to support its warfighting in Ukraine. South Korean officials are concerned that, in return, Pyongyang could receive economic aid and advanced military technology to further develop its weapons programs.",

She was the light that lifted so many survivors,\u201d her family said in a statement. \u201cDespite all the adversity she faced in her life, she shone so bright. She will be missed beyond measure.\u201d",
      "Her publicist Dini von Mueffling described Giuffre as \u201cdeeply loving, wise and funny.\"",
      "\u201cShe adored her children and many animals. She was always more concerned with me than with herself,\" von Mueffling wrote in a statement. \"I will miss her beyond words. It was the privilege of a lifetime to represent her.\u201d",

      "The American-born Giuffre, who lived in Australia for years, became an advocate for sex trafficking survivors after emerging as a central figure in Epstein's prolonged downfall.",
      "The wealthy, well-connected New York money manager killed himself in August 2019 while awaiting trial on U.S. federal sex trafficking charges involving dozens of teenage girls and young women, some as young as 14. The charges came 14 years after police in Palm Beach, Florida, first began investigating allegations that he sexually abused underage girls who were hired to give him massages.",
      "Giuffre came forward publicly after the initial investigation ended in an 18-month Florida jail term for Epstein, who made a secret deal to avoid federal prosecution by pleading guilty instead to relatively minor state-level charges of soliciting prostitution. He was released in 2009.",
      "In subsequent lawsuits, Giuffre said she was a teenage spa attendant at Mar-a-Lago \u2014 President Donald Trump's Palm Beach club \u2014 when she was approached in 2000 by Epstein's girlfriend and later employee, Ghislaine Maxwell.",
      "Giuffre said Maxwell hired her as a masseuse for Epstein, but the couple effectively made her a sexual servant, pressuring her into gratifying not only Epstein but his friends and associates. Giuffre she was flown around the world for assignations with men including Prince Andrew while she was 17 and 18.",
      "The men denied it and assailed Giuffre's credibility. She acknowledged changing some key details of her account, including the age at which she first met Epstein.",
      "But many parts of her story were supported by documents, witness testimony and photos \u2014 including one of her and Andrew, with his his arm around her bare midriff, in Maxwell\u2019s London townhouse.",
      "Giuffre said in one of her lawsuits that she had sex with the royal three times: in London during her 2001 trip, at Epstein\u2019s New York mansion when she was 17 and in the Virgin Islands when she was 18.",
      "\u201cGhislaine said, \u2018I want you to do for him what you do for Epstein,\u2019\u201d Giuffre told NBC News\u2019 \u201cDateline\u201d in September 2019.",
      "Andrew categorically rejected Giuffre\u2019s allegations and said he didn't recall having met her.",
      "His denials blew up in his face during a November 2019 BBC interview. Viewers saw a prince who proffered curious rebuttals \u2014 such as disputing Giuffre's recollection of sweaty dancing by saying he was medically incapable of perspiring \u2014 and showed no empathy for the women who said Epstein abused them.",

      "A Register reporter submitted a records request in February to Gov. Kim Reynolds' office, according to the complaint. In response, the Republican governor's office provided 825 pages of relevant documents and withheld four emails, asserting they were protected because they were \u201cintended to be confidential, and disclosure would inhibit the governor's ability to receive candid, fulsome, and robust information in the future,\" according to the office's response included in filings.",
      "An attorney followed up on the Register's behalf last week, according to court filings, arguing that so-called executive privilege is not an exemption in Iowa's open records law and, even if it was, there was no indication the governor sent or received the emails. The attorney, Susan P. Elgin, called the withholding \u201clegally indefensible\u201d and asked the records be produced in a week's time.",
      "Instead, Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird sued Friday to ask the court to intervene, as Iowa law allows, and force the Register to halt its pursuit of the records. The Associated Press emailed Elgin Friday requesting comment. The Register's parent company, Gannett Co., said in an email it does not comment on pending litigation.",
      "In a statement, the governor's office said it was unfortunate that public resources would be used to defend the governor's withholding of the records.",

      "GENEVA -- The Swiss president says Switzerland is among 15 countries with which the United States plans to conduct \u201cprivileged\u201d negotiations to help reach a deal in the wake of sweeping U.S. tariffs on dozens of countries that have shaken global markets.",
      "Karin Keller-Sutter, in an interview with broadcaster SRF published Friday, said she was \u201csatisfied\u201d with talks in Washington this week that included an International Monetary Fund conference and her one-on-one meeting with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. Keller-Sutter also serves as Switzerland\u2019s finance minister.",
      "\u201cThe United States has defined a group of 15 countries with which it wants to find ... a quick solution in this tariff question. Switzerland is part of this group of these 15 countries,\u201d she told reporters separately late Thursday in Washington.",
      "It was not immediately clear which 14 other countries were included, but she told SRF that \u201cthe U.S. envisages conducting \u2014 I would say somewhat privileged \u2014 negotiations and finding solutions\u201d with that group.",
      "Before the Trump administration paused some of its most stringent tariff plans, products imported from Switzerland had been set to face tariffs of 31% \u2014 more than the 20% tariffs on goods from the European Union. Switzerland is not a member of the 27-country bloc.",
      "According to figures published by the Swiss Embassy in Washington, the U.S. has been Switzerland\u2019s most important goods export market worldwide since 2021, while Switzerland is the fourth most important export market for U.S. services. The bilateral trade volume in goods and services between Switzerland and the U.S. reached a total of $185.9 billion in 2023, the embassy says on its website.",
      "Keller-Sutter said a memorandum of understanding was to be drawn up after which negotiations can begin. A document would also lay out the most important topics, and \u201cwe have also been assigned a specific contact person. This is not easy in the U.S. administration,\u201d she was quoted as saying.",
      "\u201cThe U.S. authorities have clearly expressed their desire to find a solution with Switzerland,\u201d Keller-Sutter told SRF. She said no timetable had been set, but the two sides agreed to move forward quickly \u201cbecause uncertainty is poison for the economy.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s sweeping \u201cLiberation Day\u201d tariffs on April 2 set off turmoil in world stock markets. A week later, Trump spoke by phone with Keller-Sutter in a conversation that her office said focused on tariffs. She emphasized the \u201cimportant role of Swiss companies and investments\" in the U.S.",
      "Hours later, Trump announced the U-turn that paused the steep new tariffs on about 60 countries for 90 days, fanning speculation \u2014 which was not confirmed \u2014 in some Swiss media that her chat with Trump might have played a role in the change of course.",
      "On Thursday, Swiss Foreign Minister Ignazio Cassis, during a trip to Beijing, said the U.S. tariffs have thrust the affected countries into \u201ca sort of coalition\u201d to try to reach a deal with the United States. And on Monday, Swiss pharmaceuticals giant Roche announced plans to invest $50 billion in the U.S. over the next five years \u2014 an unspecified amount of which has already been under way.",

The bribes were allegedly in the form of financial support for Moon\u2019s son-in-law between 2018-2020.",

      "Prosecutors said they had not found evidence that Moon directly arranged political favors for Lee, but that Lee, who worked on Moon\u2019s campaign, likely expected his assistance to be repaid. Lee was later named the head of the state-funded Korea Small and Medium Enterprises and Startups Agency and was nominated by Moon\u2019s party to run for parliament while Moon was in office.",

CEOs are scrapping their earnings guidance for investors and seeking exemptions from Trump\u2019s tariffs, which hit allies such as Canada and even penguin-inhabited islands.",

The sometimes-chaotic demonstrations drew international attention for the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe\u2019s opposition to the pipeline\u2019s Missouri River crossing upstream of the tribe\u2019s reservation. The tribe has long opposed the pipeline, fearing an oil spill polluting its water supply.",
      "A trial played out over several weeks in early 2024 in federal court in Bismarck, the state capital.

The law allows reimbursement for this harm. More than that, the rule of law requires this Court to hold the United States liable to remind it of its role in the larger picture of ensuring peace, not chaos.\u201d",

      "\u201cAlthough the unlawful protest was burgeoning before everyone's eyes and the damages and dangers were so apparent, the federal government refused to offer assistance and enforce the legal obligations on the people who were encamped,\" Wrigley said.",
      "Attorneys for the government said at trial that U.S. Army Corps of Engineers officials \u201cacted reasonably given limited options at their disposal\u201d during the protests, and that the state's claim is \u201cgreatly overstated.\" The government asked the judge to find a lack of legal jurisdiction for the state's claims, that the state hasn't proven its claims and is not entitled to damages.",
      "The pipeline has been transporting oil since June 2017. Many state government officials and industry leaders support the pipeline as crucial infrastructure in the country\u2019s No. 3 oil-producing state. The pipeline carries roughly 5% of the United States' daily oil production.",
      "In 2017, the pipeline company, Energy Transfer, donated $15 million to help cover the response costs. That same year, the U.S. Justice Department gave a $10 million grant to the state for reimbursing the response. It wasn\u2019t immediately clear how that amount affected the damages.",

      "The agency shuffled through three acting directors over the course of a week. It\u2019s preparing to lose tens of thousands of workers to layoffs and voluntary retirements. And President Donald Trump is weighing in on which nonprofits should lose their tax-exempt status, an incursion into the agency\u2019s typically apolitical stance that threatens to further erode trust in federal institutions and weaponize enforcement efforts.",
      "Just three months into Trump's second term, the government's fly-under-the-radar tax collector has become the latest platform for the Republican administration\u2019s vision to cut and control the federal bureaucracy. Tax policy experts fear that taxpayer services and collection efforts will face prolonged delays as a result of the rapid changes.",
      "The quick turnover in leadership and other changes are likely to dampen employee morale at the IRS and hurt the agency\u2019s ability to serve taxpayers in a timely manner, says Janet Holtzblatt, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center.",
      "\u201cLeadership sets the tone, particularly in this environment,\u201d she said.",
      "Already, she notes, the agency has lost decades of institutional knowledge from nonpartisan career civil servants who have left over policy disagreements and layoffs.",
      "The upheaval unfolded as Americans dutifully filed their taxes ahead of the April 15 deadline and as a legion of IRS employees undertook work to process returns and dole out refunds. The latest filing season data shows the agency accepted more than 117 million returns this tax season and issued $228.7 billion in refunds.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re committed to improving the efficiency of the Internal Revenue Service,\" said the agency's newest acting commissioner, Michael Faulkender. \"For the last 35 years, we\u2019ve been five years away from the IRS being modernized. Under the direct leadership of Treasury, the modernization will be done in two years at a fraction of the cost.\u201d",
      "Meanwhile, the IRS, like other federal agencies, is hemorrhaging employees over cuts spearheaded by the Department of Government Efficiency, all while the agency churns through acting leaders as it awaits the installation of a permanent leader.",
      "Douglas O'Donnell, the Trump administration's first acting IRS commissioner, announced his retirement in February as furor spread over DOGE gaining access to IRS taxpayer data. Melanie Krause, the second acting commissioner, resigned early this month over a deal between the IRS and the Department of Homeland Security to share immigrants\u2019 tax data with Immigration and Customs Enforcement.",
      "Gary Shapley, an IRS whistleblower who testified publicly about investigations into Hunter Biden\u2019s taxes, was acting commissioner for a matter of days before being replaced by Faulkender, who was elevated just last week. The New York Times reported that Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent had complained to Trump that Shapley had been installed without his knowledge and at the behest of Trump adviser Elon Musk.",
      "Trump's nominee for IRS commissioner, former U.S. Rep. Billy Long of Missouri, is still waiting for a confirmation hearing but faces controversies of his own. Most recently, Senate Democrats have called for a criminal investigation into Long's connections to alleged tax credit loopholes. The lawmakers allege that firms connected to Long duped investors into spending millions of dollars to purchase fake tax credits. Long did not respond to an Associated Press request for comment.",
      "Among other concerns at the agency are fears that Trump will weaponize the IRS against his enemies \u2014 and reward his friends.",
      "Some of the Democratic Party\u2019s core political institutions, including fundraising platform ActBlue and the protest group Indivisible, are preparing for the possibility that the federal government may soon launch criminal investigations against them.",
      "Trump said last week at the White House that the administration is looking at the tax-exempt status of Harvard University, which has defied the government's attempts to limit activism on campus, and environmental groups. He also mentioned the ethics watchdog organization Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s supposed to be a charitable organization,\u201d Trump said of CREW. \u201cThe only charity they had is going after Donald Trump. So we\u2019re looking at that. We\u2019re looking at a lot of things.\u201d",
      "Jonathan S. Masur, an administrative law professor at the University of Chicago Law School, said it's unlawful for the president to unilaterally take away organizations' tax-exempt status.",
      "\u201cIt's illegal for starters. The Supreme Court has established that that step is not allowed,\u201d he said, adding that he anticipates that the court system will \u201cvery quickly block\u201d any such move from the president.",
      "The Trump administration is also watching out for allies of the president.",
      "Treasury official David Eisner sent an email in March to a top IRS official regarding Mike Lindell, the founder of MyPillow and one of the chief proponents of the lie that the 2020 election was stolen from Trump.",

The president \u201cis concerned that he may have been inappropriately targeted,\" Eisner wrote.",
      "Among other changes in recent weeks are concerns about the IRS' engagement with the Department of Homeland Security over enforcing a new data-sharing agreement signed earlier this month by Bessent and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. The agreement will allow ICE to submit names and addresses of immigrants inside the U.S. illegally to the IRS for cross-verification against tax records.",
      "That agreement is being litigated in federal court.",
      "U.S. District Judge Dabney Friedrich will soon decide whether to refuse or grant a preliminary injunction in a lawsuit filed by nonprofit groups.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1,016 points, or 2.7%, and the Nasdaq composite gained 2.7%. All three indexes more than made up their big losses from the start of the week.",
      "The only prediction many Wall Street strategists are willing to make is that financial markets will likely continue to veer up and down as hopes rise and fall that Trump may negotiate deals with other countries to lower his tariffs. If no such deals come quickly enough, many investors expect the economy to fall into a recession.",

      "Leading automakers are showcasing their latest designed-for-China models at the Shanghai auto show this week",
      "SHANGHAI -- Leading automakers are showcasing their latest designed-for-China and the world models at the Shanghai auto show this week, fighting not to be edged aside in the world\u2019s largest car market while watching for U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s next steps in his trade war.",
      "This year's show in the sprawling industrial outskirts of Shanghai comes at a pivotal moment. Three decades after Beijing set out to build a world-class auto industry, local manufacturers account for about two-thirds of sales inside China, and a growing share of global exports.",
      "But with U.S. President Donald Trump raising tariffs and the European Union slapping duties on Chinese electric vehicles, selling to some overseas markets is growing increasingly challenging.",
      "\u201cGeopolitics are very complex and the situation remains uncertain,\u201d Wei Jianjun, chairman of Great Wall Motors, told reporters Wednesday. \u201cBut Great Wall is always exploring investments in overseas markets.\u201d",
      "The exhibition is holding two media days and two trade days before it opens to the public on Sunday. It runs until May 2.",
      "Encouraged by government subsidies for scrapping older cars for the latest models, Chinese drivers have embraced the switch to electrics, with sales of battery powered and hybrid vehicles jumping 40% last year.",
      "A total of 31.4 million vehicles including buses and trucks were sold last year in the world\u2019s biggest market by sales, up 4.5% compared to a year earlier, the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers reported.",
      "Growth in sales of EVs was offset by falling sales of traditional gasoline and diesel-powered vehicles, which still accounted for just over half of new car sales.",
      "Chinese electric vehicle maker BYD nudged past Tesla as the world\u2019s biggest maker of EVs by sales last year, reporting revenue of over $100 billion. It recently announced an ultra fast EV charging system that it says can provide a full charge for its latest EVs within five to eight minutes, about the time needed to fill up at the pump. It plans to build more than 4,000 of the new charging stations across China.",
      "To gain access to China's potentially huge market, foreign automakers like Volkswagen, General Motors, BMW and Ford set up joint ventures with state-owned local companies beginning in the 1980s and '90s, helping them build the capacity and technology to compete on a world scale.",
      "They also created sprawling supply chains in Shanghai and other major manufacturing hubs, helping to nurture other big names in Chinese automaking, such as BYD, Geely and Great Wall Motors.",
      "With growth at home limited by brutal competition, they're expanding rapidly especially in Southeast Asia and other developing economies with relatively affordable sedans, SUVs and pickup trucks.",
      "Shanghai\u2019s auto show is a gathering for the \u201csurvival of the fittest,\u201d said Zhou Lijun, director and chief researcher of the industry analysis group Yiche Research Institute.",
      "That doesn't mean all the EV makers go it alone. BYD teamed up with Daimler, now the Mercedes-Benz Group, to launch its Denza premium brand. It's also challenging Toyota and other top tier brands with its luxury Yangwang brand, priced at up to 2 million yuan ($280,000)",
      "Opening markets wider to foreign competition has given car buyers a choice of more affordable, innovative vehicles. That's a mixed blessing for older automakers like GM, Ford, Toyota and VW that are also fighting a battle of attrition in China.",
      "\u201cChina is still a market worth fighting for,\u201d said Oliver Zipse, chairman of the BMW Group, which like other automakers highlighted a \u201cIn China, for China,\u201d approach, at \u201cChina speed.\u201d",
      "Overhanging the upbeat talk in Shanghai by both Chinese and foreign automakers of manufacturing in China for the world are Trump's tariffs of up to 145% on Chinese goods, despite a 90-day pause that has spared many other countries, and 25% U.S. tax on imported cars and auto parts.",
      "Japanese automaker Nissan Motor Co.'s head of China operations, Stephen Ma, said the company plans to make 10 new battery electric or hybrid models by 2027 in China, for China and for \u201cexport to the world, except one country \u2014 you can guess which one.\"",
      "Higher U.S. and European tariffs on foreign-made EVs are prompting Chinese newcomers to shift production closer to those markets as more Western consumers opt for the latest Chinese models.",
      "Just a few decades ago, Nissan, Toyota and other Japanese automakers were fighting trade friction with the United States over their own exports. Now, they employ hundreds of thousands of U.S. workers at their U.S. factories.",
      "\u201cThe trade war between China and the United States has blocked direct exports from China to the United States, but it hasn't blocked local production there or the establishment of global production bases in Europe or elsewhere,\" Zhou said.",
      "A report by the Rhodium Group shows that nearly half the world's markets are restricting imports from China, in part because of national security concerns linked to the advanced electronics in EVs and other high-tech vehicles. A minority of countries like Australia and South Africa remain relatively open, and Russia is a major market but is nearly saturated, it says.",
      "Chinese automakers lag behind global leaders like Toyota in conventional gasoline and diesel fueled vehicles, but they can sell EVs at roughly the same price, while also solving the problems of range and fast charging.",
      "China has become part of what geopolitical analyst Yanmei Xie described as a \u201ctechnological paradigm shift\u201d in a commentary in the Japanese financial publication Nikkei Asia. Automakers in China are going electric not just because of the green transition, but as a route to \u201ctechnological and industrial dominance,\u201d she wrote.",
      "EV makers in China have benefited from not having huge legacy operations that have to make the transition, said Stefan Sielaff, vice president of global design for EV maker Zeekr Group, part of Geely's stable of brands. Founded in 2021, it's selling cars in more than 80 markets including in Europe.",
      "\u201cThey can immediately react to market demand, to customer demand, and can deliver very, very fast,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have done most of these cars in two years. From 0 to 100 in two years.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "A federal review of helicopter safety around some of the busiest U.S. airports has revealed dangerous flying conditions at the Las Vegas airport",
      "A federal review of helicopter safety around some of the busiest U.S. airports, prompted by the deadly midair collision in January between a passenger jet and Army helicopter in Washington, D.C., revealed dangerous flying conditions at the Las Vegas airport.",
      "The Federal Aviation Administration said Tuesday the potential for a collision between air tour helicopters and planes at Harry Reid International Airport led the agency to make immediate changes to flying rules. In the first three weeks after implementation the number of collision alerts for planes dropped 30%.",
      "The FAA said after the collision between an American Airlines jet and an Army Black Hawk helicopter in January, which killed 67 people, that it planned to use artificial intelligence to dig into the millions of reports it collects to assess other places with busy helicopter traffic, including Boston, New York, Baltimore-Washington, Detroit, Chicago, Dallas, Houston, Los Angeles and along the Gulf Coast.",
      "The FAA\u2019s acting administrator, Chris Rocheleau, said Las Vegas quickly became a concern once the agency dug into the data because agreements with helicopter operators there didn\u2019t clearly define vertical and lateral separation requirements when helicopters were approaching the airport. And air traffic controllers in the tower weren\u2019t issuing traffic advisories between returning helicopters and airplanes.",
      "\u201cWe took quick action including exercising positive control over the helicopters and issuing more traffic advisories to pilots,\u201d Rocheleau said. He promised to take additional actions in Las Vegas and at other airports where the FAA identifies concerns.",
      "Luke Nimmo, a spokesperson for Clark County Department of Aviation, referred all questions about the findings to the FAA.",
      "Following the crash of a New York City sightseeing helicopter into the Hudson River that killed six people April 10, the FAA said it was establishing a rulemaking committee to develop recommendations for improving commercial air tour safety.",
      "Jeff Guzzetti, a former National Transportation Safety Board and FAA accident investigator, said the fact that collision alerts for planes dropped so quickly \u201cindicates a real hazard existed before the FAA looked at this.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s tough to characterize how significant the hazard was,\" he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s yet another hole in the Swiss cheese that can line up with other holes and cause an accident just like what happened in Washington, D.C.\u201d",
      "He said it made sense that the FAA first addressed the Las Vegas airport, given its large mix of helicopters and commercial traffic.",
      "\u201cI think that they will find issues at other airports, but maybe not to the degree that they found with this one,\u201d Guzzetti added.",
      "Former NTSB Chairman Jim Hall said there have long been safety issues with the helicopter tour industry, describing it as slipping in many cases into \u201cbecoming an attraction rather than a safe ride.\u201d",
      "\u201cUnfortunately in aviation, it is accidents that bring the attention of the regulators to their responsibilities,\" he added.",
      "The January midair collision near Washington's Ronald Reagan National Airport was the deadliest aviation disaster in the United States since 2001. A series of other crashes and near misses in the months since have raised worries about air travel, even though it remains safe overall.",
      "Helicopters have been a key concern, but Rocheleau said the core safety issues remain operations and maintenance problems. He said the top causes of helicopter accidents include loss of control and striking an object during low-altitude operations.",
      "The FAA said its review of the safety data has expanded beyond helicopters to look at airports with a mix of many different planes and airports that are close together.",
      "The proximity between Hollywood Burbank Airport and Van Nuys Airport in the Los Angeles area emerged as a concern because they are less than 10 miles (16 kilometers) apart. Both airports serve a wide mix of aircraft and have arrival and departure paths that are close.",
      "A spokesperson for the Hollywood Burbank Airport referred questions to the FAA. The Van Nuys Airport didn't immediately respond to an email requesting comment.",
      "\u201cWhile flying remains the safest mode of transportation, we must always strive to do better,\u201d Rocheleau said. \u201cWe have to identify trends and get smarter about how we use data. And when we put corrective actions in place, we must execute them.\u201d",
      "Aviation lawyer Robert Clifford, who represents several families of victims of the D.C. plane crash, praised the FAA for taking action to make helicopter flights safer.",
      "\u201cAs a frequent critic of the FAA, I must say that the FAA deserves recognition for taking these steps to protect the traveling public,\" he said. \"Helicopters are known for being the most dangerous and potentially unsafe aircraft. The extra vigilance by the FAA may save many lives.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "The outlook for the U.S. and global economies this year and next has significantly worsened in the wake of President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs and the uncertainty they have created",
      "WASHINGTON -- The outlooks for the U.S. and global economies have significantly worsened in the wake of President Donald Trump's tariffs and the uncertainty they have created, the International Monetary Fund said Tuesday.",
      "The IMF said that the global economy will grow just 2.8% this year, down from its forecast in January of 3.3%, according to its latest World Economic Outlook. And in 2026, global growth will be 3%, the fund predicts, also below its previous 3.3% estimate.",
      "U.S. economic growth will come in at just 1.8% this year, down sharply from its previous forecast of 2.7% and a full percentage point below its 2024 expansion. The IMF doesn't expect a U.S. recession, though it has raised its odds of one this year from 25% to 37%.",
      "The forecasts are largely in line with many private-sector economists' expectations, though some do fear a recession is increasingly likely. Economists at JPMorgan say the chances of a U.S. recession are now 60%. The Federal Reserve has also forecast that growth will weaken this year, to 1.7%.",
      "\u201cWe are entering a new era,\u201d Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, chief economist at the IMF, said. \u201cThis global economic system that has operated for the last eighty years is being reset.\u201d",
      "The IMF is a 191-nation lending organization that works to promote economic growth and financial stability and to reduce global poverty.",
      "Gourinchas said that the heightened uncertainty around the import taxes led the IMF to take the unusual step of preparing several different scenarios for future growth. Its forecasts were finalized April 4, after the Trump administration announced sweeping tariffs on nearly 60 countries along with nearly-universal 10% duties.",
      "Those duties were paused April 9 for 90 days. Gourinchas said the pause didn\u2019t substantially change the IMF\u2019s forecasts because the U.S. and China have imposed such steep tariffs on each other since then.",
      "The uncertainty surrounding the Trump administration\u2019s next moves will also likely weigh heavily on the U.S. and global economies, the IMF said. Companies may pull back on investment and expansion as they wait to see how the trade policies play out, which can slow growth.",
      "China is also forecast to grow more slowly because of U.S. tariffs. The IMF now expects it will expand 4% this year and next, down roughly half a point from its previous forecasts.",
      "While the U.S. economy will likely suffer a \u201csupply shock,\u201d similar to what hampered during the pandemic and which pushed up inflation in 2021 and 2022, Gourinchas said, China is expected to experience reduced demand as U.S. purchases of its exports fall.",
      "Inflation will likely worsen in the United States, rising to about 3% by the end of this year, while it will be little changed in China, the IMF forecast.",
      "The European Union is forecast to grow more slowly, but the hit from tariffs is not as large, in part because it is facing lower U.S. duties than China. In addition, some of the hit from tariffs will be offset by stronger government spending by Germany.",
      "The economies of the 27 countries that use the euro are forecast to expand 0.8% this year and 1.2% next year, down just 0.2% in both years from the IMF\u2019s January forecast.",
      "Japan\u2019s growth forecast has been marked down to 0.6% this year and next, 0.5% and 0.2% lower than in January, respectively.",

    "story": [
      "Colorado captain Gabriel Landeskog scored his first NHL goal in nearly three years in the second period of Game 4 against Dallas in a 4-0 win",
      "DENVER -- DENVER (AP) \u2014 Colorado captain Gabriel Landeskog took a moment \u2014 a few even \u2014 to let the reality that he scored his first NHL goal in nearly three years sink in.",
      "It was all so much to absorb \u2014 his teammates mobbing him on the ice, his good friend Nathan MacKinnon bear-hugging him on the bench, the crowd thunderously chanting his name.",
      "These were all things he wasn't sure he'd ever experience again as he worked his way back from a chronically injured right knee.",
      "\u201cThere were moments of doubt,\" said Landeskog, who also had an assist as the Avalanche beat the Dallas Stars 4-0 on Saturday night in Game 4 to tie the first-round series. \"I think it would be foolish not to take a second and enjoy it and really soak it in.",
      "\"The most reflection will probably come when it\u2019s all said and done one day, and you understand what the journey has been like, and the ups and downs and the great days and great games and what-not. But for now, yeah, you enjoy it.\u201d",
      "It was almost a surreal scene when Landeskog's second-period snap shot found the back of the net after a pass from Brock Nelson. The crowd instantly erupted and Landeskog's teammates on the ice rushed over to celebrate. The Avalanche bench was elated, too, as he passed through for glove taps \u2014 and eventually that bear hug from MacKinnon.",
      "This was Landeskog's first goal since June 20, 2022, against Tampa Bay in the Stanley Cup Final. He helped the Avalanche hoist the Cup six days later.",
      "The 32-year-old Landeskog was sidelined for three regular seasons. He made his return in Game 3 \u2014 some 1,032 days since his last NHL game.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s amazing how quickly he\u2019s picked up. It\u2019s crazy, honestly. It\u2019s beyond all of our expectations,\u201d MacKinnon said. \"I was kind of laughing in my head, but he\u2019s like, \u2019I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a difference between a month off or three years off.' And I was thinking, like, \u2018Hmm, whatever. OK.\u2019 But he was right. It looks like he\u2019s been out for four weeks.",
      "\u201cIt just shows if you\u2019re good at hockey, you\u2019re good at hockey. He can come back and he\u2019s one of our best players out there. It\u2019s amazing. We missed him.\u201d",
      "Landeskog\u2019s injury traces back to the 2020 \u201cbubble\u201d season when he was accidentally sliced above the knee by the skate of teammate Cale Makar in a playoff game against Dallas. Landeskog eventually underwent a cartilage transplant procedure on May 10, 2023, with no timetable for a return \u2014 or even if he could return.",
      "\u201cIt was kind of more than just a playoff goal,\u201d MacKinnon said. \u201cI think it was a life goal. It meant a lot to all of us for him to score a goal, and then he had an assist.\u201d",
      "After the game, his teammates made Landeskog wear the oversized Avalanche hat, which is part of the celebration to recognize the team's top player in a win. To think, that particular celebration was his idea.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been quite entertaining seeing guys put it on and wear it and look quite silly,\u201d said Landeskog, whose team plays Game 5 on Monday in Dallas. \u201cAnd then I got to put it on and guys always joke about how big my head is, so it was quite snug on me. But it was fun to finally put it on, no doubt.\u2019\u2019",
      "He remains at a loss to explain all of this.",
      "\u201cEvery day, you\u2019re trying to improve, no matter if that\u2019s in the gym or on the ice or whatever,\" said Landeskog, who logged 14:37 of ice time Saturday and had three shots. \"There\u2019s no difference now that I\u2019m healthy and back in the lineup.",
      "\"This morning, I woke up and it\u2019s just no excuses. I don\u2019t want to make this about me missing X-amount of days or whatever. It\u2019s a huge playoff game for us, a must-win here at home and and I think our team played that way, and played real hard and real well. I think I was no different than anybody else tonight. I thought we all brought our \u2018A\u2019 game.\u201d",

      "Edge Jalon Walker (15) was a top-10 projection who\u2019ll boost the pass rush. Trading up to get edge James Pearce Jr. (26) could have the same impact on Atlanta\u2019s defense as the Eagles got after taking CBs Quinyon Mitchell and DeJean last season. S Xavier Watts (96) fits coach Raheem Morris\u2019 scheme. S Billy Bowman Jr. (118) has to be more consistent at the next level.",
      "S Malaki Starks (27) is mature, talented and can thrive on a team that knows how to develop safeties. Edge Mike Green Jr. (59) is excellent value. He was a first-round projection who slipped due to off-field concerns. OT Emery Jones Jr. (91) and LB Teddye Buchanan (129) are possible Day 3 steals.",
      "CB Maxwell Hairston (30) brings energy and aggressive coverage skills to a secondary that needed the help. DL T.J. Sanders (41) will boost run defense. Edge Landon Jackson (72), DL Deone Walker (109) and CB Jordan Hancock (170) provide more depth for Buffalo\u2019s defense.",
      "WR Tetairoa McMillan (8) went earlier than expected for a guy with some question marks who\u2019s loaded with talent. Edges Nic Scourton (51) and Princely Umanmielen (77) are excellent value picks and should make an immediate impact on a defense that needs pass rushers. RB Trevor Ettiene (114) can make plays. TE Mitchell Evans (163) is a nice addition. S Lathan Ransom (122) and DL Cam Jackson (140) deepen the defensive depth.",

OT Ozzy Trapilo (77) is mammoth (6-foot-8, 315) and has high upside. DL Shemar Turner (62), LB Ruben Hyppolite II (132) and CB Zah Frazier (169) are Day 3 value.",
      "Edge Shemar Stewart (17) is raw but immensely talented and provides help for a defense that needs it. LB Demetrius Knight Jr. (49) can play right away and LB Barrett Carter (119) has potential. Added depth on the offensive line with G Dylan Fairchild (81) and LG Jalen Rivers (153). Running back Tahj Brooks (193) could be a steal in the sixth round.",

S Jaylen Reed (187) is good value. QB Graham Mertz (197) has backup potential.",

OT Jonah Monheim (221) is a sleeper in the seventh. So is RB LeQuint Allen (236).",
      "Got tremendous value with OT Josh Simmons (32). DL Omarr Norman-Lott (63) and edge Ashton Gillotte (66) bolster the pass rush instantly.

      "RB Omarion Hampton (22) fits Jim Harbaugh\u2019s style. WR Tre Harris (55) gives Justin Herbert another playmaker. DL Jamaree Caldwell (86) has upside and edge Kyle Kennard (125) went too early. WR KeAndre Lambert-Smith (158) is a Day 3 highlight.",
      "Traded out of the first round, added more draft capital and landed three excellent picks to start: TE Terrance Ferguson (46), edge Josaiah Stewart (90) and RB Jarquez Hunter (117). DL Ty Hamilton (148) and LB Chris Paul Jr. (172) have potential.",
      "DT Kenneth Grant (13) fills an immediate need. So does G Jonah Savaiinaea (37). DT Jordan Phillips (143), CB Jason Marshall Jr. and S Dante Trader Jr. (155) stock up the defensive side. QB Quinn Ewers (231) is strong value in the seventh round.",
      "G Donovan Jackson (24) is versatile and determined. WR Tai Felton (102) could shine with Justin Jefferson drawing most of the attention. LB Kobe King (201) was their best Day 3 pick. Edge Tyrion Ingram-Dawkins adds depth at a position of strength.",
      "OT Will Campbell (4) had the quote of the draft when he said he\u2019d \u201cfight and die\u201d to protect Drake Maye. RB TreVeyon Henderson may have been available in the third round. WR Kyle Williams (69) could be a third-round steal. S Craig Woodson (106), DL Joshua Farmer (137) and edge Bradyn Swinson (146) are the highlights of a solid Day 3 haul.",
      "Versatile OT Kelvin Banks Jr. (9) fills a need. Passed up Shedeur Sanders and made Tyler Shough (40) the third QB selected earlier than projected. DL Vernon Broughton (71) and S Jonas Sanker (93) were solid additions. RB Devin Neal (184) stands out among the Day 3 picks.",
      "Got premier edge rusher Abdul Carter (3) and traded back into the first round to snag QB Jaxson Dart (25) a round early. DL Darius Alexander (65), RB Cam Skattebo (105) and OT Marcus Mbow (154) were high value in rounds 3-4-5. TE Thomas Fidone II (219) is a seventh-rounder with potential to be a playmaker.",
      "OT Armand Membou (7) fills a big void but may have been able to trade down, add draft capital and still address the position. TE Mason Taylor has the genes. CB Azareye\u2019h Thomas (73) will benefit playing under Aaron Glenn. WR Arian Smith (110) is a burner. CB Malachi Moore (130) and edge Tyler Baron (176) could be major contributors.",
      "Made plenty of moves, as usual, and emphasized a defense that ranked No. 1 last season and dominated the Chiefs in the Super Bowl. LB Jihad Campbell (31) was projected to go in the middle of Round 1. S Andrew Mukuba (64) helps fill a need. So does DT Ty Robinson (111). CB Mac McWilliams (145) and LB Smael Mondon Jr. (161) provide more depth.",
      "DT Derrick Harmon (21) fits the scheme nicely. RB Kaleb Johnson (83) has playmaker potential. Edge Jack Sawyer (123) is a Day 3 highlight. CB Yahya Black (164) and LB Carson Bruener are solid value picks. Finally took a QB and came away with a winner in Will Howard (185).",
      "Edge Mykel Williams (11) could shine opposite Nick Bosa. DL Alfred Collins (43) plugs a need in the middle of the defensive line. LB Nick Martin (75) needs more development. CB Upton Stout is smallish but fast. DL CJ West (113) and S Marques Sigle (160) are among their Day 3 highlights.",
      "OL Grey Zabel (18) can play anywhere and the offensive line needs help. S Nick Emmanwori (35) has first-round talent. TE Elijah Arroyo (50), QB Jalen Milroe (92), DL Rylie Mills (142) and WR Tory Horton (166) are strong value picks. So is RB Damien Martinez (223) in the seventh round.",
      "Passed up edge rushers to bolster a strength with WR Emeka Egbuka (19). CB Benjamin Morrison (30) was a first-round projection. CB Jacob Parrish (84) and edge rushers David Walker (121) and Elijah Roberts (157) have high upside. WR Tez Johnson (235) adds depth in an excellent receiver room.",
      "Needed time to be sure they wanted Cam Ward No. 1 overall after exploring options. If he doesn\u2019t pan out, it sets the organization back. Edge Oluwafemi Oladejo (52) and S Kevin Winston Jr. (82) immediately boost the defense. WR Elic Ayomanor (136) and Chimere Dike (103) give Ward more options. RB Kalel Mullings (188) is among a strong Day 3 class.",
      "OT Josh Conerly Jr. (29) upgrades the Jayden Daniels\u2019 protection. CB Trey Amos (61) could be an immediate starter. WR Jaylin Lane (128) and LB Kain Medrano (205) are high value picks. RB Jacory Croskey-Merritt (245) has sleep potential.",

      "Former Florida defensive tackle Desmond Watson, a 6-foot-6, 464-pound prospect, is signing with his hometown Tampa Bay Buccaneers as an undrafted free agent.",
      "Watson, who grew up in Plant City about 20 miles east of Tampa, announced the move on social media. He had been hoping to get selected in the later rounds of the NFL draft on Saturday. He would have become the heaviest pick in NFL history. But no team gambled on the supersized run-stopper.",
      "The Bucs, though, took a chance by signing him after the draft ended. He will get $50,000 guaranteed, the Athletic reported, including a $20,000 signing bonus.",
      "Watson wowed NFL scouts last month by repping 225 pounds a whopping 36 times, which topped any bench-press performance at this year\u2019s combine. He covered the 40-yard dash in 5.93 seconds and recorded 25 inches in the vertical jump.",
      "He looked winded during position drills, not all that surprising given Florida had just four defensive linemen in the rotation. But his size and strength \u2014 his weight, really \u2014 stood out during perhaps the most important day in his professional journey.",
      "\u201cDez, obviously, he\u2019s a unicorn,\u201d Gators coach Billy Napier said. \u201cYou\u2019ll go the rest of your career and you\u2019ll never be around a guy that\u2019s that stature. And then you get to know Dez. He\u2019s extremely intelligent. He\u2019s got a great sense of humor. He was a great teammate.",
      "\u201cHe'll get his shot, and I\u2019m hoping he\u2019ll make the most of it.\u201d",
      "Watson stepping on the scale was as eye-popping as his bench press. He was listed at 449 pounds last season, up from 435 pounds as a junior and 415 pounds as a sophomore. He\u2019s had to manage his weight since he first stepped foot on campus in 2021, when then-Florida coach Dan Mullen called him \u201ca 385-pound athlete.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s had numerous nutritionists, numerous position coaches, numerous strength coaches, and I think this past year we probably executed the best we have,\u201d Napier said. \u201cAnd I thought he played his best football of his career. In general, I think he\u2019s learned a lot about habit-building, self-discipline.",
      "\u201cUltimately, the guy\u2019s frame score would indicate that he\u2019s going to be a huge \u2014 that number\u2019s always going to be pretty big. He\u2019s 6-foot-6 and just the density, the bone structure. It\u2019s just a big man.\u201d",
      "Watson never missed a game in his four seasons in Gainesville. His highlights, though, are few and far between. He rag-dolled South Florida running back Brian Battie in 2022 and ripped the ball out of South Carolina running back Jaheim Bell\u2019s hands for a forced fumble and a fumble return later that year. Watson probably would have scored had quarterback Spencer Rattler missed an open-field tackle.",
      "Watson, the ultimate space-eater, finished his collegiate career with 63 tackles and 1 1/2 sacks. He also carried the ball for a 1-yard gain and lined up at fullback for a few more plays against Tulane in the Gasparilla Bowl in December.",

      "It's not just science that is working against these patients, it's market forces. Drug companies are naturally going to look for medications that target the most common mutations.",
      "\u201cYou need a sufficiently large number of patients in a major market in order for a company to be interested in going forward,\u201d said Dr. Kiran Musunuru, a University of Pennsylvania gene editing expert. What it amounts to, he says, is \"mutational discrimination.\u201d",
      "Charities \u2013 including a nonprofit Kramer-Golinkoff co-founded called Emily\u2019s Entourage \u2013 are trying to overcome this barrier. Fundraising efforts have helped jump-start gene therapy that could help patients regardless of mutation.",
      "While it likely won't be available for years, \u201cjust to have these therapies in trials provides so much hope,\u201d Kramer-Golinkoff said.",
      "Kramer-Golinkoff was just six weeks old when she was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis, which causes thick, sticky mucus to build up in the body.",
      "It occurs when the so-called CFTR protein is not made or not made correctly, allowing chloride to become trapped in cells, meaning water can't keep the cell's surface hydrated. Mucus buildup can lead to damage, blockages and infections in the lungs and other affected organs.",
      "\u201cAs I\u2019ve gotten older \u2026 my CF has gotten worse, despite all my best efforts to delay it,\u201d Kramer-Golinkoff said.",
      "Before her illness got so bad, she was able to earn a master\u2019s degree in bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania, work, travel and spend time with friends. But she eventually developed CF-related diabetes and other problems. She\u2019s prone to infections, and since the pandemic has lived with her parents in isolation in Greater Philadelphia.",
      "\u201cCF is a real monster of a disease,\u201d she said.",
      "Meanwhile, others with the condition have seen vast improvements in their health with \u201cCFTR modulator\u201d therapies that work for people with the most common mutation, correcting the malfunctioning protein. Research shows they dramatically improve lung function, respiratory symptoms and patients\u2019 overall quality of life.",
      "Besides not working for people with rare mutations, these treatments are unavailable to patients whose disease-causing mutations aren't known or fully understood. Mutations may be unknown because of a lack of genetic testing in places such as developing nations, or understudied because they are uncommon or difficult to detect.",
      "Genetic testing companies such as GeneDx have made some headway in screening more people of diverse backgrounds, but inequities remain.",
      "For example, comprehensive data about cystic fibrosis is scarce among African populations \u2013 affecting people who live on the continent as well as those who trace their ancestry there. Research shows Black cystic fibrosis patients are more likely than their white counterparts to be among the 10% who don\u2019t benefit from modulator therapies.",
      "While there\u2019s little chance of changing market dynamics, researchers said, one solution is to develop \u201cmutation agnostic\u201d gene therapies targeting all patients with a disease. This approach is being tried in diseases of the retina as well as cystic fibrosis.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a huge push to develop these therapies,\" said Dr. Garry Cutting of the Johns Hopkins Cystic Fibrosis Center.",
      "Most of the 14 experimental gene therapies in the pipeline for the disease aim to help patients with any mutation, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation says, delivering a new, correct version of the CFTR gene to cells. Getting correct copies of the CFTR gene would enable cells to make normal proteins no matter what mutation causes a patient to have no, or not enough, functional CFTR proteins.",
      "One treatment, partially funded by the foundation, is sponsored by Spirovant Sciences, a company Emily\u2019s Entourage provided seed money to launch. The first patient received the therapy in November in a 53-week clinical trial at Columbia University that aims to determine if it's safe and how long it stays in the lung.",
      "Kramer-Golinkoff said she\u2019s more optimistic about her future these days, even as her own illness worsens. At this point, she\u2019s living with 30% lung function, suffers from kidney issues and has high blood pressure in her lungs. She depends on insulin for her diabetes and takes numerous pills daily.",
      "\u201cYou have to make really conscientious choices ... throughout the day on how to use your limited energy. And that\u2019s really difficult to do when you have big dreams and important work and life to live,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re incredibly excited about the promise of gene therapies. They can\u2019t come soon enough.\u201d",

      "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- A lawsuit against Florida's ban on \u201clab-grown\u201d meat is still alive after a federal judge tossed four parts of the suit on Friday but kept a fifth.",
      "Northern District of Florida Chief Judge Mark Walker declined to dismiss a part of the lawsuit that argued Florida's restrictions give an unconstitutional advantage to Florida farmers over out-of-state competitors. Meanwhile, the judge sided with state attorneys seeking to dismiss the lawsuit and their argument that federal approval of cultivated chicken doesn't mean individual states can't ban it.",
      "U.S. regulators first signed off on the sale of what\u2019s known as \u201ccell-cultured\u201d or \u201ccell-cultivated\u201d meat in June 2023. The lawsuit had argued that Florida\u2019s law is preempted under federal laws that regulate the interstate market for meat and poultry products. Sellers say the product is a more ethical and sustainable alternative to conventionally raised chicken, beef and pork.",
      "But lawmakers in Florida, Alabama and Mississippi have called cultivated meat a threat to their states\u2019 agriculture industries and banned the sale of the product, which is made of animal cells that are fed a mix of proteins, vitamins and water and then formed into nuggets, sausages and steaks.",
      "The lawsuit was filed last year by Upside Foods, represented by the nonprofit law firm the Institute for Justice.",
      "\u201cUpside is not looking to replace conventional meat, which will always have a place at the table,\u201d Upside CEO Uma Valeti said in a statement. \"All we are asking for is the right to compete, so that Floridians can try our product and see that it is possible to have delicious meat without the need for slaughtering animals. Today\u2019s ruling is an important step toward securing that right.\u201d",
      "The governor's office and the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services didn't immediately respond to emails seeking comment about the lawsuit.",
      "Gov. Ron DeSantis was flanked by cattle farmers last May when he signed the state\u2019s cultivated meat ban into law.",
      "\u201cWe stand with agriculture, we stand with the cattle ranchers, we stand with our farmers because we understand it\u2019s important for the backbone of the state,\u201d DeSantis said. \u201cTake your fake lab-grown meat elsewhere.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "X, the social media platform owned by Trump adviser Elon Musk, is challenging the constitutionality of a Minnesota ban on using deepfakes to influence elections and harm candidates",
      "MINNEAPOLIS -- X Corp., the social media platform owned by Trump adviser Elon Musk, is challenging the constitutionality of a Minnesota ban on using deepfakes to influence elections and harm candidates, saying it violates First Amendment speech protections.",
      "The company's federal lawsuit filed this week also contends that the 2023 state law is preempted by a 1996 federal statute that shields social media from being held responsible for material posted on their platforms.",
      "\u201cWhile the law's reference to banning \u2018deep fakes\u2019 might sound benign, in reality it would criminalize innocuous, election-related speech, including humor, and make social-media platforms criminally liable for censoring such speech,\" the company said in a statement. \u201cInstead of defending democracy, this law would erode it.\u201d",
      "Minnesota's law imposes criminal penalties \u2014 including jail time \u2014 for disseminating a deepfake video, image or audio if a person knows it's fake, or acts with reckless disregard to its authenticity, either within 90 days before a party nominating convention, or after the start of early voting in a primary or general election.",
      "It says the intent must be to injure a candidate or influence an election result. And it defines deepfakes as material so realistic that a reasonable person would believe it's real, and generated by artificial intelligence or other technical means.",
      "\u201cElon Musk funneled hundreds of millions of dollars into the 2024 presidential election and tried to buy a Wisconsin Supreme Court seat,\" said the law's author, Democratic state Sen. Erin Maye Quade.",
      "\"Of course he is upset that Minnesota law prevents him from spreading deepfakes that meant to harm candidates and influence elections. Minnesota\u2019s law is clear and precise, while this lawsuit is petty, misguided and a waste of the Attorney General Office\u2019s time and resources,\u201d her statement said.",
      "Democratic Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison's office, which is legally obligated to defend the constitutionality of state laws in court, said in a statement that it's \u201creviewing the lawsuit and will respond in the appropriate time and manner.\u201d",
      "The Minnesota law was already the subject of a constitutional challenge by Christopher Kohls, a content creator, and GOP state Rep. Mary Franson, who likes to post AI-generated parodies of politicians. That case is on hold while they appeal to overturn a judge's denial of their request to suspend the law.",
      "The attorney general's office argues in that case that deepfakes are a real and growing threat to free elections and democratic institutions, that the law is a legitimate and constitutional response to the problem, and that it contains important limitations on its scope that protect satire and parody.",
      "X, formerly known as Twitter, said it's the only social media platform challenging the Minnesota law, and that it has also challenged other laws it considers infringements of free speech, such as a 2024 California political deepfakes law that a judge has blocked.",
      "X said in its statement that its \u201cCommunity Notes\u201d feature allows users to flag content they consider problematic, and that it's been adopted by Facebook, YouTube and TikTok. The company's lawsuit said its \u201cAuthenticity Policy\u201d and \u201cGrok AI\u201d tool provide additional safeguards.",
      "Alan Rozenshtein, a University of Minnesota law professor and expert on technology law, said in an interview Friday that it's important to separate the free-speech issues from whatever one thinks about the controversial Musk.",
      "\u201cI'm almost positive that this will be struck down,\u201d Rozenshtein said.",
      "There's no exception under the First Amendment for false or misleading political speech, even lies, he said. And the potential for criminal penalties gives social media companies like X and Facebook \u201can incentive to take down anything that might be a deepfake. ... You're going to censor a massive amount to comply with this law.\u201d",
      "Deepfakes aren't good, but it would be nice to get evidence that they're causing actual problems before imposing such limits on free speech, the professor said. And while it's easy to focus on the supply of misinformation, the large demand for it is the problem.",
      "\u201cPeople want to be fooled, and it's very bad for our democracy, but it\u2019s not something I think can be solved with a deepfakes ban,\" he said.",

      "Google\u2019s first-quarter performance illustrated the continuing power of its long-dominant search engine in a sea of uncertainty. While grappling with competitive threats emerging as artificial intelligence reshapes technology, Google is also battling court decisions condemning its search engine and digital ad network as illegal monopolies.",

      "Google's long-dominant search engine is countering the new competition with a feature called AI Overviews that appear above web links in its results. It is also testing a conversational tool called AI Mode that would usher in an even more radical change to its business model.",
      "\u201cThe company delivered a sound response to those questioning the solidity of the search business amid ever-increasing AI demand,\u201d Investing.com analyst Thomas Monteiro said.",
      "But Google is trying to keep its business intact as by the U.S. Justice Department attempts to break up the company and impose other restraints after a federal judge last year branded its search engine an illegal monopoly. To make matters worse, its digital ad network also was found to be illegally abusing its power earlier this month in another case brought by the Justice Department.",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s trade war has injected more uncertainty into the mix by rattling the financial markets amid fears the tariffs will reignite inflation while dragging the economy into a recession. Although Google\u2019s digital services aren\u2019t directly impacted by the tariffs, a recession would likely curtail the spending on ads that generate most of Alphabet\u2019s revenue.",
      "But there were few signs of a slowdown in the past quarter. Google's ad revenue during the period totaled $72.5 billion, an 11% increase from the same time a year ago.",
      "The steady growth emboldened Alphabet to stand firm on plans to invest $75 billion on AI and other technologies this year while also pursuing approval of a $32 billion deal to buy cybersecurity firm Wiz.",

      "These generally are not state-run giants like SAIC, BAIC and Guangzhou Automotive. The founder of Geely started out making refrigerators.",
      "BYD first built up its expertise in battery technology, now its biggest advantage as the world\u2019s largest-selling EV maker. Some others are technology companies allied with automakers to offer autonomous driving.",
      "Here are some of the key players:",
      "Great Wall Motors, with the Haval, Wey, Ora, Poer and Tank brands, is banking on overseas sales to keep growing after seeing its sales inside China fall by nearly 15% last year, even as the company\u2019s net profit jumped more than 80%. The company has factories in Russia, Thailand and Brazil, where it is challenging Toyota\u2019s popular Hilux pickup truck with its GWM Poer, a hybrid pickup of its own. Another mainstay is the Haval H6, a hybrid sports SUV.",
      "Great Wall has smoothed its transition to overseas production by buying factories of other automakers. In Thailand, it took over a factory formerly operated by General Motors Corp. In Brazil, it purchased a former Mercedes-Benz plant.",
      "\u201cIt is essential for volume to be big, otherwise the cost of production is too high,\u201d Great Wall\u2019s chairman, Wei Jianjun, said in a media huddle at the show. Wei, who also goes by the name Jack Wey, was born in Beijing but moved to nearby Hebei, home of the Great Wall. He led the company\u2019s transition from vehicle modification to automaking, becoming China\u2019s biggest maker of pickup trucks and a leading SUV maker. The company has a joint venture for EVs with BMW.",
      "State-owned Chery Automobile says it was the first Chinese automaker to export overseas. It has sold more than 15 million of its Chery, Exeed, Omoda and Jetour models overseas, mostly in the developing world and emerging markets, including Turkey and Ukraine. Chery reported selling 2.6 million vehicles overseas last year and is aiming for 3 million in 2025. It\u2019s quickly expanding overseas production, setting up factories in Russia and Spain. It is expanding rapidly in Latin America.",
      "Chery\u2019s tie-up with EV-maker Visionary Vehicles aimed to sell in North America but has not yet achieved that goal. The company has a 50-50 joint venture with Jaguar Land Rover, which is a subsidiary of Tata Motors of India that makes Jaguars and Land Rovers in China. It also collaborates with Huawei Technologies and e-commerce giant Alibaba.",
      "Chery still sells far more fuel-engine cars than EVs. Its battery electric vehicle company, Chery New Energy, makes minivehicles like the eQ1, or Small Ant, and the QQ Ice Cream. Its mainstays are the Tiggo lineup of SUVs and its Arrizo sedans.",
      "BYD made more electric vehicles last year than Tesla, selling 3.52 million EVs in China, up 28% from a year earlier. Its strength in plug-in hybrids has helped as Chinese increasingly opt for the fallback of a fuel engine.",
      "The company, based in southern China's Shenzhen, recently announced an ultra-fast EV charging system it says can provide a full charge for its latest EVs within five to eight minutes, about as long as a fill-up. It plans to build more than 4,000 of the new charging stations across China.",
      "The Chinese company started out making batteries and has been refining its battery and energy storage technology while building an auto empire that is expanding outside China.",
      "While BYD\u2019s fanciest, latest premium models are expected to sell for up to about $40,000, it also makes much less expensive EVs including the Seagull, which sells for around $12,000 in China.",
      "BYD barely nudged ahead of Tesla in production of battery-powered EVs in 2024, making 1,777,965 compared with Tesla\u2019s 1,773,443.",
      "Geely Auto is perhaps the most famous Chinese automaker that many people have never heard of. The privately held company was founded as a refrigerator-maker by businessman Li Shufu in 1997 in eastern China\u2019s Taizhou, which early on became a hub of private industry.",
      "Li began making strategic overseas acquisitions early on, buying Sweden\u2019s Volvo Car Co. from Ford Motor in 2010. Geely's purchase of a 49.9% stake in Malaysia\u2019s Proton gave it a 51% stake in luxury sports car brand Lotus. It formed a 50-50 joint venture to make Smart city cars with Germany\u2019s Daimler AG. It also works with Renault SA of France on powertrains and owns a stake in Aston Martin Lagonda.",
      "In March, it launched sales of its Geely EX5 SUVs in Australia and New Zealand, adding to its global reach.",

      "In a series of executive actions signed Wednesday, Trump targeted universities that he views as liberal adversaries to his political agenda. One order called for harder enforcement of a federal law requiring colleges to disclose their financial ties with foreign sources, while another called for a shakeup of the accrediting bodies that decide whether colleges can accept federal financial aid awarded to students.",
      "Trump also ordered the Education Department to root out efforts to ensure equity in discipline in the nation's K-12 schools. Previous guidance from Democratic administrations directed schools not to disproportionately punish underrepresented minorities such as Black and Native American students. The administration says equity efforts amount to racial discrimination.",
      "Colleges\u2019 financial ties with foreign sources have long been a concern among Republicans, especially ties with China and other countries with adversarial relationships with the U.S. It became a priority during Trump\u2019s first term and reemerged last week as the White House grasped for leverage in its escalating battle with Harvard University.",
      "The White House said it needed to take action because Harvard and other colleges have routinely violated a federal disclosure law, which has been unevenly enforced since it was passed in the 1980s. Known as Section 117 of the Higher Education Act, the law requires colleges to disclose foreign gifts and contracts valued at $250,000 or more.",
      "Last week, the Education Department demanded records from Harvard over foreign financial ties spanning the past decade, accusing the school of filing \u201cincomplete and inaccurate disclosures.\u201d Trump's administration is sparring with Harvard over the university's refusal to accept a list of demands over its handling of pro-Palestinian protests as well as its diversity, equity and inclusion efforts.",
      "In the executive order, Trump calls on the Education Department and the attorney general to step up enforcement of the law and take action against colleges that violate it, including a cutoff of federal money.",
      "The Trump administration intends to \u201cend the secrecy surrounding foreign funds in American educational institutions\u201d and protect against \u201cforeign exploitation,\u201d the order said.",
      "It was applauded by Republicans, including Rep. Tim Walberg of Michigan, chair of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce. He accused China of exploiting academic ties to steal research and \u201cindoctrinate students.\u201d",
      "Another order aims at accrediting bodies that set standards colleges must meet to accept federal financial aid from students. Trump campaigned on a promise to overhaul the industry, saying it was \u201cdominated by Marxist Maniacs and lunatics.\u201d",
      "Often overlooked as an obscure branch of college oversight, accreditors play an important role in shaping colleges in many aspects, with standards that apply all the way from colleges\u2019 governing boards to classroom curriculum.",
      "Trump's executive order is the opening salvo in what could be a lengthy battle to overhaul the accrediting industry. Chief among his priorities is to strip accreditors of DEI requirements imposed on colleges. Some accreditors have already dropped or stopped enforcing such standards amid Trump\u2019s DEI crackdown.",
      "Trump\u2019s order calls on the government to suspend or terminate accreditors that discriminate in the name of DEI. Instead, it calls on accreditors to focus more squarely on the student outcomes of colleges and programs they oversee.",
      "The president wants to make it easier for new accreditors to compete with the 19 that are now authorized to work on behalf of the federal government. As it stands, new accreditors looking to be recognized by the government must undergo an arduous process that traditionally takes years. Trump\u2019s order said it should be \u201ctransparent, efficient, and not unduly burdensome.\u201d",
      "\u201cInstead of pushing schools to adopt a divisive DEI ideology, accreditors should be focused on helping schools improve graduation rates and graduates\u2019 performance in the labor market,\u201d Education Secretary Linda McMahon said in a statement.",
      "Trump also invoked opposition to equity efforts in his order on school discipline. The edict signed Wednesday seeks a return to \u201ccommon sense school discipline,\u201d allowing decisions to be based solely on students\u2019 behavior and actions, McMahon said.",
      "Another executive order instructs government agencies and departments to no longer rely on \u201cdisparate impact theories.\u201d Under the disparate impact standard, policies and practices that disproportionately impact minorities and other protected groups could be challenged regardless of their intent.",
      "In many schools around the country, Black students have been more likely to receive punishments that remove them from the classroom, including suspensions, expulsions and being transferred to alternative schools. A decade ago, those differences became the target of a reform movement spurred by the same reckoning that gave rise to Black Lives Matter. The movement elevated the concept of the \u201cschool-to-prison pipeline\u201d \u2014 the notion that being kicked out of school, or dropping out, increases the chance of arrest and imprisonment years later.",
      "Federal guidelines to address racial disparities in school discipline first came from President Barack Obama\u2019s administration in 2014. Federal officials urged schools not to suspend, expel or refer students to law enforcement except as a last resort, and encouraged restorative justice practices that did not push students out of the classroom. Those rules were rolled back by Trump\u2019s first administration, but civil rights regulations at federal and state levels still mandate the collection of data on discipline.",
      "On Wednesday, Trump directed McMahon to issue new school discipline guidance within 60 days. The order also calls for a review of nonprofit organizations that have promoted discipline policies rooted in equity and ensure they don\u2019t receive federal money.",
      "Another order creates a federal task force focused on giving America\u2019s students training on artificial intelligence as early as kindergarten. It would work to develop new online learning resources.",
      "Trump is also establishing a White House initiative to empower Historically Black Colleges and Universities. Among other efforts, it would seek to promote private-sector partnerships with HBCUs and schools\u2019 workforce preparation in industries like technology and finance.",

      "Elon Musk intends to focus more on his job as Tesla CEO, but it\u2019s unclear if the billionaire will be able to solve a big problem of his own making: damage to its brand",
      "NEW YORK -- Elon Musk has been called a Moonshot Master, the Edison of Our Age and the Architect of the Future, but he's got a big problem at his car company and it's not clear he can fix it: damage to its brand.",
      "Sales have plunged for Tesla amid protests and boycotts over Musk's embrace of far right-wing views. Profits have been sliced by two-thirds so far this year, and rivals from China, Europe and the U.S. are pouncing.",
      "On Tuesday came some relief as Musk announced in an earnings call with investors that he would be scaling back his government cost-cutting job in Washington to a \u201cday or two per week\" to focus more on his old job as Tesla's boss.",
      "Investors pushed up Tesla's stock 5% Wednesday, though there are plenty of challenges ahead.",
      "Musk seemed to downplay the role that brand damage played in the drop in first-quarter sales on the investor call. Instead, he emphasized something more fleeting \u2014 an upgrade to Tesla's best-selling Model Y that forced a shutdown of factories and pinched both supply and demand.",
      "While financial analysts following the company have noted that potential buyers probably held back while waiting for the upgrade, hurting results, even the most bullish among them say the brand damage is real, and more worrisome.",
      "\u201cThis is a full blown crisis,\u201d said Wedbush Securities' normally upbeat Dan Ives earlier this month. In a note to its clients, JP Morgan warned of \u201cunprecedented brand damage.\"",
      "Musk dismissed the protests against Tesla on the call as the work of people angry at his leadership of the Department of Government Efficiency because \u201cthose who are receiving the waste and fraud wish it to continue.\u201d",
      "But the protests in Europe, thousands of miles from Washington, came after Musk supported far-right politicians there. Angry Europeans hung Musk in effigy in Milan, projected an image of him doing a straight-arm salute on a Tesla factory in Berlin and put up posters in London urging people not to buy \u201cSwasticars\u201d from him.",
      "Sales in Europe have gone into a free fall in the first three months of this year \u2014 down 39%. In Germany, sales plunged 62%.",
      "Another worrying sign: On Tuesday, Tesla backed off its earlier promise that sales would recover this year after dropping in 2024 for the first time a dozen years. Tesla said the global trade situation was too uncertain and declined to repeat the forecast.",
      "Meanwhile, Tesla's competition is stealing its customers.",
      "Among its fiercest rivals now is Chinese giant BYD. Earlier this year, the EV maker announced it had developed an electric battery that can charge within minutes. And Tesla\u2019s European rivals have begun offering new models with advanced technology that is making them real Tesla alternatives just as popular opinion has turned against Musk.",
      "Tesla's share of the EV market in the U.S. has dropped from two-thirds to less than half, according to Cox Automotive.",
      "Another rival, Google parent Alphabet, is already ahead of Tesla in an area that Musk has promised will help remake his company: Cybercabs.",
      "One of the highlights of Tesla\u2019s call Tuesday was Musk sticking with his previous prediction that it will l aunch driverless cabs without steering wheels and pedals in Austin, Texas, in June, and in other cities soon after.",
      "But Google\u2019s service, called Waymo, already has logged millions of driverless cybercab trips in San Francisco, Phoenix, Los Angeles, and Austin as part of a partnership with ride-hailing leader Uber.",
      "Musk also told analysts that this driverless capability will be available on the Tesla vehicles already on the road through software updates over the air, and put a timeline on it: \u201cThere will be millions of Teslas operating autonomously in the second half of the year.\"",
      "But he has made similar promises before, only to miss his deadlines, such as in April 2019 when he vowed full automation by the end of the next year. He repeated the prediction, moving up the date, several more times, in following years.",
      "A big problem is federal investigators have not given the all-clear that Tesla vehicles can drive completely on their own safely. Among other probes, safety regulators are looking into Tesla's so-called Full Self-Driving, which is only partial self-driving, for its tie to accidents in low-visibility conditions like when there is sun glare.",
      "In competition with rivals in the U.S., Tesla currently has one clear advantage: It will get hurt by less by tariffs because most of its vehicles are built in the countries where they are sold, including those in its biggest market, the U.S.",
      "\u201cTariffs are still tough on a company where margins are still low, but we do have localized supply chains,\u201d Musk said Tuesday. \u201cThat puts us in a strong position.\u201d",
      "The company also reconfirmed that a cheaper version of its best-selling vehicle, the Model Y sport utility vehicle, will be ready for customers in the first half of this year. That could help boost sales.",
      "Another plus: The company had a blow out first quarter in its energy storage business. And Musk has promised to be producing 5,000 Optimus robots, another Tesla business, by the end of the year.",
      "Even after falling nearly 50% from its December highs, Tesla's stock is still very richly valued based on the one yardstick that really matters in the long run: its earnings.",
      "At 110 times its expected per share earnings this year, the stock is valued more than 25 times higher than General Motors. The average stock on in the S&P 500 index trades at less than 20 times earnings.",
      "That leaves Tesla little margin for error if something goes wrong.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- The State Bar of California has disclosed that some multiple-choice questions in a problem-plagued bar exam were developed with the aid of artificial intelligence.",
      "The legal licensing body said in a news release Monday that it will ask the California Supreme Court to adjust test scores for those who took its February bar exam.",
      "\u201cThe debacle that was the February 2025 bar exam is worse than we imagined,\u201d Mary Basick, assistant dean of academic skills at the University of California, Irvine, Law School, told the Los Angeles Times. \u201cI\u2019m almost speechless. Having the questions drafted by non-lawyers using artificial intelligence is just unbelievable.\u201d",
      "In February, the new exam led to complaints after many test-takers were unable to complete their bar exams. The online testing platforms repeatedly crashed before some applicants even started. Others struggled to finish and save essays, experienced screen lags and error messages and could not copy and paste text, the Times reported earlier.",
      "According to a recent presentation by the State Bar, 100 of the 171 scored multiple-choice questions were made by Kaplan and 48 were drawn from a first-year law students exam. A smaller subset of 23 scored questions were made by ACS Ventures, the State Bar\u2019s psychometrician, and developed with artificial intelligence.",
      "\u201cWe have confidence in the validity of the (multiple-choice questions) to accurately and fairly assess the legal competence of test-takers,\u201d Leah Wilson, the State Bar\u2019s executive director, told the newspaper in a statement.",
      "Katie Moran, an associate professor at the University of San Francisco School of Law who specializes in bar exam preparation, told the newspaper, \u201cIt\u2019s a staggering admission.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe State Bar has admitted they employed a company to have a non-lawyer use AI to draft questions that were given on the actual bar exam,\u201d she said. \u201cThey then paid that same company to assess and ultimately approve of the questions on the exam, including the questions the company authored.\u201d",

      "\u201cUltimately, I\u2019m worried about who owns and controls this technology once it\u2019s created,\u201d said Page Hedley, a former policy and ethics adviser at OpenAI, in an interview with The Associated Press.",
      "Backed by three Nobel Prize winners and other advocates and experts, Hedley and nine other ex-OpenAI workers sent a letter this week to the two state attorneys general.",
      "The coalition is asking California Attorney General Rob Bonta and Delaware Attorney General Kathy Jennings, both Democrats, to use their authority to protect OpenAI's charitable purpose and block its planned restructuring. OpenAI is incorporated in Delaware and operates out of San Francisco.",
      "OpenAI said in response that \u201cany changes to our existing structure would be in service of ensuring the broader public can benefit from AI.\u201d It said its for-profit will be a public benefit corporation, similar to other AI labs like Anthropic and tech billionaire Elon Musk's xAI, except that OpenAI will still preserve a nonprofit arm.",
      "\u201cThis structure will continue to ensure that as the for-profit succeeds and grows, so too does the nonprofit, enabling us to achieve the mission,\u201d the company said in a statement.",
      "The letter is the second petition to state officials this month. The last came from a group of labor leaders and nonprofits focused on protecting OpenAI's billions of dollars of charitable assets.",
      "Jennings said last fall she would \u201creview any such transaction to ensure that the public\u2019s interests are adequately protected.\" Bonta\u2019s office sought more information from OpenAI late last year but has said it can\u2019t comment, even to confirm or deny if it is investigating.",
      "OpenAI's co-founders, including current CEO Sam Altman and Musk, originally started it as a nonprofit research laboratory on a mission to safely build what's known as artificial general intelligence, or AGI, for humanity's benefit. Nearly a decade later, OpenAI has reported its market value as $300 billion and counts 400 million weekly users of ChatGPT, its flagship product.",
      "OpenAI already has a for-profit subsidiary but faces a number of challenges in converting its core governance structure. One is a lawsuit from Musk, who accuses the company and Altman of betraying the founding principles that led the Tesla CEO to invest in the charity.",
      "While some of the signatories of this week's letter support Musk's lawsuit, Hedley said others are \u201cunderstandably cynical\u201d because Musk also runs his own rival AI company.",
      "The signatories include two Nobel-winning economists, Oliver Hart and Joseph Stiglitz, as well as AI pioneers and computer scientists Geoffrey Hinton, who won last year's Nobel Prize in physics, and Stuart Russell.",
      "\u201cI like OpenAI\u2019s mission to \u2018ensure that artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity,\u2019 and I would like them to execute that mission instead of enriching their investors,\" Hinton said in a statement Wednesday. \"I\u2019m happy there is an effort to hold OpenAI to its mission that does not involve Elon Musk.\u201d",
      "Conflicts over OpenAI's purpose have long simmered at the San Francisco institute, contributing to Musk quitting in 2018, Altman's short-lived ouster in 2023 and other high-profile departures.",
      "Hedley, a lawyer by training, worked for OpenAI in 2017 and 2018, a time when the nonprofit was still navigating the best ways to steward the technology it wanted to build. As recently as 2023, Altman said advanced AI held promise but also warned of extraordinary risks, from drastic accidents to societal disruptions.",
      "In recent years, however, Hedley said he watched with concern as OpenAI, buoyed by the success of ChatGPT, was increasingly cutting corners on safety testing and rushing out new products to get ahead of business competitors.",
      "\u201cThe costs of those decisions will continue to go up as the technology becomes more powerful,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that in the new structure that OpenAI wants, the incentives to rush to make those decisions will go up and there will no longer be anybody really who can tell them not to, tell them this is not OK.\u201d",
      "Software engineer Anish Tondwalkar, a former member of OpenAI\u2019s technical team until last year, said an important assurance in OpenAI\u2019s nonprofit charter is a \u201cstop-and-assist clause\u201d that directs OpenAI to stand down and help if another organization is nearing the achievement of better-than-human AI.",

      "Harmful bleaching of the world's coral has grown to include 84% of the ocean's reefs in the most intense event of its kind in recorded history, the International Coral Reef Initiative announced Wednesday.",
      "It's the fourth global bleaching event since 1998, and has now surpassed bleaching from 2014-17 that hit some two-thirds of reefs, said the ICRI, a mix of more than 100 governments, non-governmental organizations and others. And it's not clear when the current crisis, which began in 2023 and is blamed on warming oceans, will end.",
      "\u201cWe may never see the heat stress that causes bleaching dropping below the threshold that triggers a global event,\u201d said Mark Eakin, executive secretary for the International Coral Reef Society and retired coral monitoring chief for the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re looking at something that\u2019s completely changing the face of our planet and the ability of our oceans to sustain lives and livelihoods,\u201d Eakin said.",
      "Last year was Earth\u2019s hottest year on record, and much of that is going into oceans. The average annual sea surface temperature of oceans away from the poles was a record 20.87 degrees Celsius (69.57 degrees Fahrenheit).",
      "That's deadly to corals, which are key to seafood production, tourism and protecting coastlines from erosion and storms. Coral reefs are sometimes dubbed \u201crainforests of the sea\u201d because they support high levels of biodiversity \u2014 approximately 25% of all marine species can be found in, on and around coral reefs.",
      "Coral get their bright colors from the colorful algae that live inside them and are a food source for the corals. Prolonged warmth causes the algae to release toxic compounds, and the coral eject them. A stark white skeleton is left behind, and the weakened coral is at heightened risk of dying.",
      "The bleaching event has been so severe that NOAA\u2019s Coral Reef Watch program has had to add levels to its bleaching alert scale to account for the growing risk of coral death.",
      "Efforts are underway to conserve and restore coral. One Dutch lab has worked with coral fragments, including some taken from off the coast of the Seychelles, to propagate them in a zoo so that they might be used someday to repopulate wild coral reefs if needed. Other projects, including one off Florida, have worked to rescue corals endangered by high heat and nurse them back to health before returning them to the ocean.",
      "But scientists say it's essential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that warm the planet, such as carbon dioxide and methane.",
      "\u201cThe best way to protect coral reefs is to address the root cause of climate change. And that means reducing the human emissions that are mostly from burning of fossil fuels \u2026 everything else is looking more like a Band-Aid rather than a solution,\u201d Eakin said.",
      "\u201cI think people really need to recognize what they\u2019re doing \u2026 inaction is the kiss of death for coral reefs,\u201d said Melanie McField, co-chair of the Caribbean Steering Committee for the Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network, a network of scientists that monitors reefs throughout the world.",
      "The group's update comes as President Donald Trump has moved aggressively in his second term to boost fossil fuels and roll back clean energy programs, which he says is necessary for economic growth.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve got a government right now that is working very hard to destroy all of these ecosystems ... removing these protections is going to have devastating consequences,\" Eakin said.",

      "Scientists say a newly discovered green comet likely has broken apart and won\u2019t be visible to the naked eye",
      "NEW YORK -- A newly discovered green comet tracked by telescopes has likely broken apart as it swung by the sun, dashing hopes of a naked-eye spectacle.",
      "Comet SWAN, hailing from the Oort Cloud beyond Pluto, has been visible through telescopes and binoculars over the past few weeks with its streaming tail, but experts said it may not have survived its recent trip past the sun and is fading fast.",
      "\u201cWe'll soon be left with just a dusty rubble pile,\u201d astrophysicist Karl Battams with the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory said in an email.",

      "The newest comet was discovered by amateur astronomers, who spied it in photos taken by a camera on a spacecraft operated by NASA and the European Space Agency to study the sun.",
      "The comet won't swing close to Earth like Tsuchinshan-Atlas did last year. Other notable flybys included Neowise in 2020 and Hale-Bopp and Hyakutake in the 1990s.",
      "The comet, also designated C/2025 F2, would have been visible just after dark slightly north of where the sun set. Its green color would have been difficult to see with the naked eye.",
      "This might have been the object\u2019s first ever trip past the sun, making it particularly vulnerable to breaking apart, Battams said. After its flyby, what's left of the comet will disappear into the outer reaches of the solar system, past where scientists think it came from.",

      "As Big Tech kicks off its quarterly earnings season this week, the industry\u2019s bellwether companies have been thrust into a cauldron of uncertainty and turmoil that they didn\u2019t anticipate when Donald Trump re-entered the White House less than 100 days ago",
      "SAN FRANCISCO -- As Big Tech kicks off its quarterly earnings season this week, the industry's bellwether companies have been thrust into a cauldron of uncertainty and turmoil that they didn't anticipate when Donald Trump re-entered the White House nearly 100 days ago.",
      "Since President Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration, Big Tech stocks have been on a see-sawing ride that has eviscerated trillions of dollars in shareholder wealth amid an onslaught of tariffs and other potentially detrimental actions.",
      "It's the polar opposite of what Apple CEO Tim Cook, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos hoped for when they assembled behind Trump as he was sworn in.",
      "That display of unity reflected a belief that Trump's second stint in the White House would be a refreshing change from the heavy-handed regulation of President Joe Biden\u2019s administration while unleashing even more lucrative opportunities in artificial intelligence and deal-making.",
      "But the Trump administration\u2019s policies so far have vexed Big Tech\u2019s \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d companies \u2014 a group consisting of Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Tesla, Google parent Alphabet and Facebook parent Meta Platforms. Since Trump\u2019s inauguration, the Magnificent Seven\u2019s combined market value has plunged by $3.8 trillion, or 22%, as of April 20.",
      "The financial damage was even more severe a few days after Trump\u2019s April 2 unveiling of sweeping reciprocal tariffs that would have exacted a heavy toll on Big Tech's supply chains in China and other key markets around the globe. A temporary freeze on the majority of the most punitive tariffs and an exemption from most of the fees on electronics coming in from China has provided some relief, but Trump has made it clear the reprieve may be short-lived.",
      "That has left the specter of Trump's ongoing trade war hanging over Big Tech, whose influence extends around the world.",
      "\u201cThe mass confusion created by this constant news flow out of the White House is dizzying for the industry and investors and creating massive uncertainty and chaos for companies trying to plan their supply chain, inventory, and demand,\u201d Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives said.",
      "Besides the upheaval triggered by Trump's tariffs, his administration is also in the midst of trying to prove regulators' allegations that Meta has been running an illegal monopoly in social networking, and working to persuade a federal judge to break up Google after its search engine last year was found to be illegally abusing its power. Trump also has given no indication of abandoning antitrust lawsuits filed by the Biden administration that could hobble Apple and Amazon.",
      "And Nvidia absorbed a significant setback last week when the Trump administration banned it from selling one of its popular AI chips to China, prompting the company to record a $5.5 billion charge to account for the stockpile of processors that it intended to export to that country.",
      "Tech CEOs will get a chance to discuss the fallout from the trade war and other challenges still ahead during analyst conference calls that will be held as part of their companies\u2019 financial reports for the January-March quarter.",
      "The ritual will kick off Tuesday when Tesla is scheduled to release its full financial report after already revealing that its first-quarter car sales dropped by 13% from the same time last year.",
      "The decline occurred against a backdrop of vandalism, widespread protests and calls for a consumer boycott amid a backlash to Musk\u2019s high-profile role in the White House overseeing a cost-cutting purge of U.S. government agencies.",
      "After Musk discusses his strategy for reversing a decrease in Tesla's market value since he joined Trump in the White House, Google parent Alphabet Inc. is scheduled to announce its results on Thursday. Then four of the Magnificent Seven will get their turn next week: Amazon on April 29; Meta and Microsoft on April 30; and Apple on May 1.",
      "Nvidia, which operates on a fiscal year ending in January, is scheduled to wrap things up on May 28 with the release of its quarterly results.",

      "Google will confront an existential threat Monday as the U.S. government tries to break up the company as punishment for turning its revolutionary search engine into a ruthless monopoly.",
      "The drama will unfold in a Washington courtroom during the next three weeks during hearings that will determine how the company should be penalized for operating an illegal monopoly in search. The proceedings, known in legal parlance as a \u201cremedy hearing,\u201d feature a parade of witnesses that includes Google CEO Sundar Pichai.",
      "The U.S. Department of Justice is asking a federal judge to order a radical shake-up that would ban Google from striking the multibillion dollar deals with Apple and other tech companies that shield its search engine from competition, share its repository of valuable user data with rivals and force a sale of its popular Chrome browser.",
      "The moment of reckoning comes four-and-half-years after the Justice Department filed a landmark lawsuit alleging Google\u2019s search engine had been abusing its power as the internet's main gateway to stifle competition and innovation for more than a decade.",
      "After the case finally went to trial in 2023, a federal judge last year ruled Google had been making anti-competitive deals to lock in its search engine as the go-to place for digital information on the iPhone, personal computers and other widely used devices, including those running on its own Android software.",
      "That landmark ruling by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta sets up a high-stakes drama that will determine the penalties for Google\u2019s misconduct in a search market that it has defined since Larry Page and Sergey Brin founded the company in a Silicon Valley garage in 1998.",
      "Since that austere start, Google has expanded far beyond search to become a powerhouse in email, digital mapping, online video, web browsing, smartphone software and data centers.",
      "Seizing upon its victory in the search case, the Justice Department is now setting out to prove that radical steps must be taken to rein in Google and its corporate parent, Alphabet Inc.",
      "\u201cGoogle\u2019s illegal conduct has created an economic goliath, one that wreaks havoc over the marketplace to ensure that \u2014 no matter what occurs \u2014 Google always wins,\u201d the Justice Department argued in documents outlining its proposed penalties. \u201cThe American people thus are forced to accept the unbridled demands and shifting, ideological preferences of an economic leviathan in return for a search engine the public may enjoy.\u201d",
      "Although the proposed penalties were originally made under President Joe Biden's term, they are still being embraced by the Justice Department under President Donald Trump, whose first administration filed the case against Google. Since the change in administrations, the Justice Department has also attempted to cast Google's immense power as a threat to freedom, too.",
      "\u201cThe American dream is about higher values than just cheap goods and \u2018free\u2019 online services,\" the Justice Department wrote in a March 7 filing with Mehta. \u201cThese values include freedom of speech, freedom of association, freedom to innovate, and freedom to compete in a market undistorted by the controlling hand of a monopolist.\"",
      "Google is arguing the government's proposed changes are unwarranted under a ruling that its search engine popularity among consumers is one of the main reasons it has become so dominant.",
      "The \u201cunprecedented array of proposed remedies would harm consumers and innovation, as well as future competition in search and search ads in addition to numerous other adjacent markets,\u201d Google lawyers said in a filing leading up to hearings. \u201cThey bear little or no relationship to the conduct found anticompetitive, and are contrary to the law.\u201d",
      "Google also is sounding alarms about the proposed requirements to share online search data with rivals and the proposed sale of Chrome posing privacy and security risks. \u201cThe breadth and depth of the proposed remedies risks doing significant damage to a complex ecosystem. Some of the proposed remedies would imperil browser developers and jeopardize the digital security of millions of consumers.\"",
      "The showdown over Google's fate marks the climax of the biggest antitrust case in the U.S. since the Justice Department sued Microsoft in the late 1990s for leveraging its Windows software for personal computers to crush potential rivals.",
      "The Microsoft battle culminated in a federal judge declaring the company an illegal monopoly and ordering a partial breakup \u2014 a remedy that was eventually overturned by an appeals court.",
      "Google intends to file an appeal of Mehta's ruling from last year that branded its search engine as an illegal monopoly but can't do so until the remedy hearings are completed. After closing arguments are presented in late May, Mehta intends to make his decision on the remedies before Labor Day.",
      "The search case marked the first in a succession of antitrust cases that have been brought against a litany of tech giants that include Facebook and Instagram parent Meta Platforms, which is currently fighting allegations of running an illegal monopoly in social media in another Washington D.C. trial. Other antitrust cases have been brought against both Apple and Amazon, too.",
      "The Justice Department also targeted Google's digital advertising network in a separate antitrust case that resulted last week in another federal judge's decision that found the company was abusing its power in that market, too. That ruling means Google will be heading into another remedy hearing that could once again raise the specter of a breakup later this year or early next year.",

      "Donald Trump has the lowest 100-day job approval rating of any president in the past 80 years, with public pushback on many of his policies and extensive economic discontent, including broad fears of a recession, according to a new ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos poll.",
      "Yet he still beats the Democrats in Congress in terms of trust to handle the nation's main problems.",
      "Thirty-nine percent of respondents in this ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos poll said they approve of how Trump is handling his job as president, down 6 percentage points from February, while 55% said they disapprove.",
      "The previous low in approval for a president at or near 100 days in office, in polls dating to 1945, was Trump's 42% in 2017.",
      "Perhaps most threatening to Trump, given his promise of an economic turnaround, is the extent of negative views on the economy: Seventy-two percent said they think it's very or somewhat likely that his economic policies will cause a recession in the short term.",
      "Seventy-three percent said the economy is in bad shape, 53% said it's gotten worse since Trump took office and 41% said their own finances have worsened -- which is as many as those who said so under President Joe Biden last summer.",
      "Sixty-two percent said prices, which as a candidate, Trump pledged to curb, are rising. Seventy-one percent said they see his tariffs as a negative factor in price inflation. And just 31% in this poll, produced for ABC by Langer Research Associates with fieldwork by Ipsos, said they accept Trump's argument that the economy will emerge with a stronger foundation for the long term.",
      "Negative assessments go beyond the economy. Sixty-five percent said Trump's administration is trying to avoid complying with federal court orders, and 64% said he's going too far in trying to expand presidential powers.",
      "Sixty-two percent said they don't think his administration respects the rule of law.",
      "Majorities also expressed concern that the president will do too much to reduce the size and role of government (58%), argued he's acted beyond his authority as president without justification (56%) and doubted the Trump administration's commitment to protecting citizens' rights and freedoms (55%).",
      "See PDF for full results.",
      "Anywhere from 57% to 67% of Americans said they disapprove of Trump's performance on six of seven issues tested in this survey, including at least 6 in 10 on his handling of stock market volatility, tariffs, foreign relations and the economy overall.",
      "Fewer, 53%, said they disapprove of his handling of immigration.",
      "Six in 10 or more said they oppose various administration initiatives, peaking at 77% opposed to cuts in federal funding for medical research.",
      "Seventy percent were opposed to increasing the federal government's role in how private universities are run, 67% were opposed to ending birthright citizenship and 66% were opposed to closing the Department of Education.",
      "As reported Friday, opposition to deporting immigrants is lower, 51%. Additionally, on university governance, the public sided with Harvard University over the Trump administration in their dispute, 66%-32%.",
      "In another gauge, 57% said Trump is \"going too far\" in closing federal agencies, and it's about the same, 56%, in both laying off federal employees and in taking action against his political opponents.",
      "This eases to about half on ending diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, reflecting the public's divide on whether DEI efforts help level the playing field (51%) or create unfair discrimination (47%).",
      "In a positive for the president, more people said they believe waste throughout the federal government has decreased rather than increased under Trump, 43%-25%. The rest said it's stayed the same.",
      "That doesn't carry over in perceptions of fraud: Thirty-four percent said they think this has increased, while 32% said it has decreased.",
      "Another question, raised by Trump's comprehensive efforts to reshape the government, found that 49% think the president is moving the country away from its founding principles, while 34% think he's moving it closer toward them. Seventeen percent said they don't think he's moving it either way.",
      "Approval",
      "At 39%, Trump's job approval rating is down from 45% in a Washington Post/Ipsos poll in February. It now almost exactly matches his average, 40%, across his first term -- tied with Biden for the lowest presidential career average available, dating back to President Harry Truman.",
      "Notably, just 21% now said they \"strongly\" approve of Trump's work in office, his lowest percentage on record. About twice as many, 44%, said they strongly disapprove.",
      "Trump's approval rating from non-college-educated white men, a core support group, is 54%, tying his low in this group from his first term.",
      "That may reflect that 43% of non-college-educated white men said the nation's economy has worsened under Trump, and a third said they have gotten less well off financially since he's taken office.",
      "Trump is also tied with his previous lows in approval among Democrats and liberals.",
      "Still, Trump is hanging on to the vast bulk of his voters.",
      "Among people who voted for him in November, just 6% said they now regret it, while 94% said it was the right thing to do. (Buyer's regret was even lower, 2%, at this point in his first term, a 4-point swing.)",
      "In another gauge of partisanship, 83% of Republicans said they approve of Trump's work in office, while 93% of Democrats and 60% of independents said they disapprove.",
      "A difference is that 51% of Republicans strongly approve of Trump, while 85% of Democrats strongly disapprove. So do 44% of independents, three times as many as those who strongly approve.",
      "Trump's ratings on individual issues, absent immigration, are also underwater.",
      "Sixty-seven percent said they disapprove of his handling of the recent turmoil in the stock market.",
      "The S&P 500 is down 8.7% since Trump took office.",
      "On tariffs, 64% said they disapprove; on both the economy overall and U.S. relations with other countries, 61% said they disapprove; on looking out for the interests of average Americans, 58% said they disapprove; and on managing the federal government, 57% said they disapprove.",
      "The opposition",
      "The silver lining for Trump is that the opposition party remains out of favor.",
      "People said they trust him over the Democrats in Congress to handle the nation's main problems by 37%-30%. Underscoring bipartisan disaffection, 30% said they don't trust either party.",
      "Further, while 60% said Trump is out of touch with the concerns of most people in the country, even more, 69%, said the Democratic Party is out of touch. It's 64% for the Republican Party overall.",
      "There are some telling partisan gaps.",
      "In the political middle, 62% of independents said Trump is out of touch, while substantially more, 76%, said the Democratic Party is out of touch. And in their own camps, relatively few Republicans said Trump is out of touch, 19%, while twice as many Democrats, 38%, said this about their own party.",
      "At the same time, more people said both parties should be doing more to oppose Trump rather than more to support him -- the Democratic Party by 46%-38% and the Republican Party by 50%-26%, with the rest saying each party is handling this about right.",
      "In both cases, independents help tip the balance to opposing versus supporting Trump.",
      "Courts and Compliance",
      "In terms of the legal battles over Trump's moves, people widely rejected the administration's accusations of improper judicial interference.",
      "Most, 62%-35%, said federal judges are trying to enforce existing limits on Trump's legal authority rather than trying to interfere with his authority.",
      "An even wider margin of people, 67%-31%, said federal judges should have the authority to block an administration policy until a trial is held if they think it will harm people and is probably illegal.",
      "Further, people said by a margin of 67%-31% that they think the Trump administration is trying to avoid complying with court orders regarding its activities rather than trying to comply with those orders.",
      "Cutting government",
      "Majority perceptions of presidential overreach are common.",
      "As mentioned, 58% said they express concern that Trump will do too much to reduce the size and role of the federal government. That's essentially a mirror of attitudes under Biden: Fifty-nine percent said they were concerned he'd do too much to increase the government's size and role.",
      "The difference is in partisan divisions, reflecting sharply different views of government between Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents on one hand and Republicans and Republican-leaning independents on the other.",
      "In the Democratic group, 91% said they are concerned Trump will do too much to shrink the size and role of government, while 26% in the Republican group said the same.",
      "In 2021, by contrast, 87% in the GOP camp said they were concerned that Biden would go too far to increase the government's size and role, while 31% in the Democratic group said so.",
      "Views on the Trump administration cutting federal regulations are more closely divided.",
      "Fifty-two percent said they think it will cut regulations that are needed to protect public health and safety, while 46% instead said they think it will cut unnecessary regulations while keeping those that are needed.",
      "Foreign relations and Russia",
      "In the last area covered by this survey, respondents by 49%-34% said they think Trump has weakened rather than strengthened U.S. leadership in the world.",
      "While still negative, that's better than Biden's 48%-23% result on the same question in 2022.",
      "Regarding Russia, 46% said Trump's approach is too friendly, while 11% said it's too confrontational and 40% said it's about right. That's similar to what it was in a January 2017 poll.",
      "This survey was completed before the administration's move in the past week, pressuring Ukraine to accept a ceasefire deal favorable to Russia.",
      "Methodology: This ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos poll was conducted online via the probability-based Ipsos KnowledgePanel\u00ae April 18-22, 2025, in English and Spanish, among a random national sample of 2,464 adults. Partisan divisions are 30%-30%-29%, Democrats-Republicans-independents.",
      "Results have a margin of error of plus or minus 2 percentage points, including the design effect. Error margins are larger for subgroups. Sampling error is not the only source of differences in polls.",

      "Pope Francis was laid to rest Saturday at the Basilica of St. Mary Major in Rome after dying at 88 years old on April 21.",
      "More than 250,000 people turned out to bid farewell to the 266th pope of the Roman Catholic Church. The crowd at St. Peter's Square in the Vatican included many young people and world leaders, giving us some important snapshots of our political moment.",
      "Here are some key moments from the historic event:",
      "At his funeral, Pope Francis was remembered and venerated as a pontiff with \"strength and serenity\" who modeled his pontificate on St. Francis of Assisi. The dean of the College of Cardinals, Giovanni Battista Re, delivered the homily in front of mourners in St. Peter's Square.",
      "\"He established direct contact with individuals and peoples, eager to be close to everyone, with a marked attention to those in difficulty, giving himself without measure, especially to the marginalized, the least among us,\" Re said.",
      "\"He was a Pope among the people, with an open heart towards everyone. He was also a Pope attentive to the signs of the times and what the Holy Spirit was awakening in the Church.\"",
      "Pope Francis' outreach resonated with the younger generations, thousands of whom were present in St. Peter's Square to mourn the late pontiff during his funeral on Saturday morning.",
      "About 80,000 teenagers had registered for the Jubilee of Teenagers, a special event for worshippers between the ages of 12 and 17 during the Catholic Church's Jubilee year of 2025, according to the Dicastery for Evangelization, a department of the Roman Curia -- the central governing body of the Catholic Church.",
      "Some changes were made to the event, scheduled for Friday and Sunday, due to Francis' death. The canonization of Carlo Acutis, who died in 2006 at the age of 15 from leukemia, was postponed. Acutis, an Italian teen known for his devotion to the Eucharist, is set to become the first \"millennial\" saint upon his canonization, which was formally approved by Francis in July 2024.",
      "The mourners assembled in St. Peter\u2019s Square broke into applause as pallbearers carried the pope's coffin outside. It was the site of Pope Francis' last official act, when he celebrated Easter Sunday a day before he died on April 21.",
      "Some young adults even played a prominent role in the funeral proceedings. American Kielce Gussie, 28, did the first reading in English -- several verses from the Acts of the Apostles.",
      "Gussie works as a journalist at Vatican News and completed her undergraduate degree in theology at Mount St. Mary\u2019s University. She also has a licentiate degree in church communication from Rome's Pontifical University of the Holy Cross.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, in attendance with his wife Olena Zelenska, earned applause from the crowd in St. Peter\u2019s Square appeared on the screens around the area.",
      "Zelenskyy has led Ukraine during the country's war with Russia, which escalated in 2022 after the Russian invasion of the Eastern European country.",
      "President Donald Trump met privately with Zelenskyy prior to the funeral and had a \"very productive session,\" White House Communications Director Steven Cheung told the press pool traveling with Trump.",
      "It was the first meeting between the two men since their contentious February meeting in the Oval Office, in which Trump and Vice President JD Vance rebuked Zelenskyy for his handling of the war.",
      "First lady Melania Trump joined the president at the funeral. Former President Joe Biden and former first lady Jill Biden attended the funeral as well, sitting about four rows behind the Trumps.",
      "It is one of the most poignant and iconic moments in papal funerals: the simple yet profound image of the breeze blowing the pages of the Book of the Gospels resting on top of the pope's coffin in St. Peter's Square.",
      "The book was opened to the reading, \"In the Passion and death of the Lord.\"",
      "The coffin carrying Pope Francis was brought through the Holy Door of St. Peter's Basilica for a final time as bells tolled for the pope throughout the Vatican.",
      "The funeral, which lasted more than two hours, concluded with bells ringing for the pontiff. His coffin was taken to Rome's Basilica of Saint Mary Major where he was laid to rest.",
      "The four-mile route between St. Peter's Basilica and the final resting place of Pope Francis -- the Basilica of St. Mary Major in Rome -- was lined with tens of thousands of mourners following his funeral on Saturday morning.",
      "People could be seen crying and applauding as Francis' coffin drove by.",
      "Francis' coffin was placed in the bed of a white pickup truck, where it was visible to the thousands lining the streets. The procession took the pope's body past some of Rome's historical landmarks, such as the Roman Forum and the Colosseum.",

The dean of the College of Cardinals, Giovanni Battista Re, delivered the homily in front of some 200,000 mourners in St. Peter's Square.",
      "Here are the remarks translated into English:",
      "In this majestic Saint Peter\u2019s Square, where Pope Francis celebrated the Eucharist so many times and presided over great gatherings over the past twelve years, we are gathered with sad hearts in prayer around his mortal remains.",
      "Yet, we are sustained by the certainty of faith, which assures us that human existence does not end in the tomb, but in the Father\u2019s house, in a life of happiness that will know no end.",
      "On behalf of the College of Cardinals, I cordially thank all of you for your presence. With deep emotion, I extend respectful greetings and heartfelt thanks to the Heads of State, Heads of Government and Official Delegations who have come from many countries to express their affection, veneration and esteem for our late Holy Father.",
      "The outpouring of affection that we have witnessed in recent days following his passing from this earth into eternity tells us how much the profound pontificate of Pope Francis touched minds and hearts.",
      "The final image we have of him, which will remain etched in our memory, is that of last Sunday, Easter Sunday, when Pope Francis, despite his serious health problems, wanted to give us his blessing from the balcony of Saint Peter\u2019s Basilica. He then came down to this Square to greet the large crowd gathered for the Easter Mass while riding in the open-top Popemobile.",
      "With our prayers, we now entrust the soul of our beloved Pontiff to God, that he may grant him eternal happiness in the bright and glorious gaze of his immense love.",
      "We are enlightened and guided by the passage of the Gospel, in which the very voice of Christ resounded, asking the first of the Apostles: \u201cPeter, do you love me more than these?\u201d Peter\u2019s answer was prompt and sincere: \u201cLord, you know everything; you know that I love you!\u201d Jesus then entrusted him with the great mission: \u201cFeed my sheep.\u201d",
      "This will be the constant task of Peter and his successors, a service of love in the footsteps of Christ, our Master and Lord, who \u201ccame not to be served but to serve, and to give his life a ransom for many\u201d (Mk 10:45).",
      "Despite his frailty and suffering towards the end, Pope Francis chose to follow this path of self-giving until the last day of his earthly life. He followed in the footsteps of his Lord, the Good Shepherd, who loved his sheep to the point of giving his life for them.",
      "And he did so with strength and serenity, close to his flock, the Church of God, mindful of the words of Jesus quoted by the Apostle Paul: \u201cIt is more blessed to give than to receive\u201d (Acts 20:35).",
      "When Cardinal Bergoglio was elected by the Conclave on 13 March 2013 to succeed Pope Benedict XVI, he already had many years of experience in religious life in the Society of Jesus and, above all, was enriched by twenty-one years of pastoral ministry in the Archdiocese of Buenos Aires, first as Auxiliary, then as Coadjutor and, above all, as Archbishop.",
      "The decision to take the name Francis immediately appeared to indicate the pastoral plan and style on which he wanted to base his pontificate, seeking inspiration from the spirit of Saint Francis of Assisi.He maintained his temperament and form of pastoral leadership, and through his resolute personality, immediately made his mark on the governance of the Church. He established direct contact with individuals and peoples, eager to be close to everyone, with a marked attention to those in difficulty, giving himself without measure, especially to the marginalized, the least among us.",
      "He was a Pope among the people, with an open heart towards everyone. He was also a Pope attentive to the signs of the times and what the Holy Spirit was awakening in the Church.",
      "With his characteristic vocabulary and language, rich in images and metaphors, he always sought to shed light on the problems of our time with the wisdom of the Gospel. He did so by offering a response guided by the light of faith and encouraging us to live as Christians amid the challenges and contradictions in recent years, which he loved to describe as an \u201cepochal change.\u201d",
      "He had great spontaneity and an informal way of addressing everyone, even those far from the Church.",
      "Rich in human warmth and deeply sensitive to today\u2019s challenges, Pope Francis truly shared the anxieties, sufferings and hopes of this time of globalization. He gave of himself by comforting and encouraging us with a message capable of reaching people\u2019s hearts in a direct and immediate way.",
      "His charisma of welcome and listening, combined with a manner of behavior in keeping with today\u2019s sensitivities, touched hearts and sought to reawaken moral and spiritual sensibilities.",
      "Evangelization was the guiding principle of his pontificate. With a clear missionary vision, he spread the joy of the Gospel, which was the title of his first Apostolic Exhortation, Evangelii gaudium. It is a joy that fills the hearts of all those who entrust themselves to God with confidence and hope.",
      "The guiding thread of his mission was also the conviction that the Church is a home for all, a home with its doors always open. He often used the image of the Church as a \u201cfield hospital\u201d after a battle in which many were wounded; a Church determined to take care of the problems of people and the great anxieties that tear the contemporary world apart; a Church capable of bending down to every person, regardless of their beliefs or condition, and healing their wounds.",
      "His gestures and exhortations in favor of refugees and displaced persons are countless. His insistence on working on behalf of the poor was constant.",
      "It is significant that Pope Francis\u2019 first journey was to Lampedusa, an island that symbolizes the tragedy of emigration, with thousands of people drowning at sea. In the same vein was his trip to Lesbos, together with the Ecumenical Patriarch and the Archbishop of Athens, as well as the celebration of a Mass on the border between Mexico and the United States during his journey to Mexico.",
      "Of his 47 arduous Apostolic Journeys, the one to Iraq in 2021, defying every risk, will remain particularly memorable. That difficult Apostolic Journey was a balm on the open wounds of the Iraqi people, who had suffered so much from the inhuman actions of ISIS. It was also an important trip for interreligious dialogue, another significant dimension of his pastoral work.",
      "With his 2024 Apostolic Journey to four countries in Asia-Oceania, the Pope reached \u201cthe most peripheral periphery of the world.\u201d",
      "Pope Francis always placed the Gospel of mercy at the centre, repeatedly emphasizing that God never tires of forgiving us. He always forgives, whatever the situation might be of the person who asks for forgiveness and returns to the right path.",
      "He called for the Extraordinary Jubilee of Mercy in order to highlight that mercy is \u201cthe heart of the Gospel.\u201d",
      "Mercy and the joy of the Gospel are two key words for Pope Francis.",
      "In contrast to what he called \u201cthe culture of waste,\u201d he spoke of the culture of encounter and solidarity. The theme of fraternity ran through his entire pontificate with vibrant tones.",
      "In his Encyclical Letter Fratelli tutti, he wanted to revive a worldwide aspiration to fraternity, because we are all children of the same Father who is in heaven. He often forcefully reminded us that we all belong to the same human family.",
      "In 2019, during his trip to the United Arab Emirates, Pope Francis signed A Document on Human Fraternity for World Peace and Living Together, recalling the common fatherhood of God.",
      "Addressing men and women throughout the world, in his Encyclical Letter Laudato si\u2019 he drew attention to our duties and shared responsibility for our common home, stating, \u201cNo one is saved alone.\u201d",
      "Faced with the raging wars of recent years, with their inhuman horrors and countless deaths and destruction, Pope Francis incessantly raised his voice imploring peace and calling for reason and honest negotiation to find possible solutions. War, he said, results in the death of people and the destruction of homes, hospitals and schools. War always leaves the world worse than it was before: it is always a painful and tragic defeat for everyone. \u201cBuild bridges, not walls\u201d was an exhortation he repeated many times, and his service of faith as Successor of the Apostle Peter always was linked to the service of humanity in all its dimensions.",
      "Spiritually united with all of Christianity, we are here in large numbers to pray for Pope Francis, that God may welcome him into the immensity of his love. Pope Francis used to conclude his speeches and meetings by saying, \u201cDo not forget to pray for me.\u201d",
      "Dear Pope Francis, we now ask you to pray for us. May you bless the Church, bless Rome, and bless the whole world from heaven as you did last Sunday from the balcony of this Basilica in a final embrace with all the people of God, but also embrace humanity that seeks the truth with a sincere heart and holds high the torch of hope.",

Her arrest took place hours after federal authorities arrested former New Mexico Judge Joel Cano and his wife Nancy Cano for allegedly housing a Venezuelan national with reported gang ties, Attorney General Pam Bondi said.",
      "Bondi spoke with ABC News Live's Kyra Phillips Friday afternoon to discuss the cases and dismissed critics who accused the Trump administration of intimidating judges who oppose their crackdown on undocumented immigrants.",
      "\"Nobody is above the law, not even a judge,\" Bondi told Philips.",
      "FBI Director Kash Patel announced Judge Dugan's arrest earlier Friday in a social media post, which was briefly deleted and reposted.",
      "\"Just NOW, the FBI arrested Judge Hannah Dugan out of Milwaukee, Wisconsin on charges of obstruction \u2014 after evidence of Judge Dugan obstructing an immigration arrest operation last week,\" Patel said in the new post. \"We believe Judge Dugan intentionally misdirected federal agents away from the subject to be arrested in her courthouse, Eduardo Flores Ruiz, allowing the subject \u2014 an illegal alien \u2014 to evade arrest.\"",
      "Dugan was charged with two criminal counts of \"obstructing and impeding a proceeding before a department or agency of the United States\" and \"concealing an individual to prevent his discovery and arrest,\" according to a criminal complaint unsealed Friday.",
      "County court records show the undocumented immigrant in the Milwaukee case -- Eduardo Flores-Ruiz -- was set to appear in court on April 18 before Dugan for a pretrial conference in a case where he has been charged with three misdemeanor counts of battery/domestic abuse connected to an incident on March 12. The case is ongoing.",
      "Federal prosecutors allege Flores-Ruiz illegally entered the U.S. from Mexico and was issued an Expedited Removal order in January 2013, according to a criminal complaint.",
      "Bondi alleged that Flores-Ruiz beat his roommate and a woman so badly that they needed to be hospitalized and that he continued to be belligerent in the hospital before his arrest.",
      "According to the complaint, Dugan allegedly sought to help Flores-Ruiz evade arrest by federal officers from an ICE task force.",
      "When Judge Dugan learned ICE officers were present in court to arrest Flores-Ruiz, she became \"visibly angry\" and said the situation was \"absurd\" before leaving the bench and entering her chambers, according to the complaint, which cited witnesses who spoke to the FBI.",
      "Dugan and another unidentified judge then allegedly approached the arrest team in the public hallway, according to the complaint. She was \"visibly upset and had a confrontational, angry demeanor\" and asked one of the officers whether they were present for a court appearance, the complaint alleged.",
      "When the officer replied they were there to make an arrest, the complaint alleges Judge Dugan asked if they had a judicial warrant, to which the officer responded, \"No I have an administrative warrant.\"",
      "Multiple witnesses cited in the complaint later allegedly said Judge Dugan returned to her courtroom after directing members of the arrest team to the office of the court's chief judge.",
      "\"The courtroom deputy then saw Judge DUGAN get up and heard Judge DUGAN say something like 'Wait, come with me,'\" the complaint states. \"Despite having been advised of the administrative warrant for the arrest of Flores-Ruiz, Judge DUGAN then escorted Flores-Ruiz and his counsel out of the courtroom through the 'jury door,' which leads to a nonpublic area of the courthouse.\"",
      "\"So she continues, continues with her docket, finishes her docket. Two victims sit in court all morning long waiting and at the end. The prosecutors say 'What happened? Why didn't the case get called?'\" Bondi said.",
      "A DEA agent saw Flores-Ruiz and his attorney in the public hallway of the courthouse and he appeared to be making efforts to evade arrest, the complaint says. After he was encountered by FBI and DEA agents outside the building, Flores-Ruiz \"turned around and sprinted down the street\" before he was ultimately apprehended, according to the complaint.",
      "Dugan was arrested Friday morning at the courthouse, a law enforcement official confirmed to ABC News.",
      "She appeared in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin on Friday on the two charges, but did not enter a plea. She was released on her own recognizance.",
      "Dugan retained former United States Attorney Steven Biskupic to represent her and he said in a statement that the judge will \"defend herself vigorously and looks forward to being exonerated.\"",
      "\"Judge Hannah C. Dugan has committed herself to the rule of law and the principles of due process for her entire career as a lawyer and a judge,\" Biskupic said in a statement.",
      "If convicted on the charges, Dugan could face up to six years in prison.",
      "Bondi responded to the statement by stating that everyone is entitled to their day in court but reiterated that so are victims of crimes.",
      "\"They didn't get it because she let a criminal defendant walk out a door. She helped them. She obstructed justice,\" Bondi told Phillips.",
      "Judge Dugan's arrest angered Milwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson, who accused the federal agents of \"showboating\" and contended Dugan was not a flight risk.",
      "\"They're just trying to have this show of force and in the process of a courthouse where people need to go for court proceedings, they're scaring away people from participating in the court process,\" the mayor told reporters.",
      "Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers, in a statement on Friday afternoon, criticized President Donald Trump and the White House for what he said were efforts \"to attack and attempt to undermine our judiciary at every level.\"",
      "Evers said he would continue to have faith in the justice system \"as this situation plays out in the court of law.\" He did not mention Dugan by name.",
      "In an interview Friday, Phillips asked AG Bondi if she thought the government's actions were intimidating people in the court system, but she dodged the question.",
      "\"We're attempting to protect citizens, make America safe again,\" she said.",
      "Bondi brought up the New Mexico case, where former Judge Joel Cano faces a charge of tampering with evidence.",
      "Court documents allege that on Feb. 28, an alleged Venezuelan Tren de Aragua gang member was arrested at the Canos' residence.",
      "On April 24, agents served a search warrant at their residence and conducted an interview with Cano where he admitted to destroying a cell phone that belonged to the alleged gang member by smashing it with a hammer and throwing it in the trash, according to the complaint and Bondi.",
      "\"Cano stated that he destroyed the cellphone and further admitted that he believed the cellphone contained photos or videos that would reflect negatively on Ortega,\" the complaint states. \"Through further questioning, agents ascertained that \u2026 Cano destroyed the cellphone believing that it contained photographs of Ortega holding firearms that Ortega had uploaded onto social media platforms which would be additional incriminating evidence against him.\"",
      "Cano and his wife have not yet entered pleas in their cases, according to court records, and did not immediately have defense attorneys listed for them.",
      "Bondi reiterated that the immigrants connected to the judges were allegedly violent.",
      "Phillips again pushed Bondi about the arrests, asking if there was concern that the federal government was just going after judges, but the AG maintained that the charges were serious.",
      "\"Those are the people that have to be arrested and taken out of our country. Doesn't matter who you are, no one can harbor them, not even a judge,\" she said.",
      "Phillips questioned how far the government was willing to go to arrest undocumented immigrants, and if that meant that mayors and governors could be targeted.",
      "Bondi appeared to dodge the question and reiterated that the administration's goal is to keep people safe.",
      "\"I would hope a mayor, I would hope a governor would never harbor anyone,\" she said.",

    "story": [
      "He told Time magazine negotiations would be \"finished\" in 3-4 weeks.",
      "President Donald Trump, in a wide-ranging interview with Time magazine published Friday, claimed he's already \"made 200 deals\" on tariffs and said he's spoken with Chinese President Xi Jinping.",
      "In the cover story, in which Trump's discussed his first 100 days in office, the president was asked about White House trade adviser Peter Navarro\u2019s prediction of \"90 deals in 90 days.\"",
      "\"I\u2019ve made 200 deals,\" Trump said. When asked to confirm that number, Trump said \"100%.\"",
      "Trump, though, would not elaborate on what countries he's solidified deals with or the terms. He's met with various foreign officials at the White House in recent weeks on tariffs and other economic issues, but has not yet announced any agreements.",
      "\"I would say, over the next three to four weeks, and we're finished, by the way,\" Trump told Time. \"We'll be finished.\"",
      "On the issue of China -- which faces the highest tariff rate from the administration -- Trump said President Xi has called him.",
      "\"He's called. And I don't think that's a sign of weakness on his behalf,\" Trump said.",
      "The White House in recent days has softened its stance on China, telling reporters that talks with Beijing were moving in the right direction. But Chinese officials, before Trump's Time interview was published, disputed the White House's characterization.",
      "Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun on Thursday called the administration's claims active discussions were happening \"fake news.\" On Friday, the Jiakun said \"China and the United States have not consulted or negotiated on the tariff issue\" and \"the United States should not confuse the public.\"",
      "As he left the White House on Friday, Trump was pressed multiple times by reporters to elaborate on the call with Xi he mentioned to Time but sidestepped. When asked specifically if he'd spoken to him since the tariffs, Trump said, \"I don't want to comment on that but I've spoken to him many times.\"",
      "Here are other key takeaways from the Time interview.",
      "Deportations and Kilmar Abrego Garcia",
      "Time reported that the idea of Trump sending migrants to El Salvador started back in the summer of 2024, when Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele invited lawmakers to visit the country's infamous CECOT. Matt Gaetz, then a Republican congressman from Florida, pitched the idea to Stephen Miller, who then floated the idea to Trump, according to Time, and a deal was quietly made in February.",
      "Trump told Time he liked the idea, in part, because he believed it would be \"a greater deterrent.\"",
      "Trump also told Time that he was originally \u201cnot happy\u201d that his administration had \u201cmistakenly\u201d deported Kilmar Abrego Garcia under the Alien Enemies Act, but then \"found out that he was a person who was an MS-13 member.\" Abrego Garcia's family and attorney deny that claim.",
      "Trump said he has not asked Bukele to return Abrego Garcia despite the U.S. Supreme Court ordered the administration to \u201cfacilitate\u201d his return.",
      "Asked if Abrego Garcia deserves his day in court, Trump repeatedly said it's up to the Justice Department, but eventually said it wouldn\u2019t bother him if he received his due process.",
      "\"That\u2019s not my determination,\" Trump said. \"It's something that, frankly, bringing him back and retrying him wouldn't bother me, but I leave that up to my lawyer.\"",
      "Russia-Ukraine war",
      "President Trump again blamed Kyiv for initiating the war they are in with Russia, saying Ukraine's desire to join NATO was to blame despite Russian President Vladimir Putin launching a full-scale invasion.",
      "Amid recent comments from Trump and other top officials that the U.S. could walk away from negotiations if a deal isn't reached soon, Trump projected optimism.",
      "\"We've had very good talks, and we're getting very close to a deal,\" he told Time.",
      "The negotiated peace Trump is pursuing would hand Putin some 20% of Ukrainian territory.",
      "\u201cCrimea will stay with Russia,\u201d Trump told the magazine.",
      "Trump was asked about his repeated comments of ending the war in Ukraine on Day 1 of his presidency. Trump argued he meant that \u201cfiguratively.\u201d",
      "\u201cWell, I said that figuratively, and I said that as an exaggeration, because to make a point, and you know, it gets, of course, by the fake news [unintelligible]. Obviously, people know that when I said that, it was said in jest, but it was also said that it will be ended.\u201d",

      "The WHI is a decadeslong research effort on women's health.",
      "The Trump administration has promised to restore funding to a landmark study on women's health days after researchers leading the study announced their funding had been cut -- news that prompted outcry from medical experts and scientists.",
      "The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said in a statement Friday to ABC News that it will restore funding to the Women's Health Initiative, a 30-year study of over 160,000 women that has led to discoveries in women's health on everything from cancer and hormone therapy to chronic disease, aging and osteoporosis.",
      "\"These studies represent critical contributions to our better understanding of women's health. While NIH initially exceeded its internal targets for contract reductions, we are now working to fully restore funding to these essential research efforts,\" the agency said in a statement, referring to the National Institutes of Health, the agency within HHS that oversees the study. \"The NIH remains deeply committed to advancing public health through rigorous gold standard research and we are taking immediate steps to ensure the continuity of these studies.\"",
      "Researchers leading the Women's Health Initiative, or WHI, announced earlier this week that they had been informed HHS would terminate contracts for the study's four regional centers at the end of September. Funding for the study's clinical coordinating center would continue through January 2026, according to the researchers, and then remain uncertain.",
      "Garnet Anderson, Ph.D., principal investigator of the WHI Clinical Coordinating Center at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center in Seattle, told ABC News on Friday that the center has not received confirmation from the NIH that funding for the study will be restored.",
      "She added that while she hopes the funding for the WHI is restored, she is also worried that it may come at the expense of funding for \"other, equally deserving studies.\"",
      "\"The decision-making process now is opaque,\" Anderson told ABC News by email. \"It isn't clear that we are getting the best return on our investment -- prioritizing and supporting research on the most important issues in public health and the most promising scientific opportunities.\"",
      "Anderson's work on the WHI over the past 30 years included research on hormone therapy and women.",
      "Additional discoveries stemming from the decades' worth of data collected by the WHI include major information on preventing chronic disease in women; slowing memory loss; preventing and treating breast, ovarian and colorectal cancers in women; and better understanding of how conditions earlier in life like pregnancy, preeclampsia and gestational diabetes impact women later in life, according to Dr. JoAnn E. Manson, one of the long-term principal investigators of the WHI.",
      "\"This is the largest and most groundbreaking study of women's health, and we're learning so much about prevention of chronic disease, healthy aging, extending health span, years of life that are free of major chronic diseases with good memory and cognition and mobility, and quality of life,\" Manson, who is also Preventive Medicine division chief at Brigham and Women's Hospital and a Harvard Medical School professor, told ABC News on Thursday.",
      "Manson said the research findings the WHI continues to produce have not only shaped public health guidelines and clinical health guidelines, meaning the medical advice doctors give to patients, but have also shaped a generation of researchers of women's health.",
      "\"There have been more than 5,000 investigators who have been involved with publications and with the science, and it will be difficult to keep that together,\" she said of the potential impact of the funding cuts. \"Also, the WHI has played an enormous role in training and mentoring the next generation of researchers in women's health and healthy aging that is likely to be disrupted.\"",

      "Doctors describe impact of abortion bans 1 month after Supreme Court ruling",
      "Why being a woman may make you more susceptible to depression",
      "Manson and other researchers noted that the sudden announcement of the funding cuts and now the possible reversal to restore funding have thrown their work into chaos.",
      "\"We've got blood samples, literally hundreds of thousands of blood samples, that have been collected over the years. It isn't clear if those bio-specimens can be fully utilized and used to advance the science that is also threatened,\" Manson said, later adding, \"We need to see whether these bio-specimens can be preserved, whether they can still be made available for ancillary study by investigators around the country, whether new biomarkers can be measured in these blood samples -- it's really unclear.\"",
      "On Friday, Manson told ABC News that she has not received confirmation from the NIH that funding for the study would continue.",
      "A third WHI regional center, located at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, also told ABC News Friday it had not been informed by the NIH of a decision to restore funding.",
      "Dr. Marian Neuhouser, a principal investigator of the WHI at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, said one of the primary duties of the study's regional centers, whose funding was originally set to be terminated in September, is to continually collect data from the tens of thousands of women still enrolled in the study.",
      "\"There aren't many studies that have such a large database of older women. We have something like 13,000 women over the age of 90 and some up to age 108,\" Neuhouser told ABC News on Thursday. \"We need to learn about these women -- what keeps them healthy, what puts them at risk, how people can remain living independently. This information helps clinicians as they interact with patients.\"",
      "She added of the women enrolled in the WHI, \"They want to be studied. They want to be part of the answer.\"",
      "Experts like Neuhouser note that the work of the WHI is landmark in part because as recently as three decades ago, women were not required to be included in medical research.",
      "In the 1970s, for example, the first clinical studies on the effects of estrogen -- the sex hormone responsible for female physical features and reproduction -- were done on men.",
      "It was only with the passage of the National Institutes of Health Revitalization Act in 1993, signed into law by then-President Bill Clinton, that the inclusion of women and people of color became required in federally funded research.",

      "There's about an even division, moreover, on Trump's efforts to deport undocumented immigrants in general. Forty-eight percent said Trump is \"going too far\" in this regard, while 50% said he's either handling it about right (34%) or not going far enough (16%).",
      "There's also a close split on the deportation of suspected gang members to an El Salvador prison without a court hearing: Forty-seven percent said they support this action, while 51% said they opposed.",

      "Trump also wins approval on immigration from 93% of his 2024 voters, compared with 8% of those who voted for former Vice President Kamala Harris. However, he falls well short among those who didn't vote for president in the 2024 elections, who disapprove of Trump on immigration by 59%-40%.",
      "In another broad partisan gap, 85% of Democrats said they think Trump is \"going too far\" with deportations. Sixty percent of Republicans said they think he's handling this about right -- and 27% said he's not going far enough. Independents again fall in between.",
      "Republicans' attitudes are not monolithic. Eighty-two percent said they support sending suspected gang members to a prison in El Salvador without court hearings.

      "Sherman, in an interview with ABC News, pointed to his position as a ranking member on the House Financial Subcommittee on Capital Markets, and that other experienced members also often get passed over for leadership positions.",
      "But Rakov is not attacking Sherman on policy. Instead, he said, \"I think there is enough of that want of generational change,\" adding that it is not about age but about people wanting their members of Congress \"to be accessible and accountable and to actually meet voters where they are emotionally.\"",
      "Sherman, speaking to ABC News, dismissed Rakov -- who he indicated had not worked with him directly -- as one of an expected number of challengers.",
      "\"I always have lots of opponents and I usually win by a huge margin,\" Sherman said.",
      "More generally, Sherman sounded a skeptical note on the efforts to primary incumbents more generally.",
      "\"I see these efforts to turn the Democratic Party into a circular firing squad \u2026 It's very difficult to see how their efforts will help us win the 2026 elections. What it means is that we waste a lot of money in the primaries,\" he said.",
      "In Indiana's 7th Congressional District, which includes much of Indianapolis, George Hornedo, a 34-year-old alum of the Obama administration and Pete Buttigieg's 2020 presidential campaign, is challenging incumbent Democratic Rep. Andr\u00e9 Carson. Hornedo alleges that Carson, 50, who was first elected to the House in 2008, has not delivered for the district.",
      "\"I'm running because my community here in Indianapolis is still waiting for everything from safer streets to affordable housing to, really, just real leadership,\" Hornedo told ABC News. \"After nearly 20 years in Congress, it's clear that Congressman Carson is just holding the seat but not actually doing anything with it.\"",
      "But Hornedo does not think the divide is simply about age or time in office. The split, he said, is between members \"like Congressman Carson\" who think the current institutions in place are working for people, \"versus those like myself that acknowledge that, of course, we have to try and protect what we currently have, but we also have to acknowledge that President Trump and Elon Musk are actively dismantling government day in and day out.\"",
      "Carson told ABC News he welcomes new voices but thinks that Democrats need to work together under a common goal -- and he pushed back against Hornedo's claims.",
      "Carson pointed to the bills he's worked on that have been signed into law, as well as his work across the aisle with Republicans and the federal funding he has delivered to Indianapolis as testament to his effectiveness.",
      "But Carson also believes his own background makes him a nontraditional member of Congress already: \"I think I'm one of the few members of Congress that have ever lived in a homeless shelter \u2026 along with my grandmother, I was raised by the community. I was raised by the village, and so I'm always sensitive to the needs of the downtrodden and the less fortunate.\"",
      "In nearby Illinois, Kat Abughazaleh, 26, a former reporter and researcher with a large social media following, announced in March that she would run for Congress in Illinois' 9th Congressional District -- currently represented by Rep. Jan Schakowsky, 80, who has not yet announced if she will run for reelection.",
      "Abughazaleh has had some early success on the fundraising front, raising more than $375,000 in the first week of her campaign, according to Federal Election Commission filings. She outraised what Schakowsky fundraised in the entire first quarter.",
      "Abughazaleh is quick to emphasize that her run is not a \"vendetta\" against the incumbent -- but she says the Democratic Party is discouraging primaries and critiques in general.",
      "\"It's time for new ideas. If what we were doing was working, then we wouldn't be in this mess in the first place,\" Abughazaleh told ABC News.",
      "Abughazaleh pointed to her own life experiences that dovetail with what younger generations are experiencing -- as someone from a generation dealing with school shooting drills, out-of-pocket medical costs, and spending most of her income on rent -- as differentiating herself from longtime members.",
      "In a statement to ABC News, Schakowsky said she will decide on her own plans \"soon, but if I do indeed decide to retire, there are dozens of talented leaders, advocates, and organizers in the 9th Congressional District who know our community and who are ready to lead the charge as we fight back against the extreme MAGA regime and Trump's shameful policies.\"",
      "She also said she has \"always encouraged more participation in the democratic process.\"",

      "Blair is now setting his sights on his next role in public office.",
      "\"I'm running because District 13, my home turf, deserves better leadership. And I think we learned a very important lesson in November and we need to respond immediately to the chaos of this administration with stronger, more competent and forceful leadership,\" Blair told ABC News in an interview.",
      "Incumbent Rep. David Scott has held the seat for 22 years, following a career in the Georgia General Assembly. Blair argues that Georgia's 13th Congressional District needs a leader who is \"agile and present\" -- qualities he no longer sees in Scott.",

      "Asked why he believes he can unseat a party heavyweight, Chakrabarti told ABC News he's done it before. He served as campaign manager for Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez during her 2018 upset victory over Democratic incumbent Joe Crowley.",
      "Chakrabarti sees echoes of 2018 in 2025: a post-Trump election environment marked by frustration among Democrats over their party's defeat.",
      "\"That moment of change, in my opinion, is dwarfed by the moment of change you see right now. The level of anger at the Democratic Party for failing is huge,\" Chakrabarti said.",
      "Chakrabarti added that those who want to stand up to Trump should also have the courage to stand up to members of their own party, including Pelosi, 85.",
      "\"The one thing we know is if we go into 2028 with the party being what it is right now, we're in trouble,\" Chakrabarti said.",

      "\"So while I'm all about supporting young people to run, they have to be thoughtful \u2026 so they can actually have a well-oiled campaign, because otherwise they're going to be, yes, a challenger, but they're not going to be able to be successful in these runs for office.\"",

    "summary": "Seven in 10 Americans think Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs on international trade will drive up U.S. inflation, according to an ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos poll.",
    "story": [
      "Roughly 47% of Republicans think tariffs will negatively impact inflation.",
      "Seven in 10 Americans think President Donald Trump's tariffs on international trade will drive up U.S. inflation, outweighing hopes that they'll boost manufacturing employment and fueling a 64% disapproval rate of how he's handling the issue.",
      "Even nearly half of Republicans -- 47% in the ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos poll released Friday -- said they think tariffs will negatively impact inflation. That jumps to 75% among independents, a swing group in national politics.",
      "The tariffs admittedly are a moving target. The administration has paused some (albeit not those on China) pending negotiations.",
      "And there is a perceived positive: 59% said they think the tariffs will have a positive impact on creating manufacturing jobs in the United States, including 90% of Republicans and 60% of independents. That, along with bringing prices down, were some of Trump's key campaign promises.",
      "But -- given the current state of play -- the scale tips negative again on a third factor: 56% in this poll, produced for ABC by Langer Research Associates with fieldwork by Ipsos, think Trump's handling of tariffs will negatively impact America's economic leadership in the world vs. 42% who see a positive impact.",
      "See PDF for full results.",
      "Democrats, for their part, are roundly opposed to the tariffs. Nine in 10 think they will negatively impact inflation (90%) and U.S. economic leadership in the world (89%) alike, and a near-unanimous 96% disapprove of Trump's handling of them. Democrats aren't sold on tariffs creating manufacturing jobs, either: 68% think they'll hurt, not help.",
      "Given inflation fears, Trump's overall rating for handling tariffs is a broad 30 percentage points underwater, 34%-64%. That's far worse than his 7-point deficit in approval on handling immigration (as reported here), demonstrating that public sentiment is especially prickly when economic well-being is on the line.",
      "Indeed, in his own party, 25% of Republicans disapprove of Trump's handling of tariffs, as do 30% of conservatives. And disapproval reaches 48% among non-college-educated white men and 47% of rural Americans, two of Trump's core support groups.",
      "Methodology: This ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos poll was conducted online via the probability-based Ipsos KnowledgePanel\u00ae April 18-22, 2025, in English and Spanish, among a random national sample of 2,464 adults. Partisan divisions are 30%-30%-29%, Democrats-Republicans-independents.",

    "story": [
      "The U.S. Supreme Court is scheduled to hear arguments in a years-long legal battle over an FBI raid on the wrong Atlanta house",
      "ATLANTA -- Before dawn on Oct. 18, 2017, FBI agents broke down the front door of Trina Martin's Atlanta home, stormed into her bedroom and pointed guns at her and her then-boyfriend as her 7-year-old son screamed for his mom from another room.",
      "Martin, blocked from comforting her son, cowered in disbelief for what she said felt like an eternity. But within minutes, the ordeal was over. The agents realized they had the wrong house.",
      "On Tuesday, an attorney for Martin will go before the U.S. Supreme Court to ask the justices to reinstate her 2019 lawsuit against the U.S. government accusing the agents of assault and battery, false arrest and other violations.",
      "A federal judge in Atlanta dismissed the suit in 2022 and the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld that decision last year. The Supreme Court agreed in January to take up the matter.",
      "The key issue before the justices is under what circumstances people can sue the federal government in an effort to hold law enforcement accountable. Martin's attorneys say Congress clearly allowed for those lawsuits in 1974, after a pair of law enforcement raids on wrong houses made headlines, and blocking them would leave little recourse for families like her.",
      "FBI Atlanta spokesperson Tony Thomas said in an email the agency can\u2019t comment on pending litigation. But lawyers for the government argued in Martin's case that courts shouldn\u2019t be \u201csecond-guessing\u201d law enforcement decisions. The FBI agents did advance work and tried to find the right house, making this raid fundamentally different from the no-knock, warrantless raids that led Congress to act in the 1970s, the Justice Department said in court filings starting under the Biden administration.",
      "In dismissing Martin's case, the 11th Circuit largely agreed with that argument, saying courts can't second-guess police officers who make \u201chonest mistakes\u201d in searches. The agent who led the raid said his personal GPS led him to the wrong place. The FBI was looking for a suspected gang member a few houses away.",
      "Martin, 46, said she, her then-boyfriend, Toi Cliatt, and her son were left traumatized.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll never be the same, mentally, emotionally, psychologically,\u201d she said Friday at the neat, stucco home that was raided. \u201cMentally, you can suppress it, but you can\u2019t really get over it.\u201d",
      "She and Cliatt pointed out where they were sleeping when the agents broke in and the master bathroom closet where they hid.",
      "Martin stopped coaching track because the starting pistol reminded her of the flashbang grenade the agents set off. Cliatt, 54, said he couldn\u2019t sleep, forcing him to leave his truck driving job.",
      "\u201cThe road is hypnotizing,\" he said of driving tired. \"I became a liability to my company.\u201d",
      "Martin said her son became extremely anxious, pulling threads out of his clothes and peeling paint off walls.",
      "Cliatt initially thought the raid was a burglary attempt, so he ran toward the closet, where he kept a shotgun. Martin said her son still expresses fear that she could have died had she confronted the agents while armed.",
      "\u201cIf the Federal Tort Claims Act provides a cause of action for anything, it\u2019s a wrong-house raid like the one the FBI conducted here,\u201d Martin's lawyers wrote in a brief to the Supreme Court.",
      "Other U.S. appeals courts have interpreted the law more favorably for victims of mistaken law enforcement raids, creating conflicting legal standards that only the nation\u2019s highest court can resolve, they say. Public-interest groups across the ideological spectrum have urged the Supreme Court to overturn the 11th Circuit ruling.",
      "After breaking down the door to the house, a member of the FBI SWAT team dragged Cliatt out of the closet and put him in handcuffs.",
      "But one of the agents noticed he did not have the suspect's tattoos, according to court documents. He asked for Cliatt's name and address. Neither matched those of the suspect. The room went quiet as agents realized they had raided the wrong house.",
      "They uncuffed Cliatt and left for the correct house, where they executed the warrant and arrested the man they were after.",
      "The agent leading the raid returned later to apologize and leave a business card with a supervisor's name. But the family received no compensation from the government, not even for the damage to the house, Cliatt said.",
      "Martin said the most harrowing part of the raid was her son's cries.",
      "\u201cWhen you're not able to protect your child or at least fight to protect your child, that's a feeling that no parent ever wants to feel,\u201d she said.",

      "U.S. states are adopting and expanding programs that use taxpayer money to pay for private schools even as their costs rise and budget pictures become more uncertain",
      "State lawmakers across the U.S. are pushing to use more taxpayer dollars to pay for private school tuitions and homeschooling expenses even as they try to figure out how to budget in a time of economic uncertainty.",
      "A $1 billion-per-year voucher program the Texas Legislature sent to the governor last week and a longshot push in Congress to expand vouchers nationally, including to states that have rejected them, are focusing attention on the issue.",
      "In states that already have programs to pay private education costs for most students, the expense has quickly gobbled up more of their budgets as revenue growth has slowed or stalled. Besides Texas, Tennessee adopted a program this year, and North Dakota gave serious consideration to one before a veto last week likely ended its prospects this year.",
      "States are required to produce annual spending plans that don't exceed what they bring in. With pandemic-era federal money mostly phased out, voucher opponents fear the programs will come at the expense of other priorities, including public schools.",
      "\u201cEven if they\u2019re being funded by separate revenue sources, it can feel like school choice programs and public schools are competing for the same slice of an increasingly smaller pie,\u201d said Page Forrest, who analyzes state finances at the nonpartisan think tank Pew.",
      "Until five years ago, the boldest school choice programs were limited to lower-income and special-needs students. More recently, scholarships and state-funded savings accounts open to most or all families have been catching on, especially in Republican-controlled states.",
      "This approach costs far more, at least in the short term. That is partly because studies of the efforts in several states have found most of the first students to enroll were already attending private schools, and not receiving taxpayer subsidies at all before the choice programs' launch.",
      "In the coming school year, voucher programs are expected to cost Florida taxpayers almost $3.9 billion, or about $1 in every $13 from the state\u2019s general revenue fund. In Arizona, it\u2019s nearly 5% of the general budget.",
      "An analysis by The Associated Press found the costs in Iowa, Ohio and Oklahoma are over 3% of state general spending this year, or are projected to be in the coming budget year.",
      "Spending is a smaller portion of the budget in states where the scholarship programs are still ramping up. Those include Arkansas, Indiana, North Carolina, Utah and West Virginia.",
      "A flood of campaign money from voucher proponents has been a key factor in convincing previously resistant Republican lawmakers to endorse school choice plans, particularly as advocates have called for more school options coming out of the COVID pandemic.",
      "Programs were approved last year in Alabama and Louisiana and this year in Tennessee, where Republican Gov. Bill Lee has said the $447 million program will be available for the upcoming school year.",
      "A New Hampshire bill raising income limits on an existing program has been moving through the legislature.",
      "In Texas on Thursday, lawmakers sent the governor a bill that would allot more than $10,000 per year for students in accredited private schools. The cost would be capped at $1 billion in the 2026-27 school year, which is a little over 1% of the annual state general funding. But by 2030, a legislative analysis found, it could cost $4.5 billion a year. That could partially be offset by a little over $800 million in savings, because there would be fewer public school students to subsidize.",
      "The Texas House also approved a nearly $8 billion boost to the public education system, which advocates say doesn't cover extra expenses due to inflation.",
      "In energy-dependent North Dakota, GOP Gov. Kelly Armstrong vetoed an education savings account program, saying it wouldn't expand options for all students and there were implementation problems. He has since said the concept remains a priority for him.",
      "Erin Oban, an organizer with North Dakotans for Public Schools, said the program's costs and unknowns about the state's financial outlook make it a bad time to start a voucher program.",
      "\"I think it would be a very long-term challenge to fund something in the short term you think might be a good idea or that somehow we can afford right now,\u201d she said.",
      "Congressional Republicans are looking to extend an assortment of tax cuts passed in President Donald Trump\u2019s first term, plus enact new tax cuts for overtime, tips and Social Security benefits. Proponents of the school choice credit will face stiff competition when it comes to getting included in that mix.",
      "In Ohio, under a budget proposed by House Republicans, vouchers would see a bigger funding increase than public schools starting in July 2026. The plan, which was passed this month, also calls for a way for the state to take back some property tax money already collected by school districts.",
      "Democratic state Rep. Bride Rose Sweeney said she doesn\u2019t have a problem with vouchers, so long as public schools are fully funded. But she says the budget plan falls short of that.",
      "It also would continue to increase the amount available for scholarships to private schools, including for the first time making a portion of them available to institutions that operate without any state oversight.",
      "\u201cNinety percent of Ohio\u2019s kids are still in the public schools,\u201d Sweeney said. \u201cThey are increasing still more into vouchers while still not giving the public schools what they need \u2014 even though that\u2019s where the bulk of the money is coming from.\u201d",
      "Rachel Brady, a mother of four in Wake Forest, North Carolina, was a leader in a successful push last year for lawmakers to fully fund scholarships after one of her children, and thousands of others, were put on a waiting list after the initial allocation was exhausted.",

The lake is about 230 miles (370 kilometers) west of Kansas City, home to the Corps district office for parts of Kansas, Missouri and southern Nebraska.",

      "U.S. officials say the wife of an active-duty Coast Guardsman was arrested earlier this week by federal immigration authorities inside the family residential section of the U.S. Naval Air Station at Key West, Florida, after she was flagged in a securit...",
      "WASHINGTON -- The wife of an active-duty Coast Guardsman was arrested earlier this week by federal immigration authorities inside the family residential section of the U.S. Naval Air Station at Key West, Florida, after she was flagged in a routine security check, officials said Saturday.",
      "\u201cThe spouse is not a member of the Coast Guard and was detained by Homeland Security Investigations pursuant to a lawful removal order,\u201d said Coast Guard spokesperson Lt. Cmdr. Steve Roth in a statement confirming Thursday\u2019s on-base arrest. \u201cThe Coast Guard works closely with HSI and others to enforce federal laws, including on immigration.\u201d",
      "According to a U.S. official, the woman's work visa expired around 2017, and she was marked for removal from the United States a few years later. She and the Coast Guardsman were married early this year, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss an enforcement incident.",
      "Though the Trump administration has made immigration arrests a top priority for federal law enforcement, it did not immediately appear the on-base arrest of the military spouse was part of a broader sweep.",
      "The official said that when the woman and her Coast Guard husband were preparing to move into their on-base housing on Wednesday, they went to the visitor control center to get a pass so she could access the Key West installation. During the routine security screening required for base access, the woman's name was flagged as a problem.",
      "Base personnel contacted the Naval Criminal Investigative Service, which looked into the matter, said the official. NCIS and Coast Guard security personnel got permission from the base commander to enter the installation and then went to the Coast Guardsman's home on Thursday, the official said. They were joined by personnel from Homeland Security Investigations, a unit within Immigration and Customs Enforcement.",
      "HSI eventually took the spouse into custody, and the official said they believe she is still being detained. Officials did not provide the name of the country she is from.",
      "The Coast Guard referred questions about the woman\u2019s identity, immigration status and charges to ICE, which did not respond to a request for comment on Saturday. The Department of Homeland Security also did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "The husband of the arrested woman is a Coast Guardsman assigned to the USCGC Mohawk, a 270-foot-long cutter based at Key West. The couple was moving into U.S. government housing at the nearby Naval Air Station.",
      "An online database that tracks ship movements shows the Mohawk has been docked in its home port since mid-March. A March 16 media release says the ship had recently returned following a 70-day deployment to the Eastern Pacific Ocean on a mission to intercept shipments of illegal drugs.",
      "In a statement, the Navy said that it \u201cfully cooperated with federal law enforcement authorities on this matter. We take security and access at naval installations seriously.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Chris Murphy has been touring the country talking to voters, and some people are starting to view the Democratic senator from Connecticut as worthy of the national spotlight",
      "SAXAPAHAW, N.C. -- Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy isn\u2019t drawing stadium-size crowds like Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez are as he tours the country talking to voters. But in a packed concert hall in rural North Carolina, people are starting to view the Democrat as worthy of the national spotlight.",
      "Murphy and Rep. Maxwell Frost, D-Fla., have been staging events in Republican congressional districts in recent weeks, trolling GOP lawmakers such as Rep. Richard Hudson, who represents the area they visited Thursday. Hudson, the chairman of the House GOP campaign arm, has discouraged Republicans from holding town halls, so Murphy and Frost decided to hold one on his home turf in North Carolina.",
      "\u201cWe are doing the job that these Republican congressmen and senators won\u2019t do,\u201d Murphy told the hyped-up crowd of mostly older voters at the event, while acknowledging that Democrats need to do more to soothe their anxiety and counter President Donald Trump. \u201cI want to make sure that everywhere, in every corner of this country, people are willing to stand up and fight.\u201d",
      "As other Democrats grasp for a response to Trump\u2019s election, unsure of how to confront him, Murphy is channeling his own frustration and anger into a sustained blitz of television appearances, fundraising appeals, Senate floor speeches and events like the one in North Carolina. He also is talking directly to voters on social media, including through lengthy live videos on Instagram where he sits in his kitchen with a cocktail and tries to explain what he sees as \u201cthe central story\u201d of Trump\u2019s presidency \u2014 \u201cthe billionaire takeover of our government made possible by the destruction of our democracy.\u201d",
      "It's a methodical approach for Murphy, 51, a serious-minded legislator who has been most well known for his yearslong fight to stem gun violence in the aftermath of the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, that killed 20 first-grade students and six educators.",
      "While the kitchen talks on Instagram seem to come more naturally to Murphy than riling up a crowd, his message is clearly resonating with his party's base of voters, many of whom are angry at Democrats in Washington for inaction. He raised around $8 million in the first quarter of the year, a significant sum that could rival the totals for Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez, who have been drawing much larger crowds on a tour together.",
      "\u201cI mean, I\u2019m not Bernie Sanders,\u201d Murphy said in an interview after the event in Saxapahaw. \u201cI\u2019m not going to draw 70,000 people. But that doesn\u2019t mean that I don\u2019t still have an obligation to try to go out and support a national mobilization.\u201d",
      "Frustration with the Democratic Party\u2019s leaders came to a boil last month, with most of the anger directed at Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York, who voted for a Republican bill to keep the government open just as the base was hoping to see more fight from their elected officials. Murphy was strongly against the bill, even if opposing it meant Democrats would trigger a government shutdown.",
      "\u201cI think when people see us engaged in risk adverse behavior, then they are much less likely to show up for rallies to ultimately engage in the kind of civil disobedience we might need to save the democracy,\u201d Murphy said.",
      "His fundraising haul, and his barrage of media and events, begs questions about his future ambitions. But it is unclear where Murphy\u2019s moment might lead. He insists that he is not thinking about a presidential bid or a future in Senate leadership after the No. 2 Democrat, Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, announced this week that he will retire next year.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s probably not a coincidence that my content is breaking through and more people are listening to me at a time when I\u2019m not getting up every day thinking about my personal political future,\u201d said Murphy, who was reelected to the Senate last year.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s not going to be an election in 2028 if we don\u2019t win this fight right now. So it seems kind of silly to think about anything other than the emergency that exists today. I\u2019m not trying to avoid the question. It\u2019s not a cop out. That is legitimately what drives me.\u201d",
      "Ron Osborne, the chairman of the Democratic Party in Alamance County, where Thursday\u2019s event was located, said he had not previously considered Murphy a major contender for the presidency in 2028. But \u201che\u2019s doing the right things,\" Osborne said.",
      "\"He is speaking out where others could do the same thing and have not,\u201d Osborne said, and \u201cthat takes courage.\u201d",
      "Terry Greenlund, a 78-year-old Democrat who was also in the audience, said he thinks Murphy \u201chas a way of talking with people.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s time for a new generation to move in with some new views and insight and energy,\u201d Greenlund said, echoing many others in the room.",
      "Murphy, 51 and the father of two teenagers, seems to be enjoying the attention. He joked at the event that he may not be as \u201ccool\u201d as Frost, who is the youngest member of Congress at 28. But Murphy is still decades younger than many of his colleagues, who have controlled the party for years.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m trying to be dad cool,\u201d Murphy said.",
      "Murphy was in Missouri on Friday after visiting a Republican district in Michigan with Frost last month. And they are not the only Democrats venturing into red states. In addition to Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, the 2024 vice presidential nominee, and Rep. Ro Khanna of California have also recently traveled to talk to voters in Republican areas.",
      "Murphy said he does not want to \u201creinvent the wheel\u201d with his fundraising haul, but he does not want to sit on it, either. He said he plans to help organizations mobilize voters before the 2026 midterm elections and also put pressure on Republicans as they try to push tax and spending cuts through Congress.",
      "\u201cThe only way that history tells us that you stop an elected leader from converting a country away from democracy is mass mobilization,\u201d he said.",
      "\"Our party has made mistakes, and if we don\u2019t learn from those mistakes,\" Murphy said, \u201cwe're cooked.\u201d",

      "An AP-NORC poll finds many Americans don't agree with President Trump\u2019s aggressive efforts to quickly enact his agenda, and even Republicans aren't overwhelmingly convinced his attention has been in the right place",
      "WASHINGTON -- Many Americans do not agree with President Trump\u2019s aggressive efforts to quickly enact his agenda, a new poll finds, and even Republicans are not overwhelmingly convinced that his attention has been in the right place.",
      "Americans are nearly twice as likely to say Trump has been mostly focusing on the wrong priorities as to say he has been focusing on the right ones, according to the survey from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.",
      "Further, about 4 in 10 Americans say Trump has been a \u201cterrible\u201d president in his second term, and about 1 in 10 say he has been \u201cpoor.\u201d In contrast, about 3 in 10 say he has been \u201cgreat or \u201dgood,\u201d while just under 2 in 10 say he has been \u201caverage.\u201d",
      "Most haven\u2019t been shocked by the drama of Trump\u2019s first 100 days. About 7 in 10 U.S. adults say the first few months of Trump\u2019s second term have been mostly what they expected, and only about 3 in 10 say the Republican president\u2019s actions have been mostly unexpected.",
      "But that does not mean they are pleased with how those opening months have gone.",
      "In fact, Democrats seem even unhappier with the reality of the second Trump term than before he was sworn in on Jan. 20. About three-quarters of Democrats say Trump is focused on the wrong topics and about 7 in 10 think he has been a \u201cterrible\u201d president so far. That is an increase from January, when about 6 in 10 anticipated that he would be \u201cterrible.\u201d",
      "Rahsaan Henderson, a Democrat from California, said \u201cit has been one of the longest 100 days I\u2019ve ever had to sit through.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think the next four years will be a test of seeing who can resist the most and continue defying whatever he\u2019s trying to do, since he defies everything, including the Supreme Court,\u201d said Henderson, 40.",
      "Republicans are largely standing behind the president, but are ambivalent about what he has chosen to emphasize. About 7 in 10 say he has been at least a \u201cgood\u201d president. But only about half say he has mostly had the right priorities so far, while about one-quarter say it has been about an even mix and about 1 in 10 said Trump has mostly had the wrong priorities.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s really doing the stuff that he said he was going to do,\u201d said Tanner Bergstrom, 29, a Republican from Minnesota. He is \u201cnot making a bunch of promises and getting into office and nothing happens. ... I really like that. Even if it\u2019s some stuff I don\u2019t agree with, it\u2019s still doing what he said he was going to do.\u201d",
      "Those who were surprised by Trump\u2019s first few months seem to have had a rude awakening. The people who say Trump\u2019s actions were not what they expected \u2014 who are mostly Democrats and independents \u2014 are more likely to say Trump has had mostly the wrong priorities and that he has been a poor or terrible president, compared with the people who mostly expected his actions.",
      "About 4 in 10 in the survey approve of how Trump is handling the presidency overall. The issue of immigration is a relative strength. According to the poll, 46% of U.S. adults approve of his handling of the issue, which is slightly higher than his overall approval. But there are also indications that foreign policy, trade negotiationsand the economy could prove problematic as he aims to prove his approach will benefit the country.",
      "Trump\u2019s approval on those issues is much lower than it is on immigration. Only about 4 in 10 U.S. adults approve of how he is handling each. Republicans are less likely to approve of Trump\u2019s approach to trade and the economy than immigration.",
      "There are additional signals that some Trump supporters may not be thrilled with his performance so far. The share of Republicans who say he has been at least a \u201cgood\u201d president has fallen about 10 percentage points since January. They also have grown a bit more likely to say Trump will be either \u201cpoor\u201d or \u201cterrible,\u201d although only 16% describe his first few months that way.",
      "Republican Stephanie Melnyk, 45, from Tennessee, is supportive of Trump\u2019s handling of the presidency more broadly but said she did not approve of his handling of foreign affairs, particularly on the war in Ukraine. Melnyk\u2019s family emigrated from Ukraine and she said Trump is \u201ctrying for a quick fix that\u2019s not going to last\u201d and that Russian President Vladimir Putin \u201cis not to be trusted.\u201d",
      "Melnyk, who voted for Trump largely for his positions on immigration, said she wished the president would stay on script.",
      "\u201cHe sounds like he can be very condescending, and it sounds like my way or the highway,\u201d Melnyk said. \u201cIt\u2019s like, dude. You\u2019re not 12.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s common, though, for a president\u2019s standing to be at its best before taking office and beginning the work of governing. And Trump continues to hold high approval from Republicans.",
      "About 4 in 10 Americans have a favorable opinion of Trump, roughly in line with his approval number. Among Republicans, the figure is about double: About 8 in 10 Republicans have a positive view of the president, and about the same share approves of how he is handling the presidency. About one-third of U.S. adults have a favorable opinion of Vice President JD Vance, including about 7 in 10 Republicans.",
      "Those Republicans interviewed were particularly fond of efforts to scale back the size of the federal government led by billionaire outside adviser Elon Musk and Trump\u2019s cost-cutting initiative, the Department of Government Efficiency, known as DOGE.",
      "\u201cOverall, I would have to say that I\u2019m happy with the Trump presidency,\u201d said Matthew Spencer, 30, a Republican from Texas. \u201cI think that the Department of Government Efficiency has made great strides in reducing our spending, and I also agree with putting America first. I agree with the policies he\u2019s put in as far as border protection and America standing for itself again as far as the tariffs.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re only three months in, but so far, so good,\u201d said Carlos Guevara, 46, who lives in Florida. Guevara, a Republican, said DOGE has been a \u201csmash hit\u201d and on tariffs, and while there may be short-term pain, \u201cif that does encourage businesses to start manufacturing here ... then that\u2019ll wash out over time.\u201d",
      "Democrats have a much bleaker outlook on the economy than they held before Trump took office. The poll also found that the vast majority of Democrats think he has \u201cgone too far\u201d on deportations and tariffs.",
      "Gabriel Antonucci, 26, a Democrat who recently moved to South Carolina, said Trump\u2019s second term is \u201cjust a lot more ridiculous\u201d than he had anticipated.",
      "\u201cIt really seems like he is doing everything he can to make the wrong decisions,\u201d Antonucci said. \u201cThings are probably going to be worse in four years than they are right now.\u201d",

      "Iran and the United States have started in-depth negotiations in Oman over Tehran\u2019s rapidly advancing nuclear program, talks that likely will hinge on the Islamic Republic\u2019s enrichment of uranium",
      "MUSCAT, Oman -- Iran and the United States began in-depth negotiations in Oman over Tehran's rapidly advancing nuclear program on Saturday, talks that likely will hinge on the Islamic Republic's enrichment of uranium.",
      "Iranian state television reported the talks had begun in Muscat, the mountain-wrapped capital of this sultanate on the eastern edge of the Arabian Peninsula. However, neither Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi nor U.S. Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff offered any immediate specifics or details on the talks that they'll lead.",
      "Araghchi arrived Friday in Oman and met with Omani Foreign Minister Badr al-Busaidi, who has mediated the two previous round of talks in Muscat and Rome. Araghchi then visited the Muscat International Book Fair, surrounded by television cameras and photojournalists. Video late Saturday morning showed Araghchi heading to the talks.",
      "Witkoff was in Moscow on Friday meeting Russian President Vladimir Putin. He arrived Saturday to Oman, where the talks were expected to start in the coming hours, a source familiar with Witkoff's travels told The Associated Press, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the closed-door negotiations.",
      "The talks seek to limit Iran\u2019s nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of some of the crushing economic sanctions the U.S. has imposed on the Islamic Republic closing in on half a century of enmity.",
      "U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly threatened to unleash airstrikes targeting Iran\u2019s program if a deal isn\u2019t reached. Iranian officials increasingly warn that they could pursue a nuclear weapon with their stockpile of uranium enriched to near weapons-grade levels.",
      "Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers did limit Tehran's program. However, Trump unilaterally withdrew from it in 2018, setting in motion years of attacks and tensions. The wider Middle East also remains on edge over the devastating Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip.",
      "Trump, traveling to Rome for the funeral of Pope Francis, again said he hoped negotiations would lead to a new nuclear deal. However, he still held out the possibility of a military strike if they didn't.",
      "\u201cThe Iran situation is coming out very well,\u201d Trump said on Air Force One. \u201cWe've had a lot of talks with them and I think we're going to have a deal. I'd much rather have a deal than the other alternative. That would be good for humanity.\"",
      "He added: \u201cThere are some people that want to make a different kind of a deal \u2014 a much nastier deal \u2014 and I don\u2019t want that to happen to Iran if we can avoid it.\u201d",
      "While Araghchi and Witkoff are again expected to speak through the Omanis, experts on both sides also will begin negotiating details of a possible deal.",
      "From the Iranian side, Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Majid Takht-e Ravanchi will lead Tehran\u2019s expert team, said Mohammad Golzari, an Iranian government official. Takht-e Ravanchi took part in the 2015 nuclear talks.",
      "The U.S. technical team, which is expected to arrive in Oman on Friday, will be led by Michael Anton, the director of U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio\u2019s policy planning staff. Anton does not have the nuclear policy experience of those who led America\u2019s efforts in the 2015 talks.",
      "Iran has insisted that keeping its enrichment is key. But Witkoff has muddied the issue by first suggesting in a television interview that Iran could enrich uranium at 3.67%, then later saying that all enrichment must stop. That demand all enrichment stop also has been repeated by U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio.",
      "However, Iranians remain hopeful the talks could be successful, as the Iranian rial has rebounded from historic lows during which it took over 1 million rial to buy $1.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s OK to negotiate, to make the nuclear program smaller or bigger, and reach a deal,\u201d Tehran resident Farzin Keivan said. \u201cOf course we shouldn\u2019t give them everything. After all, we\u2019ve suffered a lot for this program.\u201d",

      "Russian-born scientist Kseniia Petrova has been detained by U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement since February when she failed to declare frog embryo samples at Boston's Logan Airport",
      "BATON ROUGE, La. -- Kseniia Petrova never imagined she would face significant immigration issues, but it has been 68 days since she was detained at the Boston airport while traveling with undeclared frog embryo samples.",
      "The Russian-born scientist and Harvard University researcher associate was in the United States legally. But she finds herself thrust into a detention system that has been in the national spotlight as President Donald Trump pursues his promise of mass deportations.",
      "Petrova, 30, was sent to a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Louisiana where she continues to await a judge's decision on whether she will be deported to Russia, where she fears she will be imprisoned or worse.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security accuses Petrova of knowingly breaking the law, while friends and advocates are calling for her release and saying the incident was an infraction that normally would be punishable by a fine.",
      "As Petrova spends days in a crowded dormitory awaiting her fate, her colleagues say their research, including using a one-of-a-kind cancer-detecting microscope, will be delayed or moot without the scientist who they say plays a critical role.",
      "\u201cThe truth is on my side,\u201d said Petrova, who spoke with The Associated Press on Friday in a video call from the Louisiana ICE detention center in Monroe. She held an outdated phone to one ear and pressed her fingers against the other trying to block out muffled background conversations in various languages.",
      "Behind Petrova were steel bunkbeds, a few tables, two microwaves and a television showing CNN.",
      "\u201cAlmost all our life is happening in this dorm,\u201d Petrova said.",
      "Dozens of woman walked around Petrova. She said many were Latin Americans, some who crossed the border illegally. Other immigrants had been in the country for a long time and were detained after missing a check-in with ICE. There are others who Petrova said were in the facility \"without any sense or any reason, really any point\" about why they were detained.",
      "Petrova is not aware of any other scientists in the dorm housing 99 women.",
      "Petrova described the facility's food as \"absolutely terrible\", mainly carbohydrates without fruits or vegetables. Detainees typically get an hour outside unless it's raining, a regular occurrence this time of year in the Bayou State.",
      "People spend the night shivering because the dorm is cold, the showers are painfully hot, privacy is absent and the constant noise makes it \u201chard to live,\" she said.",
      "A couple months earlier, Petrova had been vacationing in France, where she stopped at a lab specializing in splicing superfine sections of a frog embryos and obtained a package of samples to be used for research.",
      "As she passed through a customs checkpoint in Boston's Logan Airport, Petrova was questioned about the samples. Petrova told the AP she didn't realize the items needed to be declared and was not trying to sneak in anything. After an interrogation, Petrova was told her visa was being cancelled.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security said in a statement on X that Petrova was detained after \u201clying to federal officers about carrying substances into the country.\u201d They allege messages on her phone \u201crevealed she planned to smuggle the materials through customs without declaring them.\"",
      "Petrova's boss and mentor, Leon Peshkin, said the samples were not in any way dangerous or biohazardous.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think she did anything wrong,\u201d Peshkin told the AP. \u201cBut even if she did, at most she should have gotten a warning or maybe a fine of up to $500.\u201d",
      "Harvard said in a statement that the university \u201ccontinues to monitor the situation.\u201d",
      "Petrova has a very special scientific skill set required by the work, said Peshkin, a principal research scientist at Harvard\u2019s Department of Systems Biology who explained Petrova is assisting an investigation into the earliest stages of cell division using frog embryos.",
      "\u201cShe has made herself crucial to pretty much every project that\u2019s going on in the lab. I don\u2019t know how we\u2019re gonna continue without her,\u201d Peshkin said.",
      "Will Trim, a postdoctoral fellow and Petrova's roommate, backed the description of her scientific value. He has worked with her as she writes computer scripts to read images from a unique microscope that Trim believes has the potential to make breakthroughs in cancer detection.",
      "\u201cSome very important research will end if she\u2019s gone,\" Trim said.",
      "Trim boarded a flight to Louisiana on Friday to visit Petrova, who is allotted one visitor a week.",
      "The facility is one of nine immigration detention centers in the state, all located in the rural north or western parts of the state. Many detainees have complained of isolation as they are held long distances from their families and attorneys.",
      "Louisiana has been at the center of other high-profile immigration cases, including the detention of Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University activist.",
      "Like many others in detention, Petrova left her country to avoid conflict or possible political repression. She fled after Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, marking the start of a bloody three-year war.",
      "\"If I go back, I am afraid I will be imprisoned because of my political position and my position against war,\u201d Petrova said.",
      "A Louisiana immigration judge earlier this week found the federal government\u2019s case to be legally insufficient and gave ICE a week to submit stronger evidence.",
      "Petrova's case is being closely watched by the scientific community, with some fearing it could impact recruiting and retaining foreign scientists at U.S. universities.",
      "\u201cI think that there is a wrong perception that foreign scientists are somehow privileged to be in the United States. I feel it\u2019s the opposite,\u201d Peshkin said. \u201cForeign scientists come here with gifts ... they are highly skilled experts who are in demand. They enrich the American scientific community.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "A new tribal national park in North Dakota is opening a little-seen area of the rugged Badlands to hikers and other outdoors enthusiasts",
      "BISMARCK, N.D. -- A new tribal national park in North Dakota's rugged Badlands is opening a little-seen area of the dramatic landscape to hikers and other outdoors enthusiasts, part of a Native American tribe's efforts to preserve the land and encourage recreation.",
      "The Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara Nation established Three Affiliated Tribes National Park with the purchase of 2,100 acres (850 hectares) of a former ranch adjacent to the Fort Berthold Reservation's boundaries on the south side of the Little Missouri River.",
      "The area was in the tribe's original treaty lands but a government allotment act later reduced the reservation's size, said Mary Fredericks, director of the tribe\u2019s Parks and Reserve Program. The reservation's boundaries have expanded to include the park.",
      "Tribal Chairman Mark Fox said the goal is to establish a park for cultural and recreational purposes such as canoeing, kayaking and viewing wildlife.",
      "\u201cIt's part of our history, our lands, very significant to us, the whole area,\u201d Fox said. \u201cThis is just another strong move to reacquire some of our lands and then do something very effective with it, so to speak\u201d to aid tourism and the economy through recreation.",
      "Park officials are being careful with how they plan and develop the park to be thoughtful about impacts on the landscape.",
      "\u201cThis place will be here in perpetuity and it will be better when we are done than it was when we got it, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re pushing for, that\u2019s where we\u2019re headed,\u201d Park Superintendent Ethan White Calfe said.",
      "North Dakota's Badlands \u2014 the name denotes the difficult terrain \u2014 comprise a stark, erosive, colorful landscape with dramatic shapes, petrified wood and ancient fossils. The area draws hikers, campers, hunters, bicyclists and other outdoors enthusiasts.",
      "The park, which held a soft opening in September, is open only to foot traffic by a free permit online. Park officials require visitors to register their plans and hikers must park at a grass lot. By the end of the summer, organizers hope to have 10 miles (16 kilometers) of trails finished, Fredericks said.",
      "Plans to build a visitor center and campground are in the works. Park officials also intend to work on native prairie and soil restoration in the erosive environment where some native plants that thrive in the area have been pushed out by invasive species, White Calfe said.",
      "\u201cWe're looking at it as how do we help this area look like it did 300 years ago? How do we help this area heal to where it is in a lot of more of a state of equilibrium,\u201d White Calfe said.",
      "It's a beautiful and picturesque but deceptive and steep landscape, Fredericks said.",
      "The park is bisected by a state highway that drops from a flat into a rugged river bottom. People can see parts of the park while driving, but not its interior, she said.",
      "Eventually, the park could be a gateway for visitors to the reservation, Fredericks said. Outdoor recreation is available at Lake Sakakawea, which straddles the vast reservation, and nearby at Theodore Roosevelt National Park and the Maah Daah Hey Trail.",
      "The MHA Nation benefits from oil development on its reservation, which helped the tribe to afford the land for the park, Fredericks said.",
      "\u201cBut in that we have to be careful and preserve and conserve,\u201d she said. \u201cI'm very, very proud of our tribal council for having the foresight to buy this land with the intent of making it into a national park ... because we don't know what's going to happen 50 years from now and what our landscape is going to look like, but we can preserve this part of it.\u201d",
      "The park neighbors Little Missouri State Park, which draws horseback riders to its 40 miles (64 kilometers) of trails in the Badlands.",
      "The rugged landscape \u201ckind of has that almost spiritual feel to it. It's peaceful,\u201d state Parks and Recreation Department Director Cody Schulz said.",
      "State park officials have worked with the tribe for about two years on its plans and partnering together, such as connecting trail systems, Schulz said. Tribal park officials are collaborating with anyone willing, Fredericks said.",
      "White Calfe said the park is an opportunity \u201cto tell our own story, our own narrative from our own perspective in a place like this. That's pretty valuable.\u201d",

      "Sixty years after the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. led a rally protesting housing discrimination and segregated schools in Boston, thousands of people are expected to gather at the same site to honor and reflect on the historic event",
      "BOSTON -- As a Black teenager growing up in Boston, Wayne Lucas vividly remembers joining some 20,000 people to hear the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. speak out against the city's segregated school system and the entrenched poverty in poor communities.",
      "Sixty years on, Lucas will be back on the Boston Common on Saturday to celebrate the anniversary of what became known as the 1965 Freedom Rally. This time, though, Lucas expects much of the focus will be on President Donald Trump and concerns that the commander-in-chief is exploiting divisions and fears about race and immigration.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s different forms of, how do we say it, racism and also I have to include fascism, what\u2019s going on in this country,\u201d said Lucas, a social activist and retired postal worker who was standing on the Boston Common near the site of 20-foot-high (6-meter) memorial to racial equity, \u201cThe Embrace,\u201d where the rally will be held.",
      "The rally will be preceded by a march mostly along the route taken to the Boston Common in 1965 and feature up to 125 different organizations.",
      "\u201cPeople gotta be aware and say something.\" he continued. \u201cWe can grumble (and) stuff like that, but we need to take part and do something.\"",
      "The original protest rally in 1965 brought the civil rights movement to the Northeast, a place King knew well from his time earning a doctorate in theology from Boston University and serving as assistant minister at the city\u2019s Twelfth Baptist Church. It was also the place he met his wife, Coretta Scott King, who earned a degree in music education from the New England Conservatory.",
      "In his speech, King told the crowd that he returned to Boston not to condemn the city but to encourage its leaders to do better at a time when Black leaders were fighting to desegregate the schools and housing and working to improve economic opportunities for Black residents. King also implored Boston to become a leader that other cities like New York and Chicago could follow in conducting \u201cthe creative experiments in the abolition of ghettos.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt would be demagogic and dishonest for me to say that Boston is a Birmingham, or to equate Massachusetts with Mississippi,\u201d he told the crowd. \u201cBut it would be morally irresponsible were I to remain blind to the threat to liberty, the denial of opportunity, and the crippling poverty that we face in some sections of this community.\u201d",
      "The Boston rally happened after President Lyndon Johnson signed the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and months ahead of the enactment of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 signed in August.",
      "King and other civil rights movement leaders had just come off the Selma to Montgomery march in Alabama, also referred to as Blood Sunday, weeks before the Boston rally. The civil rights icon also was successful in the 1963 Birmingham campaign prompting the end of legalized racial segregation in the Alabama city, and eventually throughout the nation.",
      "This time in Boston, King's eldest son, Martin Luther King III, will be the keynote speaker. He and other speakers are expected to touch on some of the same issues that have plagued communities of color for decades including the need for good jobs, decent health care and affordable housing.",
      "His visit also comes at a time when the Trump administration is waging war on diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives in government, schools and businesses around the country, including in Massachusetts.",
      "Since his Jan. 20 inauguration, Trump has banned diversity initiatives across the federal government. The administration has launched investigations of colleges \u2014 public and private \u2014 that it accuses of discriminating against white and Asian students with race-conscious admissions programs intended to address historic inequities in access for Black students.",
      "The Defense Department at one point temporarily removed training videos recognizing the Tuskegee Airmen and an online biography of Jackie Robinson. In February, Trump fired Air Force Gen. CQ Brown Jr., a champion of racial diversity in the military, as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Brown, in the wake of Floyd\u2019s killing, had spoken publicly about his experiences as a Black man, and was only the second Black general to serve as chairman.",
      "The administration has fired diversity officers across government, curtailed some agencies\u2019 celebrations of Black History Month and terminated grants and contracts for projects ranging from planting trees in disadvantaged communities to studying achievement gaps in American schools. Trump also wants to force changes at the Smithsonian Institution with an executive order targeting funding for programs that advance \u201cdivisive narratives\u201d and \u201cimproper ideology.\"",
      "The efforts also impact Massachusetts. The state has pushed back against threats from the Trump administration to cut funding if the state doesn't comply with an Education Department order to certify local school systems' compliance with a race-neutral interpretation of civil rights laws.",
      "The Museum of African American History in Boston also announced earlier this month that a $500,000 federal grant received last year has been terminated.",
      "\u201cMake no mistake, these efforts are designed to marginalize and destabilize the Museum of African American History, and African American public history institutions like us,\" the museum wrote in a statement. \u201cWe are all in danger of being erased.\u201d",
      "Martin Luther King III told The Associated Press that the attacks on diversity make little sense, noting, \u201cWe cannot move forward without understanding what happened in the past.\"",
      "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s about blaming people. It\u2019s not about collective guilt. It\u2019s about collective responsibility,\u201d he continued. \u201cHow do we become better? Well, we appreciate everything that helped us to get to where we are. Diversity hasn't hurt the country.\u201d",
      "King said opponents of diversity have floated an uninformed narrative that unqualified people of color are taking jobs from white people, when the reality is they have long been denied opportunities they deserve.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know if white people understand this, but Black people are tolerant,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom knee-high to a grasshopper, you have to be five times better than your white colleague. And that\u2019s how we prepare ourselves. So it\u2019s never a matter of unqualified, it\u2019s a matter of being excluded.\u201d",
      "Imari Paris Jeffries, the president and CEO of Embrace Boston, which along with the city is putting on the rally, said the event is a chance to remind people that elements of the \u201cpromissory note\u201d King referred to in his \u201cI Have A Dream\u201d speech remain \"out of reach\u201d for many people.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re having a conversation about democracy. This is the promissory note \u2014 public education, public housing, public health, access to public art,\u201d Paris Jeffries said. \"All of these things are a part of democracy. Those are the things that are actually being threatened right now.\u201d",

      "Coal-fired power plants, long a money-losing proposition in the U.S., are becoming more valuable now",
      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- Coal-fired power plants, long an increasingly money-losing proposition in the U.S., are becoming more valuable now that the suddenly strong demand for electricity to run Big Tech's cloud computing and artificial intelligence applications has set off a full-on sprint to find new energy sources.",
      "President Donald Trump \u2014 who has pushed for U.S. \u201cenergy dominance\u201d in the global market and suggested that coal can help meet surging power demand \u2014 is wielding his emergency authority to entice utilities to keep older coal-fired plants online and producing electricity.",
      "While some utilities were already delaying the retirement of coal-fired plants, the scores of coal-fired plants that have been shut down the past couple years \u2014 or will be shut down in the next couple years \u2014 are the object of growing interest from tech companies, venture capitalists, states and others competing for electricity.",
      "That\u2019s because they have a very attractive quality: high-voltage lines connecting to the electricity grid that they aren\u2019t using anymore and that a new power plant could use.",
      "That ready-to-go connection could enable a new generation of power plants \u2014 gas, nuclear, wind, solar or even battery storage \u2014 to help meet the demand for new power sources more quickly.",
      "For years, the bureaucratic nightmare around building new high-voltage power lines has ensnared efforts to get permits for such interconnections for new power plants, said John Jacobs, an energy policy analyst for the Washington, D.C.-based Bipartisan Policy Center.",
      "\u201cThey are very interested in the potential here. Everyone sort of sees the writing on the wall for the need for transmission infrastructure, the need for clean firm power, the difficulty with siting projects and the value of reusing brownfield sites,\u201d Jacobs said.",
      "Coincidentally, the pace of retirements of the nation's aging coal-fired plants had been projected to accelerate at a time when electricity demand is rising for the first time in decades.",
      "The Department of Energy, in a December report, said its strategy for meeting that demand includes re-using coal plants, which have been unable to compete with a flood of cheap natural gas while being burdened with tougher pollution regulations aimed at its comparatively heavy emissions of planet-warming greenhouse gases.",
      "There are federal incentives, as well \u2014 such as tax credits and loan guarantees \u2014 that encourage the redevelopment of retired coal-fired plants into new energy sources.",
      "Todd Snitchler, president and CEO of the Electric Power Supply Association, which represents independent power plant owners, said he expected Trump's executive orders will mean some coal-fired plants run longer than they would have \u2014 but that they are still destined for retirement.",
      "Time is of the essence in getting power plants online.",
      "Data center developers are reporting a yearlong wait in some areas to connect to the regional electricity grid. Rights-of-way approvals to build power lines can also be difficult to secure, given objections by neighbors who may not want to live near them.",
      "Stephen DeFrank, chairman of the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, said he believes rising energy demand has made retiring coal-fired plants far more valuable.",
      "That's especially true now that the operator of the congested mid-Atlantic power grid has re-configured its plans to favor sites like retired coal-fired plants as a shortcut to meet demand, DeFrank said.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s going to make these properties more valuable because now, as long as I\u2019m shovel ready, these power plants have that connection already established, I can go in and convert it to whatever,\" DeFrank said.",
      "In Pennsylvania, the vast majority of conversions is likely to be natural gas because Pennsylvania sits atop the prolific Marcellus Shale reservoir, DeFrank said.",
      "In states across the South, utilities are replacing retiring or retired coal units with gas. That includes a plant owned by the Tennessee Valley Authority; a Duke Energy project in North Carolina; and a Georgia Power plant.",
      "The high-voltage lines at retired coal plants on the Atlantic Coast in New Jersey and Massachusetts were used to connect offshore wind turbines to electricity grids.",
      "In Alabama, the site of a coal-fired plant, Plant Gorgas, shuttered in 2019, will become home to Alabama Power\u2019s first utility-scale battery energy storage plant.",
      "Texas-based Vistra, meanwhile, is in the process of installing solar panels and energy storage plants at a fleet of retired and still-operating coal-fired plants it owns in Illinois, thanks in part to state subsidies approved there in 2021.",
      "Nuclear is also getting a hard look.",
      "In Arizona, lawmakers are advancing legislation to make it easier for three utilities there \u2014 Arizona Public Service, Salt River Project and Tucson Electric Power \u2014 to put advanced nuclear reactors on the sites of retiring coal-fired plants.",
      "At the behest of Indiana's governor, Purdue University studied how the state could attract a new nuclear power industry. In its November report, it estimated that reusing a coal-fired plant site for a new nuclear power plant could reduce project costs by between 7% and 26%.",
      "The Bipartisan Policy Center, in a 2023 study before electricity demand began spiking, estimated that nuclear plants could cut costs from 15% to 35% by building at a retiring coal plant site, compared to building at a new site.",
      "Even building next to the coal plant could cut costs by 10% by utilizing transmission assets, roads and buildings while avoiding some permitting hurdles, the center said.",
      "That interconnection was a major driver for Terrapower when it chose to start construction in Wyoming on a next-generation nuclear power plant next to PacifiCorp\u2019s coal-fired Naughton Power Plant.",
      "Kathryn Huff, a former U.S. assistant secretary for nuclear energy who is now an associate professor at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, said the department analyzed how many sites might be suitable to advanced nuclear reactor plants.",
      "A compelling factor is the workers from coal plants who can be trained for work at a nuclear plant, Huff said. Those include electricians, welders and steam turbine maintenance technicians.",
      "In Homer City, the dread of losing its coal-fired plant \u2014 it shut down in 2023 after operating for 54 years \u2014 existed for years in the hills of western Pennsylvania\u2019s coal country.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been a rough 20 years here for our area, maybe even longer than that, with the closing of the mines, and this was the final nail, with the closing of the power plant,\u201d said Rob Nymick, Homer City's manager. \u201cIt was like, \u2018Oh my god, what do we do?\u2019\u201d",
      "That is changing.",
      "The plant's owners in recent weeks demolished the smoke stacks and cooling towers at the Homer City Generating State and announced a $10 billion plan for a natural gas-powered data center campus.",
      "It would be the nation\u2019s third-largest power generator and that has sown some optimism locally.",
      "\u201cMaybe we will get some families moving in, it would help the school district with their enrollment, it would help us with our population,\u201d Nymick said. \u201cWe\u2019re a dying town and hopefully maybe we can get a restaurant or two to open up and start thriving again. We\u2019re hoping.\u201d",

      "Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin is asking his party\u2019s candidate vying to be Virginia\u2019s next lieutenant governor to step aside",
      "RICHMOND, Va. -- Republican John Reid said Friday he will continue his campaign to be Virginia\u2019s lieutenant governor and denied he had anything to do with a social media account containing sexually explicit photos that had prompted GOP Gov. Glenn Youngkin to call for him to quit the race.",
      "Reid, the first openly gay man to run statewide in Virginia and a supporter of Youngkin, posted a video response to the governor's attempt to stymie his candidacy after the governor learned of the photos on a Tumblr account with a username matching the candidate\u2019s Instagram handle. Reid said the account was a fabrication that comes as he grapples with increasing pressure to exit the race by members of his party.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s predictable, but what I didn\u2019t expect was the governor I have always supported to call and demand my resignation without even showing me the supposed evidence or offering me a chance to respond,\u201d said Reid, a conservative talk-radio host. \u201cI did not accept that, and I deeply resent it.\u201d",
      "The political theater comes a week before the May 2 start of early voting in Virginia\u2019s primaries and only days after Reid's only Republican opponent dropped out.",
      "The Tumblr account, which was first reported by The Richmonder, was active Friday morning but was deleted by that afternoon. The webpage had reposted photos of naked men, according to The Richmonder.",
      "\u201cThe Governor was made aware late Thursday of the disturbing online content,\u201d according to a statement released by a political group affiliated with Youngkin. \u201cFriday morning, in a call with Mr. Reid, the Governor asked him to step down as the Lt. Governor nominee.\u201d",
      "In a video statement, Reid said he did not own the account. He also said his worst fear had been that someone would manufacture lies about him because of his sexuality.",
      "\u201cAnyone on the internet can open accounts with the same or similar names as other people,\u201d he said.",
      "Reid became the sole Republican candidate after Fairfax County Supervisor Pat Herrity left the race because of his health.",
      "Herrity's abrupt exit solidified Virginia Republicans' diverse ticket, with Reid running alongside Jamaican immigrant Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, who is vying to be governor, and Attorney General Jason Miyares, a first-generation Cuban American running for reelection.",
      "Before Youngkin's phone call, Reid said he was also pressed by a religious activist in Virginia to drop out after photos revealed him attending a drag show in Richmond. Since Herrity dropped out, Reid also said he received a deluge of requests insisting that he leave the race.",
      "Reid described the calls as \u201cdemands that I drop out, because supposedly, Christian voters would never support me, and it was inevitable that I would destroy the ticket and destroy Virginia,\u201d Reid said. \u201cI told everyone who called that I did not accept that analysis and would not decline the nomination that I\u2019ve worked for so many months to secure.\u201d",
      "Youngkin had initially backed Reid, writing on X on Monday: \u201cI spoke with John tonight and know he is ready to work with (Earle-Sears) and (Miyares) to keep Virginia the best state for business, to back the blue, and to stand strong for parents.\u201d",
      "The conservative Family Foundation Action group wrote in a Friday statement that they \u201cstrongly support Gov. Youngkin\u2019s call for John Reid to step aside as the Lieutenant Governor candidate. Virginians want elected officials who represent their values.\u201d",
      "Politicians and elected officials have received greater scrutiny for their online activity. The Tumblr account seemingly connected to Reid comes less than two years after Susanna Gibson, a Virginia Democrat, lost a House of Delegates race following reports that she had live-streamed sex acts with her husband on a pornographic website. Gibson has since said she and her husband did not consent to the live-stream being recorded, and argued the leak was criminal.",

      "President Donald Trump's administration is providing another example of how it's targeting those the president feels are blocking his agenda",
      "On Thursday, President Donald Trump directed his Department of Justice to investigate ActBlue, the Democratic Party-aligned fundraising site that has fueled so many successful challenges against his own party.",
      "The next day, amid a long-running feud with judges who have put some of his initiatives on hold because they may violate the Constitution, Trump's FBI arrested a Milwaukee judge, alleging she had helped a migrant evade immigration authorities.",
      "The two acts sent shockwaves through the legal and political worlds, which already have been reeling as Trump has used his office to target law firms, media outlets and individuals with whom he disagrees. The investigations are the latest version of a clear pattern in Trump's second term: The president has harnessed the power of the federal government to punish his enemies and anyone he sees as standing in his way.",
      "\u201cThis government has been consistent, from the moment it took office, in weaponizing the government and deploying it against critics,\u201d said Steve Levitsky, a Harvard political scientist and the coauthor of \u201cHow Democracies Die.\u201d \u201cThis is not a surprise. Trump campaigned on it and he's been doing it since day one.\u201d",
      "The complaint filed by the U.S. Department of Justice on Friday accused Milwaukee County Circuit Court Judge Hannah Dugan of ushering the man, who is accused of being in the country illegally, out the \u201cjury door\u201d of her courtroom. The complaint alleges the judge became \u201cvisibly angry\u201d when told there were immigration agents in the courthouse.",
      "Her arrest Friday morning was announced in a post on X by Trump's FBI director, Kash Patel, a Trump loyalist who before the election had compiled an \u201cenemies list\u201d to target during the president's second term. Patel later deleted the post.",
      "Shortly after Dugan's arrest, a few dozen protesters marched outside the courthouse, chanting, \u201cJudge Dugan will be free, no justice, no peace.\u201d Democrats across the country were alarmed.",
      "\u201cThere are no kings in America,\u201d Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said. He called the arrest \u201ca dangerous escalation, an attack on the separation of powers, and we will fight this with everything we have.\u201d",
      "During an appearance on Fox News after the arrest, Attorney General Pam Bondi sent a warning to judges across the country. She was addressing the case of Dugan and a retired New Mexico judge, whom the administration also is targeting for allegedly harboring someone in the country illegally. But her words carried extra weight given the administration's feuds with federal judges who have ruled against them in lawsuits challenging the administration's actions and executive orders.",
      "\"Some of these judges think they are beyond and above the law and they are not, and we\u2019re sending a very strong message today,\u201d Bondi said.",
      "Hours later, she revoked a Biden administration policy protecting journalists from having their records seized in leak investigations.",
      "Trump himself lambasted judges Friday as he flew to Pope Francis' funeral in Rome, frustrated that they were stalling his deportation plans.",
      "\u201cThese are judges who just want to show how big and important they are,\u201d Trump told reporters on Air Force One. \u201cThey shouldn't be allowed to do it. We have hundreds of thousands of people we want to get out of the country, and the courts are holding us back.\u201d",
      "The White House has mocked on social media an order, upheld unanimously at the U.S. Supreme Court, from a federal judge that it \u201cfacilitate\u201d the return of a Maryland man it admitted mistakenly deporting to a notorious prison in El Salvador. It mocked another federal judge who ordered planes full of immigrants turned around before they reached El Salvador. In another case, it acknowledged deporting additional migrants despite an order against it, arguing that the judge only forbade immigration authorities \u2014 and not the military \u2014 from removing the men from the country.",
      "Trump's allies in Congress and online have urged that judges be impeached if they have ruled against his other initiatives to cut the federal government or unilaterally change elections, or even to ignore orders outright. With the Republican-controlled Congress silent as Trump tries to remake the federal government, the courts have emerged as the only branch of government that is actively challenging the president.",
      "Trump also moved to kneecap one other force challenging him by targeting ActBlue. The website funnels small-dollar donations to predominantly Democratic candidates and has become a powerhouse in helping Democrats stay ahead of Republicans financially in many elections. The GOP set up a site to mimic it called WinRed, but Trump's order only directs a probe into the Democratic site, not the one run by his own party.",
      "Trump asked Bondi to see if ActBlue was a potential conduit for illegal overseas donations. The site said it followed the law, and it and Democrats condemned the probe as politically motivated.",
      "Brendan Nyhan, a political scientist at Dartmouth College, said Trump's targeting of Democratic Party infrastructure fits a pattern of many authoritarians around the world, who use government power to cripple opposition parties so they can no longer win elections.",
      "\u201cWe're well past Watergate,\u201d he said, referring to the 1972 scandal that led to President Richard Nixon's resignation two years later. \u201cThe investigation of ActBlue makes clear that we're not in a fully democratic country.\u201d",

      "Congo and Rwanda hope the involvement of the United States \u2014 and the incentive of major investment if there's enough security for U.S. companies to work safely in east Congo \u2014 will calm the fighting and militia violence that have defied peacekeeping and negotiation since the mid-1990s.",
      "The risk is that the United States becomes involved in or worsens the militia violence, corruption, exploitation and rights abuses surrounding the mining and trade of east Congo's riches.",
      "\u201cA durable peace ... will open the door for greater U.S. and broader Western investment, which will bring about economic opportunities and prosperity,\" Rubio said, adding that it would \u201cadvance President Trump's prosperity agenda for the world.\u201d",

      "Eastern Congo has been in and out of crisis for decades with more than 100 armed groups, most of which are vying for territory in the mining region near the border with Rwanda. The conflict has created one of the world\u2019s largest humanitarian disasters with more than 7 million people displaced, including 100,000 who fled homes this year.",
      "Conflict in eastern Congo is estimated to have killed 6 million people since the mid-1990s, in the wake of the Rwanda genocide. Some of the ethnic Hutu extremists responsible for the 1994 killing of an estimated 1 million of Rwanda's minority ethnic Tutsis and Hutu moderates later fled across the border into eastern Congo, fueling the proxy fighting between rival militias aligned to the two governments.",
      "\u201cToday marks not an end but a beginning,\u201d Congolese Foreign Minister Therese Kayikwamba Wagner said Friday before signing the broad agreement, which commits Rwanda and Congo to draft a peace accord and work to instill security and a good business environment, allow the return of the millions of displaced and accomplish other goals.",
      "\u201cThe good news is there is hope for peace,\" she said. \"The real news is peace must be earned.\"",
      "She directed part of her remarks to the civilians of east Congo, brutalized, isolated and displaced by the fighting: \u201cWe know you are watching this moment with concern, with hope and, yes, with doubt. You are entitled to actions that measure up to the suffering you have endured.\u201d",
      "Rwandan Foreign Minister Olivier Nduhungirehe said the two rival governments were now addressing the root causes of the hostility between them, the most important of which he said were security and the ability of refugees to return home.",
      "\u201cVery importantly, we are discussing how to build new regional economic value chains that link our countries, including with American private sector investment,\u201d he said.",
      "Trump\u2019s senior adviser for Africa, Massad Boulos, the father-in-law of Trump's daughter Tiffany, helped broker the U.S. role in promoting security in east Congo, part of an opening that Boulos has said could involve multibillion-dollar investments.",
      "The response from Congolese civil society Friday mixed hope with skepticism.",
      "Rights advocate Christophe Muisa in Goma, a city in east Congo that the powerful, Rwandan-backed M23 armed group seized earlier this year, said the U.S. is the main beneficiary of the deal. He urged his government not to \u201csubcontract its security.\u201d",
      "Georges Kapiamba, the president of the Congolese Association for the Access to Justice, a nongovernmental organization focusing on rights, justice and addressing corruption, said he supported a mineral-and-security deal with the U.S., but worried his own government could blow it by siphoning off the proceeds.",
      "Three months into Trump's second term, his administration and Republican lawmakers have made good on pledges to pare U.S. diplomacy and foreign assistance down to agreements that most directly serve their perception of U.S. strategic and financial interests. The administration has terminated thousands of U.S. aid and development workers and programs that worked more broadly for global development.",
      "In another such transactional deal, the Trump administration is negotiating with Ukraine over a minerals deal that the U.S. is demanding as repayment for past U.S. military support after Russia invaded in 2022.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy initially proposed that deal last fall in hopes of strengthening his country\u2019s hand in its conflict with Russia by tying U.S. interests to Ukraine\u2019s future.",

      "Her wildlife visitors didn't really surprise her. In recent years, bears have been pretty common in Simsbury, a suburban community of 24,500, located about 12 miles (19 kilometers) northwest of Hartford, where overturned garbage cans are often found along the road on \u201ctrash day\u201d after a bear has searched inside for a snack.",

      "\u201cHe made it to the landing and then went down the slide, like he had done it before,\u201d she said. In the video, the bear nonchalantly slides head first, its front paws breaking its fall in a pile of soft sand at the bottom. The bear then lays there for a few seconds, calmly looking around.",
      "Loving said the pair hung out for a few more minutes before moving on to her neighbor's yard. Their appearance lasted about 10 minutes.",
      "\u201cThey seemed so comfortable on the playscape,\u201d said Loving, whose family moved to Simsbury about two years ago, not knowing they might run across bears. \u201cWe just kept joking that they probably have been before, but we have not seen a bear go down playscape before, ever. That was a first.\u201d",

      "California regulators have released a new proposal to allow the testing of self-driving heavy duty trucks on public roads",
      "LOS ANGELES -- California regulators have released a new proposal to allow the testing of self-driving heavy duty trucks on public roads.",
      "The state's Department of Motor Vehicles announced proposed regulations Friday to allow the testing of self-driving vehicles over 10,001 pounds, opening the door for companies to test self-driving technology with previously prohibited autonomous commercial semi-trucks on the road.",
      "Regulators say self-driving heavy-duty trucks are already being tested in other states including Texas, Arizona and Arkansas. California is the only state with regulations that explicitly ban them.",
      "The regulations are subject to a public comment period that ends in June.",
      "They will likely face pushback from the labor unions that represent the state's hundreds of thousands of commercial truck drivers, who are concerned about safety and losing truck driving jobs to automation in the future.",
      "The California Legislature passed a bill in 2023 to require human drivers aboard self-driving trucks, but it was vetoed by Gov. Gavin Newsom, who said additional regulation was unnecessarily because existing laws governing self-driving vehicles were sufficient.",
      "The proposed regulations will also enhance data-reporting requirements for manufacturers, such as reporting instances when cars stop in the middle of an active road for any reason and need to be retrieved. They will give the state's Department of Motor Vehicles more authority to apply \u201cincremental enforcement measures\u201d against companies instead of fully suspending their testing permits.",

      "College journalists across the U.S. are navigating a surge in requests to remove previously published content amid the Trump administration\u2019s crackdown on student protesters and what critics describe as unprecedented attacks on campus speech",
      "CHICAGO -- Over the past few weeks, Greta Reich, editor-in-chief of Stanford University\u2019s student newspaper, has had almost two dozen requests to take down quotes, bylines, photos and opinion articles from current and former sources and writers.",
      "She and her staff at the Stanford Daily have been reviewing them on a case-by-case basis.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a number that has been startling to see,\u201d Reich said.",
      "Other student journalists on college campuses across the country are fielding similar requests. They are being asked to remove previously published content amid the Trump administration's crackdown on student protesters, fears of deportation for international students and what critics have described as unprecedented attacks on campus speech.",
      "Many young editors are beginning to reconsider long-standing journalistic practices around transparency to protect the people who appear in their reports. It's happening amid a climate of fear on campuses that is causing certain students to be reluctant to speak out publicly.",
      "These dramatic shifts in student media escalated after R\u00fcmeysa \u00d6zt\u00fcrk, a Tufts University student from Turkey, was threatened with deportation and detained in March over what her lawyers say is apparent retaliation for an op-ed piece she co-wrote in the student newspaper. \u00d6zt\u00fcrk was among four students who wrote the op-ed in the campus newspaper, The Tufts Daily, criticizing the university\u2019s response to student activists demanding that Tufts \u201cacknowledge the Palestinian genocide,\u201d disclose its investments and divest from companies with ties to Israel.",
      "And Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate student and Palestinian activist, was arrested in March and has been held in a Louisiana detention center for more than six weeks.",
      "Meanwhile, more than 1,000 students at 160 colleges, universities and university systems have had their visas revoked or their legal status terminated since late March, according to an Associated Press review. The federal government has since announced it will reverse the termination of legal status for international students after many filed court challenges, a government lawyer said Friday.",
      "The need to consider high-stakes safety risks has increased pressure on students in newsrooms that are meant to be learning labs for future journalists.",
      "Emma Wozniak, editor-in-chief of The Lantern at Ohio State University, where 12 students had their visas revoked, said it's \u201ctaken a mental toll\u201d on staff members.",
      "\u201cWe feel an enormous pressure to do the right thing because the stakes are higher and we don\u2019t want to put anyone in danger,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s terrifying to think that something we put out into the world could have such a devastating impact on someone. And so we take that very seriously.\u201d",
      "Earlier this month, the Student Press Law Center and other media rights groups issued guidance urging student journalists to be more flexible about requests to take down content.",
      "\u201cThis is something we\u2019ve never, ever done before,\u201d said Mike Hiestand, senior legal counsel for the center. \u201cIt\u2019s unprecedented. But we felt it was important to respond to what we were hearing from students.\u201d",
      "Hiestand said he\u2019s seen a surge in calls from student journalists facing requests to take down content, remove bylines or offer anonymous sourcing. Some of the calls have been from international students concerned about how to protect themselves while working in campus newsrooms. Many, fearing legal repercussions, have decided to retract their names in the bylines of published articles or opinion pieces.",
      "\u201cPeople are really concerned, really fearful,\u201d he said.",
      "The Stanford Daily has seen multiple staff members step away from editing positions or from covering certain stories related to the Israel-Hamas war or President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign to end diversity, equity and inclusion programs, Reich said.",
      "Since returning to the White House, Trump, a Republican, has threatened funding for universities over what he calls \u201cwokeness\u201d and diversity efforts in education, and he has launched an unprecedented campaign of immigration enforcement that has pushed the limits of executive power and clashed with federal judges trying to restrain him.",
      "The Stanford Daily published a letter from the editor in April addressing a \u201cchilling effect we\u2019ve noticed on campus and the fear of speaking to the Daily\u201d and announcing more leniency in granting anonymity for students who feel threatened. Three days before, the Daily reported that six student visas had been revoked by federal authorities.",
      "Reich said she worries about the diversity in voices the Daily may be losing because international students especially are afraid to speak with reporters or join the newsroom.",
      "\u201cWhen we have an entire section of the student body scared to have their stories told, that\u2019s a significant portion of the life of Stanford that just isn\u2019t being told,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s wildly concerning.\u201d",
      "Adam Kinder, editor-in-chief of the Columbia Political Review, said he\u2019s had about half a dozen requests from student writers wanting to put the publishing process on hold and a similar number of requests to take down previously published articles.",
      "Many of the requests have been from international students \u201cbecause of the very real fear right now, including the fear of deportation,\u201d Kinder said. The publication reversed a previous rule restricting non-bylined articles.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a coincidence that we\u2019re getting more of these requests than we ever had before,\u201d he said.",
      "Dylan Hembrough, editor-in-chief of the Alestle at Southern Illinois University, said he\u2019s also being more flexible with taking down previously published content, removing bylines from staff writers and offering anonymity. That includes for an upcoming story about eight international students at the school who have had their visas revoked.",
      "The Alestle\u2019s staff is working on a new policy for removing previously published content.",
      "\u201cOffering anonymity now is important because for some of these people, their lives could be completely upended at a moment\u2019s notice,\u201d Hembrough said. \u201cPeople\u2019s lives are more important than a good story.\u201d",
      "Jane Kirtley, a University of Minnesota media ethics professor, acknowledged that the current moment \u201craises a whole new set of ethical issues that may feel much more existential.\u201d But she encouraged student journalists to slow down when deciding how to weigh minimizing harm with other ethical standards, including to seek the truth and report it and to tell the full story of what is happening.",
      "Kirtley said anonymous sourcing and non-bylined work can appear less credible. Removing previously published content can have lasting effects, given that journalism is often called the first draft of history.",
      "\u201cYou have to ask yourself, what am I doing to the historical record, especially amid attempts in the current administration to rewrite history,\u201d she said.",

    "story": [
      "All major UK lenders are now offering fixed mortgage deals with an interest rate of less than 4%, but brokers say further cuts are not guaranteed.",
      "A mini price war has broken out between mortgage providers, although many of the lowest-rate deals still require borrowers to provide a hefty deposit and a substantial fee.",
      "More frequent cuts in interest rates by the Bank of England are expected this year, amid global economic turmoil.",
      "However, lenders are already reflecting those predicted cuts in their latest deals, suggesting borrowers could be taking a risk by relying on ongoing drops in mortgage costs.",
      "\"If the base rate does come down then there is a chance fixes could get a bit cheaper but there are no guarantees,\" said Aaron Strutt, from broker Trinity Financial.",
      "Timing issue for borrowers",
      "Some tracker and variable rate mortgages move closely in line with the Bank of England's base rate, which is expected to be cut from 4.5% on 8 May.",
      "However, more than eight in 10 mortgage customers have fixed-rate deals. The interest rate on this kind of mortgage does not change until the deal expires, usually after two or five years, and a new one is chosen to replace it.",
      "About 800,000 fixed-rate mortgages, currently with an interest rate of 3% or below, are expected to expire every year, on average, until the end of 2027.",
      "The average rate for a two-year fixed deal is now 5.21%, according to the financial information service Moneyfacts. A typical five-year deal has a rate of 5.12%.",
      "Five ways for first-time buyers to get on the housing ladder",
      "Low-deposit mortgage deals highest for 17 years",
      "When will interest rates go down again?",
      "However, lenders are offering attention-grabbing sub-4% deals again to some customers. They were seen briefly in February, but market-watchers had not expected them to return for a while.",
      "The fallout from US tariffs policy has led the markets to settle on a view of more base rate cuts this year.",
      "As a result, so-called swap rates - a key measure on which mortgage deals are priced - have fallen.",
      "Equally, there is now little to tell between swap rates - and therefore mortgage rates - over two years and five years.",
      "\"More borrowers are taking two-year fixes on the assumption rates will reduce but many may be better off taking longer term fixes for the payment security,\" Mr Strutt said.",
      "Rachael Hunnisett believes that many people want to step away from \"the roulette wheel\" of short-term fixed-rate deals.",
      "\"There is a cohort who just do not want to take that level of risk with their home,\" she said, arguing that everyday payments, like children's activities, are affected if borrowers find themselves having to pay a higher rate after two years.",
      "She is the director of mortgage distribution at April Mortgages, which provides 10 and 15-year mortgages. The rates are generally higher, but the certainty of payments she feels is a selling point.",
      "The company is now offering home loans at seven times a borrower's income, which is higher than for many shorter-term loans.",
      "Brokers say this is one example of a host of lenders competing by potentially allowing customers more flexibility to borrow larger amounts, particularly first-time buyers.",
      "They also point to the UK's biggest building society, the Nationwide, making changes earlier in the week that offered improved rates to those remortgaging - another sign of greater competition.",
      "David Hollingworth, from broker L&C, said that the sub-4% deals were now becoming part of the core range of mortgages offered by the big lenders.",
      "But he warned the global economic uncertainty meant these rates could quite quickly move either way.",
      "As a result, borrowers were increasingly applying for deals, almost as a backstop months before their old deals expired, he said. If rates improve before the new deal starts, then they could still switch to a better rate."

    "summary": "The US central bank is one of Trump's favourite punching bags. But how serious is the threat?",
    "story": [
      "US President Donald Trump has some well-known nemeses: illegal immigrants, low-flow showers and last, but definitely not least, the head of the US central bank.",
      "Elevated by Trump to lead the Federal Reserve starting in 2018, Jerome Powell almost immediately found himself under fire - described on social media as a bonehead and questioned about reports that the president wanted him gone.",
      "But however uncomfortable Powell might have been then, his position has only gotten worse.",
      "Not only is he overseeing an economy where the risk of recession is rapidly rising, Trump has been flirting publicly with his removal, writing on social media last week: \"Powell's termination cannot come fast enough!\"",
      "Coming at a time when Trump has pushed to expand presidential power, while cowing political opponents and ploughing past judicial efforts to check his action, it has raised alarm that he is more serious about, and might be more able to, exert control over the Fed than during his first term.",
      "The tensions cooled this week, when Trump, a day after a market slide that some analysts tied to the comments, denied to reporters that he ever had any intention of firing Powell.",
      "It came amid other hints of de-escalation in Trump's economic rhetoric as his policies, especially trade tariffs, have faced rising political and business backlash.",
      "But Trump did not offer much assurance that he would limit his interventions at the Fed, maintaining his right to have a view and noting that he might call Powell to discuss his concerns about the bank's interest rate policy.",
      "Donald Kohn, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and the former vice chair of the Federal Reserve, said the shift in tone appeared intended to calm financial markets but he did not think it marked the end of a fight over the Fed, an institution considered vital to the health of the world's largest economy.",
      "\"It's a testimony to the market's response,\" he said. \"But I think it's way too soon to say that there's a stability there.\"",
      "What is Trump's problem with Powell?",
      "Trump's clash with the Fed is ostensibly rooted in differences over where the bank should fix its key interest rate, which plays an influential role shaping borrowing costs for credit cards, mortgages and other loans.",
      "Lower rates make it easier to borrow and tend to deliver an economic boost. Higher interest rates dampen activity, helping to keep prices stable.",
      "Trump, who cut his teeth professionally taking out loans as a property developer, has long confessed to liking a low interest rate policy.",
      "He objected when the Fed raised rates in his first term and has been pushing Powell to cut them now, arguing that inflation has cooled and keeping rates too high could do unnecessary economic damage.",
      "\"There can be a SLOWING of the economy unless Mr. Too Late, a major loser, lowers interest rates, NOW,\" he wrote on social media earlier this week, referring to Powell.",
      "A threat to Fed independence?",
      "Trump is hardly the first politician to cast the bank as a scapegoat at a moment of economic turmoil - or to press for lower interest rates.",
      "Nor is he alone in his criticism of Powell, who infamously initially dismissed post-pandemic price inflation as \"transitory\" and has been faulted for being too focused on backward-looking data.",
      "Trump's pressure on the bank, however, breaks with Washington tradition in recent decades of presidential deference to the Fed.",
      "It has drawn comparisons to former President Richard Nixon, who pushed his Fed chairman to loosen its policies ahead of the 1972 election, moves later blamed for feeding the high-inflation, low-growth \"stagflationary\" dynamic of that decade.",
      "The idea that Trump could exert control over the Fed elicits horror among many economists, who say history is littered with examples of countries where political interference at central banks led to spiralling prices and economic ruin.",
      "Sarah Binder, professor at George Washington University and a scholar of the Federal Reserve, said confidence in Fed independence is key to maintaining market faith that inflation will be controlled.",
      "If shaken, it could lead to higher borrowing costs for everyone, as investors demand higher interest rates for holding debt, she warned, noting that should the Fed eventually cut rates, it is likely to spark speculation about Trump's influence - regardless of how, if at all, it played into the decision.",
      "\"That's ultimately the problem. It is perceptions of independence that really matter and that's what the pernicious effects of the attacks are they do raise doubts about whether the Fed can be as stalwart as central bankers want to be,\" she said.",
      "Can Trump fire Powell?",
      "Joe Lavorgna, chief economist at SMBC Nikko Securities, who served on the National Economic Council during Trump's first term, said he saw little need for Trump to dial back his attacks, noting that he was making a \"very classic macro argument\" about the bank's flaws.",
      "\"I'm completely on board with the president's sympathies or comments that the Fed has historically been late,\" he said, adding that he thought stock market falls had been driven primarily by questions about trade policy.",
      "He said he believed that Fed officials would remain more responsive to financial conditions than the president, noting that, if anything, Trump's pressure could make it more hesitant to cut, lest it be perceived as being cowed.",
      "\"Ultimately the Fed is going to do what's prudent,\" he said. \"The question is just the timing.\"",
      "Powell, a longtime Washington lawyer whose term as chair is due to end next year, has maintained that he is unbothered - and uninfluenced - by the criticism and asserted that Trump does not have the legal authority to remove him.",
      "But the strength of his position is a matter of legal debate.",
      "By law, Fed governors can only be removed for cause, but it is unclear whether that protection extends to the role leading the board.",
      "The administration has already taken steps to reduce the Fed's regulatory role and is engaged in a legal battle over expanding presidential authority over other government agencies set up with features, like for cause protections, intended to insulate them from partisan pressure.",
      "Mark Spindel, founder and chief investment officer of the Washington-based investment advisory firm Potomac River Capital, who has worked with Prof Binder on Fed studies, noted that the tradition of Fed \"independence\" had evolved over time, often after political or economic crisis.",
      "\"Things that are given can be taken away,\" he said, hours before Trump appeared to back off.",

      "The next step will be to halve the number of apprentices over the next year as their contracts finish, ending up with six by the end of this year.",

      "Kerry added the way the chancellor is treating salons, which overwhelmingly employ women, \"totally goes against the objectives of the government\" in growing the economy and supporting workers.",
      "Part of the pressure is coming from the UK's Value Added Tax (VAT) rules, which do not allow businesses to reclaim tax on staff costs in the same way they can for goods, putting labour-intensive businesses such as hair or beauty salons at a disadvantage.",
      "\"If you look at a cafe, one waiter can serve several tables of four customers in the space of an hour and the cafe can reclaim the VAT on all the food and drink they serve,\" Kerry explained.",

      "Many hairdressers went into debt due to the pandemic, said Kerry, and the added pressures of increases in employer National Insurance contributions (Nics) and business rates are now threatening the future of salons across the country.",
      "For Kerry's salon, the Vanilla Rooms, the tax increases have added a \"devastating\" \u00a323,000 extra to her annual costs, through a combination of the threshold at which employers start to pay Nics on staff wages being lowered to \u00a35,000 and changes to business rates.",
      "Her Nics costs have risen 29%, from about \u00a342,000 to about \u00a354,500 - now costing more than \u00a31,000 a week  - and business rates have gone up by 144%, from about \u00a37,000 to about \u00a318,000 a year.",
      "Kerry is one of 50,000 UK hairdressing professionals represented by the British Hair Consortium (BHC), which has urged Rachel Reeves to take action or face the \"collapse\" of the industry due to rising costs.",
      "The BHC argues the most efficient support the government could offer is through halving VAT for salons, because staff wages make up 60% of their costs.",
      "The association says cutting VAT could actually increase overall tax take, by preventing more workers going self-employed or entering the black market.",
      "Kerry's case was one of those raised by Conservative MP Julia Lopez in a debate this week in Parliament's Westminster Hall, where she urged Rachel Reeves to lower VAT from 20% to 10% to support the hair and beauty sector.",
      "Lopez,  the MP for Hornchurch and Upminster, said Kerry was not alone in being forced to consider whether she will have to shut up shop completely.",
      "\"Some of the increased bills for salons are just unbelievable,\" she said, adding that women were disproportionately impacted by the changes.",
      "\"It's hard to ignore the impact, let alone the irony, of a chancellor celebrating herself for being the first woman to hold that office while simultaneously hammering the sectors that employ, serve and are often led, by women.\"",
      "Liberal Democrat business spokesperson Sarah Gibson agreed that Reeves' Budget had implemented \"an unfair tax on jobs\" and the government must offer tax relief for small businesses in June.",
      "Gibson said an increasing number of salons are opting to rent chairs out to self-employed staff, instead of employing stylists directly, to avoid paying tax.",
      "\"If salons don't get support we will see a huge increase in people becoming chair renters,\" she said, which reduces the Treasury's overall tax take.",
      "Responding for the Labour government, Small Business Minister Gareth Thomas defended the chancellor's decisions in her October Budget as \"important for long term stability\".",
      "Salons are \"a vital pillar of our high streets\", he said, adding \"many hair and beauty businesses will benefit from some of the other measures the chancellor introduced\".",
      "\"We increased the employment allowance so that almost one million employers pay no national insurance contributions at all.",
      "More than half of employers will see no change or gain from that package, and that includes many hair and beauty businesses,\" he told MPs.",
      "Update 26 April 2025: This article was amended to correct the cost of Kerry's business rates, which she said increased from about \u00a37,000, not from \u00a3700 as we originally stated.",

    "story": [
      "Domestic energy prices are forecast to fall in July, reversing three consecutive increases in regulator Ofgem's price cap.",
      "The annual bill of a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity will fall by \u00a3166 a year, a drop of nearly 9%, analysts at the consultancy Cornwall Insight have predicted.",
      "It comes after a series of household bills became more expensive in April, and would mean a typical annual bill for a dual-fuel customer paying by direct debit would cost \u00a31,683.",
      "The price cap is based on the cost of each unit of energy, not the total bill - so if you use more, you pay more.",
      "Huge uncertainty",
      "The energy price cap covers around 22 million households in England, Wales and Scotland and is set every three months by Ofgem.",
      "While the quarterly change can skew annual comparisons, the regulator illustrates the effect of the price cap with the annual bill for a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity.",
      "In the three months from July last year, that typical bill stood at \u00a31,568 a year. It rose on each of the three occasions the cap was set after that, the most recent of which was at the start of April.",
      "The predicted fall of almost 9% in July - if it happens - would bring it sharply down to the lowest level since last September.",
      "Cornwall Insight also expects a slight fall in prices in October and another drop in January 2026.",
      "However, analysts said great uncertainty still surrounded these forecasts.",
      "\"While a fall in bills will always be welcomed by households, we mustn't get ahead of ourselves. We have all seen markets go up as fast as they go down, and the very fact the market dropped so quickly shows how vulnerable it is to geopolitical and market shifts,\" said Craig Lowrey, principal consultant at Cornwall Insight, which is widely recognised for the accuracy of its predictions.",
      "\"There is unfortunately no guarantee that any fall in prices will be sustained.",
      "\"The only real way to protect households from this constant cycle of instability and insecurity is to reduce our dependence on international wholesale markets.\"",
      "The fall in the wholesale cost of energy, paid by suppliers, is behind the latest predictions.",
      "That has been affected by US tariffs policy and warmer-than-expected weather in Europe."

    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yrgpwg545o",
    "published": "Fri, 25 Apr 2025 21:15:35 GMT",
    "summary": "Countries in the continent may see exports rise as both the US and China need new suppliers.",
    "story": [
      "When Donald Trump revealed the level of trade tariffs that countries around the world would face from the US, nations in South America breathed a sigh of relief.",
      "Ten of the 12 states on the continent received the lowest level of 10%.",
      "Only Guyana and Venezuela were initially hit with higher rates of 38% and 15% respectively, before these were subsequently reduced to 10%. This came as Trump decided to pause elevated rates on almost all countries for 90 days.",
      "The exceptions are China, which has been hit with 145%, and Canada and Mexico, which have still got 25% tariffs on some exports to the US.",
      "Commentators who describe this as a win for South America argue that the higher US tariffs on China, and on Canada and Mexico, could make South American goods more attractive to US and global buyers.",
      "While plausible, this view oversimplifies broader global trade instability that South America is also exposed to.",
      "What are tariffs and why is Trump using them?",
      "Global growth forecast slashed by IMF over tariff impact",
      "US tariffs will make global trade shrink, says WTO",
      "US coffee shops worried about bitter price hike after tariffs",
      "Here I'll set out this debate \u2013 starting with the potential upsides for the region.",
      "South America is rich in commodities. Its biggest economies - Brazil and Argentina - are major exporters of soybeans and petroleum as well as, in Brazil's case, iron ore used in steel production.",
      "The US's huge tariffs on Chinese goods, and China's retaliatory 125% on US imports, may create opportunities for South American exporters.",
      "For example, Brazil could increase agricultural exports to China to replace previous US supplies. China is already Brazil's largest export destination, followed by the US.",
      "There is a precedent. When Trump hit China with tariffs during his first term of office, China shifted some commodity purchases from the US to Brazil, boosting Brazilian soybean exports.",
      "With the 2025 soybean harvest in Brazil now continuing, some are hoping for a repeat.",
      "These include Frederico D'Avila, a farmer and ex-politician aligned with former Brazilian President Bolsonaro. Mr D'Avila was also previously a senior figure at Aprosoja, a soybean producers' group.",
      "He tells the BBC that President Trump's first term was \"excellent for Brazilian agriculture\" as \"Trump's tariffs in that time favoured us\".",
      "However, Juan Carlos Hallak, professor of international economics at the University of Buenos Aires, has a counterpoint. He says that raising \"bilateral barriers\" on commodities mostly just affects \"who sells to whom\", and not financial gains for the sellers  - as the prices are set globally.",
      "So his suggestion is that South American nations shouldn't expect more financial gains from their commodities as a result of Trump's actions, just potentially different customers.",
      "\"The prices are [instead] affected by macroeconomic factors\u2026 for example if there is a recession,\" he tells the BBC.",
      "Yet other sectors in South America are also hoping that Trump's actions mean they could win more global sales as countries decide to buy less from the US.",
      "Take the Brazilian beef industry. The country's President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva was recently in Japan, hoping to open the Japanese market to Brazil's beef exports.",
      "Japan currently buys 40% of its beef from the US. But after Trump initially threatened to hit the country with 24% tariffs, Tokyo may shift to buy more meat from South America.",
      "Other Brazilian industries, such as coffee and footwear, may gain a competitive edge over their Asian counterparts in the US market.",
      "Brazil is the world's biggest producer of coffee, followed by Vietnam, Indonesia and Colombia.",
      "Trump initially hit Vietnam with tariffs of 46% and Indonesia with 32%. While those higher rates are now on pause, if they are reinstated in July it will make beans from those two countries significantly more expensive in the US.",
      "This would give both Brazilian and Colombian coffee a competitive advantage in the US, where they are already the main suppliers.",
      "Meanwhile, Brazil's shoemakers could see more exports to the US as a result of Trump's high tariffs on Chinese exports. Currently China is the world's largest manufacturer of footwear while Brazil is in fifth place.",
      "The other three nations in the top five list of the world's largest footwear producers are India, Vietnam and Indonesia. The US initially gave India a higher tariff rate of 26%.",
      "Uruguay's new President Yamand\u00fa Orsi has also said that Trump's tariffs are helping to push a trade deal between the EU and South America's bloc, Mercosur, closer to reality.",
      "He said that \"Europe has little choice now but to lower its demands somewhat\" in negotiations, as it seeks to diversify trading partners.",
      "You may have noted a lot of \"coulds\" and \"ifs\". That's not just because it is early days. It's also because the pace and scale of US trade changes are causing wider instability.",
      "Whether the potential positives for South America outweigh the potential negatives is hard to calculate accurately, which brings me to the risks for the continent.",
      "Firstly, 10% is still 10%. Even countries with the lower tariff rate may face reduced US demand if prices rise. This is more of a risk for imports that compete with US domestic production, such as oil, soybeans, copper, iron ore, gold, and lithium.",
      "The US has also hit imports of aluminium and steel, from all countries, with tariffs of 25%.",
      "Brazil is a producer of both metals and has large reserves of their raw materials  \u2013 bauxite and iron ore.  Meanwhile, Argentina has one of the largest aluminium producers in South America, listed company Aluar, and a smaller steel industry.",
      "Argentine producers warn they may both lose US access and face more Chinese imports, creating increased competition for domestic producers.",
      "\"We're worried by the diversion of what can no longer enter the US,\" Carlos Vaccaro, executive director of the Argentine Steel Chamber, told the Buenos Aires Herald.",
      "Trump's tariff wars have also led to global commodity price volatility, with oil and copper prices seeing slumps. Copper hit a 17-month low at the start of April. This volatility could hit the economies of Chile and Peru, where copper is the top export.",
      "Eduardo Levy Yeyati, a former chief economist at the Central Bank of Argentina, says the impact on commodity prices and global demand is a \"serious headwind\" for South America.",
      "Looking ahead, Mr Yeyati says that if Brazil and Argentina do end up enjoying a big rise in exports to the US, it could result in them getting higher tariffs from Trump.",
      "After all, Trump's aim is to boost domestic production, not imports from other countries.",
      "Mr Yeyati says that Trump may be equally displeased if South American nations start exporting more to China. \"If Brazil fills in the US quota of goods exports to China, the US may choose to punish Brazil.\"",
      "He theorises that Trump could also try to pressure Latin America to reduce China's footprint in the region in return for favourable treatment. China invests billions of dollars in infrastructure projects across Central and South America.",
      "So, calling Trump's tariffs a clear \"win\" or \"loss\" for South America oversimplifies a complex situation. Especially if Trump announces in July that every country except China, Canada and Mexico will continue at 10%.",
      "As Mr Hallak says: \"It's very hard to predict where this is going.\"",
      "Subject to this caveat, he envisions a future where the US protects its manufacturing industries more than its agricultural goods.",
      "But adds: \"I'm not sure Latin America is ready to take advantage of those opportunities. There will be specific opportunities for sure, but something that changes the game? I don't think so.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 25 Apr 2025 04:46:24 GMT",
    "summary": "Not owning crucial code has meant it has been unable to replace the system that led to a scandal.",
    "story": [
      "The Post Office has paid more than \u00a3600m of public money to continue using the faulty Horizon IT system despite deciding to ditch it more than a decade ago, the BBC can reveal.",
      "The terms of the original 1999 deal with computer giant Fujitsu mean the Post Office has been stuck with the system and unable to build a replacement so far, even after it contributed to one of the UK's biggest miscarriages of justice.",
      "Former Prime Minister Sir Tony Blair and other senior Labour government figures were warned about potential problems with the terms of the deal before it was signed, the BBC has learned.",
      "The Post Office said it \"apologises unreservedly to victims of the Horizon IT scandal\" and said it was committed to moving away from Fujitsu and the Horizon software.",
      "Under the terms of the original \u00a3548m deal, struck under pressure from the then-Labour government, the Post Office did not own the computer code for the core part of the Horizon system.",
      "Although the Post Office has wanted to switch suppliers since 2012, buying the rights to the code from Fujitsu or building a completely new system from scratch was considered too expensive - even as the amounts paid to Fujitsu to retain the Horizon system grew and grew.",
      "Because it did not own the code, the Post Office was also unable to inspect the part of the software that processed transactions, and had to rely on assurances from Fujitsu that it was functioning correctly.",
      "The Post Office, which is owned by the government, prosecuted about 700 sub-postmasters between 1999 and 2015 for theft, fraud and false accounting over supposed cash shortfalls in branches reported by the Horizon system, based on these assurances. The convictions were overturned by Parliament last year.",
      "Earlier this year, Business Minister Baroness Jones of Whitchurch told the House of Lords that the Post Office is \"unfortunately, still dependent on the Horizon system\", and the only way Fujitsu could be \"out of the picture\" immediately would mean shutting down all local post offices.",
      "An attempt to replace the system with one built by IBM failed in 2016, at a cost of \u00a340m, and the Post Office extended its contract with Fujitsu for at least four more years at a cost of \u00a3107m.",
      "The Post Office told the BBC that it finally obtained rights related to the Horizon software and code in 2023, although it is not known if this includes the core system that processes transactions.",
      "The \u00a310m price for the licence was \"cheap - because who else would buy it?\" according to IT expert Jason Coyne, one of the first people to identify flaws in the system.",
      "The BBC understands that the Post Office may try to use this licence for Horizon's replacement. But while this is being built,  IT experts believe the Post Office's contract with Fujitsu will need to be extended beyond March 2026 - when it is currently due to end.",
      "Issues over who would own the Horizon software began when the contract to computerise the network of Post Office branches - then numbering 18,000 - was negotiated between the Post Office, Fujitsu and its subsidiary ICL Pathway, and the government.",
      "In May 1999, Sir Tony Blair received an update from the Treasury, in a document warning that discussions with ICL over the terms of a deal \"have foundered\".",
      "One of the sticking points was around intellectual property rights (IPR) - which included ownership of the code within the Horizon software.",
      "The document says that ICL was \"not prepared to... give perpetual licences for all the IPR\".",
      "It goes on to say that if the Post Office ever wanted to change suppliers, the owner of the IPR \"would be in a strong position to drive a costly settlement with the Post Office\".",
      "The BBC has also obtained a document from 20 May the same year, which was sent to then-Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown and other government officials, warning about the issue of who owned the code.",
      "In it, a Treasury civil servant states that one of the \"main problems\" with the terms of a proposed deal with ICL for the Horizon software was the \"issues surrounding ownership of assets and IPR of the kit acquired by\" the Post Office.",
      "Mr Coyne, the IT expert, said it was \"utter madness\" that the deal went ahead in July 1999 because it meant that the Post Office became \"operationally reliant on Horizon\", even though it did not own the rights to use the system without Fujitsu.",
      "A spokesperson for Sir Tony Blair did not address the BBC's questions around his knowledge of the IPR issues but said he \"took very seriously the issues raised about the Horizon contract\" at the time.",
      "\"The final decision was taken after an investigation by an independent panel recommended it was viable.",
      "\"It is now clear that the Horizon product was seriously flawed, leading to tragic and completely unacceptable consequences, and Mr Blair has deep sympathy with all those affected.\"",
      "A spokesperson for Gordon Brown said he \"would not have been shown the memo\" from 20 May 1999 and he would have been copied in as a \"formality\".",
      "\"He was not involved in any work related to the purchasing, award or management of the Horizon contract.\"",
      "The warnings about ownership of the IPR came true more than a decade later when Post Office decided to invite other companies to take over the Horizon contract.",
      "Former executives told the Post Office Inquiry, which is examining decisions leading up to the wrongful convictions of hundreds of sub-postmasters, how the company had found it difficult to replace Fujitsu.",
      "Alisdair Cameron, former chief financial officer at the Post Office, said that Fujitsu had been \"difficult colleagues\" and \"it was accepted that Horizon, and the infrastructure on which it was built, was vulnerable\".",
      "But Mike Young, chief operations officer at the Post Office between October 2010 and April 2012, told the inquiry that Fujitsu management said to him \"the code is ours. You own the service because you pay for that but you don't pay [for] the code\".",
      "Documents released by the Post Office Inquiry show the \"IPR issue\" was often discussed by top-level Post Office executives.",
      "\"There is a risk that we may be unable to agree an IP license with Fujitsu on reasonable terms\", said an agenda for a Post Office board meeting in July 2013 - while other documents describe concerns over costs.",
      "Procurement specialist Ian Makgill told us he believes not owning the IPR to the Horizon software would have been a factor in the collapse of the 2016 IBM deal to replace the system.",
      "He said that if IBM had tried to build new software without any of the IPR from Horizon, it would have needed to \"start from scratch, which would have cost the Post Office hundreds of millions of pounds\".",
      "\"IPR is the reason why the Post Office hasn't been able to move away from Fujitsu and the Horizon software,\" he said.",
      "Since 1999, the Post Office has spent \u00a32.5bn on contracts with Fujitsu. This figure includes more than \u00a3600m spent on bridging or extension contracts to continue the Horizon contract since the Post Office started looking for new suppliers in 2012, according to analysis from data firm Tussell and the BBC.",
      "Many of the sub-postmasters wrongly accused by the Post Office maintained that there was no missing money and the shortfalls were down to errors in the Horizon system.",
      "But with the Post Office unable to directly inspect the system which processed transactions, it accepted assurances from Fujitsu that the system was working correctly.",
      "\"Fujitsu were fighting the whole time to protect their investment and their intellectual property, rather than looking after the interests of the sub-postmasters,\" said Mr Makgill.",
      "Fujitsu did not respond to the BBC's specific questions but stated that it was \"focused on supporting the Post Office in their plans for a new service delivery model\" so branches can continue to operate.",
      "Mr Makgill said that the Post Office bears the \"ultimate responsibility\" over the fate of wrongly accused sub-postmasters.",
      "\"They didn't have to take those prosecutions, they didn't have to take people to court.\"",
      "Sub-postmasters currently using the Horizon IT software continue to report issues with it. Seven in 10 said they had experienced an \"unexplained discrepancy\" on the system since January 2020, according to a YouGov survey with 1,015 respondents commissioned by the Post Office Inquiry in 2024.",
      "The Post Office has said that it has not undertaken any prosecutions related to Horizon since 2015 and \"has no intention of doing so\".",
      "It told the BBC that it is \"implementing changes across the entire organisation\" so that it is \"fit for the future, fundamentally changed and with postmasters at its heart\".",
      "It said this includes working with Fujitsu to correct discrepancies and reviewing the current version of Horizon - replacing it in stages, under a five-year plan named the \"Future Technology Portfolio\".",
      "Post Office chairman Nigel Railton has said a new IT system would not be introduced in one \"big bang\" but there would be gradual changes.",
      "The Post Office did not respond to the BBC's specific questions about IPR being the reason why the company was unable to ditch Fujitsu, and said it would not be appropriate to comment ahead of the Post Office Inquiry's final report.",
      "The Department of Business and Trade told the BBC that it was providing \u00a3136m of funding over the next five years to the Future Technology Portfolio, and was \"working at pace\" to ensure the Post Office had the technology it needed, including replacing the Horizon system.",

    "summary": "Ed Miliband says \"zonal pricing\" or reformed national pricing are the only available options to overhaul the energy market.",
    "story": [
      "Energy secretary Ed Miliband is \"considering\" plans to introduce regional pricing for power that could lead to lower bills in parts of the country that generate more energy.",
      "He did not set out details of the \"zonal pricing\" scheme, which is meant to make the national energy grid more efficient and encourage investment.",
      "But he rejected claims in a Daily Telegraph article that it would mean increased energy bills for southern English households.",
      "Some energy companies have backed the idea - but others say it will scare off investment and lead to higher bills.",
      "If the UK has more renewable energy, why aren't bills coming down?",
      "Could Scotland have Europe's lowest electricity bills?",
      "GB Energy to be blocked from using slavery-linked solar",
      "According to the Telegraph government officials have advised Miliband to back plans for a form of regional pricing used in some other parts of the world including Australia, Italy and Sweden.",
      "If implemented, it would be the biggest reform of the power market since the 1990s privatisation.",
      "Under the scheme, power costs would match local supply and demand. In practice it could lead to lower bills in areas with abundant wind generation like Scotland rather than households in the South.",
      "The scheme is supported by some energy businesses - including Greg Jackson, the boss of Octopus Energy, the UK's largest domestic energy supplier.",
      "Mr Jackson said it could make the overall system more efficient and reduce the amount of network upgrades needed to shift the electricity from where it's generated to where it's consumed.",
      "But Dale Vince, the founder of green energy company Ecotricity and a Labour donor, said on BBC Radio 4's Today Programme that zonal pricing was a \"terrible idea\" as \"tens of millions of Britons could end up paying more for their energy than they do now\".",
      "Speaking ahead of an international energy security summit in London, Miliband said the government were considering options to change energy pricing but insisted \"absolutely no decision has been made\".",
      "\"This is an incredibly complex question that we are looking at about how we reform our energy market,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.",
      "\"There are two options, zonal pricing and reformed national pricing.",
      "\"Whatever route we go down my bottom line is bills have got to fall, and they should fall throughout the country.",
      "\"We are going to take our time over this very complex and important decision.\"",
      "Can I fix my energy prices?",
      "The Liberal Democrats warned against regional pricing saying the \"government has got to ensure that reforms to electricity pricing ultimately bring down customers' bills and create a fairer system - across the board.\"",
      "The party's energy and net zero spokesperson, Pippa Heylings, said: \"In a cost-of-living crisis and when energy giants have been raking it in - energy bills should be going down not up.\"",
      "Reform UK leader Nigel Farage called the plans \"a form of bribery\", saying cheaper bills would be a payoff for massive infrastructure projects \"ruining\" the local area.",
      "\"None of this I think has been fully thought through,\" he argued.",
      "\"I think Ed Miliband has a religious fervour for achieving that zero, regardless of the consequences.\"",
      "The Green Party of England and Wales have also called on the government to reject regional pricing.",
      "Party co-leader Adrian Ramsay told the BBC: \"People live in poverty all over the country - penalising families struggling to pay their bills because of where they happen to live would be wrong.\"",
      "The Conservatives have also been approached for comment."

      "The European Union has ordered Apple and Meta to pay a combined \u20ac700m (\u00a3599m) in the first fines it has issued under legislation intended to curb the power of big tech.",
      "It has issued a \u20ac500m (\u00a3428m) fine to Apple over its App Store, while Meta has been fined \u20ac200m (\u00a3171m) over how much choice users had to consent to data collection.",
      "\"We have a duty to protect the rights of citizens and innovative businesses in Europe,\" Commissioner Henna Virkkunen said in a statement.",
      "The two tech firms have reacted angrily, with Meta accusing the EU of \"attempting to handicap successful American businesses\" and Apple saying it was being \"unfairly targeted\" and forced to \"give away our technology for free.\"",
      "The fines are lower than some of those issued by the EU in the past but - given the heightened economic tensions with America - still risk angering US President Donald Trump.",
      "The US has levied a 10% tariff on imports from the EU, which Trump has accused of \"taking advantage\" of America.",
      "EU spokesperson Arianna Podesta insisted the matters were \"completely separate\", telling the BBC: \"This is about enforcement, it's not about trade negotiations.\"",
      "The White House has been contacted for comment.",
      "Data and apps",
      "The European Commission - the EU's executive - started both investigations last year under a new law brought in to promote fairness in the tech sector called the Digital Markets Act (DMA).",
      "The case against Apple was over its App Store.",
      "The Commission says it must freely offer alternative app marketplaces to users and app developers - and says Apple was in breach of this.",
      "Meanwhile, Meta's fine was over the choices it offered on data collection.",
      "Meta introduced a \"consent or pay\" model, which meant users had to choose between allowing Meta to combine data it had collected on Facebook and Instagram, or paying a monthly subscription.",
      "The Commission says this model did not allow users to freely consent to how their data was used.",
      "In November, Meta introduced another option, which the Commission says \"allegedly uses less personal data to display advertisements.\"",
      "The Commission is currently assessing the new option.",
      "In both cases, the Commission says the size of the fine takes into account \"the gravity and duration of the non-compliance\".",
      "Both companies have 60 days to comply or risk further fines.",
      "\"Apple and Meta have fallen short of compliance with the DMA by implementing measures that reinforce the dependence of business users and consumers on their platforms,\" said Commissioner Teresa Ribera.",
      "\"As a result, we have taken firm but balanced enforcement action against both companies, based on clear and predictable rules.\"",
      "Apple said the Commission had made \"a series of decisions that are bad for the privacy and security of our users, bad for products, and force us to give away our technology for free.\"",
      "It also accused the Commission of \"[moving] the goal posts\" during their meetings.",
      "Meta said the ruling means Chinese and European companies are allowed to operate to different standards compared to American businesses.",
      "\"This isn't just about a fine; the Commission forcing us to change our business model effectively imposes a multi-billion-dollar tariff on Meta while requiring us to offer an inferior service,\" it said in a statement.",
      "Epic dispute",
      "The fines are relatively small given the tech companies' huge worldwide revenues - and are a fraction of Google's \u20ac2.4bn fine from last September.",
      "But they are significant in the context of the current global economic situation.",
      "In February, Donald Trump's White House issued a memorandum complaining about EU and UK regulation of American tech firms.",
      "\"Today's decisions are important in that they confirm that the European Commission will not back down,\" Anne Witt, professor of law at the EDHEC Business School in France, told the BBC.",
      "Prof Witt said the disagreement was \"not so much about substantive antitrust principles,\" given the US government is itself taking a number of big tech companies to court over alleged monopoly power.",
      "They are more \"about the fact that European institutions are telling US companies how to behave, even if these decisions are limited to have these companies behave on European soil,\" she added.",
      "One company pleased with the ruling against Apple is Epic Games, the makers of Fortnite.",
      "They had a long-running dispute over the distribution of their apps on Apple devices.",
      "Epic Games chief executive Tim Sweeney said the ruling was \"great news for app developers worldwide\" in a thread on X.",
      "He urged the US to pass similar legislation which would allow developers to distribute their apps without using Apple's App Store, which charges fees for using its platform.",
      "A US-based think tank, which is partly funded by big tech firms including Apple and Meta, came out against the decision.",
      "The Information Technology and Innovation Foundation said the European Commission \"has made clear that the DMA will be used to extract revenues from U.S. firms even as they continue striving to comply with its strictures.\"",
      "\"The Commission's actions today will not be well received by the Trump administration,\" it said.",
      "The UK is also investigating big tech companies over alleged monopoly power, after a digital competition law was brought in last year focusing on companies with large market shares.",

    "summary": "Humanoid robots are attracting a lot of investment but will China dominate the industry?",
    "story": [
      "It's a bright spring morning in Hanover, Germany, and I'm on my way to meet a robot.",
      "I have been invited to see the G1, a humanoid robot built by Chinese firm, Unitree, at the Hannover Messe, one of the world's largest industrial trade shows.",
      "Standing at about 4'3\" (130cm), G1 is smaller and more affordable than other humanoid robots on the market, and has such a highly fluid range of motion and dexterity that videos of it performing dance numbers and martial arts have gone viral.",
      "Today the G1 is being controlled remotely by Pedro Zheng, the Unitree sales manager.",
      "He explains that customers must program each G1 for autonomous functions.",
      "Passers-by stop and actively try to engage with the G1, which cannot be said for a lot of the other machines being shown off in the cavernous conference room.",
      "They reach out to shake its hand, make sudden movements to see if it will respond, they laugh when G1 waves or bends backwards, they apologise if they bump into it. There's something about its human shape that, uncanny as it is, sets people at ease.",
      "Unitree is just one of dozens of companies around the world developing robots that have a human form.",
      "The potential is huge - for business it promises a workforce that doesn't need holidays or pay rises.",
      "It could also be the ultimate domestic appliance. After all, who wouldn't want a machine that could do the laundry and stack the dishwasher.",
      "But the technology is still some way off. While robotic arms and mobile robots have been common in factories and warehouses for decades, conditions in those workplaces can be controlled and workers can be kept safe.",
      "Introducing a humanoid robot to a less predictable environment, like a restaurant or a home, is a much more difficult problem.",
      "To be useful humanoid robots would have to be strong, but that also makes them potentially dangerous - simply falling over at the wrong time could be hazardous.",
      "So much work needs to be done on the artificial intelligence that would control such a machine.",
      "\"The AI simply has not yet reached a breakthrough moment,\" a Unitree spokesperson tells the BBC.",
      "\"Today's robot AI finds basic logic and reasoning \u2013 such as for understanding and completing complex tasks in a logical way \u2013 a challenge,\" they said.",
      "At the moment their G1 is marketed at research institutions and tech companies, who can use Unitree's open source software for development.",
      "For now entrepreneurs are focussing their efforts on humanoid robots for warehouses and factories.",
      "The highest profile of those is Elon Musk. His car company, Tesla, is developing a humanoid robot called Optimus. In January he said that \"several thousand\" will be built this year and he expects them to be doing \"useful things\" in Tesla factories.",
      "Other carmakers are following a similar path. BMW recently introduced humanoid robots to a US factory. Meanwhile, South Korean car firm Hyundai has ordered tens of thousands of robots from Boston Dynamics, the robot firm it bought in 2021.",
      "Thomas Andersson, founder of research firm STIQ, tracks 49 companies developing humanoid robots - those with two arms and legs. If you broaden the definition to robots with two arms, but propel themselves on wheels, then he looks at more than 100 firms.",
      "Mr Andersson thinks that Chinese companies are likely to dominate the market.",
      "\"The supply chain and the entire ecosystem for robotics is huge in China, and it's really easy to iterate developments and do R&D [research and development],\" he says.",
      "Unitree underlines that advantage - its G1 is cheap (for a robot) with an advertised price of $16,000 (\u00a312,500).",
      "Also, Mr Andersson points out, the investment favours Asian nations.",
      "In a recent report STIQ notes that almost 60% of all funding for humanoid robots has been raised in Asia, with the US attracting most of the rest.",
      "Chinese companies have the added benefit of support from the national and local government.",
      "For example, in Shanghai there is a state-backed training facility for robots, where dozens of humanoid robots are learning to complete tasks.",
      "So how can US and European robot makers compete with that?",
      "Bristol-based Bren Pierce has founded three robotics companies and the latest, Kinisi has just launched the KR1 robot.",
      "While the robot has been designed and developed in the UK, it will be manufactured in Asia.",
      "\"The problem you get as a European or American company, you have to buy all these sub-components from China in the first place.",
      "\"So then it becomes stupid to buy your motors, buy your batteries, buy your resistors, shift them all halfway around the world to put together when you could just put them all together at the source, which is in Asia.\"",
      "As well as making his robots in Asia, Mr Pierce is keeping costs down by not going for the full humanoid form.",
      "Designed for warehouses and factories, the KR1 does not have legs.",
      "\"All of these places have flat floors. Why would you want the added expense of a very complex form factor... when you could just put it on a mobile base?\" he asks.",
      "Where possible, his KR1 is built with mass-produced components - the wheels are the same as you would find on an electric scooter.",
      "\"My philosophy is buy as many things as you can off the shelf. So all our motors, batteries, computers, cameras, they're all commercially available, mass produced parts,\" he says.",
      "Like his competitors at Unitree, Mr Pierce says that the real \"secret sauce\" is the software that allows the robot to work with humans.",
      "\"A lot of companies come out with very high-tech robots, but then you start needing a PhD in robotics to be able to actually install it and use it.",
      "\"What we're trying to design is a very simple to use robot where your average warehouse or factory worker can actually learn how to use it in a couple of hours,\" Mr Pierce says.",
      "He says the KR1 can perform a task after being guided through it by a human 20 or 30 times.",
      "The KR1 will be given to pilot customers to test this year.",
      "So will robots ever break out of factories into the home? Even the optimistic Mr Pierce says it's a long way off.",
      "\"My long term dream for the last 20 years has been building the everything robot. This is what I was doing my PhD work in I do think that is the end goal, but it's a very complicated task,\" says Mr Pierce.",
      "\"I still think eventually they will be there, but I think that's at least 10 to 15 years away.\""

    "published": "Fri, 25 Apr 2025 06:56:30 GMT",
    "summary": "Australia has proposed to create a strategic reserve of critical minerals.",
    "story": [
      "Australia's prime minister Anthony Albanese has pledged to invest A$1.2bn (\u00a3580m) in a strategic reserve for critical minerals if he wins next month's election, as trade tensions escalate.",
      "The announcement came after China imposed export restrictions on seven rare earth elements, essential to the production of advanced technologies - including electric vehicles, fighter jets, and robots.",
      "China's controls apply to all countries but were widely seen as retaliation to US President Donald Trump's tariffs.",
      "Albanese said Australia would prioritise minerals that are key to its security, and that of its partners, including rare earths. But could his plan challenge China's dominance?",
      "What are rare earth minerals and why are they important?",
      "Rare earths are a group of 17 elements - named \"rare\" because they are notoriously difficult to extract and refine.",
      "Rare earths, like samarium and terbium, are critical to the production of technologies set to shape the world in the coming decades \u2013 including electric vehicles and highly advanced weapons systems.",
      "Albanese's proposed reserve includes rare earths as well as other critical minerals of which Australia is a top producer - like lithium and cobalt.",
      "Both China and Australia have rare earth reserves. But 90% of rare earth refining \u2013 which makes them usable in technology \u2013 takes place in China, giving the country significant control over supply.",
      "And that has spooked Western governments.",
      "Why is China restricting the export of rare earth minerals?",
      "Beijing said its restrictions on rare earths were in response to Trump's sweeping tariffs on Chinese imports to the US, currently at 145%.",
      "But analysts say Washington's inability to secure the supply of rare earths has become one of the Trump administration's chief anxieties, especially as diplomatic tensions with Beijing have deepened.",
      "Around 75% of US rare earth imports came from China between 2019 and 2022, according to the US Geological Survey.",
      "Philip Kirchlechner, director of Iron Ore Research in Perth, Western Australia, told the BBC that the US and EU had \"dropped the ball\" on recognising the importance of the rare earths over recent decades, as China swiftly developed a monopoly over refinement.",
      "\"China has its foot on the blood vein\u2026 of US and European defence systems,\" he added.",
      "Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, this week said that China halting exports of rare earths used in advanced magnets was affecting the company's ability to develop humanoid robots, in an early symbol of the pain Beijing has the power to inflict on US companies.",
      "Could Australia's proposal change the game?",
      "Albanese's proposal says that minerals in the reserve will be available to both \"domestic industry and international partners\", in a likely reference to allies such as the US and EU.",
      "But Kirchlechner, while welcoming the move as \"long overdue\", added that the proposal is \"not going to solve the problem\".",
      "The fundamental issue is that even if Australia stockpiles more critical minerals, the refining process of rare earths will still largely be controlled by China.",
      "Lithium \u2013 not a rare earth, but a crucial metal in the production electric vehicle batteries and solar panels \u2013 is a good example. Australia mines 33% of the world's lithium, but only refines and exports a tiny fraction. China, on the other hand, mines just 23% of the world's lithium, but refines 57% of it, according to the International Energy Agency.",
      "Australia has been investing in refining rare earths as part of its Future Made in Australia plan, aimed at leveraging the country's critical minerals reserves to drive the green transition.",
      "Arafura Rare Earths, headquartered in Perth, Western Australia, last year received A$840m in funding to create the country's first combined mine and refinery for rare earths. And in November, Australia opened its first rare earths processing plant, also in Western Australia, operated by Lynas Rare Earths.",
      "But the country is expected to depend on China for refining until at least 2026, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, headquartered in Washington.",
      "How will the US and China respond?",
      "China has been trying to seize on the volatility brought by Trump.",
      "In a series of editorials in Australian newspapers, China's ambassador to Canberra lambasted Washington's approach to global trade, and called on Australia to \"join hands\" with Beijing - something that Albanese quickly rejected.",
      "Australia has touted its resource industry in its talks with Trump. Some critical minerals were exempt from a 10% tariff he imposed on imports of most Australian products.",
      "But analysts say Albanese's proposal is mainly aimed at protecting Australia and its partners from strategic adversaries like China.",
      "Alicia Garc\u00eda-Herrero, chief economist for Asia-Pacific at Natixis, told the BBC that Albanese's plan was \"more sophisticated\" than previous proposals, because it included the ability to sell Australia's resources at moments of economic tension.",
      "If China imposes export controls, she added, Australia could begin selling more of its mineral reserves to help lower prices on global markets, and loosen the control China has had on setting prices.",
      "But she said that Australia still cannot completely replace China.",
      "\"If [Australia's] goal is to serve the West, become more instrumental to the West \u2013 especially the US \u2013 there are weak spots China can enter \u2013 and the most important is refining.\"",

    "summary": "The rail and road link will slash journey times between much of Scandinavia and continental Europe.",
    "story": [
      "A record-breaking tunnel is being built under the Baltic Sea between Denmark and Germany, which will slash travel times and improve Scandinavia's links with the rest of Europe.",
      "Running for 18km (11 miles), the Fehmarnbelt will be the world's longest pre-fabricated road and rail tunnel.",
      "It's also a remarkable feat of engineering, that will see segments of the tunnel placed on top of the seafloor, and then joined together.",
      "The project's main construction site is located at the northern entrance to the tunnel, on the coast of Lolland island in the south east of Denmark.",
      "The facility spans more than 500 hectares (1,235 acres), and includes a harbour and a factory that is manufacturing the tunnel sections, which are called \"elements\".",
      "\"It's a huge facility here,\" says Henrik Vincentsen, chief executive of Femern, the state-owned Danish company that is building the tunnel.",
      "To make each 217m (712ft) long and 42m wide element reinforced steel is cast with concrete.",
      "Most underwater tunnels - including the 50km Channel Tunnel between the UK and France \u2013 burrow through bedrock beneath the seafloor. Here instead, 90 individual elements will be linked up, piece by piece, like Lego bricks.",
      "\"We are breaking records with this project,\" says Mr Vincentsen. \"Immersed tunnels have been built before, but never on this scale.\"",
      "With a price-tag around \u20ac7.4bn ($8.1bn; \u00a36.3bn) the scheme has mostly been financed by Denmark, with \u20ac1.3bn from the European Commission.",
      "It's among the region's largest-ever infrastructure projects, and part of a wider EU plan to strengthen travel links across the continent while reducing flying.",
      "Once completed, the journey between R\u00f8dbyhavn in southern Denmark and Puttgarten in northern Germany, will take just 10 minutes by car, or seven minutes by train, replacing a 45-minute ferry voyage.",
      "Bypassing western Denmark, the new rail route will also halve travel times between Copenhagen and Hamburg from five to 2.5 hours, and provide a \"greener\" shortcut for freight and passengers.",
      "\"It's not only linking Denmark to Germany, it's linking Scandinavia to central Europe,\" states Mr Vincentsen. \"Everybody's a winner,\" he claims. \"And by travelling 160km less, you'll also cut carbon and reduce the impact of transport.\"",
      "Towered over by cranes, the tunnel entrance sits at the base of a steep coastal wall with sparkling seawater lying overhead.",
      "\"So now we are in the first part of the tunnel,\" announces senior construction manager Anders Gert Wede, as we walk inside the future highway. It's one of five parallel tubes in each element.",
      "There are two for railway lines, two for roads (which have two lanes in each direction), and a maintenance and emergency corridor.",
      "At the other end enormous steel doors hold back the sea. \"As you can hear, it's quite thick,\" he says tapping on the metal.  \"When we have a finished element  at the harbour, it will be towed out to the location and then we will slowly immerse it behind the steel doors here.\"",
      "Not only are these elements long, they're enormously heavy, weighing over 73,000 tonnes. Yet incredibly, sealing the ends watertight and fitting them with ballast tanks, gives enough buoyancy to tow them behind tugboats.",
      "Next it's a painstakingly complex procedure, lowering the elements 40 metres down into a trench dug out on the seafloor, using underwater cameras and GPS-guided equipment, to line it up with 15mm precision.",
      "\"We have to be very, very careful,\" emphasises Mr Wede. \"We have a system called 'pin and catch' where you have a V-shaped structure and some arms grabbing onto the element, dragging it slowly into place.\"",
      "Denmark sits at the mouth of the Baltic, on a stretch of sea with busy shipping lanes.",
      "With layers of clay and bedrock of chalk, the subsurface is too soft to drill a bore tunnel, said Per Goltermann, a professor in concrete and structures at the Technical University of Denmark.",
      "A bridge was initially considered, but strong winds might disrupt traffic, and security was another important consideration.",
      "\"There was the risk of ships crashing into bridges. We can build the bridge so they can withstand it,\" he adds. \"But this is rather deep water, and the biggest ships can sail there.\"",
      "So, adds Mr Goltermann, it was decided to go with an immersed tunnel. \"They looked at it and said, \"Okay, what is the cheapest? The tunnel. What is the safest? The tunnel.\"",
      "Denmark and Germany signed an agreement to build the tunnel back in 2008, but the scheme was delayed by opposition from ferry operators and German conservation groups concerned about the ecological impact.",
      "One such environmental group, Nabu (The Nature And Biodiversity Conservation Union), argued that this area of the Baltic is an important habitat for larvae and harbour porpoises, which are sensitive to underwater noise.",
      "However in 2020 their legal challenge was dismissed by a federal court in Germany, which green-lighted construction to go ahead.",
      "\"We have done a lot of initiatives to make sure that the impact of this project is as small as possible,\" says Mr Vincentsen, pointing to a 300-hectare wetland nature and recreational area that's planned on reclaimed land, which has been built from the dredged up sand and rock.",
      "When the tunnel opens in 2029, Femern estimates that more than 100 trains and 12,000 cars will use it each day.",
      "According to plans, revenues collected from toll fees will repay the state-backed loans that were taken out to finance the construction, and Mr Vincentsen calculates that will take around four decades.  \"Ultimately, the users are going to pay,\" he says.",
      "It's also hoped the huge investment will boost jobs, business and tourism in Lolland, which is one of Denmark's poorest regions.",
      "\"The locals down here have been waiting for this project for a lot of years,\" said Mr Wede, who grew up nearby. \"They're looking forward to businesses coming to the area.\""

    "story": [
      "Mortgage rates are expected to come down over the next year, which could make owning a home a possibility for millions more people.",
      "Thinking about where to start can be a daunting prospect, but there are an increasing number of ways to save up for a deposit, and get a foothold in the housing market.",
      "We spoke to some leading mortgage experts to get their tips for anyone starting out on the journey to owning their own home.",
      "1. Start saving as soon as you can",
      "The average deposit paid for a first-time buyer is \u00a334,500, according to UK Finance. So the sooner you start saving, the better.",
      "A Lifetime ISA (individual savings account) offers 25% bonuses for those who are saving for a first home. For each \u00a34,000 saved in any given tax year, the government will top it up with an extra \u00a31,000.",
      "Digital mortgage broker Tembo specialises in helping first-time buyers, and has seen a rise in savers starting young.",
      "\"If you maxed out your savings allowance from the age of 18 to 30, you could pick up \u00a322,000 in free bonuses,\" says Tembo chief executive Richard Dana.",
      "\"Family members can contribute too. But beware that the money can only be withdrawn to fund a first-time home purchase up to the value of \u00a3450,000.\"",
      "2. Look at low-deposit mortgage options",
      "Those struggling to raise a deposit have now got a broad range of 95% loan-to-value (LTV) deals available, says David Hollingworth from mortgage brokers London & Country.",
      "In fact, more low-deposit mortgages are available to choose from than at any time since the financial crisis of 2008, according to new figures.",
      "\"Yorkshire Building Society offers a \u00a35,000 deposit mortgage which does what it says on the tin and could offer a mortgage equivalent to as much as 99% of the purchase price,\" says Mr Hollingsworth.",
      "\"Skipton's Track Record mortgage can offer as much as 100% lending for those that can demonstrate a track record of paying rent that exceeds the mortgage payment.\"",
      "However, small deposit mortgages typically offer higher rates, and may not be suitable for many self-employed homebuyers who may struggle to meet the strict eligibility criteria.",
      "3. Explore shared ownership",
      "Shared ownership has been available in England since the 1980s and enables a first-time buyer to own a \"share\" in their home of between 25% and 75% of the value. There are similar schemes available in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.",
      "You need a small deposit and can take out a mortgage to buy your share and then pay rent to the landlord for the rest.",
      "Over time you can increase the amount of the property you own and reduce rental payments. It's known as \"staircasing\" and the aim is to eventually own your home outright.",
      "\"Although shared ownership is usually seen as an option for younger, first-time buyers, that is not always the case,\" says Laura Gaskell, sales manager at shared ownership specialists Snugg Homes.",
      "\"The average age of a buyer with us is now 48 and we have people who have been homeowners previously. Our advice is to register your interest and regularly check the eligibility criteria.\"",
      "4. Consider an 'income boost' mortgage",
      "The \"Bank of Mum and Dad\" might not be an option for some, but there are ways to get help from family members without borrowing any money at all.",
      "An \"income boost\" mortgage (otherwise known as a Joint Borrower Sole Proprietor mortgage) allows a homebuyer to add up to three family members (or in some cases friends) to their mortgage to increase the amount they can borrow from a lender.",

      "All major UK lenders are now offering fixed mortgage deals with an interest rate of less than 4%, but brokers say further cuts are not guaranteed.",
      "A mini price war has broken out between mortgage providers, although many of the lowest-rate deals still require borrowers to provide a hefty deposit and a substantial fee.",
      "More frequent cuts in interest rates by the Bank of England are expected this year, amid global economic turmoil.",
      "However, lenders are already reflecting those predicted cuts in their latest deals, suggesting borrowers could be taking a risk by relying on ongoing drops in mortgage costs.",
      "\"If the base rate does come down then there is a chance fixes could get a bit cheaper but there are no guarantees,\" said Aaron Strutt, from broker Trinity Financial.",
      "Timing issue for borrowers",
      "Some tracker and variable rate mortgages move closely in line with the Bank of England's base rate, which is expected to be cut from 4.5% on 8 May.",
      "However, more than eight in 10 mortgage customers have fixed-rate deals. The interest rate on this kind of mortgage does not change until the deal expires, usually after two or five years, and a new one is chosen to replace it.",
      "About 800,000 fixed-rate mortgages, currently with an interest rate of 3% or below, are expected to expire every year, on average, until the end of 2027.",

      "Low-deposit mortgage deals highest for 17 years",
      "When will interest rates go down again?",
      "However, lenders are offering attention-grabbing sub-4% deals again to some customers. They were seen briefly in February, but market-watchers had not expected them to return for a while.",
      "The fallout from US tariffs policy has led the markets to settle on a view of more base rate cuts this year.",
      "As a result, so-called swap rates - a key measure on which mortgage deals are priced - have fallen.",
      "Equally, there is now little to tell between swap rates - and therefore mortgage rates - over two years and five years.",
      "\"More borrowers are taking two-year fixes on the assumption rates will reduce but many may be better off taking longer term fixes for the payment security,\" Mr Strutt said.",
      "Rachael Hunnisett believes that many people want to step away from \"the roulette wheel\" of short-term fixed-rate deals.",
      "\"There is a cohort who just do not want to take that level of risk with their home,\" she said, arguing that everyday payments, like children's activities, are affected if borrowers find themselves having to pay a higher rate after two years.",
      "She is the director of mortgage distribution at April Mortgages, which provides 10 and 15-year mortgages. The rates are generally higher, but the certainty of payments she feels is a selling point.",
      "The company is now offering home loans at seven times a borrower's income, which is higher than for many shorter-term loans.",
      "Brokers say this is one example of a host of lenders competing by potentially allowing customers more flexibility to borrow larger amounts, particularly first-time buyers.",
      "They also point to the UK's biggest building society, the Nationwide, making changes earlier in the week that offered improved rates to those remortgaging - another sign of greater competition.",
      "David Hollingworth, from broker L&C, said that the sub-4% deals were now becoming part of the core range of mortgages offered by the big lenders.",
      "But he warned the global economic uncertainty meant these rates could quite quickly move either way.",
      "As a result, borrowers were increasingly applying for deals, almost as a backstop months before their old deals expired, he said. If rates improve before the new deal starts, then they could still switch to a better rate."

      "While the quarterly change can skew annual comparisons, the regulator illustrates the effect of the price cap with the annual bill for a household using a typical amount of gas and electricity.",
      "In the three months from July last year, that typical bill stood at \u00a31,568 a year. It rose on each of the three occasions the cap was set after that, the most recent of which was at the start of April.",
      "The predicted fall of almost 9% in July - if it happens - would bring it sharply down to the lowest level since last September.",
      "Cornwall Insight also expects a slight fall in prices in October and another drop in January 2026.",
      "However, analysts said great uncertainty still surrounded these forecasts.",
      "\"While a fall in bills will always be welcomed by households, we mustn't get ahead of ourselves.

      "Avnee Morjaria, associate director at the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR), who worked for the DfE when the expansion programme was being developed, says the school-based nursery programme is a \"glimmer of hope\".",
      "\"If they are delivered and delivered well, I think that has got a lot of potential. It just makes sense in terms of communities and schools and nurseries being the hub of their communities to have that kind of policy.\"",
      "But for now, the system is still heavily reliant on private nurseries.",
      "Private nurseries are facing 'huge increases'",
      "There are more than 20,000 private and voluntary nurseries in the UK, which provide most early years places, but many are unhappy with the current situation and some are struggling to make the funded hours scheme work.",
      "Purnima Tanuku, executive chair of National Day Nurseries Association (NDNA), says most providers are facing \"huge increases\" in their operating costs from April, including statutory wage increases, changes to national insurance contributions and rising utility bills.",
      "The government says it is increasing its funding for all pre-school children to reflect the wage increases and is providing an additional \u00a375 million grant for nurseries to expand.",
      "But some nurseries say the money they receive for three-and-four-year olds is not enough and they can no longer subsidise it with the money parents pay for younger children - as from September the state will be paying for 80% of childcare in England.",
      "The DfE is also clamping down on nurseries charging for extras, such as meals, snacks and nappies. Its updated guidance says that nurseries are entitled to ask parents to pay for such extras - but these charges must be clear and are voluntary.",
      "This is causing \"enormous stress,\" claims Ms Tanuku.",
      "\"We can't give out meals for free\" one nursery owner told me, \"we just don't know how this is going to work\".",
      "Some nurseries have threatened to pull out of the scheme altogether.",
      "But Phillipson says that \"despite the inherited challenges\", they are pressing ahead \"with the investment and leadership needed to support families and make sure that every child, regardless of background, can access the high-quality early education they deserve\".",
      "In the meantime, local authority-run nurseries are continuing their long term decline. The BBC has found that 23 council-run nurseries, 16 Sure Start centres and 12 maintained nursery schools, which offer funded hours, are either under review, being privatised or in the process of closing across England.",
      "Staffing was one of the main reasons given. Finding suitable trained staff remains a real problem for the sector.",
      "Working families and eligibility",
      "The cost of childcare in the UK remains one of the highest in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries, for many parents who cannot access the free hours.",
      "To qualify for the new hours, all adults in a household must be working and earn more than \u00a39,518 but less than \u00a3100,000 per year.",
      "David from London was devastated to find out that he and his wife were not eligible for the free hours. His wife is retraining to be an occupational therapist so they aren't classed as a \"working family\". And London and the East of England have the highest childcare costs in England.",
      "\"We just assumed we were eligible and didn't think for a second we wouldn't be,\" he says. \"It's just the unfairness of it\u2026 it seems to be a huge oversight.",
      "\"The NHS does offer a bursary but we are having to use our savings and are paying \u00a320,000 a year now on childcare. It's a huge disincentive to retraining and to a lot of people it would be prohibitive.\"",
      "The government says there is a range of support for students in further or higher education.",
      "Coram Family and Childcare's annual report, which looks at the cost of childcare, warned that families who aren't eligible, are not in work, or who do not earn enough to be eligible are now paying an average of around \u00a35,000 a year more than families who do have access, for a part-time place for a child under two.",
      "This raises questions, according to the report, about whether disadvantaged children have the same opportunities as their more affluent peers.",
      "Research by IPPR with Save the Children found that the childcare expansion is at risk of not delivering for those families. Only a third of the poorest families use formal childcare, compared to almost three quarters of the highest earning households.",
      "\"The government is in a really tough spot,\" says Ms Morjaria. \"They have this kind of legacy policy that the Conservative government have chosen to fund and it clearly leaves out a section of young children and gives access to those with working families.",
      "\"Is it a gap widening policy? Of course it is, particularly where you think about early childcare as early education, because there is a really substantial proportion of young children not receiving that.\"",
      "Question of child development",
      "The government's other ambition is for 75% of children to reach a \"good level of development\" at the end of reception, by 2028. (This includes skills like being able to follow instructions in maths and literacy.)",
      "The figure was 67.7% in 2023 to 2024. Phillipson has said \"giving every child the best start in life is my top priority, and integral to our mission to ensure tens of thousands more children are school ready every year\".",
      "The poorest children have access to 15 hours a week of free childcare during term-time when they are two, but children of working parents will have access to 30 hours from nine months.",
      "\"That's quite difficult\", says Ms Farquharson. \"It is that disadvantaged group that's precisely those most vulnerable children [who] you want to target and support.\"",
      "In the Shirecliffe area of Sheffield, Meadows Nursery opened during the pandemic in joint venture with the local school, Sheffield Hallam University and charity, Save the Children.",
      "The idea was to help children who were already behind and give parents access to spaces. \"A private nursery would not have opened here in a million years\", claims Claire Carroll, who is head of nurseries at the university.",
      "Most of the children in the 40-place setting are two and three, and receive 15 hours a week of free childcare. \"We find many of them haven't reached their physical milestones,\" she says.",
      "\"They might live in a one bedroom flat with six people in it and no balcony, they haven't got a garden to run around in and the local parks are run down and not necessarily safe.\"",
      "She believes that it is vital to give this group of children more access to free childcare.",
      "The Dfe has announced \"the largest ever uplift to the early years pupil premium, increasing the rate by over 45%\", so the most disadvantaged children are accessing the high-quality early years education they need, a spokesperson said.",
      "A system under strain",
      "The government is doubling the amount it spends on childcare to help parents back into the workplace. By 2026, it will cost around \u00a38bn. But the system is under strain.",
      "What it needs is the right staff and enough places to make it work. Helping children reach a good level of development is also vital, according to many of those experts.",
      "Phillipson has been clear: \"every child, regardless of background\" should be able to access high-quality early education.",
      "It remains to be seen how the system will cope from September.",
      "However Farquharson believes the government's dual aims \u2013 around growth and child development - are trying to solve different problems.",
      "\"We're doubling the amount that we spend on free childcare in England,\" she warns, \"[and] when you make that kind of a policy commitment, there's always going to be a risk of unintended consequences.\"",

      "He told the Daily Mail \"they're not all true\", and said he had felt \"under attack\" and had contemplated suicide.",

      "Wallace has faced further claims of \"groping\" and \"touching\" since the original allegations. He strenuously denies them.",
      "MasterChef's production company, Banijay, has launched an inquiry into the historical allegations.",
      "In a post on Instagram Wallace said he \"meant every word\" of his Mail interview.",
      "\"It was hard to do, but speaking honestly for myself, my family and especially my mum, felt right,\" he wrote.",
      "He said he now needed \"space to heal and be with the people who know who I really am\".",
      "In his first interview since the claims emerged, Wallace said that he had received \"a tidal wave of abuse\" on social media after posting a video on Instagram hitting out at his accusers.",
      "In the video, which he subsequently apologised for, he said the claims against him had come from \"a handful of middle-class women of a certain age\".",
      "\"News channels were updating hourly with new allegations,\" he said.",
      "\"You're watching yourself get personally ripped apart, criticised, accused of all sorts of stuff over and over again. You're thinking, this isn't true. It isn't true. What's coming next?\"",
      "Wallace said he couldn't sleep at the time, adding: \"The feeling of being under attack, of isolation, of abandonment was overwhelming. Nobody from the BBC contacted me once these stories started breaking \u2013 absolutely nobody at all.\"",

      "Wallace said that at the time, his mother called him to ask why people were \"picking on him\".",
      "He said he responded: \"I've said something really stupid. They're investigating my behaviour, but more and more people are coming forward with complaints about me. Mum, they're not all true. I haven't done these things.\"",
      "Wallace revealed that his mother recently died, adding that it was \"terribly sad\" that she had spent the last few days of her life reading \"horrible things\" about him.",
      "One of the women who spoke to BBC News as part of its investigation was broadcaster Kirsty Wark who appeared on Celebrity MasterChef.",
      "Wark accused Wallace of telling \"sexualised jokes\" during the filming of the show, and said that it left people feeling \"uncomfortable\".",
      "But Wallace says he was never aware he had offended her until it came to light last year, saying: \"I thought we got on.\"",
      "Other high-profile media personalities, including Vanessa Feltz and Kirstie Allsopp, also spoke up at the time.",
      "Wallace said that Feltz's complaint \"knocked him for six\", and also pushed back against Allsopp's comments about his language, saying: \"I wouldn't have said that.\"",
      "'Absolutely not true'",
      "Writing on Instagram in November, singer Sir Rod Stewart described Wallace as an \"ill-mannered bully\", and said the presenter \"humiliated\" his wife Penny Lancaster when she was on Masterchef in 2021.",
      "Addressing that claim, Wallace said it was a \"shame\" as he liked Sir Rod. He acknowledged there had been a \"falling out\" between himself and Lancaster, but said it was over \"whether an orchid should stay on a bowl of soup or not\".",
      "He also addressed other allegations that emerged towards the end of last year, including one that he'd walked around on set naked with a sock on his penis.",
      "He admitted to putting a \"sock over my private bits\" and opening his dressing room door shouting \"hooray\", but claimed he did this to three friends who were in the studio after filming had finished, rather than while it was taking place.",
      "He admitted that some of the inappropriate jokes were \"probably true\", saying: \"Some of what's been said sounds like the sort of comments I'd have made.\"",
      "But he insisted he never groped any workers, calling those claims \"absolutely not true\".",
      "He also said that many of those who work with him had been supportive, including John Torode, his co-presenter on MasterChef.",

      "When Banijay launched an inquiry, Wallace said his \"world tumbled in\".",
      "\"It's very difficult to explain the pressure unless you've been through it. I thought about suicide all the time: \"Is my insurance up to date? Will [Wallace's wife] Anna get some money? She doesn't deserve this. It would be better if I wasn't here.\"",
      "He told the newspaper Banijay had arranged for a crisis mentor to support him.",
      "Wallace said he was recently diagnosed with autism, saying: \"I want to make it absolutely clear I'm not blaming my behaviour on my diagnosis, but it does explain a hell of a lot to me.\"",
      "He added that he accepts he was \"very slow to wake up\" to a changing work environment.",
      "\"It wasn't until seven years ago that I had a massive wake-up call and realised the loud, energetic greengrocer persona I was on the telly was, maybe, becoming redundant. So I changed.\"",
      "\"I honestly never meant to upset anyone. I thought I was going in every day and just delivering what was wanted. I didn't realise I was causing any problems.\"",
      "Wallace has been one of Britain's most high profile presenters for more than two decades.",
      "BBC News, which is editorially independent from the wider organisation, started investigating Wallace last summer, after becoming aware of allegations. The claims were made across five shows, from 2005 to 2022.",
      "Most of the allegations came from production workers. Many were young female freelancers.",
      "Allegations heard include Wallace talking openly about his sex life, taking his top off in front of a female worker saying he wanted to \"give her a fashion show\", and telling a junior female colleague he wasn't wearing any boxer shorts under his jeans.",
      "BBC News has also heard from a former MasterChef worker who says he showed her topless pictures of himself and asked for massages, and a former worker on Channel 5's Gregg Wallace's Big Weekends, who says he was fascinated by the fact she dated women and asked for the logistics of how it worked.",
      "Another female worker on MasterChef in 2019 says Wallace talked about his sex life; a female worker on the BBC Good Food Show in 2010 says Wallace stared at her chest; and a male worker on MasterChef in 2005-06 says Wallace regularly said sexually explicit things on set.",
      "After BBC News's initial investigation, more women came forward with claims.",
      "One woman says he touched her bottom at an event and another says he pressed his crotch against her while filming on a different show.",
      "His lawyers have strongly denied he engages in behaviour of a sexually harassing nature.",
      "Wallace has repeatedly declined interview requests from BBC News.",

      "In an interview with the Daily Telegraph, Lisa Nandy said there were \"problems\" with the annual charge, with \"fewer and fewer people\" paying the \u00a3174.50 fee.",
      "The charter, which expires in 2027 and is under review, is an agreement between the BBC and the government that sets out the terms and purposes of the corporation - including the existence of the licence fee.",
      "A BBC spokeswoman said the broadcaster looks forward to engaging with the government and securing the long-term future of the BBC.",
      "Nandy has already started negotiations with the BBC about the corporation's funding.",

      "Nandy has previously said the charge was \"deeply regressive\" and that she was thinking \"quite radically and creatively\" about alternatives. But the minister has ruled out using general taxation to fund the BBC.",
      "She did, however, keep open the possibility of a subscription model.",
      "Last month in a Sunday Times interview, the corporation's chairman suggested wealthier households could be charged more.",

    "story": [
      "McFly star Tom Fletcher has said he felt \"overwhelming excitement\" working on the new Paddington stage musical, which producers have confirmed will open in November.",
      "The singer-songwriter said he hoped the music and lyrics he has written for the show would \"do Paddington proud\", adding that the musical numbers are \"my favourite songs I've ever written\".",
      "The show will open at the Savoy Theatre in the West End on 1 November, and follow Paddington as he arrives from Peru seeking a new home in London.",
      "The musical, which has been in development for five years, is based on Michael Bond's original novels and follows the hugely successful recent film series.",
      "Speaking about the show for the first time, Fletcher told BBC News he felt \"so honoured and lucky\" to be working on the project, which he said would reflect \"all of the fun, warmth and heart that the books and movies have captured so brilliantly\".",
      "\"There is something so magical about seeing Paddington step out on to the stage, and seeing him... I was about to say in the flesh, but I guess in the fur is more accurate,\" he joked.",
      "Fletcher is best-known as the founding member of pop band McFly, whose hits include All About You, Obviously and Star Girl, and is also a successful children's author.",
      "He was first approached about Paddington around the time of the first Covid lockdown in early 2020, and workshopped the project with scriptwriter Jessica Swale, director Luke Sheppard and the producers before the show was formally announced in 2023.",
      "With the musical now almost ready to launch, Swale told BBC News it would feature \"lots of juicy new material\".",
      "\"We're bringing a lot of new flavours to the table, but of course we're all in love with the original material, so we've been faithful to our cast of characters,\" she said.",
      "\"Of course the Browns are part of it, and familiar faces like Mr Gruber and Mr Curry, but there are a lot of new people as well. We've been very inspired by the books and the films but we like to think we're covering new territory.\"",
      "Bond's first book in the series, A Bear Called Paddington, was published in 1958.",
      "The author went on to write 29 Paddington books in total, the final one being Paddington at St Paul's, which was published posthumously in 2018. The stories have sold more than 35 million copies worldwide.",
      "Fletcher said he relished the opportunity to find what \"the musical language\" of Paddington was. \"Having something that everybody knows but no-one's heard what it sounds like yet is a really exciting thing to be able to work on,\" he explained.",
      "He recalled that, when producer Eliza Lumley first called him about the project, he not only immediately replied with \"a very fast 'yes please'\", but began writing music for the show right away.",
      "\"While I was still on the phone to her, I had the idea for a song, so I went and wrote my first song for it that night, instantly after getting off the phone, and that song is still in the musical now.\"",
      "He reflected: \"My instant reaction wasn't to be intimidated, it was to be excited and just so inspired by these stories and films that I already knew, I just jumped straight at my piano and started writing.\"",
      "The three film adaptations of Paddington, featuring the voice of Ben Whishaw, have been a huge success at the box office since the first was released in 2014.",
      "In recent years, London has seen pop group Abba represented by virtual avatars on stage, while some animated film characters have been depicted using more traditional puppeteering methods, such as snowman Olaf in the stage adaptation of Frozen.",
      "It has not yet been revealed what approach producers will take to representing Paddington in the theatre.",
      "\"I don't know what you're talking about, he's a bear!\" joked Swale. \"He's travelling from Peru to be a special part of our show!\"",
      "She continued: \"I can't give away our secrets. One of the things I'm most excited about for this show is the character of Paddington.\"",
      "'The politics of Paddington'",
      "Swale credits producers Lumley and Sonia Friedman for \"really experimenting with every possible way that we could tell the bear's story in the best way, and the magic that they've found in how they do it\u201d, adding: \u201cEvery single time I see Paddington for the first time, it makes me cry.",
      "\"I think he's completely magic, and to me he's very real. But I don't think audiences will be disappointed. It's a wonderful, theatrical version of how to tell this story.\"",
      "As for the character himself, Swale noted the musical \"also reveals the spirit and the politics of Paddington\".",
      "\"For example, Paddington is a refugee, so we want to honour the fact that he is somebody who migrates to the UK and doesn't have a home, and make sure we are conscious of the experience of who he represents.\"",
      "Between now and the show's opening in November, Fletcher said the team would be \"fine-tuning for as long as we can, and making sure that we get it absolutely right\".",
      "He added: \"I really hope that I've done everyone who loves Paddington justice... This is so different to anything I've ever done before. I feel like this show is so ready to be out in the world, it's the most special thing I've ever been a part of in my whole life.\"",
      "The 39-year-old will be on tour with McFly and Busted when the musical opens in November, \"so I'll be going from touring with the band and then rushing back to London to fit it all in\", he explained.",
      "\"It's a slightly hectic schedule, but we'll make it work somehow. I might get confused and start singing Paddington songs on stage with McFly.\"",
      "Most important, of course, is the question of whether or not Paddington's favourite food will feature in the stage adaptation.",
      "\"You can rest easy,\" laughed Swale. \"Marmalade features not only in the book and the lyrics, but physically on stage in a spectacular way.\"",

    "story": [
      "Gary Lineker has said he believes the BBC wanted him to leave Match of the Day as he was negotiating a new contract last year.",
      "The presenter and the BBC jointly announced in November that he would be stepping down from the flagship football programme, although he will still host World Cup and FA Cup coverage.",
      "Asked by the BBC's Amol Rajan why he would choose to leave given his successful tenure, Lineker said: \"Well, perhaps they want me to leave. There was the sense of that.\"",
      "The BBC didn't comment on that suggestion, but at the time Lineker's exit was announced, the corporation's director of sport described him as a \"world-class presenter\".",
      "However, the BBC noted in the same statement that Match of the Day \"continually evolves for changing viewing habits\".",
      "A new trio of presenters - Kelly Cates, Mark Chapman and Gabby Logan - was announced in January.",
      "Reflecting on his departure from Match of the Day, Lineker told Rajan: \"It's time. I've done it for a long time, it's been brilliant.\"",
      "However, asked why he'd want to leave when the ratings were still high and it was a job Lineker still enjoyed, the former footballer said he \"had the sense\" the BBC had wanted him to step down.",
      "\"I always wanted one more contract, and I was umm-ing and ahh-ing about whether to do three years [more],\" Lineker explained.",
      "But, he continued, the matter of how long to sign for was complicated by the cycle of broadcasting rights for matches.",
      "\"In the end, I think there was a feeling that, because it was a new rights period, it was a chance to change the programme,\" he said.",
      "\"I think it was their preference that I didn't do Match of the Day for one more year, so they could bring in new people. So it's slightly unusual that I would do the FA Cup and the World Cup, but to be honest, it's a scenario that suits me perfectly.\"",
      "Lineker added that he was pleased his football podcasts had been picked up by BBC Sounds as part of a deal with the corporation.",
      "BBC suspension",
      "Lineker was also asked about comments he posted on social media in March 2023, criticising the then-government's immigration policy.",
      "The remarks led to his suspension from the BBC, prompting other sports presenters to down tools in solidarity, something Lineker said he felt \"moved\" by.",
      "Reflecting on his tweets, Lineker said he did not regret taking the position he did, but that he would not do it again because of the \"damage\" it did to the BBC.",
      "\"I don't regret saying them publicly, because I was right - what I said, it was accurate - so not at all in that sense.",
      "\"Would I, in hindsight, do it again? No I wouldn't, because of all the nonsense that came with it... It was a ridiculous overreaction that was just a reply to someone that was being very rude. And I wasn't particularly rude back.\"",
      "He continued: \"But I wouldn't do it again because of all the kerfuffle that followed, and I love the BBC, and I didn't like the damage that it did to the BBC... But do I regret it and do I think it was the wrong thing to do? No.\"",
      "The row erupted when Lineker called a government asylum policy \"immeasurably cruel\", and said a video promoting it used language that was \"not dissimilar to that used by Germany in the 30s\".",
      "The home secretary at the time, Suella Braverman, who appeared in the video, called his criticism \"offensive\" and \"lazy\", while Downing Street said it was \"not acceptable\".",
      "Lineker's post reignited the debate about the BBC's impartiality guidance on social media and how it applied to presenters.",
      "While staff working in news and current affairs are expected to remain impartial on social platforms, there had been questions over how much the rules extended to BBC personalities in other areas such as entertainment and sport.",
      "Lineker argued that the previous set of rules \"were for people in news and current affairs\".",
      "\"They have subsequently changed,\" he acknowledged. \"But that left people like me, who has always given his honest opinions about things, then they suddenly changed them and you have to go, 'Oh, I've got to be impartial now'. It doesn't make any sense.\"",
      "He added: \"I've always been strong on humanitarian issues and always will be, and that's me.\"",
      "Lineker said that, following his tweets, \"the goalposts were massively moved because it was never an issue until, suddenly, this point\".",
      "The BBC updated its social media guidance in 2023 following a review that was commissioned in the wake of the fallout over Lineker's tweets.",
      "The corporation said presenters of flagship programmes, such as Match of the Day, \"carry a particular responsibility to respect the BBC's impartiality, because of their profile on the BBC\".",
      "Asked if he understood that his comments gave ammunition to the BBC's critics, Lineker said: \"Yes of course, I understand that, but does it make it wrong what I did? I don't think so. Would I do it if I knew what would've happened and transpired? Of course I wouldn't.\"",
      "Gaza doc",
      "Lineker hit the headlines again recently when he, along with 500 other high-profile figures, signed an open later urging the BBC to reinstate a documentary about Gaza to iPlayer.",
      "The documentary, Gaza: How to Survive a War Zone, was pulled from the streaming service in February after it emerged its 13-year-old narrator was the son of a Hamas official.",
      "Lineker told Rajan he would \"100%\" support the documentary being made available again, arguing: \"I think you let people make their own minds up. We're adults. We're allowed to see things like that. It's incredibly moving.\"",
      "He added that, although the 13-year-old was narrating the programme, the script had \"not been written by [the child], it's been written by the people who produced the show\".",
      "\"I think [the BBC] just capitulated to lobbying that they get a lot,\" he said.",
      "After concerns were raised, the BBC took down the programme while it carried out further due diligence. The matter is currently still being investigated by the corporation.",
      "The BBC said it had identified serious flaws in the making of the documentary. The BBC board said the mistakes were \"significant and damaging\".",
      "Gambling in sport",
      "In the wide-ranging interview, which will be broadcast on Tuesday, Lineker also discussed his footballing career, his son's leukemia battle as a baby, and his views on gambling sponsorship in sports.",
      "Lineker said the football industry should rethink its responsibility when it comes to taking money from gambling firms.",
      "\"I know people [for whom] it becomes an addiction, it can completely destroy their lives,\" he said.",
      "\"There's talk about taking [logos] off the shirts, but you see it on the boards around the ground everywhere.",

      "Knowles, 71, says for now, the children are not too exposed to it.",
      "\"But one day they'll read the ignorance that people put out there about them, the lies and all of that,\" she says. \"And I do worry about that.\"",
      "Despite those pressures, she says Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z - who are notoriously private about their home life - are doing an \"amazing\" job as parents.",
      "\"The truth is they spend abnormal amount of time with their children and they have great relationships with their kids,\" she says.",
      "\"And they're just great parents. I don't think you could ask for better parents.\"",
      "Knowles is speaking to BBC News ahead of the publication of her new memoir, Matriarch.",
      "It covers her childhood in Texas, her daughters' rise to fame and her later years, as a grandmother.",
      "Knowles now has four grandchildren, including Julez Smith, the son of her younger daughter, singer-songwriter Solange. She also considers herself a grandmother to former Destiny's Child singer Kelly Rowland's children.",
      "She says that she sees all her grandchildren regularly, describing them as \"one of the biggest joys in my life\".",
      "\"[Blue Ivy and I] have a very close bond,\" she says of her eldest granddaughter.",
      "\"I'm so happy that she feels like she can talk to me,\" she says, adding that Blue Ivy is always giving her advice about taking care of herself.",
      "\"She's my beauty guru. She's my manager,\" she says.",
      "I'm intrigued by this, and ask why she calls the 13-year-old her manager.",
      "\"Well, I don't call her my manager. Everybody else calls her my manager, because she's bossy. She's a little Capricorn like me. So we have that bond.\"",
      "Knowles grew up in 50s and 60s Galveston, the youngest of seven.",
      "In her book, she talks about the harassment her family faced, including from the police.",
      "\"There was a lot of racial tension,\" she tells me. \"And I think some things have changed, but I still think that black people are more susceptible to police brutality [and] being stopped.\"",
      "She met her now ex-husband, Mathew Knowles, in Houston and the pair went on to have two daughters, Beyonc\u00e9 in 1981 and Solange five years later.",
      "Beyonc\u00e9, she writes, was \"not an easy baby\". Nursery rhymes did not cut it (\"she cried louder\" to drown out Mary Had A Little Lamb), but jazz music would soothe her.",
      "As a child, Solange was a \u201csocial butterfly\u201d but Beyonc\u00e9 was shy. \"She walked into every classroom trying to be invisible,\" Knowles writes.",
      "She says at the time, her daughters - and all little black girls - were being \"bombarded\" by messages from mainstream culture that they were \"less than\".",
      "But Beyonc\u00e9 was always singing, and Solange's talent emerged early on too.",
      "\"I knew Beyonc\u00e9 had a very beautiful voice, but I didn't know how talented she was until she was seven,\" Knowles tells me.",
      "\"And Solange probably four, because she just grew up around nothing but music and performances. So she was a lot earlier.\"",
      "Knowles is adamant that she didn't push her daughters into the music industry.",
      "\"Absolutely not. This was not my first choice for my girls. They just lived and breathed music,\" she says.",
      "\"It is their decision. They were born to be entertainers.\"",
      "None of them - including Kelly Rowland, who moved in with the family - were very rebellious, she says. All they wanted to do was sing, dance and perform.",
      "\"I wanted them to have that experience of teenage life and going out to parties and having fun, but I had to force them to do that,\" she says.",
      "In the 1990s, the girl group Destiny's Child was formed. It originally comprised Beyonc\u00e9, Rowland, LaTavia Roberson, and LeToya Luckett, but the final line-up was a trio - Beyonc\u00e9, Rowland, and Michelle Williams.",
      "The band achieved worldwide fame with mega hits such as Bills, Bills, Bills, Say My Name and Jumpin', Jumpin'.",

      "Many interpreted that as a reference to her treatment at the 2016 Country Music Awards, where her performance of Daddy Lessons with The Chicks led to a barrage of criticism - and racism - online.",
      "Knowles says Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s childhood, growing up in Texas and spending time in Louisiana, influenced her music.",
      "\"She was very influenced by [Zydeco, a music genre from Louisiana], and that culture and cowboy culture,\" she says.",
      "She added it was \"interesting\" to hear some saying Beyonc\u00e9 is \"not country Western\" and shouldn't be making that kind of music.",
      "\"It is in her. It\u2019s in her right to make whatever music she feels like making.\"",

    "summary": "Supported housing for vulnerable or disabled people is in crisis, a letter to the prime minister says.",
    "story": [
      "Supported housing, which helps vulnerable or disabled people live independently, is in crisis, an open letter signed by more than 170 organisations in the sector claims.",
      "Services at one in three providers in England had to shut last year, adding to a total shortfall of about 325,000 places, says the letter, which will be delivered to Prime Minister Keir Starmer today. Signatories to it include Refuge, Age UK and the National Housing Federation (NHF).",
      "Blaming cuts to council funding and rising costs, the NHF says a further one in three providers fear they may close unless the government pledges more money.",
      "The government says supported housing is vital and it is focused on building more homes.",
      "About half a million people in the UK currently live in supported housing, including young care leavers, army veterans, people with learning disabilities and those escaping homelessness or domestic abuse.",
      "\"Supported housing plays an indispensable role in cutting NHS waiting list backlogs, and reducing pressure on social care, temporary accommodation, and other vital public services,\" the open letter says.",
      "However, it says the future of supported housing is now at risk following \"years of funding cuts\" and that local authorities have now been forced to \"decommission vital services\".",
      "\"Rising costs alongside reduced funding have rendered many services unviable, forcing many to close, while demand for supported housing continues to rise. The decision to increase employers' National Insurance contributions has placed even further pressure on providers' budgets.\"",
      "The organisations are calling for long-term increased funding for housing-related support of at least \u00a31.6bn per year for councils and for supported homes to be among the 1.5 million new houses planned by the government.",
      "\"We recognise the vital role played by supported housing in helping vulnerable people to live independently and well, and the contribution it makes to tackling rough sleeping and timely hospital discharge,\" a spokesperson for the Department for Housing, Communities and Local Government said.",
      "The spokesperson said the government was putting \u00a32bn into increasing social and affordable housebuilding in 2026-27, with further details to be set out in a long-term housing strategy later this year.",
      "Proponents of austerity measures say tough funding choices need to be made to balance the UK's finances.",
      "However, Shaoxiong Liu says his family do not know what they would have done without a supported housing place for his son Jason.",
      "Aged 39, Jason has autism, a learning disability and mental health challenges. As he grew older, this became increasingly unmanageable for his family. After falling ill, Jason was admitted to hospital with sepsis in 2017.",
      "Due to his challenging behaviour and a condition that induces severe vomiting, he remained in hospital for months as they struggled to find somewhere long term that could accommodate his needs.",
      "He was eventually placed with Advance Housing, where his family says Jason has flourished in the intervening eight years. His weight has risen from 35kg to 53kg, he can go on bus trips and attends social events organised by the housing provider.",
      "\"Jason's behaviour is so much better now. He's lived there so long and he's happy there,\" Mr Liu says. \"Jason is an adult now and we are in our 70s, so his behaviour could be quite dangerous for us if he lived with us - we couldn't look after him.\"",
      "The NHF says one in three providers in England it surveyed say they may have to stop providing services altogether, meaning the loss of 70,000 supported homes across the country.",
      "In 2009, ringfenced council funding for housing-related support was removed. When council budgets were cut during austerity from 2010, funding was needed in other areas, meaning some councils had to cut supported housing services.",
      "The NHF says that means there are now fewer supported homes than in 2007, including a net loss of 3,000 supported homes in the last three years. It calculates there is a total shortfall of up to 325,000 supported homes, based on unmet need.",

    "story": [
      "Chris Brookes-Smith, 28, used to live in fear of dying from eating even the smallest trace of peanut.",
      "Ten years ago he had his worst allergic reaction after ordering a curry at a local Indian takeaway. The trauma of it is seared into his memory.",
      "\"I knew I was in trouble after one bite,\" he says. \"Within seconds there were spots on my lips. Within minutes I was vomiting. I could feel my throat closing up, hives forming in my armpits then over my whole body... My face going all puffy with the swelling.\"",
      "His voice tails off, full of emotion.",
      "\"I thought I was going to die.\"",
      "Photos taken in hospital later that day show the toll the reaction took on his body.",
      "\"I looked like a plucked turkey because my skin had blistered so much,\" Chris says.",
      "But the most painful thing were the hives - red, raised bumps on the skin - which felt \"like boiling water had been poured over me\".",
      "Trying to avoid peanuts, one of the most common food allergies, has been a way of life for Chris and millions of other adults with a serious allergy. Eating out, going to social events and travelling abroad are all fraught with anxiety.",
      "As many as one in 200 adults and one in 50 children have a nut allergy, charities say. Some children grow out of their allergies, but many don't - and they continue into adulthood, often getting worse.",
      "An allergic reaction occurs when the body reacts to the protein in peanuts, thinking it's a threat, which triggers a sudden release of chemicals. Symptoms can range from the mild to very serious.",
      "Chris's allergy first came to light as a baby, when he developed a rash as his mum made peanut butter sandwiches.",
      "Each reaction since has been worse than the one before, which means he's become accustomed to living every day \"on high alert hoping nothing bad happens\".",
      "Activities such as going out with friends or eating in restaurants, which should be enjoyable, turned into stressful, potentially life-threatening experiences.",
      "Despite a love of travel, Chris avoided going to countries where peanuts are commonly used, like south east Asia, after three allergic reactions on a trip to Italy.",
      "As Chris grew up, his family constantly worried about him. But then his mum heard about a clinical trial at Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust and King's College London that would change her son's life.",
      "It would test whether adults like Chris with serious peanut allergies could be desensitised by training their bodies to tolerate the very thing that could kill it, calming down the immune system when it would usually over-react.",
      "Despite being \"really nervous\", Chris agreed to sign up.",
      "From milligrams to whole nuts",
      "Under the watchful eye of doctors, Chris started by eating a fraction of a milligram of peanut powder mixed with yoghurt. Over many months, the amount of peanut was gradually increased, slowly building up to Chris eating fractions of nuts and, finally, whole nuts.",
      "By the end of the nine-month study, 14 of the 21 patients could eat the equivalent of five peanuts without having allergic reactions - including Chris.",
      "Professor Stephen Till, who led the research, says the treatment \"has potential to have a real impact on patients' lives\".",
      "\"Most severe reactions occur because of mistakes, usually by somebody else, and miscommunication. So it provides them with some protection against that.",
      "\"They've taken control, if you like, of their peanut allergy now.\"",
      "The method - called oral immunotherapy - is already proven to work for allergies to pollen, wasp and bee stings. It's only been used on food allergies in the last 20 years, and mostly in children whose immune systems are still developing. Adult allergies are thought to be harder to shift.",
      "\"Peanut allergy is very common in children and almost never goes away,\" says Prof Till. \"Those young people are going to become adults, so we need treatments for adults too.\"",
      "This trial, published in the journal Allergy, shows adults with serious allergies can increase the amount of peanut they can tolerate by 100 times.",
      "Chris, who lives in Northamptonshire, had no idea how he would react to even the slightest trace of peanut. Increasing that dose - willingly - every day was something he couldn't imagine.",
      "\"The first time I went there and I ingest this stuff, my heart's going a million miles an hour,\" he says. \"The big jump in fear was going from peanut dust to half a whole nut.\"",
      "But he was reassured by having a team of doctors and nurses present, with drugs such as adrenaline standing by in case of a severe, life-threatening reaction.",
      "\"You've got 100 eyes on you - nothing is gonna happen.\"",
      "However, experts stress no one should try this at home on their own because of the risk of a serious allergic reaction occurring.",
      "'Wonderful feeling'",
      "Not everyone who tried the treatment was desensitised, and larger trials in more people will have to work out why that is.",
      "\"For some people, there were reactions and we had to slow down or go back a step,\" explains Prof Till. \"But the message is that you can desensitise adults to peanuts -and there should be more focus on adults in the future.\"",
      "Being able to eat peanuts safely had a huge impact on the lives of those who took part, the researchers say. It has given them freedom to travel, reduced their anxiety when eating out and removed their fear of food.",
      "How to develop this into a practical treatment on the NHS is more of a challenge. First, larger trials are needed to prove it can work for more people.",
      "And researchers are looking at whether putting drops of peanut in solution under the tongue could be a safer way of achieving the same end result.",
      "Chris now eats four peanuts every morning with his breakfast granola to keep his allergy at bay \u2013 as recommended by his doctors.",
      "He's grateful for having had the opportunity to take part in the trial and hopes many others with serious peanut allergies can also benefit from the treatment.",
      "While he admits he still hates the flavour of peanuts, he says knowing he can now eat something that once sent his body into \"nuclear meltdown\" has changed his life.",

      "Extreme tiredness and exhaustion among NHS staff poses a significant risk to patients, England's NHS safety watchdog warns.",
      "The Health Services Safety Investigations Body said medication errors, impaired decision-making, reduced attention and rude and disrespectful behaviour were the most common problems associated with fatigued staff in hospitals.",
      "It said there was limited data on the scale of the problem, but cited evidence from staff surveys and information provided by safety experts that it was a contributory factor in safety incidents.",
      "In its report, the watchdog gave examples of mistakes being made with pregnancy scans and chemotherapy drugs.",
      "In one case a mother and baby were harmed after an inaccurate scan, with the staff member saying fatigue and workload contributed.",
      "In the chemotherapy case the staff were nearly nine hours into a 12.5-hour day shift and had only managed five to six hours of sleep between shifts and had limited breaks because of staffing pressures.",
      "The hospital investigation found fatigue was \"likely to have been a factor\".",
      "Sleep-deprived",
      "Some staff reported being sleep-deprived on a daily basis.",
      "And one doctor told the watchdog: \"When it gets to that third day of doing these 12-hour nights it's dangerous from 2am onwards... do I have the energy or the brain space or the mental space to even make a life-changing decision for a patient at this point?\"",
      "The watchdog said exhaustion was also a risk to staff themselves with some complaining of nodding off at the wheel on the way home and reports of staff dying in road accidents after work.",
      "Shift work, long working hours, lack of breaks, caring responsibilities and financial pressures were all cited as factors in staff fatigue.",
      "The watchdog said the issue was often misunderstood in the NHS and thought of more as a wellbeing issue rather than a safety issue.",
      "It said the government and NHS England needed to introduce better systems to monitor fatigue and work with unions and employers to raise awareness about it.",
      "Support available",
      "Senior safety investigator Saskia Fursland said: \"Fatigue is more than just being tired - it can significantly impair decision-making, motor skills, and alertness.",
      "\"We must move away from viewing fatigue as an individual issue and putting the onus on personal responsibility and instead treat it as a system-level risk that deserves urgent attention.\"",
      "Dr Latifa Patel, of the British Medical Association, said the findings were concerning, but not surprising with doctors facing long shifts back-to-back with little respite.",
      "She said there needed to be better rota design to ensure staff could rest properly between shifts and improved rest facilities in hospitals.",
      "But she said fatigue was also \"often driven by workforce shortages\" too.",
      "A spokesperson for NHS England said it recognised staff were at risk of burnout and was \"committed\" to ensuring they got the support they needed to provide safe care.",
      "\"Staff should always feel confident to report patient safety concerns, including those that are linked to fatigue, and we will work with local NHS systems to address any issues,\" he added.",
      "He said the NHS was offering more flexible working options than ever before and there was a range of mental health support available for staff.",

    "story": [
      "More than six million illegal vaping products have been seized by Trading Standards officers across England in the past three years, new analysis by the BBC has found. We joined one of the teams responsible for tracking down the illicit goods as they prepare for a ban on the sale of single-use disposable vapes.",
      "Paul Leighton is packing his rucksack with a heavy-duty hammer, pry bar and evidence bags for what he describes as \"just an average day out\".",
      "As the senior Trading Standards officer at Newcastle City Council, he has learned the hiding places used to conceal illegal vapes can be sophisticated. Sometimes, he has to force his way in.",
      "He has found them hidden everywhere from inside fridges and barbecues to behind fake fuse boxes and tiled panels complete with hydraulic lifts.",
      "\"I've seen entire kitchens come away from walls and off the floor as well\u2026 so all sorts of hiding places,\" he says.",
      "Classified as illicit or non-compliant vapes, the products he will be searching for today fail to meet the legal requirements for sale in the UK.",
      "More than six million of them were seized in England between 2022 and 2024, according to analysis by the BBC.",
      "The health risks posed to unwitting customers are summed up by Connor Lamb, a senior technician for licensing also taking part in the unannounced checks on shops.",
      "If you get a normal vape, he says, \"they've got a capacity which is enough for 600 puffs - the equivalent to 20 cigarettes\".",
      "But if you get an illegal one, \"it can be anything from 200 cigarettes in one vape. Obviously someone buying this to go on a night out or a kid might just be chuffing on it all day and you can imagine the drastic effect that'll have on someone's lungs.\"",
      "According to Trading Standards, illicit or non-compliant vapes can be anything with tank sizes greater than 2ml, a nicotine strength of more than 20ml or labels that do not display manufacturer details and health warnings.",
      "The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency strongly advises consumers not to use them as the true content - and any possible health risk - is unknown.",
      "On the road, Paul and Connor quickly find a stash of between 12 and 20 packs of illegal vapes at the back of a shop counter.",
      "\"It would be unusual to have so few in a shop that sells quite frequently like this, so it's just a case of where they're hiding the rest,\" says Paul.",
      "We head to a room at the back of the shop. There is a stench of urine. It is full of litter and we are deep in seemingly empty cardboard boxes.",
      "Paul's hunch is proven right though as a search among the rubbish unearths a box of illegal vapes.",
      "How widespread are illegal vapes?",
      "Of 136 local Trading Standards bodies in England, 133 responded to BBC Freedom of Information requests, showing that between 2022 and 2024:",
      "At least 6,169,822 illicit or non-compliant vaping products were seized, including those taken at ports as well as in shopsThere were 3,766 records of retailers selling vapes to children making test purchases, with some retailers potentially caught more than onceRetailers were recorded 7,594 times as selling illicit or non-compliant vapes on test purchases",
      "At least 6,169,822 illicit or non-compliant vaping products were seized, including those taken at ports as well as in shops",
      "There were 3,766 records of retailers selling vapes to children making test purchases, with some retailers potentially caught more than once",
      "Retailers were recorded 7,594 times as selling illicit or non-compliant vapes on test purchases",
      "Selling illegal vapes was a factor in at least 316 shop closures during that period, while selling to children was a factor in at least 67. Most of the closures were temporary and some retailers may have been shut down more than once.",
      "The Independent British Vape Trade Association (IBVTA) insists the majority of vape shops operate within the law, serving adults who would otherwise be smoking.",
      "A spokesperson said: \"These business owners would never knowingly involve themselves in criminal activity. Rather, it is since the resurgence of popularity of single-use vapes, and therefore a popular 'cash market', that we've seen organised crime gangs get involved in importing and distributing vapes.\"",
      "They said IBVTA had long called for greater enforcement action at borders to stem the flow of illegal products entering the country.",
      "The Department of Health and Social Care said it was allocating an extra \u00a310m this financial year for Trading Standards to tackle underage and illicit sales, with an expected 80 additional apprentice enforcement officers to be funded.",
      "Paul and Connor agree single-use vapes are among the main driving forces of the illegal trade and hope the coming ban will improve the situation.",
      "\"These are quite sophisticated networks that we're up against who are also involved in lots of quite serious activities as well as modern day slavery, trafficking, drug supply,\" says Paul.",
      "\"I think we'll see a lot less product taken off the street because we haven't really had a massive issue with reusable vapes for quite some time.",
      "\"They've always been broadly compliant in terms of the devices that are being used, the batteries, the liquids, the odd oversized tank here.\"",
      "When does the disposable vapes ban start?",
      "From 1 June, it will be illegal for businesses in the UK to sell, supply or possess single-use vapes for sale.",
      "Those caught doing so will get a \u00a3200 on-the-spot fine in the first instance, rising to an unlimited fine and/or a prison sentence of up to two years for repeat offences.",
      "The government has said Trading Standards will be able to keep the full value of the on-the-spot fines, to reinvest into enforcement.",
      "Extra enforcement powers and funding are something IBVTA says it welcomes, noting \"not all Trading Standards teams are equally or adequately resourced\" and \"some areas with low regulatory compliance are unable to carry out the enforcement they would want to\".",
      "But a national spokesperson for Trading Standards said its work was \"definitely having an impact\".",
      "Government funding had enabled \"extra boots on the ground\" at Heathrow Airport and Dover Port, the spokesperson said, which explained the high number of seizures by the local authorities home to those border points \u2013 Hillingdon and Kent.",
      "In Hillingdon alone, 2,099,248 vaping products were seized between 2022-2024, making up a third of the total.",
      "They said Salford was home to a number of vape warehouses supplying products across England, meaning \"seizing at this stage in the supply chain is really effective\".",
      "However, they said there was still a \"huge challenge in terms of retailers prepared to sell illegal products as well as those who persistently sell to children\".",
      "Back in Newcastle, Paul offers a similar assessment of the task faced nationally.",
      "He estimates the number of illegal vapes still circulating in the country is \"easily in the millions at the moment\", adding: \"It's a constant battle trying to make a difference.\"",

      "Warning: This story contains an image of surgery",
      "It's early morning outside theatre, and a team of specialist medical experts gather for a briefing to discuss the unprecedented surgery about to take place.",
      "Vanellope still has no breastbone, leaving her heart covered by just by a thin layer of skin.",
      "Surgeons have come up with a plan to use her ribs to form a protective cage inside her chest.",
      "Consultant paediatric surgeon Nitin Patwardhan was one of the 50-strong medical team at Vanellope's birth on 22 November.",
      "Now he is set to play a leading role again in surgery, which has never been performed like this before.",
      "\"I'd lie if I say I don't get nervous,\" he says. \"But having been in this profession for so many years, you actually look forward to it because at the end of the day, you're doing something that will change somebody's life.\"",
      "He remembers how \"everything was unknown\" when Vanellope was born, because no-one in the country had ever dealt with a similar case.",
      "A handful of children in the US have also survived this condition.",
      "Ectopia cordis affects only a few cases per million births - and Vanellope was given a less than 10% chance of survival.",
      "But she defied those odds and was allowed home after 14 months in hospital.",
      "Since then, Vanellope has had to wear a brace around her chest to protect her heart.",

      "Explaining the current procedure, he points to a 3D scan of Vanellope's chest, and describes how her heart has attached to the thin layer of skin protecting it.",
      "Detaching it \"is risky\", he confesses.",
      "\"You can damage the vessel trying to get into the chest cavity,\" he said.",
      "Now aged seven, surgeons decided Vanellope had reached the right age for reconstructive surgery to form a permanent structure around her heart.",
      "Vanellope is first placed on a bypass machine, which temporarily takes over the functions of the heart and lungs.",
      "This allows her heart to deflate, allowing the \"very tricky\" procedure to detach part of her heart - the right ventricular outflow tract - and the pulmonary artery from where it has stuck to her skin.",
      "Next, the bilateral rib osteotomy takes place, which involves breaking Vanellope's ribs on both sides to move them in order to form the protective cage around her heart.",
      "Carrying out all of the procedures at once, on a patient with ectopia cordis, has never been done in this country before, the team says.",

    "summary": "It follows the UK Supreme Court's ruling that a woman is defined by biological sex under equalities law.",
    "story": [
      "The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) has released interim guidance on how organisations should interpret the UK Supreme Court's ruling that a woman is defined by biological sex in law.",
      "The new guidance says that, in places like hospitals, shops and restaurants, \"trans women (biological men) should not be permitted to use the women's facilities\". It also states that trans people should not be left without any facilities to use.",
      "The EHRC said it was releasing interim guidance because \"many people have questions about the judgement and what it means for them\".",
      "Guidance on when competitive sports can be single-sex will be published in due course, the EHRC said.",
      "Last week the Supreme Court found the terms \"woman\" and \"sex\" in the 2010 Equality Act \"refer to a biological woman and biological sex\".",
      "This means, for instance, that transgender women, who are biologically male but identify as women, can be excluded from women-only spaces.",
      "As part of the judgement, Supreme Court judge Lord Hodge stressed that the law still gives protection against discrimination to transgender people.",
      "The EHRC - which enforces equalities law and provides guidance to policymakers, public sector bodies and businesses - said the impact of the ruling was that \"if somebody identifies as trans, they do not change sex for the purposes of the [Equality] Act, even if they have a Gender Recognition Certificate (GRC)\".",
      "In this respect, the EHRC says, \"a trans woman is a biological man\" and \"a trans man is a biological woman\".",
      "The guidance also states that \"in some circumstances the law also allows trans women (biological men) not to be permitted to use the men's facilities, and trans men (biological women) not to be permitted to use the women's facilities\".",
      "When asked to clarify this, the EHRC pointed to a section of the Supreme Court ruling stating that trans men could be excluded from women's facilities \"where reasonable objection is taken to their presence, for example because the gender reassignment process has given them a masculine appearance or attributes to which reasonable objection might be taken\" in the context of a women-only service.",
      "The EHRC guidance adds: \"However where facilities are available to both men and women, trans people should not be put in a position where there are no facilities for them to use.\"",
      "Akua Reindorf KC, a barrister and a Commissioner at the EHRC, told BBC Radio 4's PM programme that situations where trans men could be excluded from women's facilities would be decided on a \"case-by-case\" basis.",
      "She said there \"should never be a situation where a trans person is left without a toilet to use\".",
      "But, citing the example of a rape crisis counselling session, she said a trans man could be \"excluded properly and lawfully from that because of the alarm that it may cause to vulnerable women to share that space with somebody who to all intents and purposes appears to be a man\".",
      "Where possible, mixed-sex toilets, washing or changing facilities should be provided in addition to sufficient single-sex facilities, according to the guidance.",
      "Alternatively, the guidance says it is possible to have toilet, washing or changing facilities which can be used by all, provided they are \"in lockable rooms (not cubicles)\" and intended to be used by one person at a time. One such example might be a single toilet in a small business such as a caf\u00e9.",
      "In schools, it says: \"Pupils who identify as trans girls (biological boys) should not be permitted to use the girls' toilet or changing facilities, and pupils who identify as trans boys (biological girls) should not be permitted to use the boys' toilet or changing facilities. Suitable alternative provisions may be required.\"",
      "In associations - groups or clubs with more than 25 members - the EHRC says \"a women-only or lesbian-only association should not admit trans women (biological men), and a men-only or gay men-only association should not admit trans men (biological women)\".",
      "The EHRC says the interim guidance, published online on Friday evening, is intended to highlight the main consequences of the Supreme Court judgement.",
      "\"Employers and other duty-bearers must follow the law and should take appropriate specialist legal advice where necessary,\" it adds.",
      "A two-week consultation to seek views from \"affected stakeholders\" is expected to be launched in May.",
      "The EHRC aims to provide an updated code of practice to the government for ministerial approval by the end of June.",
      "A government spokesperson said: \"We welcome the ruling and the clarity it brings for women, and service providers.",
      "\"We will review and update policy wherever necessary to ensure it complies with the latest legal requirements.\"",

      "Forget the huge thwack of decisive national victory. Brace for what one former minister described as slivers of votes between five political parties, determining who wins and loses power over town halls in England, and one perch in the Commons.",
      "The results will set the political pace for the next few months. And from Friday, Reform could give the two big traditional tribes a problem, and also acquire a potential problem they haven't encountered thus far - a track record to defend.",
      "The largest parties are both likely to have a horrible time of it. Labour's wide coalition of voters went pop almost as soon as they moved into No 10.",
      "Calm heads in government say it was always going to be thus because of the state of the country when they took over. Sir Keir Starmer even told us on the record he was going to \"have to be unpopular\" \u2013 a curious ambition for a politician!",
      "But more candid insiders admit the government \"looked very unsure\" at the start. \"They didn't come in with a big project,\" one source says, and many voters took a dim view of ministers' freebies and the decision on winter fuel allowance.",

      "A poor performance in areas that are traditionally Tory, where the party prospered in 2021, won't be a surprise. One cabinet minister says, \"they're just not our heartlands, so we just haven't got our normal base\".",
      "But Labour could also lose mayors and there's no such excuse in what was one of their safest seats, in Runcorn, in the by-election where they could struggle to cling on.",
      "After 10 months in power, next week could show Labour how much the reality of government can really hurt.",
      "The Conservatives have also been falling over themselves to tell you just saying how awful it's going to be for them after they were, in the words of one senior figure, \"absolutely, mercilessly hammered\" back in July.",
      "The leadership says \"nowhere is safe\".  Some sources even warn in private they could lose all of the town halls they control.",
      "The concern behind the very public worry about losing hundreds and hundreds of seats is that \"we might not yet actually have hit the bottom\", in the words of another veteran.",
      "Leader Kemi Badenoch's backers continually say that rebuilding the party is a long-term project, and praise her for managing to draw at least a faint line under the toxic infighting that corroded Conservative ranks in recent years.",
      "The broad sense in Westminster is that dreadful results next week won't usher Badenoch to the door. Still, you'd be hard pressed to find a Conservative who'd happily bet their mortgage she'll definitely be in charge by the time of the next election.",
      "That's in large part because in the words of one Tory bigwig, \"she was working on the basis that it was her versus Starmer but it's not her versus Starmer,  it's her versus Starmer and Farage and Davey\".",
      "This election is pick and mix, with the newest morsels on offer coming from Nigel Farage's Reform UK. They see success in these elections as \"two or three more steps up the staircase\" towards power, says a senior figure.",
      "The other parties report Reform spending big, particularly on online advertising, focusing on national issues like immigration and net zero, and \"putting Farage out to draw a crowd\", according to a minister.",
      "Reform sources scent success. They hope they can nab Runcorn from Labour (although they aren't banking on it), but are more confident of winning mayoral races and of taking plenty of council seats.",

      "Sign up for the Off Air with Laura K newsletter to get Laura Kuenssberg's expert insight and insider stories every week, emailed directly to you.",
      "Reform might be the loudest group, but they're not the only one making life hard for the big boys.

      "And party sources suggest their activists are more motivated, and their numbers even increasing, because of US President Donald Trump.",
      "Lastly, but not least, the Greens want to continue their steady march into council seats across England.",
      "In 2023 they had their best showing in 20 years and took majority control of a council for the first time, adding many more councillors to their number last year.",
      "This time round they want to add to the tally in counties like Shropshire, Gloucestershire and Kent, where they already have bums on seats.",
      "The Green MPs have made less noise than their other newbie rivals at the other end of the spectrum, Reform. So at a time when enthusiasm for the climate agenda has been fading, or at least evolving in both the big main parties, next week the Green Party will want to show it is a growing force.",
      "Any election is also a test of our political parties' campaign machines \u2013 the questions different for each this time round.",
      "For Labour, is it firing on all cylinders after its July triumph? Frankly, it doesn't seem to be running a campaign at full throttle this time, which given the geography of the contests, shouldn't surprise.",

Some loyalists are heartened there are still members willing to knock on doors. But a rival campaigner now calls them the \"tumbleweed Tories\", claiming they're nowhere to be seen on the ground.",
      "Both the Lib Dems and the Greens have long been playing effective local ground games, concentrating on building power bases in pockets of the country.",
      "The most acute test perhaps then is for Reform, who have proven time and time again they can make a lot of noise nationally, on air, and increasingly, online.",
      "In five-party politics, many races may be won with a relatively small share of the vote, by tiny margins, that \"sliver here and sliver there\".",
      "These elections are likely to result in real-life evidence of a political idea that's all the rage, that there's \"fragmentation\" among the public, the traditional voting blocs are no more. Excitable columns are already being penned in anticipation, proclaiming that two-party politics is dead.",
      "The splitting of the vote among so many groups also seems likely to leave more councils without any a clear majority.",
      "In that case, they go into what's known as \"no overall control\", so the biggest party needs votes from the others to get their way.",
      "It's likely that will pose the Conservatives with a tricky real-life question after many weeks of troublesome hypothetical arguments: will they, or won't they, work with their arch rivals Reform UK on the ground?",
      "Crucially, if Reform makes its expected big advances, it will for the first time have responsibility for decisions that affect people's lives.  That will be a big achievement.",
      "Both senior Labour and Conservative sources agree privately, as one said, \"the biggest thing to come out of Thursday night is that Reform will have a record to defend\".",
      "Next week the smaller parties are on track to have plenty to celebrate.  If the General Election was branded the \"ABC election \u2013 Anyone But the Conservatives\", maybe next week's ballots will be branded the \"ABB election \u2013 Anyone But the Big parties\".",

      "The UK's trade relationship with the EU is arguably \"more important\" than the one it has with the US, the chancellor has told the BBC.",
      "Rachel Reeves suggested that moving closer to the EU on trade was a bigger priority, despite her current focus on talks with the US.",
      "After her meeting with US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Friday, Reeves tweeted that both the UK and US want a deal that is \"in both our national interests\".",
      "Earlier this week, she signalled the UK could lower tariffs on US car imports from their current 10% to 2.5% as part of a wider deal.",
      "The UK is preparing for a summit with the EU in May in an attempt to \"reset\" the relationship between the two.",
      "\"I understand why there's so much focus on our trading relationship with the US but actually our trading relationship with Europe is arguably even more important, because they're our nearest neighbours and trading partners,\" she told the BBC.",
      "\"Obviously I've been meeting Scott Bessent this week whilst I'm in Washington, but I've also this week met the French, the German, the Spanish, the Polish, the Swedish, the Finnish finance ministers - because it is so important that we rebuild those trading relationships with our nearest neighbours in Europe, and we're going to do that in a way that is good for British jobs and British consumers.\"",
      "A Downing Street spokesman said the chancellor's remarks had been \"a statement of fact that the EU is our largest trading partner\".",

      "She has said she wants to see \"free and fair\" trade, and wants to deepen the relationship between the US and UK in areas such as technology.",
      "Conservative shadow business secretary Andrew Griffith told Sky News that his party would \"absolutely be seeking to prioritise\" a deal with the US over the EU.",
      "Griffith argued that the UK already had a tariff-free deal on goods with the EU, therefore the \"next best choice if you want to grow the economy after the chancellor's crashed it would be to get a deal with the US\".",
      "Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson Daisy Cooper MP said: \"The chancellor is absolutely right that our trading relationship with Europe is more important, but the government's approach so far shows these are little more than empty words.",
      "\"This government has bent over backwards to appease Donald Trump but barely lifted a finger to unleash growth by boosting trade with Europe.\"",
      "'We're all grappling with tariffs'",
      "Regarding the situation with the US, Reeves said she \"understands what President [Donald] Trump wants to address\" with his tariffs, ahead of talks with her US counterpart in Washington.",
      "Reeves said there were similarities with the way both the US and UK governments had come to power off the back of voter frustration with the economy.",
      "\"We're all grappling with this issue of tariffs but I think that there is an understanding why President Trump wants to address some of the global imbalances there are in the system,\" she said.",
      "Trump has already imposed tariffs of 25% on all car imports to the US including from the UK.",
      "The UK also faces a broader tariff rate of 10% and is looking to negotiate an agreement with the US administration, along with dozens of other countries hit with even higher levies \u2013 most of which are currently on pause until July.",
      "Some US officials have been positive about the prospects of a deal. Last week US Vice-President JD Vance said there was a \"good chance\" a trade deal could be reached with the UK.",

      "The next step will be to halve the number of apprentices over the next year as their contracts finish, ending up with six by the end of this year.",
      "If the business cannot recover over the next four years, the rest of her 28 staff, who are nearly all local women who became stylists after serving an apprenticeship at the salon, are facing potential redundancy.",
      "\"I'm having to drastically reduce my overall employee numbers to cut costs just to survive,\" she said.",
      "\"Where are the future hairdressers going to come from if good, employed salons go out of business?\"",
      "Kerry added the way the chancellor is treating salons, which overwhelmingly employ women, \"totally goes against the objectives of the government\" in growing the economy and supporting workers.",
      "Part of the pressure is coming from the UK's Value Added Tax (VAT) rules, which do not allow businesses to reclaim tax on staff costs in the same way they can for goods, putting labour-intensive businesses such as hair or beauty salons at a disadvantage.",
      "\"If you look at a cafe, one waiter can serve several tables of four customers in the space of an hour and the cafe can reclaim the VAT on all the food and drink they serve,\" Kerry explained.",
      "\"Whereas one salon customer needs attention from the receptionist, the apprentice for hair-washing, and the stylist in that same hour and we can only claim VAT back on a tube of hair colour.\"",
      "Many hairdressers went into debt due to the pandemic, said Kerry, and the added pressures of increases in employer National Insurance contributions (Nics) and business rates are now threatening the future of salons across the country.",
      "For Kerry's salon, the Vanilla Rooms, the tax increases have added a \"devastating\" \u00a323,000 extra to her annual costs, through a combination of the threshold at which employers start to pay Nics on staff wages being lowered to \u00a35,000 and changes to business rates.",
      "Her Nics costs have risen 29%, from about \u00a342,000 to about \u00a354,500 - now costing more than \u00a31,000 a week  - and business rates have gone up by 144%, from about \u00a37,000 to about \u00a318,000 a year.",
      "Kerry is one of 50,000 UK hairdressing professionals represented by the British Hair Consortium (BHC), which has urged Rachel Reeves to take action or face the \"collapse\" of the industry due to rising costs.",
      "The BHC argues the most efficient support the government could offer is through halving VAT for salons, because staff wages make up 60% of their costs.",
      "The association says cutting VAT could actually increase overall tax take, by preventing more workers going self-employed or entering the black market.",
      "Kerry's case was one of those raised by Conservative MP Julia Lopez in a debate this week in Parliament's Westminster Hall, where she urged Rachel Reeves to lower VAT from 20% to 10% to support the hair and beauty sector.",
      "Lopez,  the MP for Hornchurch and Upminster, said Kerry was not alone in being forced to consider whether she will have to shut up shop completely.",
      "\"Some of the increased bills for salons are just unbelievable,\" she said, adding that women were disproportionately impacted by the changes.",
      "\"It's hard to ignore the impact, let alone the irony, of a chancellor celebrating herself for being the first woman to hold that office while simultaneously hammering the sectors that employ, serve and are often led, by women.\"",
      "Liberal Democrat business spokesperson Sarah Gibson agreed that Reeves' Budget had implemented \"an unfair tax on jobs\" and the government must offer tax relief for small businesses in June.",
      "Gibson said an increasing number of salons are opting to rent chairs out to self-employed staff, instead of employing stylists directly, to avoid paying tax.",
      "\"If salons don't get support we will see a huge increase in people becoming chair renters,\" she said, which reduces the Treasury's overall tax take.",
      "Responding for the Labour government, Small Business Minister Gareth Thomas defended the chancellor's decisions in her October Budget as \"important for long term stability\".",
      "Salons are \"a vital pillar of our high streets\", he said, adding \"many hair and beauty businesses will benefit from some of the other measures the chancellor introduced\".",
      "\"We increased the employment allowance so that almost one million employers pay no national insurance contributions at all.",
      "More than half of employers will see no change or gain from that package, and that includes many hair and beauty businesses,\" he told MPs.",
      "Update 26 April 2025: This article was amended to correct the cost of Kerry's business rates, which she said increased from about \u00a37,000, not from \u00a3700 as we originally stated.",

      "\"It's unenforceable and, particularly, I've been very concerned about the way it's been enforced in the past, with women - particularly vulnerable women - targeted for enforcement action, and the BBC itself has accepted that.\"",
      "Two BBC reviews found the gender disparity had been due to societal factors.",

      "Last month in a Sunday Times interview, the corporation's chairman suggested wealthier households could be charged more.",

      "The Labour government is aiming to forge closer economic ties to the EU after Brexit. Both sides have also expressed a renewed interest in a defence and security pact amid the war in Ukraine.",
      "A defence deal would potentially unlock full UK access to a \u20ac150bn (\u00a3128bn) EU-backed loans scheme, with British firms otherwise limited to providing up to 35% of the value of projects funded under the programme.",
      "Speaking at UK Trade and Business Commission meeting on Thursday, Germany's ambassador to the UK Miguel Berger said he wanted to see progress on a youth visa deal as part of a \"package approach\" to the talks, where different topics are linked together.",
      "He added that EU citizens had faced \"many obstacles\" to moving to the UK since Brexit, including \"very high thresholds\" for skilled work visas.",
      "Existing schemes",
      "The UK currently offers visas allowing young people from 12 non-EU countries including Japan, South Korea and Uruguay to study or work in the UK for up to two years. Those from Australia, Canada or New Zealand can extend by a further year.",
      "These visas are subject to annual quotas, ranging from 100 visas for Andorra to 42,000 for Australia, with ballots held where they are oversubscribed.",
      "Applicants from these countries need at least \u00a32,530 in savings, cannot apply for most benefits, and have to pay an annual NHS surcharge of \u00a3776 for students and \u00a31,035 for workers.",
      "The European Commission first suggested an EU-wide youth deal in April last year, claiming Rishi Sunak's government had approached European capitals to discuss individual visa deals, risking \"differential treatment\" of EU citizens.",
      "Under its original proposal, people aged between 18 and 30 would be able to apply for visas lasting up to four years to work, study, train or volunteer, with no overall cap on the number of visas issued.",
      "It also said EU applicants should not have to pay the NHS surcharge, and should be able to pay the same university tuition fees as British students, rather than the higher fees they have had to pay since Brexit.",
      "'Youth experience'",
      "There have been suggestions that the Home Office, tasked with delivering government plans to lower overall migration, is pushing for any eventual agreement to be more limited than that suggested by the European Commission.",
      "Home Secretary Yvette Cooper is reportedly arguing for visas to be limited to one year so that EU citizens taking part do not show up in official immigration figures, with applications also subject to an overall cap.",
      "Asked about the reports, Mr Berger declined to comment, saying that \"we have to leave that to the negotiations\".",
      "The EU has been keen to stress that a visa deal would not replicate the bloc's rules on freedom of movement, under which EU citizens were automatically entitled to live and work in the UK without applying for a visa.",
      "Documents circulated between EU states also suggest a deal could be rebranded as a \"youth experience\" scheme, in an apparent bid to downplay any link to migration.",
      "But any deal that is negotiated is likely to lead to a political row, with the Conservatives and Reform UK critical of a proposed agreement.",
      "During a local election campaign visit earlier, Tory leader Kemi Badenoch said a deal risked \"another avenue which people might use to game the system,\" adding that Labour \"doesn't know how to negotiate\".",
      "She added: \"Where are all these people they want to bring in going to work?\"",
      "Reform leader Nigel Farage said a deal could lead to a \"huge number of people\" coming to the UK, adding it would be \"completely against what the Brexit vote demanded\".",
      "An agreement has however been strongly supported by the Liberal Democrats and the Greens, which have long been calling on the Labour government to reach an agreement with the EU.",
      "In his comments on Thursday, Mr Berger insisted a deal would have \"nothing to do with migration\" as those taking part in the scheme would \"go home\" once their visa has ended."

    "summary": "Supported housing for vulnerable or disabled people is in crisis, a letter to the prime minister says.",
    "story": [
      "Supported housing, which helps vulnerable or disabled people live independently, is in crisis, an open letter signed by more than 170 organisations in the sector claims.",
      "Services at one in three providers in England had to shut last year, adding to a total shortfall of about 325,000 places, says the letter, which will be delivered to Prime Minister Keir Starmer today. Signatories to it include Refuge, Age UK and the National Housing Federation (NHF).",
      "Blaming cuts to council funding and rising costs, the NHF says a further one in three providers fear they may close unless the government pledges more money.",
      "The government says supported housing is vital and it is focused on building more homes.",
      "About half a million people in the UK currently live in supported housing, including young care leavers, army veterans, people with learning disabilities and those escaping homelessness or domestic abuse.",
      "\"Supported housing plays an indispensable role in cutting NHS waiting list backlogs, and reducing pressure on social care, temporary accommodation, and other vital public services,\" the open letter says.",
      "However, it says the future of supported housing is now at risk following \"years of funding cuts\" and that local authorities have now been forced to \"decommission vital services\".",
      "\"Rising costs alongside reduced funding have rendered many services unviable, forcing many to close, while demand for supported housing continues to rise. The decision to increase employers' National Insurance contributions has placed even further pressure on providers' budgets.\"",
      "The organisations are calling for long-term increased funding for housing-related support of at least \u00a31.6bn per year for councils and for supported homes to be among the 1.5 million new houses planned by the government.",
      "\"We recognise the vital role played by supported housing in helping vulnerable people to live independently and well, and the contribution it makes to tackling rough sleeping and timely hospital discharge,\" a spokesperson for the Department for Housing, Communities and Local Government said.",
      "The spokesperson said the government was putting \u00a32bn into increasing social and affordable housebuilding in 2026-27, with further details to be set out in a long-term housing strategy later this year.",
      "Proponents of austerity measures say tough funding choices need to be made to balance the UK's finances.",
      "However, Shaoxiong Liu says his family do not know what they would have done without a supported housing place for his son Jason.",
      "Aged 39, Jason has autism, a learning disability and mental health challenges. As he grew older, this became increasingly unmanageable for his family. After falling ill, Jason was admitted to hospital with sepsis in 2017.",
      "Due to his challenging behaviour and a condition that induces severe vomiting, he remained in hospital for months as they struggled to find somewhere long term that could accommodate his needs.",
      "He was eventually placed with Advance Housing, where his family says Jason has flourished in the intervening eight years. His weight has risen from 35kg to 53kg, he can go on bus trips and attends social events organised by the housing provider.",
      "\"Jason's behaviour is so much better now. He's lived there so long and he's happy there,\" Mr Liu says. \"Jason is an adult now and we are in our 70s, so his behaviour could be quite dangerous for us if he lived with us - we couldn't look after him.\"",
      "The NHF says one in three providers in England it surveyed say they may have to stop providing services altogether, meaning the loss of 70,000 supported homes across the country.",
      "In 2009, ringfenced council funding for housing-related support was removed. When council budgets were cut during austerity from 2010, funding was needed in other areas, meaning some councils had to cut supported housing services.",
      "The NHF says that means there are now fewer supported homes than in 2007, including a net loss of 3,000 supported homes in the last three years. It calculates there is a total shortfall of up to 325,000 supported homes, based on unmet need.",

    "summary": "Ed Miliband says \"zonal pricing\" or reformed national pricing are the only available options to overhaul the energy market.",
    "story": [
      "Energy secretary Ed Miliband is \"considering\" plans to introduce regional pricing for power that could lead to lower bills in parts of the country that generate more energy.",
      "He did not set out details of the \"zonal pricing\" scheme, which is meant to make the national energy grid more efficient and encourage investment.",
      "But he rejected claims in a Daily Telegraph article that it would mean increased energy bills for southern English households.",
      "Some energy companies have backed the idea - but others say it will scare off investment and lead to higher bills.",
      "If the UK has more renewable energy, why aren't bills coming down?",
      "Could Scotland have Europe's lowest electricity bills?",
      "GB Energy to be blocked from using slavery-linked solar",
      "According to the Telegraph government officials have advised Miliband to back plans for a form of regional pricing used in some other parts of the world including Australia, Italy and Sweden.",
      "If implemented, it would be the biggest reform of the power market since the 1990s privatisation.",
      "Under the scheme, power costs would match local supply and demand. In practice it could lead to lower bills in areas with abundant wind generation like Scotland rather than households in the South.",
      "The scheme is supported by some energy businesses - including Greg Jackson, the boss of Octopus Energy, the UK's largest domestic energy supplier.",
      "Mr Jackson said it could make the overall system more efficient and reduce the amount of network upgrades needed to shift the electricity from where it's generated to where it's consumed.",
      "But Dale Vince, the founder of green energy company Ecotricity and a Labour donor, said on BBC Radio 4's Today Programme that zonal pricing was a \"terrible idea\" as \"tens of millions of Britons could end up paying more for their energy than they do now\".",
      "Speaking ahead of an international energy security summit in London, Miliband said the government were considering options to change energy pricing but insisted \"absolutely no decision has been made\".",
      "\"This is an incredibly complex question that we are looking at about how we reform our energy market,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.",
      "\"There are two options, zonal pricing and reformed national pricing.",
      "\"Whatever route we go down my bottom line is bills have got to fall, and they should fall throughout the country.",
      "\"We are going to take our time over this very complex and important decision.\"",
      "Can I fix my energy prices?",
      "The Liberal Democrats warned against regional pricing saying the \"government has got to ensure that reforms to electricity pricing ultimately bring down customers' bills and create a fairer system - across the board.\"",
      "The party's energy and net zero spokesperson, Pippa Heylings, said: \"In a cost-of-living crisis and when energy giants have been raking it in - energy bills should be going down not up.\"",
      "Reform UK leader Nigel Farage called the plans \"a form of bribery\", saying cheaper bills would be a payoff for massive infrastructure projects \"ruining\" the local area.",
      "\"None of this I think has been fully thought through,\" he argued.",
      "\"I think Ed Miliband has a religious fervour for achieving that zero, regardless of the consequences.\"",
      "The Green Party of England and Wales have also called on the government to reject regional pricing.",
      "Party co-leader Adrian Ramsay told the BBC: \"People live in poverty all over the country - penalising families struggling to pay their bills because of where they happen to live would be wrong.\"",
      "The Conservatives have also been approached for comment."

      "The idea has cross-party support, with some Labour and Tory MPs previously suggesting similar measures.",
      "However, without government support the Lib Dem proposals are unlikely to become law.",
      "Why do people play music in public through a phone?",
      "Loud music could be banned on buses in West Midlands",
      "A survey of more than 2,000 UK adults for the Lib Dems, conducted by Savanta, found 38% had experienced people playing music out loud often or sometimes.",
      "Some 54% of people would not feel comfortable asking someone to turn down their music on public transport, the findings suggest.",
      "The figure was higher for women (63%) then men (46%).",

      "It said this should be accompanied by a national publicity campaign, including posters on train platforms and at bus stops.",
      "Currently passengers who breach bylaws can be removed from trains or stations, with a maximum fine of \u00a31,000.",
      "Existing regulations also allow passengers to be removed from buses if they play sounds which are likely to annoy others.",
      "Liberal Democrat Home Affairs spokeswoman Lisa Smart said: \"Far too many people dread their daily commute because of the blight of anti-social behaviour - and headphone dodgers playing loud music on buses and trains are some of the worst offenders.",
      "\"Whether you're heading to work, taking your kids to school, or simply trying to enjoy a moment of peace, everyone deserves to feel safe and respected on public transport.\"",
      "She added: \"It's time to take a stand for the quiet majority who just want to get from A to B in peace.\"",
      "Conservative shadow transport secretary Gareth Bacon said: \"Playing loud music on public transport may seem like a small thing, but it speaks towards a growing tolerance of anti-social behaviour that chips away at public civility.\"",
      "He added that the Conservative Party supports \"common-sense reforms like this\" but \"any new byelaws must be backed by stepping up enforcement - something the Liberal Democrats' plan fails to deliver\".",

    "title": "If the UK has more renewable energy, why aren't bills coming down?",
    "link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crkep1vx3mro",
    "published": "Thu, 24 Apr 2025 09:15:15 GMT",
    "summary": "The government has pledged to reduce energy bills by using more renewables, but bills are currently rising.",
    "story": [
      "Energy bills rose by 6% for a typical family in April, following an announcement from the regulator Ofgem.",
      "But Labour pledged in its manifesto: \"We will save families hundreds of pounds on their bills, not just in the short term, but for good.\" It also promised bills would come down by \"up to \u00a3300 by 2030\".",
      "Responding to the 6% price cap rise, Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said it was due to \"our reliance on the fossil fuel markets\" and added: \"We're acting to bring down bills for everyone with our mission for clean, home-grown power that we control.\"",
      "The government wants to remove nearly all fossil fuels from UK electricity production by 2030.",
      "More power is coming from renewable sources than ever before, so why isn't this translating into cheaper electricity bills?",
      "There are a number of reasons, including the time and money it takes to make the power system greener, the question of who pays, and the way the electricity market is set up.",
      "People should consider energy bill fix, regulator says",
      "Is Labour's 2030 green energy goal realistic and how would it affect bills?",
      "How do UK prices compare with other countries?",
      "The UK's electricity is expensive.",
      "Compared with countries in the European Union, UK domestic electricity prices ranked fourth highest in the first half of 2024 - the most recent government data.",
      "This is for consumers with medium usage, including taxes and subsidies.",
      "For industrial electricity, the UK had the highest prices - for medium users - over the same period.",
      "The UK has much higher electricity prices - both domestic and industrial - than other large economies outside Europe, such as the US and Canada.",
      "The largest, and most variable, component of a UK customer's electricity bill is the \"wholesale\" price. This is the cost at which suppliers buy it from the companies that generate it.",
      "Other parts of the bill include \"network\" costs for operating, maintaining and upgrading the power grid, and \"policy\" costs, which include government levies to help fund environmental projects.",
      "The main reason for the spikes in electricity bills over the past few years has been changes to wholesale costs. This is linked to an increase in international gas prices.",
      "How is the price set?",
      "The price for wholesale electricity is set by a bidding process, with each generating company saying what it would be willing to accept to produce a unit of electricity.",
      "Once built, the cost of generating power from renewables is very low, so these typically come in with the cheapest bid. Nuclear might come next.",
      "Gas generators often have the highest costs, because they have to buy gas to burn, as well as paying a \"carbon price\" - a charge for emissions.",
      "The wholesale cost is set by the last unit of electricity needed to meet demand from consumers. This means that even if gas only generates 1% of power at a given time, gas will still set the wholesale price.",
      "In Great Britain, this generally happens more often than its European counterparts, where demand can be met more often without relying on gas.",
      "\"The main reason why electricity prices are currently high is because the cost of gas - which is what sets the electricity price - is also high,\" said a spokesperson from the Climate Change Committee, the government's independent adviser on cutting emissions.",
      "How cheap is renewable energy?",
      "Renewables can generate electricity cheaply.",
      "But building a wind farm on land - and particularly out at sea - comes with high up-front costs and the planning process is often lengthy.",
      "The government needs to triple wind and solar capacity. To get developers to deliver this, it needs to provide certainty that they will get a return on their investment.",
      "It does that by agreeing a fixed price - or strike price - that they will be paid for each unit of electricity generated for 15 years into the future.",
      "If the wholesale price is below this fixed price, the renewable generator gets paid a top up by a government-owned company. If the wholesale price is above the strike price, the generator pays the difference back.",
      "Any costs or savings are then passed onto consumers via bills.",
      "Strike prices were expensive, but have fallen considerably, apart from a small rise from 2022-24 linked to global supply chain pressures.",
      "As more renewables are connected - and operational improvements mean the grid can be safely run on this type of power - there should be more times when gas is not setting the wholesale price.",
      "\"There are in practice very few hours at the moment in which gas does not set the price despite being a minority of the overall generation,\" said Adam Berman, director of policy at Energy UK, the trade association for the energy industry.",
      "\"The more that you are able to have a renewable infrastructure that can deliver electricity at any hour of the day and in any circumstance, the more you are able to move away from gas setting the price.\"",
      "What about extra costs?",
      "The UK has an ageing electricity grid, which needs upgrading, partly to accommodate new renewable power sources. There are times when wind power is actually paid not to generate, because the grid cannot handle all the electricity that it could produce.",
      "This adds to the network costs in a bill.",
      "Intermittent renewable sources also require backup for when it's not windy or sunny. In the short term, this role will be largely filled by gas, but eventually it could be met by storing renewable energy in batteries or by hydrogen power.",
      "Great Britain's island location means it is more expensive than in continental Europe to build interconnectors - cables to connect electricity systems of neighbouring countries - to help meet periods of low output.",
      "Some analysts have also argued that placing extra social and environmental taxes on electricity bills - rather than gas bills or general taxation - makes electricity artificially expensive.",
      "What is being done?",
      "The government is reviewing the structure of the electricity market, alongside its push for clean power through renewables and nuclear.",
      "In the long term, renewables \"will be bringing down overall energy bills, and specifically electricity bills, for the UK,\" argues Dr Iain Staffell of Imperial College London.",
      "But savings in the short term are not guaranteed. A faster rollout of renewables could mean upfront costs - for things like upgrading the grid - being passed onto consumers more quickly.",
      "Some analysts have also expressed concern that a rush to secure enough renewables to meet the 2030 goal could mean less competitive \"strike prices\", locking in higher costs.",
      "\"If you think 10-15 years down the line, you are likely to see the cost for technologies like offshore wind decrease further\u2026 but potentially the rush to have to do this in the next couple of years means that you have to lock in a lot of these projects now to make sure that it can deliver [for 2030],\" said Pranav Menon, research associate at the Aurora Energy Research think tank.",
      "\"That does mean that you are going to push up against stretched supply chains, which could mean that cost to procure that [extra capacity] increases.\"",
      "But a rapid roll-out of renewables would also reduce the UK's dependence on gas - the main cause of the price spike of the past few years - and so there could be benefits sooner if gas prices remain high.",
      "The government said earlier in February that its plans would \"bring down bills for households and businesses for good\" and lowering them by \"up to \u00a3300 by 2030\" remains an objective.",

      "The area of the UK burnt by wildfires so far this year is already higher than the total for any year in more than a decade, satellite data suggests.",
      "More than 29,200 hectares (292 sq km or 113 sq miles) has been burnt so far, according to figures from the Global Wildfire Information System, which has recorded burnt area since 2012.",
      "That is more than the previous high of 28,100 hectares for the whole year of 2019.",
      "The prolonged dry, sunny weather in March and early April helped to create ideal conditions for widespread burning, according to researchers.",
      "Wildfires are very common in the UK in early spring, with plenty of dead or dormant vegetation at the end of winter that can dry out quickly.",
      "The switch back to wetter conditions over the past couple of weeks has largely brought an end to the spell of fires for now, but not before reaching record levels.",
      "The figures from the Global Wildfire Information System only capture fires larger than roughly 30 hectares (0.3 sq km).",
      "More than 80 such fires have been detected across the UK since the beginning of the year.",
      "Most fires are deliberately or accidentally started by humans, but favourable weather conditions can make it much easier for fires to ignite and spread quickly.",
      "\"We had an exceptionally dry and sunny March,\" said Will Lang, head of risk and resilience services at the Met Office.",
      "\"This followed quite a wet autumn and winter, which can have the effect of increasing the vegetation that acts as fuel for any fire that does start.\"",
      "A lack of rainfall in March and April can be particularly conducive to fires.",
      "\"The vegetation is coming out of the winter and it has gone dormant, so it's not growing, and therefore it's very dry and doesn't have water,\" explained Guillermo Rein, professor of fire science at Imperial College London.",
      "\"Then in the spring, before you start to collect the water into the live tissue, there is a period where it's very flammable.\"",
      "The seven days from 2 to 8 April saw more than 18,000 hectares (180 sq km) burnt, the highest weekly figure on record.",
      "The BBC has also analysed satellite images to illustrate two of the biggest burns this year.",
      "In Galloway Forest Park, in south-west Scotland, an estimated 65 sq km burnt, nearly a quarter of the UK total.",
      "A fire in the Cwm Rheidol area of Wales, about 25 km (16 miles) from Aberystwyth, also burnt a large area of roughly 50 sq km.",
      "Fires have also been detected by satellite imagery on the Isle of Arran, the Isle of Bute and the Isle of Skye in Scotland, as well as in the Mourne Mountains in south-east Northern Ireland. All occurred in early April.",
      "These early season burns - predominantly grass, heath and shrub fires - have created great strain on fire services, but their ecological impacts can be complicated.",
      "Not all fires, particularly smaller, lower-intensity burns, are necessarily catastrophic to long-term vegetation health.",
      "Certain plants, such as heather, are adapted to fire-prone environments. But increasingly frequent or severe blazes can impair their ability to naturally recover.",
      "Some researchers are concerned about the second peak of the fire season, which typically comes later in the year when temperatures are high and vegetation has dried out again.",
      "\"My number one worry is what is going to happen in the summer,\" said Prof Rein, when \"there are fewer wildfires but they are bigger and they can actually be seriously catastrophic\".",
      "\"You can have 100 [small] wildfires across the whole country and all of them can be handled in one day, or you could have one summer wildfire that actually cannot be stopped in a week and actually goes on to burn houses.\"",
      "The recent widespread burns don't necessarily mean this summer will be a busy fire season.",
      "But scientists expect the UK to see an increase in weather conditions conducive to extreme wildfires in a warming world, even though there's lots of variation from year to year.",
      "A study led by the Met Office found that the extreme \"fire weather\" that helped spread the destructive blazes of July 2022 were made at least six times more likely by human-caused climate change.",
      "Shifts in the way land is used can also play a key role in shaping fire risk.",
      "\"One thing that seems to have consensus is that we are likely to see more fires and possibly worse fires with climate change,\" said Rory Hadden, senior lecturer in fire investigation at the University of Edinburgh.",

      "Donald Trump has signed a controversial executive order aimed at stepping up deep-sea mining within US and in international waters.",

      "Thursday's order is the latest issued by the US president to try to increase America's access to minerals used by the aerospace, green technology and healthcare sectors.",

      "Deep-sea mining tech advances but doubts remain",
      "The latest US executive order was issued to \"establish the United States as a global leader in responsible seabed mineral exploration\", it reads.",
      "The move appears to bypass a long-running round of UN negotiations on mining in international waters.",
      "Many countries, including China, have delayed issuing permits until countries agreed a framework for how resources could be shared.",
      "\"The US authorisation... violates international law and harms the overall interests of the international community,\" Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun said on Friday.",
      "China dominates global production of rare earths and critical metals like cobalt and lithium.",
      "Trump has been frustrated by this relative weakness of the US position, analysts say.",
      "\"We want the US to get ahead of China in this resource space under the ocean, on the ocean bottom,\" a US official said on Thursday.",
      "To achieve this, the order says the US will speed up the process of issuing exploration licences and recovery permits both in its own waters and in \"areas beyond national jurisdiction\".",
      "The administration estimates that deep-sea mining could boost the country's GDP by $300bn (\u00a3225bn) over 10 years and create 100,000 jobs",
      "The EU, the UK and others support a moratorium on the practice until further scientific research is carried out.",
      "Environmentalists and scientists are concerned that marine species living in the deep sea could be harmed by the process.",
      "\"Deep-sea mining is a deeply dangerous endeavour for our ocean,\" said Jeff Watters of Ocean Conservancy, a US-based environmental group.",

      "It is not clear how quickly deep-sea mining could begin but one mining company, The Metals Company (TMC), is already in discussions with the US government to obtain permits.",
      "TMC's CEO Gerard Barron has previously said he hopes to begin mining by the end of the year.",

    "published": "Thu, 24 Apr 2025 23:06:26 GMT",
    "summary": "Climate activists may be going deeper underground.",
    "story": [
      "Listen to Justin read this article",
      "Just Stop Oil (JSO) activists are dusting down their placards, digging out their infamous fluorescent orange vests, and charging up their loud hailers \u2014 a routine they have gone through many a time before.",
      "It has taken just three years of throwing soup, spraying corn-starch paint and blocking roads - lots and lots of roads \u2013 for the troop of climate activists to become one of the country's most reviled campaigning organisations.",
      "They expect hundreds of activists to turn out on Saturday in Central London.",
      "However, despite appearances, this JSO gathering is going to be very different from what has gone before. For a start, its existence is no secret. And secondly, there is unlikely to be any of the mass disruption that has been seen previously.",
      "In fact, this is their last ever protest. JSO are, in their own words, \"hanging up the hi-viz\" and ending their campaign of civil disobedience.",
      "The group's official line is that they've won their battle because their demand that there should be no new oil and gas licences is now government policy. But privately members of JSO admit tough new powers brought in to police disruptive protests have made it almost impossible for groups like it to operate.",
      "Sarah Lunnon, co-founder of JSO, says Saturday's gathering will be a \"joyful celebration\".",
      "\"We've done incredible things together, trusted each other with so much,\" she says.",
      "The group aren't the only ones who'll be celebrating. Many of the thousands of motorists who've been delayed, art lovers appalled by the attacks on great paintings, or the sports fans and theatre goers whose events were interrupted, will be glad to see the back of them. So too the police. Policing JSO protests has soaked up thousands of hours of officer time and cost millions. In 2023 the Met Police said the group's protests cost almost \u00a320m.",
      "But the end of JSO also raises some big questions, including if this is really the end of disruptive climate protest in the UK or whether being forced underground could spawn new, even more disruptive or chaotic climate action. And there's a bigger strategic question. Despite widespread public concern about the future of the planet, much of the public ended up hostile to JSO. How can the climate movement avoid a repeat of that?",
      "Policed to extinction?",
      "JSO's model involved small groups of committed activists undertaking targeted actions designed to cause maximum disruption or public outrage. But it had strict internal rules. The actions had to be non-violent, and activists had to be held accountable \u2013 they had to wait around to get arrested.",
      "For leaders like Roger Hallam, who was originally jailed for five years for plotting to disrupt traffic on the M25, being seen to be punished was a key part of the publicity.",
      "The police, roused by public anger and hostile media coverage, demanded more powers to stop the \"eco-loons\", as the Sun newspaper dubbed them, and other protesters. And politicians heeded the call.",
      "The biggest change came with the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act in 2022. It made \"intentionally or recklessly causing public nuisance\" a statutory offence. A list of loosely defined actions including causing \"serious distress, serious annoyance, serious inconvenience or serious loss of amenity\" were now potentially serious crimes. And that opened up another legal route for the authorities: the charge of conspiracy to intentionally cause public nuisance. Now even planning a potentially disruptive action could bring substantial jail time.",
      "The Public Order Act the following year broadened the police's powers to manage protests and brought in new criminal offences including \"locking on\" to objects, causing serious disruption by tunnelling, and interfering with major infrastructure.",
      "At the same time judges, backed by the higher courts, have blocked the right of protesters to claim they had a \"lawful excuse\" for their actions in the vast majority of protest cases. The Court of Appeal has accepted that the \"beliefs and motivation\" of a defendant are too remote to constitute lawful excuse for causing damage to a property. It means they can no longer argue to juries that their right to splash paint on buildings, sit in the road, or undertake other disruptive activities, is justified by the bigger threat posed by climate change. In most trials the only question for the court now is whether the defendants did what they are accused of, not why they did it.",
      "\"We've seen people being found guilty and sent to prison for years,\" says JSO's Sarah Lunnon.",
      "David Spencer, a former police officer who now is head of crime and justice at the think tank Policy Exchange, says too often the law had previously \"favoured those involved in disruptive protests at the expense of the legitimate interests of other people.\"",
      "The human rights organisation Liberty sees things very differently, believing the changes amount to an attack on democracy.",
      "Ruth Ehrlich, head of policy and campaigns at the organisation argues the legal changes have \"had a chilling effect on the ways all of us are able to speak out for what we believe\".",
      "What comes next?",
      "In this context, some climate activists have concluded that it is time to drop the movement's long-standing commitment to accountability \u2013 they will undertake disruptive actions but won't stick around to be arrested any more.",
      "Over the past year a group called Shut the System (STS) has carried out a series of criminal attacks on the offices of finance and insurance companies: smashing windows, daubing paint, supergluing locks, and in January this year they targeted fibre optic communication cables.",
      "I spoke to one of the organisers on a messaging app. They argue the legal changes mean the traditional forms of accountable protest aren't viable anymore.",
      "\"It would be impossible for people to sustain an effective campaign with people going to prison for years after a single action,\" the spokesperson told me. \"Activists are forced into a position where we have to go underground.\"",
      "I asked the group what they would say to people who criticise them for breaking the law. They said that in their view the stakes are such that they have to do what they think works.",
      "This is not the first time protesters in the UK have taken clandestine action on climate issues. Over the past few years a group calling itself the Tyre Extinguishers has deflated tyres on sports utility vehicles (SUVs) in several locations, while this year another group drilled holes in the tyres of cars at a Land Rover dealership in Cornwall.",
      "The idea of protesters causing JSO levels of disruption - but unlike JSO, avoiding justice - may send a chill down the spine of many motorists. But Dr Graeme Hayes, reader in Political Sociology at Aston University, thinks only a tiny minority of climate campaigners are likely to get involved in such actions.",
      "He has studied environmental protest groups in the UK for decades and says the more radical groups are finding it increasingly hard to recruit people.",
      "\"There is a very strong, profound ethical commitment to being non-violent within the climate movement so I think whatever it does will be based on those principles,\" he says.",
      "'Disgruntled people find each other'",
      "Others have found legal ways to make their protests heard. A group called the Citizen's Arrest Network (CAN) is attempting to flip the script by using the law of public nuisance \u2013 implemented so effectively against the disruptive protests of JSO \u2013 against the bosses of fossil fuel and other polluting companies.",
      "The group exploits the right, dating back to medieval England, that allows citizens to arrest people they think have committed a crime. CAN put together alleged criminal cases against those company bosses they argue are causing public nuisance by damaging the environment. Then they \"arrest\" them in public, which involves handing them documents detailing the alleged crimes they are responsible for.",
      "The group claims to have \"arrested\" a number of executives from fossil fuel and water companies and last month served indictments against Shell and BP to the Crown Prosecution Service. Gail Lynch, one of the organisers, says the group was born out of frustration, \"disgruntled people find each other, and they need a mechanism to have their voice heard,\" she says.",
      "Drawing the line",
      "These days very few elected politicians speak out in favour of JSO's actions. Yet as recently as April 2019 Extinction Rebellion (XR) staged 10 days of protests across the UK that caused widespread disruption and included blocking Oxford Circus in central London with a large pink boat. Instead of lengthy prison sentences for those involved, the protest leaders were instead rewarded with a meeting with Conservative government ministers.",
      "Within two months the UK parliament had passed a law committing the country to bringing all greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050. Robert Jenrick, then a Treasury minister, was one of the ministers who met XR and was still in post when the Net Zero laws were passed.",
      "But things are different now and Jenrick, who is now shadow Justice Secretary, is very critical of JSO's actions.",
      "\"It was completely unacceptable that ambulances were being blocked and millions of commuters were being subjected to hours of delays and misery,\" he tells me.",
      "\"Just Stop Oil's zealotry has probably set back their cause by alienating the law-abiding majority.\"",
      "Polling evidence suggests there is still strong support for climate action amongst the public.",
      "Ahead of the general election last year, the polling organisation More in Common, along with climate think tank ESG, found around 80% of Britons thought it was important that the government cares about tackling climate change. This broad sentiment was echoed across the political board - nearly four out of five Conservative voters and two thirds of Reform voters felt this way.",
      "But despite this, JSO is not well regarded by the public. A 2023 YouGov poll of almost 4,000 people found just 17% had a favourable view of the group.",
      "According to Dr Hayes, what happened with JSO has prompted deep reflection within the climate movement about its future strategy.",
      "There are some within the green movement who will be pleased to see the end of JSO.",
      "Rupert Read, a former spokesperson for XR is one of many who believes JSO's message on the urgency of action on climate change got lost in the outrage caused by their disruptive campaigning.",
      "\"Just Stop Oil has been effective at getting attention,\" says Read, \"but that's not the same thing as getting real change.\" They generated a lot of headlines: \"[but] sometimes people give you coverage precisely because they think that coverage will be bad for you and your cause.\"",
      "John Gummer, now Lord Deben, was an environment minister under Margaret Thatcher and chaired the government's watchdog on climate change for a decade. He has been very critical of successive governments' lack of action on climate change.",
      "But Lord Deben believes the disruptive actions of groups like JSO are counterproductive. \"I think it annoys people more than it encourages people to think seriously about the issue,\" he says.",
      "His advice to people who want to see more action on climate change is to use the democratic system more effectively, for example by telling MPs and local councillors about concerns.",
      "Public support",
      "XR's former spokesperson, Mr Read, believes campaigners should now focus on building a mass movement. \"If we are going to actually win on this, we need to do something that will bring most people with us because there is no way one gets to win on climate without bringing most people with one,\" he says.",
      "He's working with the former head of the Green Party, Caroline Lucas, on a new organisation, the Climate Majority Project. It lists prominent Conservatives including Lord Deben among its supporters and aims to use non-disruptive methods. The focus will be building support for climate action by focusing on tackling the impacts of extreme weather in local communities.",
      "\"The end game is that we get a situation where the political parties are racing to compete for votes on climate and nature, rather than running away from them,\" explains Read.",
      "Naturalist and presenter Chris Packham believes \"empowering\" voters should be the focus. \"We need a larger number, a larger percentage of our populace, on board when it comes to being able to talk [\u2026] truth to power.\"",
      "But he argues there are real dangers for governments that stifle the voices of those who have legitimate concerns. \"If a government is arrogant enough not to listen to people protesting and they have good grounds for protest [\u2026] there are bound to be those people who say we are going to escalate the protest.\"",
      "He helped organise last year's Restore Nature Now march which brought tens of thousands of people onto the streets and was supported by a whole range of nature focused organisations including big charities like the National Trust and RSPB, as well as campaign groups like JSO.",
      "Packham was hoping that by getting a whole range of activists together on a single stage \"they would all see the bigger picture and recognise that there are far more commonalities between them than differences.\"",
      "But peaceful climate action does not get the same attention as non-peaceful action. \"We put between 70,000 and 80,000 people on the streets of London, but because it was a peaceful demonstration made up of kids in fancy dress we didn't get any coverage,\" says Packham.",
      "Will flights really reach net zero by 2050 - and at what cost to passengers?",
      "Will China step up if Trump takes a step back on climate change?",
      "The unexpected knock-on effect of Trump's minerals 'deal of the century'",
      "It is in this context that Ms Lunnon of JSO believes new forms of disruptive protest will emerge in time. \"The movement is there and will find new ways to confront the government,\" she says. \"Nobody is shutting up shop and calling it a day.  We know morally that we have to continue.\"",
      "However it is clear that, for now at least, the model that made JSO so notorious is dead.",

      "The summit is being co-hosted by the UK and the International Energy Agency (IEA). The head of the IEA, Fatih Birol, told the BBC ahead of the summit that there was increased \"international fragmentation\" leaving countries unable to solve the biggest risks to energy security.",

    "published": "Thu, 24 Apr 2025 09:00:09 GMT",
    "summary": "Deep tracks gouged in the seafloor off the coast of Scotland could help us understand Antarctica today.",
    "story": [
      "Icebergs as large as cities, potentially tens of kilometres wide, once roved the coasts of the UK, according to scientists.",
      "Researchers found distinctive scratch marks left by the drifting icebergs as they gouged deep tracks into the North Sea floor more than 18,000 years ago.",
      "It's the first hard evidence that the ice sheet formerly covering Britain and Ireland produced such large bergs.",
      "The findings could provide vital clues in understanding how climate change is affecting Antarctica today.",
      "The scientists searched for fingerprints of giant icebergs using very detailed 3D seismic data, collected by oil and gas companies or wind turbine projects doing ocean surveys.",
      "This is a bit like doing an MRI scan of the sediment layers beneath the present-day seafloor, going back millions of years.",
      "The researchers found deep, comb-like grooves, interpreted to have been created by the keels of large icebergs that broke off the British-Irish ice sheet more than 18,000 years ago.",
      "Some of these scratch marks are as close as 90 miles (145km) to Scotland's present-day east coast.",
      "\"We found [evidence of] these gigantic tabular icebergs, which basically means the shape of a table, with incredibly wide and flat tops,\" said James Kirkham, marine geophysicist at the British Antarctic Survey and lead author of the new study, published in the journal Nature Communications.",
      "\"These have not been seen before and it shows definitively that the UK had ice shelves, because that's the only way to produce these gigantic tabular icebergs.\"",
      "Ice shelves are floating platforms of ice where glaciers extend out into the ocean.",
      "By analysing the size of the grooves, the scientists estimate that these icebergs could be five to tens of kilometres wide and 50-180m thick, although it's difficult to be exact.",
      "That means they would have covered an area roughly as big as medium-sized UK cities like Norwich or Cambridge.",
      "The icebergs are comparable in size to some of the smaller icebergs found off present-day Antarctica, such as blocks that calved from the Larsen B ice shelf in 2002.",
      "Dr Kirkham described seeing such an iceberg when working in Antarctica two years ago.",
      "\"Those of us working on this paper were standing together, gazing out onto this iceberg and thinking, 'Wow, that's probably a similar size iceberg to what was found off the shore of Scotland 18,000 years ago, right in front of us in Antarctica today.'\"",
      "Clues for Antarctica?",
      "Hundreds of ice shelves surround about three-quarters of today's Antarctic ice sheet, helping to hold back its vast glaciers.",
      "But if ice shelves are lost, the glaciers behind can speed up, depositing more and more ice into the ocean and raising sea levels worldwide.",
      "Exactly how this plays out, though, is \"one of the largest sources of uncertainty in our models of sea level rise\", Dr Kirkham told BBC News.",
      "That's partly because scientists have only been able to use satellites for a few decades to observe about 10 cases of ice shelves collapsing - hence the desire to look for examples further back in time.",
      "No ice shelf setting is the same, but the researchers say their findings from the former British-Irish ice sheet could help understand how Antarctica might respond to today's rapidly warming climate.",
      "By looking at the changing scratch marks on the seafloor, the researchers discovered an abrupt shift in Britain's icebergs about 18,000 years ago, a time when the planet was gradually warming from a very cold period.",
      "The occasional production of giant bergs ceased. Instead, smaller ones were produced much more frequently.",
      "That indicates that the ice shelves suddenly disintegrated; without these massive floating platforms, such large icebergs could no longer be produced.",
      "And it's potentially important because this coincides with the time when the glaciers behind began to retreat faster and faster.",
      "The crucial, but unresolved, question is whether the disintegration of Britain's former ice shelves was merely a symptom of a quickly melting ice sheet - or whether the loss of these shelves directly triggered the runaway retreat of ice.",
      "Resolving this chicken-and-egg dilemma, as Dr Kirkham put it, would shed light on how serious the impacts of losing today's Antarctic ice shelves might be.",
      "\"These ocean records are fascinating and have implications for Antarctica, as they illustrate the fundamental role of ice shelves in buttressing [holding back] the flow of continental ice into the ocean,\" said Prof Eric Rignot, glaciologist at the University of California, Irvine, who was not involved in the study.",
      "\"But the argument that the collapse of ice shelves triggered ice sheet collapse is only part of the story; the main forcing is warmer air temperature and warmer ocean temperature,\" he argued.",

    "summary": "The industry says powers to self-monitor water quality should be handed back to the regulator.",
    "story": [
      "Water companies should no longer be allowed to monitor their own levels of sewage pollution, the industry body has told the BBC exclusively.",
      "Instead they are proposing a new, third-party monitoring system to build consumer trust.",
      "The recommendation is part of a submission made to the UK government's independent review into the water sector.",
      "Campaigners have long complained the companies' self-reporting has prevented the true scale of pollution in UK water being revealed.",
      "A third-party system could add more pressure to the regulators, which have also been criticised for not holding the companies to account.",
      "How much sewage is spilled near you?",
      "England water pollution at 10-year high, campaigners say",
      "Government has broken the law on sewage, says watchdog",
      "A report from the National Audit Office examining the three water regulators (Ofwat, the Environment Agency, and the Drinking Water Inspectorate) and Defra, is expected on Friday.",
      "David Henderson, CEO of industry body Water UK, told the BBC: \"We absolutely accept that self-monitoring is not helping to instil trust and so we would like to see an end to it, and in place of it a more robust, third-party system.\"",
      "As part of their permitting arrangements water companies are expected to regularly sample water quality to identify potential pollution, and submit this data to the Environment Agency in an arrangement known as \"operator self monitoring\".",
      "But there have been incidents of misreporting by water companies in England and Wales uncovered by the regulators, who said some cases had been deliberate.",
      "Southern Water was previously issued fines totalling \u00a3213m by the industry regulator (Ofwat) and the environmental regulator (the Environment Agency) for manipulating sewage data.",
      "In that case, there was unreported pollution into numerous conservation sites which caused \"major environmental harm\" to wildlife.",
      "The company later admitted its actions \"fell short\".",
      "Henderson added that the industry never asked to self-monitor, but that it was introduced in 2009 by the then Labour government to \"reduce the administrative burden\" on the Environment Agency (EA).",
      "In 2023, the BBC reported that EA staff were concerned that, due to funding cuts, the Agency was increasingly relying on water companies to self-report rather than carrying out its own checks on pollution from sewage.",
      "The current environment minister, Steve Reed, has promised to review the system, calling it the equivalent of companies \"mark[ing] their own homework\".",
      "But the National Audit Office (NAO), which reviews government spending, questioned the ability of regulators, like the EA, to take on any new monitoring.",
      "\"Regulators need to address the fact that they currently have limited oversight over whether water companies are carrying out their work as expected. It is hard to see how they will achieve this without increased overall capacity,\" said Anita Shah, NAO Director of Regulation.",
      "It is expected to publish a full review of the regulation of the water sector on Friday.",
      "A Defra spokesperson told the BBC: \"We are committed to taking decisive action to fix the water industry. The Water Commission's recommendations will mark the next major step [to] restore public trust in the sector.\"",
      "The government launched an independent water commission in October to review the sector and the way it is regulated. The public consultation closed on Wednesday with the findings expected in July.",
      "Water UK submitted a 200-page document of recommendations, including this call to end self-monitoring.",
      "The industry body also requested that water meters be universal across England and Wales to make bills fairer. At present about 60% of the population have a meter.",
      "\"The meter is just to ensure that people are paying for what they use as opposed to a flat rate of system where you can use virtually no water and pay the same as someone filling up a pool three times in a summer,\" said Henderson.",
      "\"This doesn't properly reflect the value of water and encourage people to conserve it in the way that we need,\" he added.",

    "published": "Wed, 23 Apr 2025 18:01:24 GMT",
    "summary": "Experts say the discovery provides the first physical evidence of gladiatorial combat with animals.",
    "story": [
      "Bite marks found on the skeleton of a Roman gladiator are the first archaeological evidence of combat between a human and a lion, experts say.",
      "The remains were discovered during a 2004 dig at Driffield Terrace, in York, a site now thought to be the world's only well-preserved Roman gladiator cemetery.",
      "Forensic examination of the skeleton of one young man has revealed that holes and bite marks on his pelvis were most likely caused by a lion.",
      "Prof Tim Thompson, the forensic expert who led the study, said this was the first \"physical evidence\" of gladiators fighting big cats.",
      "\"For years our understanding of Roman gladiatorial combat and animal spectacles has relied heavily on historical texts and artistic depictions,\" he said.",
      "\"This discovery provides the first direct, physical evidence that such events took place in this period, reshaping our perception of Roman entertainment culture in the region.\"",
      "Experts used new forensic techniques to analyse the wounds, including 3D scans which showed the animal had grabbed the man by the pelvis.",
      "Prof Thompson, from Maynooth University, in Ireland, said: \"We could tell that the bites happened at around the time of death.",
      "\"So this wasn't an animal scavenging after the individual died - it was associated with his death.\"",
      "As well as scanning the wound, scientists compared its size and shape to sample bites from large cats at London Zoo.",
      "\"The bite marks in this particular individual match those of a lion,\" Prof Thompson told BBC News.",
      "The location of the bites gave researchers even more information about the circumstances of the gladiator's death.",
      "The pelvis, Prof Thompson explained, \"is not where lions normally attack, so we think this gladiator was fighting in some sort of spectacle and was incapacitated, and that the lion bit him and dragged him away by his hip.\"",
      "The skeleton, a male aged between 26 and 35, had been buried in a grave with two others and overlaid with horse bones.",
      "Previous analysis of the bones pointed to him being a Bestiarius - a gladiator that was sent into combat with beasts.",
      "Malin Holst, a Senior Lecturer in Osteoarchaeology at the University of York, said in 30 years of analysing skeletons she had \"never seen anything like these bite marks\".",
      "Additionally, she said the man's remains revealed the story of a \"short and somewhat brutal life\".",
      "His bones were shaped by large, powerful muscles and there was evidence of injuries to his shoulder and spine, which were associated with hard physical work and combat.",
      "Ms Holst, who is also managing director of York Osteoarchaeology, added: \"This is a hugely exciting find because we can now start to build a better image of what these gladiators were like in life.\"",
      "The findings, which have been published in the Journal of Science and Medical Research PLoS One, also confirmed the \"presence of large cats and potentially other exotic animals in arenas in cities such as York, and how they too had to defend themselves from the threat of death\", she said.",
      "Experts said the discovery added weight to the suggestion an amphitheatre, although not yet found, likely existed in Roman York and would have staged fighting gladiators as a form of entertainment.",
      "The presence of distinguished Roman leaders in York would have meant they required a lavish lifestyle, experts said, so it was no surprise to see evidence of gladiatorial events, which served as a display of wealth.",
      "David Jennings, CEO of York Archaeology, said: \"We may never know what brought this man to the arena where we believe he may have been fighting for the entertainment of others, but it is remarkable that the first osteoarchaeological evidence for this kind of gladiatorial combat has been found so far from the Colosseum of Rome, which would have been the classical world's Wembley Stadium of combat.\""

    "summary": "The mission will explore new ways of reducing the cost of feeding an astronaut.",
    "story": [
      "Steak, mashed potatoes and desserts for astronauts could soon be grown from individual cells in space if an experiment launched into orbit today is successful.",
      "A European Space Agency (ESA) project is assessing the viability of growing so-called lab-grown food in the low gravity and higher radiation in orbit and on other worlds.",
      "ESA is funding the research to explore new ways of reducing the cost of feeding an astronaut, which can cost up to \u00a320,000 per day.",
      "The team involved say the experiment is a first step to developing a small pilot food production plant on the International Space Station in two years' time.",
      "Lab-grown food will be essential if Nasa's objective of making humanity a multi-planetary species were to be realised, claims Dr Aqeel Shamsul, CEO and founder of Bedford-based Frontier Space, which is developing the concept with researchers at Imperial College, London.",
      "\"Our dream is to have factories in orbit and on the Moon,\" he told BBC News.",
      "\"We need to build manufacturing facilities off world if we are to provide the infrastructure to enable humans to live and work in space\".",
      "Lab-grown food involves growing food ingredients, such as protein, fat and carbohydrates in test tubes and vats and then processing them to make them look and taste like normal food.",
      "Lab-grown chicken is already on sale in the US and Singapore and lab grown steak is awaiting approval in the UK and Israel. On Earth, there are claimed environmental benefits for the technology over traditional agricultural food production methods, such as less land use and reduced greenhouse gas emissions. But in space the primary driver is to reduce costs.",
      "The researchers are doing the experiment because it costs so much to send astronauts food on the ISS - up to \u00a320,000 per astronaut per day, they estimate.",
      "Nasa, other space agencies and private sector firms plan to have a long-term presence on the Moon, in orbiting space stations and maybe one day on Mars. That will mean sending up food for tens and eventually hundreds of astronauts living and working in space \u2013 something that would be prohibitively expensive if it were sent up by rockets, according to Dr Shamsul.",
      "Growing food in space would make much more sense, he suggests.",
      "\"We could start off simply with protein-enhanced mashed potatoes on to more complex foods which we could put together in space,\" he tells me.",
      "\"But in the longer term we could put the lab-grown ingredients into a 3D printer and print off whatever you want on the space station, such as a steak!\"",
      "This sounds like the replicator machines on Star Trek, which are able to produce food and drink from pure energy. But it is no longer the stuff of science fiction, says Dr Shamsul.",
      "He showed me a set-up, called a bioreactor, at Imperial College's Bezos Centre for Sustainable Proteins in west London. It comprised a brick-coloured concoction bubbling away in a test tube. The process is known as precision fermentation, which is like the fermentation used to make beer, but different: \"precision\" is a rebranding word for genetically engineered.",
      "In this case a gene has been added to yeast to produce extra vitamins, but all sorts of ingredients can be produced in this way, according to Dr Rodrigo Ledesma-Amaro, Director of the Bezos Centre.",
      "\"We can make all the elements to make food,\" says Dr Ledesma-Amaro proudly.",
      "\"We can make proteins, fats, carbohydrates, fibres and they can be combined to make different dishes.\"",
      "A much smaller, simpler version of the biorector has been sent into space on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket as part of the ESA mission. There is plenty of evidence that foods can be successfully grown from cells on Earth, but can the process be repeated in the weightlessness and higher radiation of space?",
      "Drs Ledesma-Amaro and Shamsul have sent small amounts of the yeast concoction to orbit the Earth in a small cube satellite on board Europe's first commercial returnable spacecraft, Phoenix. If all goes to plan, it will orbit the Earth for around three hours before falling back to Earth off the coast of Portugal. The experiment will be retrieved by a recovery vessel and sent back to the lab in London to be examined.",
      "The data they gather will inform the construction of a larger, better bioreactor which the scientists will send into space next year, according to Dr Ledesma-Amaro.",
      "The problem, though, is that the brick-coloured goo, which is dried into a powder, looks distinctly unappetising \u2013 even less appetising than the freeze-dried fare that astronauts currently have to put up with.",
      "That is where Imperial College's master chef comes in. Jakub Radzikowski is the culinary education designer tasked with turning chemistry into cuisine.",
      "He isn't allowed to use lab grown ingredients to make dishes for people just yet, because regulatory approval is still pending. But he's getting a head start. For now, instead of lab-grown ingredients, Jakub is using starches and proteins from naturally occurring fungi to develop his recipes. He tells me all sorts of dishes will be possible, once he gets the go-ahead to use lab-grown ingredients.",
      "\"We want to create food that is familiar to astronauts who are from different parts of the world so that it can provide comfort.",
      "\"We can create anything from French, Chinese, Indian. It will be possible to replicate any kind of cuisine in space.\"",
      "Today, Jakub is trying out a new recipe of spicy dumplings and dipping sauce. He tells me that I am allowed to try them out, but taster-in-chief is someone far more qualified: Helen Sharman, the UK's first astronaut, who also has a PhD in chemistry.",
      "We tasted the steaming dumplings together.",
      "My view: \"They are absolutely gorgeous!\"",
      "Dr Sharman's expert view, not dissimilar: \"You get a really strong blast from the flavour. It is really delicious and very moreish,\" she beamed.",
      "\"I would love to have had something like this. When I was in space, I had really long-life stuff: tins, freeze dried packets, tubes of stuff. It was fine, but not tasty.\"",
      "Dr Sharman's more important observation was about the science. Lab-grown food, she said, could potentially be better for astronauts, as well as reduce costs to the levels required to make long-term off-world habitation viable.",
      "Research on the ISS has shown that the biochemistry of astronauts' bodies changes during long duration space missions: their hormone balance and iron levels alter, and they lose calcium from their bones. Astronauts take supplements to compensate, but lab-grown food could in principle be tweaked with the extra ingredients already built in, says Dr Sharman.",
      "\"Astronauts tend to lose weight because they are not eating as much because they don't have the variety and interest in their diet,\" she told me.",
      "\"So, astronauts might be more open to having something that has been cooked from scratch and a feeling that you are really eating wholesome food.\"",

      "It's a big shift from the 2021 election, when the environment topped the list of voter concerns.",
      "In that vote, there was a consensus between the two major parties that Canada should rapidly transition to a green economy, with a net-zero emissions law passed in June of that year.",
      "That sense of unity is now long gone.",

      "However, his first action as prime minister was to repeal the consumer carbon levy.",
      "The tax - a signature climate policy of the governing Liberals - was introduced in 2019, and placed an added charge on consumers using coal, oil or gas products.",
      "It was unpopular, and for the Conservatives it became an easy target of blame for the rising cost of living in recent years. Poilievre even sought to paint his rival as \"Carbon Tax Carney\".",

      "\"I think there's a missed opportunity here to set a new narrative framework around this in the election.\"",
      "Carney's election pitch on energy is to turn Canada into \"a world leading superpower in both clean and conventional energy\".",
      "He is emphasising his pragmatic approach, and his campaign talks about fast-tracking green energy projects and encouraging green transport and buildings, without giving too many details. He has also called for investment in technologies like carbon capture.",
      "There are other important factors that have helped cool some of the Carney climate rhetoric.",
      "Opinion polls indicate that, since late 2023, Canadian concerns over the climate fell as worries over rising prices, energy and housing costs came to the fore.",
      "The war in Ukraine has also put new emphasis on the country's bountiful natural resources in oil, gas and critical minerals.",

      "According to Prof Winfield, the Conservative proposals to boost oil and gas is likely to prove attractive to voters, even if the merits of expanding production don't stand up to scrutiny.",
      "He told the BBC it's more \"at the in-principal level as a response to Trump, as opposed to any real thinking through of what are the implications on climate, and whether this is actually economically viable\".",
      "Regardless of climate or energy, the key question in the minds of voters in this election is which leader is best placed to deal with the combative US president.",
      "That is especially important when it comes to the oil and gas industry.",
      "Canada is America's largest foreign supplier of oil, with around 90% of crude production heading south of the border, and the impact of energy tariffs could well be disastrous for jobs and the economy.",

    "summary": "Climate activists may be going deeper underground.",
    "story": [
      "Listen to Justin read this article",
      "Just Stop Oil (JSO) activists are dusting down their placards, digging out their infamous fluorescent orange vests, and charging up their loud hailers \u2014 a routine they have gone through many a time before.",
      "It has taken just three years of throwing soup, spraying corn-starch paint and blocking roads - lots and lots of roads \u2013 for the troop of climate activists to become one of the country's most reviled campaigning organisations.",
      "They expect hundreds of activists to turn out on Saturday in Central London.",
      "However, despite appearances, this JSO gathering is going to be very different from what has gone before. For a start, its existence is no secret. And secondly, there is unlikely to be any of the mass disruption that has been seen previously.",
      "In fact, this is their last ever protest. JSO are, in their own words, \"hanging up the hi-viz\" and ending their campaign of civil disobedience.",
      "The group's official line is that they've won their battle because their demand that there should be no new oil and gas licences is now government policy. But privately members of JSO admit tough new powers brought in to police disruptive protests have made it almost impossible for groups like it to operate.",
      "Sarah Lunnon, co-founder of JSO, says Saturday's gathering will be a \"joyful celebration\".",
      "\"We've done incredible things together, trusted each other with so much,\" she says.",
      "The group aren't the only ones who'll be celebrating. Many of the thousands of motorists who've been delayed, art lovers appalled by the attacks on great paintings, or the sports fans and theatre goers whose events were interrupted, will be glad to see the back of them. So too the police. Policing JSO protests has soaked up thousands of hours of officer time and cost millions. In 2023 the Met Police said the group's protests cost almost \u00a320m.",
      "But the end of JSO also raises some big questions, including if this is really the end of disruptive climate protest in the UK or whether being forced underground could spawn new, even more disruptive or chaotic climate action. And there's a bigger strategic question. Despite widespread public concern about the future of the planet, much of the public ended up hostile to JSO. How can the climate movement avoid a repeat of that?",
      "Policed to extinction?",
      "JSO's model involved small groups of committed activists undertaking targeted actions designed to cause maximum disruption or public outrage. But it had strict internal rules. The actions had to be non-violent, and activists had to be held accountable \u2013 they had to wait around to get arrested.",
      "For leaders like Roger Hallam, who was originally jailed for five years for plotting to disrupt traffic on the M25, being seen to be punished was a key part of the publicity.",
      "The police, roused by public anger and hostile media coverage, demanded more powers to stop the \"eco-loons\", as the Sun newspaper dubbed them, and other protesters. And politicians heeded the call.",
      "The biggest change came with the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Act in 2022. It made \"intentionally or recklessly causing public nuisance\" a statutory offence. A list of loosely defined actions including causing \"serious distress, serious annoyance, serious inconvenience or serious loss of amenity\" were now potentially serious crimes. And that opened up another legal route for the authorities: the charge of conspiracy to intentionally cause public nuisance. Now even planning a potentially disruptive action could bring substantial jail time.",
      "The Public Order Act the following year broadened the police's powers to manage protests and brought in new criminal offences including \"locking on\" to objects, causing serious disruption by tunnelling, and interfering with major infrastructure.",
      "At the same time judges, backed by the higher courts, have blocked the right of protesters to claim they had a \"lawful excuse\" for their actions in the vast majority of protest cases. The Court of Appeal has accepted that the \"beliefs and motivation\" of a defendant are too remote to constitute lawful excuse for causing damage to a property. It means they can no longer argue to juries that their right to splash paint on buildings, sit in the road, or undertake other disruptive activities, is justified by the bigger threat posed by climate change. In most trials the only question for the court now is whether the defendants did what they are accused of, not why they did it.",
      "\"We've seen people being found guilty and sent to prison for years,\" says JSO's Sarah Lunnon.",
      "David Spencer, a former police officer who now is head of crime and justice at the think tank Policy Exchange, says too often the law had previously \"favoured those involved in disruptive protests at the expense of the legitimate interests of other people.\"",
      "The human rights organisation Liberty sees things very differently, believing the changes amount to an attack on democracy.",
      "Ruth Ehrlich, head of policy and campaigns at the organisation argues the legal changes have \"had a chilling effect on the ways all of us are able to speak out for what we believe\".",
      "What comes next?",
      "In this context, some climate activists have concluded that it is time to drop the movement's long-standing commitment to accountability \u2013 they will undertake disruptive actions but won't stick around to be arrested any more.",
      "Over the past year a group called Shut the System (STS) has carried out a series of criminal attacks on the offices of finance and insurance companies: smashing windows, daubing paint, supergluing locks, and in January this year they targeted fibre optic communication cables.",
      "I spoke to one of the organisers on a messaging app. They argue the legal changes mean the traditional forms of accountable protest aren't viable anymore.",
      "\"It would be impossible for people to sustain an effective campaign with people going to prison for years after a single action,\" the spokesperson told me. \"Activists are forced into a position where we have to go underground.\"",
      "I asked the group what they would say to people who criticise them for breaking the law. They said that in their view the stakes are such that they have to do what they think works.",
      "This is not the first time protesters in the UK have taken clandestine action on climate issues. Over the past few years a group calling itself the Tyre Extinguishers has deflated tyres on sports utility vehicles (SUVs) in several locations, while this year another group drilled holes in the tyres of cars at a Land Rover dealership in Cornwall.",
      "The idea of protesters causing JSO levels of disruption - but unlike JSO, avoiding justice - may send a chill down the spine of many motorists. But Dr Graeme Hayes, reader in Political Sociology at Aston University, thinks only a tiny minority of climate campaigners are likely to get involved in such actions.",
      "He has studied environmental protest groups in the UK for decades and says the more radical groups are finding it increasingly hard to recruit people.",
      "\"There is a very strong, profound ethical commitment to being non-violent within the climate movement so I think whatever it does will be based on those principles,\" he says.",
      "'Disgruntled people find each other'",
      "Others have found legal ways to make their protests heard. A group called the Citizen's Arrest Network (CAN) is attempting to flip the script by using the law of public nuisance \u2013 implemented so effectively against the disruptive protests of JSO \u2013 against the bosses of fossil fuel and other polluting companies.",
      "The group exploits the right, dating back to medieval England, that allows citizens to arrest people they think have committed a crime. CAN put together alleged criminal cases against those company bosses they argue are causing public nuisance by damaging the environment. Then they \"arrest\" them in public, which involves handing them documents detailing the alleged crimes they are responsible for.",
      "The group claims to have \"arrested\" a number of executives from fossil fuel and water companies and last month served indictments against Shell and BP to the Crown Prosecution Service. Gail Lynch, one of the organisers, says the group was born out of frustration, \"disgruntled people find each other, and they need a mechanism to have their voice heard,\" she says.",
      "Drawing the line",
      "These days very few elected politicians speak out in favour of JSO's actions. Yet as recently as April 2019 Extinction Rebellion (XR) staged 10 days of protests across the UK that caused widespread disruption and included blocking Oxford Circus in central London with a large pink boat. Instead of lengthy prison sentences for those involved, the protest leaders were instead rewarded with a meeting with Conservative government ministers.",
      "Within two months the UK parliament had passed a law committing the country to bringing all greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050. Robert Jenrick, then a Treasury minister, was one of the ministers who met XR and was still in post when the Net Zero laws were passed.",
      "But things are different now and Jenrick, who is now shadow Justice Secretary, is very critical of JSO's actions.",
      "\"It was completely unacceptable that ambulances were being blocked and millions of commuters were being subjected to hours of delays and misery,\" he tells me.",
      "\"Just Stop Oil's zealotry has probably set back their cause by alienating the law-abiding majority.\"",
      "Polling evidence suggests there is still strong support for climate action amongst the public.",
      "Ahead of the general election last year, the polling organisation More in Common, along with climate think tank ESG, found around 80% of Britons thought it was important that the government cares about tackling climate change. This broad sentiment was echoed across the political board - nearly four out of five Conservative voters and two thirds of Reform voters felt this way.",
      "But despite this, JSO is not well regarded by the public. A 2023 YouGov poll of almost 4,000 people found just 17% had a favourable view of the group.",
      "According to Dr Hayes, what happened with JSO has prompted deep reflection within the climate movement about its future strategy.",
      "There are some within the green movement who will be pleased to see the end of JSO.",
      "Rupert Read, a former spokesperson for XR is one of many who believes JSO's message on the urgency of action on climate change got lost in the outrage caused by their disruptive campaigning.",
      "\"Just Stop Oil has been effective at getting attention,\" says Read, \"but that's not the same thing as getting real change.\" They generated a lot of headlines: \"[but] sometimes people give you coverage precisely because they think that coverage will be bad for you and your cause.\"",
      "John Gummer, now Lord Deben, was an environment minister under Margaret Thatcher and chaired the government's watchdog on climate change for a decade. He has been very critical of successive governments' lack of action on climate change.",
      "But Lord Deben believes the disruptive actions of groups like JSO are counterproductive. \"I think it annoys people more than it encourages people to think seriously about the issue,\" he says.",
      "His advice to people who want to see more action on climate change is to use the democratic system more effectively, for example by telling MPs and local councillors about concerns.",
      "Public support",
      "XR's former spokesperson, Mr Read, believes campaigners should now focus on building a mass movement. \"If we are going to actually win on this, we need to do something that will bring most people with us because there is no way one gets to win on climate without bringing most people with one,\" he says.",
      "He's working with the former head of the Green Party, Caroline Lucas, on a new organisation, the Climate Majority Project. It lists prominent Conservatives including Lord Deben among its supporters and aims to use non-disruptive methods. The focus will be building support for climate action by focusing on tackling the impacts of extreme weather in local communities.",
      "\"The end game is that we get a situation where the political parties are racing to compete for votes on climate and nature, rather than running away from them,\" explains Read.",
      "Naturalist and presenter Chris Packham believes \"empowering\" voters should be the focus. \"We need a larger number, a larger percentage of our populace, on board when it comes to being able to talk [\u2026] truth to power.\"",
      "But he argues there are real dangers for governments that stifle the voices of those who have legitimate concerns. \"If a government is arrogant enough not to listen to people protesting and they have good grounds for protest [\u2026] there are bound to be those people who say we are going to escalate the protest.\"",
      "He helped organise last year's Restore Nature Now march which brought tens of thousands of people onto the streets and was supported by a whole range of nature focused organisations including big charities like the National Trust and RSPB, as well as campaign groups like JSO.",
      "Packham was hoping that by getting a whole range of activists together on a single stage \"they would all see the bigger picture and recognise that there are far more commonalities between them than differences.\"",
      "But peaceful climate action does not get the same attention as non-peaceful action. \"We put between 70,000 and 80,000 people on the streets of London, but because it was a peaceful demonstration made up of kids in fancy dress we didn't get any coverage,\" says Packham.",
      "Will flights really reach net zero by 2050 - and at what cost to passengers?",
      "Will China step up if Trump takes a step back on climate change?",
      "The unexpected knock-on effect of Trump's minerals 'deal of the century'",
      "It is in this context that Ms Lunnon of JSO believes new forms of disruptive protest will emerge in time. \"The movement is there and will find new ways to confront the government,\" she says. \"Nobody is shutting up shop and calling it a day.  We know morally that we have to continue.\"",
      "However it is clear that, for now at least, the model that made JSO so notorious is dead.",

    "summary": "The UK Energy Secretary was speaking at the opening of a two day summit on energy security.",
    "story": [
      "Energy Secretary Ed Miliband has called for countries to cooperate to reduce the risk to global energy supplies.",
      "He was speaking at the opening of a two day summit on energy security in London, which is being attended by delegates from more than 50 governments, including the US and the EU.",
      "Miliband also warned of the risks from energy being \"weaponised\", seen as a reference to the impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine on gas prices.",
      "Delegates will be discussing how to reduce the mounting risks to energy arising from the wars in Europe and the Middle East, the ongoing trade war between the US and China, extreme weather, attacks on undersea cable and cyber warfare.",
      "In his opening remarks, Ed Miliband said he recognised the value of fossil fuels in the energy mix but made clear that, at least for the UK, the future of energy is low-carbon.",
      "He said this was not just to help tackle climate change but also to achieve energy security.",
      "The summit is being co-hosted by the UK and the International Energy Agency (IEA). The head of the IEA, Fatih Birol, told the BBC ahead of the summit that there was increased \"international fragmentation\" leaving countries unable to solve the biggest risks to energy security.",
      "\"Instead of cooperation, we see countries are really challenging each other. In my view the lasting solution to energy security challenges goes through cooperation among the countries.\"",
      "He did not blame any countries specifically for a breakdown in relations, but energy prices have been particularly impacted by the war in Ukraine and US President Donald Trump's recent trade war.",
      "Global gas prices spiked following the Russian invasion of Ukraine and have remained nearly 50% higher than pre-Covid levels.",
      "Europe was initially able to plug the shortage of gas, following sanctions of Russia, by purchasing LNG from the US. But that supply is now under threat as relations between the bloc and President Trump worsen.",
      "The US is attending the summit, which should be seen as a \"success\" according to Mr Birol. But the Trump administration has been highly critical of the global energy watchdog for its promotion of clean energy and forecasting declines in oil and gas.",
      "Many think tanks and researchers have defended the IEA's position.",
      "\"On the big calls \u2013 like the future of global oil demand \u2013 the IEA has consistently proven a more reliable forecaster than fossil fuel companies,\" said Laurence Tubiana, CEO, of the European Climate Foundation",
      "\"As countries come together to shape a new energy security paradigm, they need unbiased, dependable data on the future direction of energy,\" he added.",
      "Miliband also read out a letter from King Charles III.",
      "\"As we all navigate the transition to cleaner energy for our planet and energy security for our citizens, summits such as these are of vital importance in facilitating shared learning between nations, particularly those in the global south and across the Commonwealth,\" King Charles wrote.",
      "The UK government wants 95% of Great Britain's electricity mix to come from clean energy by the end of the decade - currently this stands around 60%.",

    "published": "Thu, 24 Apr 2025 09:00:09 GMT",
    "summary": "Deep tracks gouged in the seafloor off the coast of Scotland could help us understand Antarctica today.",
    "story": [
      "Icebergs as large as cities, potentially tens of kilometres wide, once roved the coasts of the UK, according to scientists.",
      "Researchers found distinctive scratch marks left by the drifting icebergs as they gouged deep tracks into the North Sea floor more than 18,000 years ago.",
      "It's the first hard evidence that the ice sheet formerly covering Britain and Ireland produced such large bergs.",
      "The findings could provide vital clues in understanding how climate change is affecting Antarctica today.",
      "The scientists searched for fingerprints of giant icebergs using very detailed 3D seismic data, collected by oil and gas companies or wind turbine projects doing ocean surveys.",
      "This is a bit like doing an MRI scan of the sediment layers beneath the present-day seafloor, going back millions of years.",
      "The researchers found deep, comb-like grooves, interpreted to have been created by the keels of large icebergs that broke off the British-Irish ice sheet more than 18,000 years ago.",
      "Some of these scratch marks are as close as 90 miles (145km) to Scotland's present-day east coast.",
      "\"We found [evidence of] these gigantic tabular icebergs, which basically means the shape of a table, with incredibly wide and flat tops,\" said James Kirkham, marine geophysicist at the British Antarctic Survey and lead author of the new study, published in the journal Nature Communications.",
      "\"These have not been seen before and it shows definitively that the UK had ice shelves, because that's the only way to produce these gigantic tabular icebergs.\"",
      "Ice shelves are floating platforms of ice where glaciers extend out into the ocean.",
      "By analysing the size of the grooves, the scientists estimate that these icebergs could be five to tens of kilometres wide and 50-180m thick, although it's difficult to be exact.",
      "That means they would have covered an area roughly as big as medium-sized UK cities like Norwich or Cambridge.",
      "The icebergs are comparable in size to some of the smaller icebergs found off present-day Antarctica, such as blocks that calved from the Larsen B ice shelf in 2002.",
      "Dr Kirkham described seeing such an iceberg when working in Antarctica two years ago.",
      "\"Those of us working on this paper were standing together, gazing out onto this iceberg and thinking, 'Wow, that's probably a similar size iceberg to what was found off the shore of Scotland 18,000 years ago, right in front of us in Antarctica today.'\"",
      "Clues for Antarctica?",
      "Hundreds of ice shelves surround about three-quarters of today's Antarctic ice sheet, helping to hold back its vast glaciers.",
      "But if ice shelves are lost, the glaciers behind can speed up, depositing more and more ice into the ocean and raising sea levels worldwide.",
      "Exactly how this plays out, though, is \"one of the largest sources of uncertainty in our models of sea level rise\", Dr Kirkham told BBC News.",
      "That's partly because scientists have only been able to use satellites for a few decades to observe about 10 cases of ice shelves collapsing - hence the desire to look for examples further back in time.",
      "No ice shelf setting is the same, but the researchers say their findings from the former British-Irish ice sheet could help understand how Antarctica might respond to today's rapidly warming climate.",
      "By looking at the changing scratch marks on the seafloor, the researchers discovered an abrupt shift in Britain's icebergs about 18,000 years ago, a time when the planet was gradually warming from a very cold period.",
      "The occasional production of giant bergs ceased. Instead, smaller ones were produced much more frequently.",
      "That indicates that the ice shelves suddenly disintegrated; without these massive floating platforms, such large icebergs could no longer be produced.",
      "And it's potentially important because this coincides with the time when the glaciers behind began to retreat faster and faster.",
      "The crucial, but unresolved, question is whether the disintegration of Britain's former ice shelves was merely a symptom of a quickly melting ice sheet - or whether the loss of these shelves directly triggered the runaway retreat of ice.",
      "Resolving this chicken-and-egg dilemma, as Dr Kirkham put it, would shed light on how serious the impacts of losing today's Antarctic ice shelves might be.",
      "\"These ocean records are fascinating and have implications for Antarctica, as they illustrate the fundamental role of ice shelves in buttressing [holding back] the flow of continental ice into the ocean,\" said Prof Eric Rignot, glaciologist at the University of California, Irvine, who was not involved in the study.",
      "\"But the argument that the collapse of ice shelves triggered ice sheet collapse is only part of the story; the main forcing is warmer air temperature and warmer ocean temperature,\" he argued.",

      "In that vote, there was a consensus between the two major parties that Canada should rapidly transition to a green economy, with a net-zero emissions law passed in June of that year.",
      "That sense of unity is now long gone.",
      "Carney, who became leader of the Liberals and prime minister in early March, has a long track record as an international champion of climate change.",

      "However, his first action as prime minister was to repeal the consumer carbon levy.",
      "The tax - a signature climate policy of the governing Liberals - was introduced in 2019, and placed an added charge on consumers using coal, oil or gas products.",

      "\"I think there's a missed opportunity here to set a new narrative framework around this in the election.\"",
      "Carney's election pitch on energy is to turn Canada into \"a world leading superpower in both clean and conventional energy\".",
      "He is emphasising his pragmatic approach, and his campaign talks about fast-tracking green energy projects and encouraging green transport and buildings, without giving too many details. He has also called for investment in technologies like carbon capture.",
      "There are other important factors that have helped cool some of the Carney climate rhetoric.",
      "Opinion polls indicate that, since late 2023, Canadian concerns over the climate fell as worries over rising prices, energy and housing costs came to the fore.",
      "The war in Ukraine has also put new emphasis on the country's bountiful natural resources in oil, gas and critical minerals.",

      "\"And that's created another sort of dynamic in all of this, which was not present in previous elections.\"",
      "Pierre Poilievre is the man seeking to replace Carney as PM.",
      "He is running on cost of living issues, and advocating for tougher policies on law and order and what he considers \"woke\" cultural issues.",
      "Poilievre, whose party has a strong voter base in energy-rich regions of the country, is pushing for a major expansion of the oil and gas industries and the removal of the carbon tax on industry.",
      "While he has remained tight-lipped on whether he supports Canada's net-zero goals, he has argued that it would be better for the world if India and other Asian countries were to replace \"dirty coal\" with cleaner Canadian oil and gas.",
      "According to Prof Winfield, the Conservative proposals to boost oil and gas is likely to prove attractive to voters, even if the merits of expanding production don't stand up to scrutiny.",
      "He told the BBC it's more \"at the in-principal level as a response to Trump, as opposed to any real thinking through of what are the implications on climate, and whether this is actually economically viable\".",
      "Regardless of climate or energy, the key question in the minds of voters in this election is which leader is best placed to deal with the combative US president.",
      "That is especially important when it comes to the oil and gas industry.",
      "Canada is America's largest foreign supplier of oil, with around 90% of crude production heading south of the border, and the impact of energy tariffs could well be disastrous for jobs and the economy.",
      "\"Our relationship with the US has completely changed,\" Carney said last week in the first of two election debates.",

    "story": [
      "A medieval cemetery unearthed near Cardiff Airport is continuing to confound archaeologists, as the mysteries surrounding it are multiplying.",
      "The discovery of the site, dating to the 6th or 7th Century, was announced last year, with dozens of skeletons found lying in unusual positions with unexpected artefacts.",
      "Now researchers have learned nearly all of those buried in the cemetery are women, and while their bones show signs of wear and tear - indicating they carried out heavy manual work - there are also surprising signs of wealth and luxury.",
      "Another unexpected find has been a woman tossed in a ditch, in stark contrast to all  the other people who were buried with great care.",
      "\"Every time we think we understand something, something else crops up and the picture gets more intriguing,\" said Andy Seaman from Cardiff University, who is leading the project.",
      "About half the site, which lies in an unremarkable field in the grounds of Fonmon Castle, has now been excavated.",
      "So far researchers have found 39 adult skeletons lying in graves carved out of the thick limestone bedrock. A full analysis is still ongoing, but it's thought that all apart from one are female.",
      "\"I'm not entirely sure what it means just yet,\" said Dr Seaman.",
      "\"It could be that it's something particular about this community, or it could be that this is perhaps just one cemetery within a broader kind of landscape or it might be that there's more men in another part of the cemetery.\"",
      "The skeletons of two children have also been found - a surprisingly small number given the high infant mortality of the time. Their burials also have some intriguing features.",
      "\"The earth that's been used to backfill the grave looks slightly different to that in the adults' graves,\" explained Dr Marion Shiner, an archaeologist from Cardiff University.",
      "\"It's darker and seems more organic, so potentially some time had elapsed between the burial of the adults and the burial of these two children - it's more mystery.\"",
      "Artefacts at the site are also adding to the puzzle of who these people were.",
      "Shards of pottery and fine, etched glass unearthed in the graves were most likely brought to the cemetery by people feasting while they visited the dead.",
      "\"Glass is rare, and where it is found these are sites of quite significant status,\" said Dr Seaman.",
      "\"It was probably made in the Levant - the Egypt area - and then was manufactured into vessels, we think, in southern France, and probably arrived here alongside wine in barrels.\"",
      "The presence of these items suggest this was no ordinary community. And each person here has been buried with painstaking care, some laid flat, others crouching, all facing from east to west.",
      "The team don't yet know why the woman flung into the ditch was treated so differently, but believe she could have been an outcast or a criminal.",
      "They have taken her bones to the lab at Cardiff University to try to find out more about her.",
      "Osteologist Dr Katie Faillace says she thinks the woman was in her late 30s or early 40s.",
      "Her skeleton shows a healed fracture to her arm, while her tooth was infected and had an abscess, which exposed the roots and must have been painful.",
      "Ten of the skeletons are also now undergoing more detailed analysis.",
      "The results show the people buried in the cemetery aren't all from the immediate area - they come from all over Wales and possibly from the south-west of England too.",
      "Further DNA analysis will also reveal whether any of them were related.",
      "The team are particularly interested in the skeletons' teeth.",
      "Because of the way teeth grow, they provide a unique record of everything someone has eaten from the time they are weaned right through to their death.",
      "\"They've been eating a very consistent diet based on lots of carbs - but not a lot of meat,\" said Dr Faillace. \"And that's true from their childhood into their adulthood, and that's something we're seeing across the population.",
      "\"But there was no fish whatsoever. As soon as the Romans leave, we see an absence of fish signals in the diet. It's one of the big mysteries.\"",
      "The dig is continuing this summer and the archaeologists will start to unearth the other half of the cemetery.",
      "Andy Seaman is hoping to be able to answer the questions the site has thrown up.",
      "\"We're hoping to tell the story of the individuals within the cemetery, but also the broader community,\" he said.",
      "\"We know a lot about the lives of kings and queens, but much less about everyday people. And never before really have we been able to explore a single community in so much detail and all the interesting inter-relationships.\"",

      "It comes the same week Meta announced an update to its teen accounts feature on Instagram.",
      "The firm revealed it was testing AI technology in the US designed to find accounts belonging to teenagers who have lied about their age on the platform.",
      "Where is the new blue circle?",
      "If you can't see it, you may not be able to use it yet.",
      "Meta says the feature is only being rolled out to some countries at the moment and advises it \"might not be available to you yet, even if other users in your country have access\".",
      "As well as the blue circle, there is a search bar at the top inviting users to 'Ask Meta AI or Search'.",
      "This is also a feature on Facebook Messenger and Instagram, with both platforms owned by Meta.",
      "Its AI chatbot is powered by Llama 4, one of the large language models operated by Meta.",
      "Before you ask it anything, there is a long message from Meta explaining what Meta AI is - stating it is \"optional\".",
      "On its website, WhatsApp says Meta AI \"can answer your questions, teach you something, or help come up with new ideas\".",
      "I tried out the feature by asking the AI what the weather was like in Glasgow, and it responded in seconds with a detailed report on temperature, the chance of rain, wind and humidity.",
      "It also gave me two links for further information, but this is where it ran into problems.",
      "One of the links was relevant, but the other tried to give me additional weather details for Charing Cross - not the location in Glasgow, but the railway station in London.",
      "What do people think of it?",
      "So far in Europe people aren't very pleased, with users on X, Bluesky, and Reddit outlining their frustrations - and Guardian columnist Polly Hudson was among those venting their anger at not being able to turn it off.",
      "Dr Kris Shrishak, an adviser on AI and privacy, was also highly critical, and accused Meta of \"exploiting its existing market\" and \"using people as test subjects for AI\".",
      "\"No one should be forced to use AI,\" he told the BBC.",
      "\"Its AI models are a privacy violation by design - Meta, through web scraping, has used personal data of people and pirated books in training them.",
      "\"Now that the legality of their approach has been challenged in courts, Meta is looking for other sources to collect data from people, and this feature could be one such source.\"",
      "An investigation by The Atlantic revealed Meta may have accessed millions of pirated books and research papers through LibGen - Library Genesis - to train its Llama AI.",
      "Author groups across the UK and around the world are organising campaigns to encourage governments to intervene, and Meta is currently defending a court case brought by multiple authors over the use of their work.",
      "A spokesperson for Meta declined to comment on The Atlantic investigation.",
      "What are the concerns?",
      "When you first use Meta AI in WhatsApp, it states the chatbot \"can only read messages people share with it\".",
      "\"Meta can't read any other messages in your personal chats, as your personal messages remain end to end encrypted,\" it says.",
      "Meanwhile the Information Commissioner's Office told the BBC it would \"continue to monitor the adoption of Meta AI's technology and use of personal data within WhatsApp\".",
      "\"Personal information fuels much of AI innovation so people need to trust that organisations are using their information responsibly,\" it said.",
      "\"Organisations who want to use people's personal details to train or use generative AI models need to comply with all their data protection obligations, and take the necessary extra steps when it comes to processing the data of children.\"",
      "What is AI and how does it work?",
      "Dr Shrishak says users should be wary.",
      "\"When you send messages to your friend, end to end encryption will not be affected,\" he said.",
      "\"Every time you use this feature and communicate with Meta AI, you need to remember that one of the ends is Meta, not your friend.\"",
      "The tech giant also highlights that you should only share material which you know could be used by others.",
      "\"Don't share information, including sensitive topics, about others or yourself that you don't want the AI to retain and use,\" it says.",

    "summary": "The tech giants have reacted with fury, accusing the EU of unfairly pursuing US companies.",
    "story": [
      "The European Union has ordered Apple and Meta to pay a combined \u20ac700m (\u00a3599m) in the first fines it has issued under legislation intended to curb the power of big tech.",
      "It has issued a \u20ac500m (\u00a3428m) fine to Apple over its App Store, while Meta has been fined \u20ac200m (\u00a3171m) over how much choice users had to consent to data collection.",
      "\"We have a duty to protect the rights of citizens and innovative businesses in Europe,\" Commissioner Henna Virkkunen said in a statement.",
      "The two tech firms have reacted angrily, with Meta accusing the EU of \"attempting to handicap successful American businesses\" and Apple saying it was being \"unfairly targeted\" and forced to \"give away our technology for free.\"",
      "The fines are lower than some of those issued by the EU in the past but - given the heightened economic tensions with America - still risk angering US President Donald Trump.",
      "The US has levied a 10% tariff on imports from the EU, which Trump has accused of \"taking advantage\" of America.",
      "EU spokesperson Arianna Podesta insisted the matters were \"completely separate\", telling the BBC: \"This is about enforcement, it's not about trade negotiations.\"",
      "The White House has been contacted for comment.",
      "Data and apps",
      "The European Commission - the EU's executive - started both investigations last year under a new law brought in to promote fairness in the tech sector called the Digital Markets Act (DMA).",
      "The case against Apple was over its App Store.",
      "The Commission says it must freely offer alternative app marketplaces to users and app developers - and says Apple was in breach of this.",
      "Meanwhile, Meta's fine was over the choices it offered on data collection.",
      "Meta introduced a \"consent or pay\" model, which meant users had to choose between allowing Meta to combine data it had collected on Facebook and Instagram, or paying a monthly subscription.",
      "The Commission says this model did not allow users to freely consent to how their data was used.",
      "In November, Meta introduced another option, which the Commission says \"allegedly uses less personal data to display advertisements.\"",
      "The Commission is currently assessing the new option.",
      "In both cases, the Commission says the size of the fine takes into account \"the gravity and duration of the non-compliance\".",
      "Both companies have 60 days to comply or risk further fines.",
      "\"Apple and Meta have fallen short of compliance with the DMA by implementing measures that reinforce the dependence of business users and consumers on their platforms,\" said Commissioner Teresa Ribera.",
      "\"As a result, we have taken firm but balanced enforcement action against both companies, based on clear and predictable rules.\"",
      "Apple said the Commission had made \"a series of decisions that are bad for the privacy and security of our users, bad for products, and force us to give away our technology for free.\"",
      "It also accused the Commission of \"[moving] the goal posts\" during their meetings.",
      "Meta said the ruling means Chinese and European companies are allowed to operate to different standards compared to American businesses.",
      "\"This isn't just about a fine; the Commission forcing us to change our business model effectively imposes a multi-billion-dollar tariff on Meta while requiring us to offer an inferior service,\" it said in a statement.",
      "Epic dispute",
      "The fines are relatively small given the tech companies' huge worldwide revenues - and are a fraction of Google's \u20ac2.4bn fine from last September.",
      "But they are significant in the context of the current global economic situation.",
      "In February, Donald Trump's White House issued a memorandum complaining about EU and UK regulation of American tech firms.",
      "\"Today's decisions are important in that they confirm that the European Commission will not back down,\" Anne Witt, professor of law at the EDHEC Business School in France, told the BBC.",
      "Prof Witt said the disagreement was \"not so much about substantive antitrust principles,\" given the US government is itself taking a number of big tech companies to court over alleged monopoly power.",
      "They are more \"about the fact that European institutions are telling US companies how to behave, even if these decisions are limited to have these companies behave on European soil,\" she added.",
      "One company pleased with the ruling against Apple is Epic Games, the makers of Fortnite.",
      "They had a long-running dispute over the distribution of their apps on Apple devices.",
      "Epic Games chief executive Tim Sweeney said the ruling was \"great news for app developers worldwide\" in a thread on X.",
      "He urged the US to pass similar legislation which would allow developers to distribute their apps without using Apple's App Store, which charges fees for using its platform.",
      "A US-based think tank, which is partly funded by big tech firms including Apple and Meta, came out against the decision.",
      "The Information Technology and Innovation Foundation said the European Commission \"has made clear that the DMA will be used to extract revenues from U.S. firms even as they continue striving to comply with its strictures.\"",
      "\"The Commission's actions today will not be well received by the Trump administration,\" it said.",
      "The UK is also investigating big tech companies over alleged monopoly power, after a digital competition law was brought in last year focusing on companies with large market shares.",
      "\"Apple and Google's mobile ecosystems and Google's general search and search advertising services are currently being investigated for potentially having this status, and it is likely that other US tech giants and platforms will face similar investigations in the near future,\" said Andrew Maxwell, partner at law firm Freeths.",

      "The first South American pontiff passed away on Monday aged 88, marking the end of a 12-year pontificate.",
      "As the Italian capital woke up to a hazy morning, teenage pilgrims, nuns and priests of all denominations filed silently down the streets leading to the Vatican.",
      "Many of the streets around St Peter's Basilica were closed - both to allow the flow of visitors and for security reasons, as more than a hundred foreign dignitaries were expected to join the funeral mass.",

      "Who was at Pope Francis' funeral and where did they sit?",
      "More than 8,000 Italian police of different branches were out in force, as well as firefighters, medics, canine unit handlers, volunteers, members of the armed forces and even park guards.",
      "Many had been called in from all sides of Italy to be in Rome today - resulting in a rather joyous blend of accents from across the country, from the Sicilian to the Milanese.",
      "By 08:00 local time (06:00 GMT) much of the square was already full.",
      "Jessica, 22 and from Mexico, and Cyril, 20 and from the US, had arrived at dawn to secure a front row spot to the funeral mass.",
      "\"We never thought we'd be this close. We sacrificed a little sleep to be here but it's worth it,\" said Jessica.",
      "She's a Catholic and said her relatives in Mexico would \"never believe it\" when she told them she had been at the Vatican for the Pope's funeral.",
      "As heads of state and foreign dignitaries took their places to the right of the altar, hundreds of photographers in the press area on the roof of the colonnade snapped their cameras furiously, hoping to capture a candid image of US President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, whose last meeting in February gave rise to a combative exchange in the Oval Office.",
      "But soon after, as a striking photo of the two men sitting on two chairs inside St Peter's began to circulate, it emerged that they had already met for around 15 minutes before the service began.",
      "Later, Zelensky said the meeting \"had potential to become historic, if we achieve joint results\".",
      "No more details were shared, but some on social media later joked that, given the setting, the meeting had been a \"miracle\".",
      "Photos showed that UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, Trump, Zelensky and French President Emmanuel Macron had also all met in the Vatican.",
      "From the bright red of the clergy's habits to the muted grey and blue of nuns' veils to the rainbow sun hats worn by pilgrims, all morning St Peter's Square was a riot of colours glistening in the sun.",
      "Hymns played out on giant speakers, occasionally drowned out by the sound of helicopters flying overhead, as drones and seagulls crisscrossed over Michelangelo's dome.",
      "Yet the voice of 91-year-old Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re rang loud and clear as he presided over the mass.",
      "The service's structure was very similar to that of any Catholic funeral mass, although the readings were done in many different languages and all hymns were sung in Latin.",
      "Outside St Peter's, a crowd the Vatican later said numbered 200,000 applauded as large screens showed Zelensky take his seat. There was also applause when the Pope's simple wooden coffin was brought out.",
      "The crowd's applause marked some other salient moments - such as when Cardinal Re, as part of his homily, remembered the Pope's commitment to migrants and peace.",
      "He mentioned that the Pope's first trip had been to the Italian island of Lampedusa, the port of arrival in Europe for many migrants who make the perilous journey across the Mediterranean, and recalled the mass the Pope celebrated at the US-Mexico border.",
      "\"War, he said, results in the death of people and the destruction of homes, hospitals and schools. War always leaves the world worse than it was before: it is always a painful and tragic defeat for everyone.\"",
      "The cardinal emphasised that Pope Francis had repeatedly urged the world to \"build bridges, not walls\".",
      "\"It was good to hear that on a day when so many heads of state were on St Peter's Square,\" a woman called Maria told the BBC. She and her friend Grazia had flown in from Sardinia especially for the funeral.",
      "\"It was a message especially for them, I think, because it's them who decide whether there's going to be war or peace, not us... Let's hope something made it through to them.\"",
      "\"Otherwise them being here was just pure hypocrisy,\" added Grazia.",
      "During communion, a procession of white-clad priests made its way down St Peter's Square, carrying golden chalices full of wafers for communion, as many in the large crowd moved forward to receive the hosts.",
      "Soon after, Cardinal Re blessed the Pope's coffin with holy water, before burning incense in a thurible - a symbol of cleansing - and the basilica's bells tolled three times after the blessing of the coffin was carried out.",
      "After some brief mingling, world leaders started making their way out of the basilica. Their motorcades then filed out of the Vatican.",
      "Within an hour Trump was reported to be back on Air Force One, while other leaders held various informal meetings in Rome.",
      "Meanwhile, the Pope's coffin was carried through Rome in a slow procession to the church of Santa Maria Maggiore for burial.",
      "Authorities said 140,000 had lined the streets, clapping and waving as the hearse \u2013 a repurposed white popemobile \u2013 crossed the Tiber river and drove past some of Rome's most recognisable sights: the Colosseum, the Forum and the Altare della Patria national monument on Piazza Venezia.",
      "Once the coffin reached Santa Maria Maggiore, it was taken inside and the live broadcast ceased.",
      "Pope Francis was buried in the righthand side of the church, near a beloved icon of the Virgin Mary, at around 15:00.",
      "Visitors, pilgrims and the clergy vacated St Peter's Square quickly. Many could be seen minutes later in the numerous cafes, restaurants and pizzerias of the historic Borgo Pio neighbourhood nearby.",
      "Grazia from Sardinia said the funeral had made a big impression on her.",
      "\"It was wonderful to meet in a single square with people who come from every corner of the world and to live a shared moment. This is the legacy of the Pope,\" she said.",
      "Officials said the day had unfolded without any major incidents.",
      "\"Four hundred thousand people shared a historic and emotional moment, and thanks to everyone's commitment the day took place in a solemn and serene way, without critical issues,\" said the head of the Civil Protection, Fabio Ciciliano.",
      "The city of Rome and the Catholics of the world will now be preparing for the next momentous event - the conclave, which will select the next Pope.",
      "A date has not yet been set but it is thought it could start as early as 5 or 6 May, after the Novemdiales - the mandatory nine days of mourning - are over.",
      "With 135 cardinals set to attend, it will be the largest conclave in modern history and one of the most unpredictable.",
      "Over the past few days, cardinals wandering around Rome were hounded by journalists trying to get a steer on what the conclave might yield.",
      "After the funeral, too, the Cardinal of Tonga Soane Patita Paini Mafi was approached by the media as he made his way out of St Peter's Square.",
      "After a South American pope, is it time for an Asian one, he was asked.",
      "Cardinal Mafi laughed and pointed to the sky. \"Only He knows,\" he said."

      "\"We're pretty financially secure - but I worry about them,\" said Eric Gionet. While he and his wife could buy their first home while young, he said, \"there's no prospect\" their children will be able to do the same.",
      "\"I'm excited to be here,\" said Carri Gionet. \"I'm hopeful.\"",
      "Tapping into voter frustration has helped opposition parties sweep governments from power in democracies around the world. Canada seemed almost certain to follow suit.",
      "Last year, the Conservatives held a 20-point lead in national polls over the governing Liberals for months. Poilievre's future as the country's next prime minister seemed baked in.",
      "Then a series of shockwaves came in quick succession at the start of 2025, upending the political landscape: Justin Trudeau's resignation, Carney's subsequent rise to Liberal leader and prime minister; and the return of Trump to the White House with the threats and tariffs that followed.",
      "By the time the election was called in mid-March, Carney's Liberals were polling neck-and-neck with the Conservatives, and by early April they had pulled slightly ahead, national surveys suggest.",
      "It has been a stunning reversal of fortunes. Seemingly dead and buried, the Liberals now believe they could win a fourth successive election, and even a majority in Parliament.",
      "Carney is pitching himself as the man most ready to meet this critical moment - a steady central banker who helped shepherd Canada's economy through the 2008 financial crisis and later, the UK through Brexit.",
      "For Conservative voter Gwendolyn Slover, 69, from Summerside in the province of Prince Edward Island, his appeal is \"baffling\".",
      "\"Many people think Mark Carney is some kind of Messiah,\" she said. \"It's the same party, he's one person. And he's not going to change anything.\"",
      "For Carney's supporters, they see a strong resume and a poise that has calmed their anxieties over Trump's threats of steep tariffs and repeated suggestions the country should become the 51st US state - though the president has been commenting less frequently on Canada during the campaign.",
      "\"I'm very impressed by the stability and the serious thought process of Mark Carney,\" said Mike Brennan from Kitchener, Ontario, as he stood in line to meet the Liberal leader at a coffee shop in Cambridge, about an hour outside Toronto.",
      "Mr Brennan is a \"lifelong Liberal\" who did not initially plan to vote for the party in this election because of his dislike for Trudeau.",
      "The departure of former prime minister Trudeau, who had grown increasingly unpopular over his decade in power, released \"a massive pressure valve\", said Shachi Kurl, president of the Angus Reid Institute, a non-profit public opinion research organisation.",
      "\"All of these angry Liberals who are either parking their votes with the [left-wing] NDP or parking their votes with the Conservatives start re-coalescing,\" she said.",
      "Then more disaffected Liberals and other progressive voters began to migrate towards Carney's Liberals, driven by Trump, this election's \"main character\", Ms Kurl said.",
      "\"The threats, the annexation talk, all of that has been a huge motivator for left of centre voters.\"",
      "It has worked to Carney's advantage, with Trump's tariffs threats giving the political neophyte - he is the first prime minister to have never held elected public office - the chance to publicly audition to keep his job during the campaign.",
      "Trump's late-March announcement of global levies on foreign automobile imports allowed Carney to step away from the trail and take on the prime minister's mantle, setting up a call with the president and meeting US Cabinet ministers.",
      "He's never been tested in a gruelling federal election campaign, with its relentless travel, high-pressure demands for retail politics and daily media scrutiny. Yet on the campaign trail, and in the high-stakes debate with party leaders, he is considered to have performed well.",
      "Poilievre, in contrast, is a veteran politician and polished performer. But on the shifting political ground, Conservatives appeared to struggle to find their footing, pivoting their message from Canada being broken to \"Canada First\".",
      "Poilievre had to fend off criticism from political rivals that he is \"Trump lite\", with his combative style, his vows to end \"woke ideology\", and willingness to take on the \"global elite\".",
      "\"I have a completely different story from Donald Trump,\" he has said.",

      "Malnutrition is also rapidly worsening, according to the UN. Last week, one of its humanitarian partners screened 1,300 children in northern Gaza and identified more than 80 cases of acute malnutrition - a two-fold increase from previous weeks.",
      "The UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) says there are also severe shortages of medicine, medical supplies and equipment for hospitals overwhelmed by casualties from the Israeli bombardment, and that fuel shortages are hampering water production and distribution.",

      "Food prices had skyrocketed by up to 1,400% compared to during the ceasefire, and the shortages of essential commodities raised serious nutrition concerns for vulnerable populations, including children under five, pregnant and breastfeeding women, and the elderly, it warned.",
      "\"The situation inside the Gaza Strip has once again reached a breaking point: people are running out of ways to cope, and the fragile gains made during the short ceasefire have unravelled. Without urgent action to open borders for aid and trade to enter, WFP's critical assistance may be forced to end,\" the agency said.",
      "\"WFP urges all parties to prioritize the needs of civilians and allow aid to enter Gaza immediately and uphold their obligations under international humanitarian law.\"",

      "It also said Israel was not obliged to allow in aid because Hamas had \"hijacked\" supplies \"to rebuild its terror machine\".",

    "story": [
      "Federal agents arrested a Wisconsin judge and charged her with obstruction for allegedly trying to help an undocumented immigrant evade arrest.",
      "Announcing her arrest, FBI director Kash Patel accused Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Hannah Dugan of \"intentionally misdirecting\" immigration agents away from a Mexican man they were trying to arrest last week.",
      "\"Thankfully our agents chased down the perp on foot and he's been in custody since, but the Judge's obstruction created increased danger to the public,\" Patel wrote on X.",
      "During a preliminary court hearing on Friday, Dugan's lawyer said she \"wholeheartedly regrets and protests her arrest. It was not made in the interest of public safety\".",
      "The judge has been charged with obstruction and concealing an individual to avoid arrest, and faces a maximum of six years in prison if convicted on both charges.",
      "Dugan was released on her own recognisance pending a hearing on 15 May.",
      "The charges stem from events that played out in Dugan's courtroom last week.",
      "On 17 April, an immigration judge issued a warrant for the arrest of Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, a Mexican national facing three misdemeanour battery counts stemming from a domestic fight, according to court documents filed in the case by the FBI.",
      "The following day, Flores-Ruiz appeared in the Milwaukee court for a scheduled hearing, and six officers from US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice), the FBI and the Drug Enforcement Agency arrived at the courthouse to make the arrest.",
      "The agents identified themselves to court officials and waited outside Dugan's courtroom, but according to the FBI affidavit, the judge became \"visibly angry, commented that the situation was 'absurd,' left the bench, and entered chambers\" when she learned of their presence.",
      "In the hallway outside the court, Dugan and the unnamed agents then argued over the type of arrest warrant that had been issued, before the judge instructed them to report to the office of the county's chief judge.",
      "While several agents were in the office, affidavit says, the judge ushered Flores-Ruiz and his lawyer to a side door meant for jury members leading out of the courtroom.",
      "But two agents remained near the courtroom and spotted Flores-Ruiz attempting to escape, the affidavit says.",
      "Flores-Ruiz, who authorities say had previously been deported from the US in 2013, managed to exit the courthouse but was arrested just minutes later after a short foot chase.",
      "Dugan's arrest came one day after a former judge in New Mexico was taken into custody accused of harbouring an alleged Venezuelan gang member in his home.",
      "\"I think some of these judges think they are beyond and above the law and they are not,\" Attorney General Pam Bondi told Fox News in an interview on Friday.",
      "\"And if you are destroying evidence, if you are obstructing justice, when you have victims sitting in a courtroom of domestic violence, and you're escorting a criminal defendant out a back door, it will not be tolerated.\"",
      "Reaction to the arrest largely split along partisan lines.",
      "Wisconsin Senator Tammy Baldwin, a Democrat, called it a \"gravely serious and drastic move\".",
      "\"Make no mistake, we do not have kings in this country and we are a democracy governed by laws that everyone must abide by,\" Baldwin said in a statement. \"By relentlessly attacking the judicial system, flouting court orders, and arresting a sitting judge, this President is putting those basic democratic values that Wisconsinites hold dear on the line.\"",
      "Milwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson also criticised the arrest, calling it \"showboating\" and warned that it would have a \"chilling effect\" on court proceedings.",
      "Wisconsin's Republican US Senator, Ron Johnson, told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: \"I would advise everyone to cooperate with federal law enforcement and not endanger them and the public by obstructing their efforts to arrest criminals and illegal aliens.\"",
      "Dugan was first elected as a judge in 2016, and was re-elected to a second six-year term in 2022.",
      "Judicial elections in Wisconsin are non-partisan, however Dugan was endorsed by Milwaukee's Democratic mayor.",
      "The obstruction charge carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine, while the concealment charges can be punished by up to one year in prison and a $100,000 fine.",
      "In 2019, during the first Trump administration, a judge in Massachusetts was arrested after she allowed an undocumented immigrant defendant to retrieve property from a lockup in the courtroom. The immigrant then left the courtroom.",
      "Judge Shelley M Richmond Joseph was charged with obstruction, but the charges were dropped in 2022, although she still faces an ongoing ethics complaint stemming from the incident."

      "On Friday, businesswomen told the BBC that some fellow traders had been arrested on the second day of a ban imposed by Tanzania on all agricultural imports from Malawi and South Africa.",
      "\"My bananas were seized and destroyed. Right now, our business has brought losses, and we only have a little money left,\" said Jestina Chanya, a trader in Karongo, about 50km (30 miles) from the border with Tanzania.",
      "Diplomatic efforts to address the dispute have failed but Tanzania's agriculture minister said fresh talks were ongoing.",
      "Last month, Malawi blocked imports of flour, rice, ginger, bananas and maize from Tanzania, and other countries, saying this was to protect local producers.",
      "South Africa has for years prohibited the entry of bananas from Tanzania.",
      "On Thursday, Tanzania's Agriculture Minister Hussein Bashe said trade restrictions from those two countries \"directly affected\" traders from his country and described the trade barrier as \"unfair and harmful\".",
      "Bashe announced an immediate ban on all agricultural imports from the two countries, \"to protect our business interests\".",
      "Trade flows have been greatly affected at Kasumulu \u2013 the official border crossing between Tanzania and Malawi.",
      "When the BBC visited the Malawian town of Karonga, traders - mostly women - said they were still shaken by the sight of tonnes of their produce slowly rotting, then ultimately being dumped after being denied entry into Tanzania.",
      "\"The losses I have incurred are big because I can't go buy anything any more, and I don't even know how I will feed my children,\" said June Mwamwaja.",
      "But Tanzanian traders have also been hit.",
      "On Saturday Tanzania's agriculture minister posted a video on social media showing a pile of rotten bananas in a truck which had been prevented from entering Malawi.",
      "Tonnes of tomatoes also spoiled at the border recently after lorries from Tanzania were denied entry into Malawi.",
      "Malawian traders like Jeniffa Mshani said they preferred agricultural goods from Tanzania because it was easier and more affordable to source them across the border.",
      "\"Tanzanian products are big and sell very well in the market, and their prices are good. Our local [Malawi] products are more expensive. I have nothing to do - I don't have the capacity to compete with those [who have big capital]. I just can't,\" she told the BBC.",
      "They said Tanzanian produce, especially potatoes, were larger and of better quality.",
      "Others said their customers preferred Tanzanian plantains over Malawian ones, describing the former as tastier, while the latter were often spongy.",
      "But since Thursday, Malawian authorities, both at the border and in nearby markets, have become increasingly strict \u2013 often arresting traders found with Tanzanian produce.",
      "\"When we bring goods from Tanzania, they turn us back. One of us was stopped and arrested right at the border,\" another trader said.",
      "Some of them said they had no idea why they were being blocked while some rich business people were still allowed to transport goods across the border.",
      "\"They are targeting us who have little capital, while those with big money are still bringing in goods,\" said Ms Chanya, who sells potatoes and bananas in Karonga market.",
      "Following the crackdown, some traders have resorted to selling their goods in secret, afraid to display them openly for fear of arrest.",
      "\"We only carry three or four bunches [of bananas], just to earn a living for the children,\" said Evelina Mwakijungu, adding: \"But our large consignments have been blocked, so we have no business - we're struggling with our families\".",
      "The normally bustling border crossing of Kasumulu remained noticeably quieter than usual with  drivers seen relaxing in the shade of trees, while others played draughts or lounged in the back of their lorries.",
      "They declined to be quoted directly but explained that they were simply waiting for word from their bosses on what to do next.",
      "On a normal day, more than 15 lorries loaded with agricultural produce would cross the border, drivers told the BBC.",
      "Malawi's trade ministry spokesperson Patrick Botha told local media that they were yet to get official communication on the issue.",
      "\"We are hearing [about] this from social media. At an appropriate time, we will comment,\" he was quoted as saying.",
      "Malawi has become an increasingly important market for Tanzanian goods in recent years, with exports trebling between 2018 and 2023, according to official Tanzanian figures.",
      "But landlocked Malawi, which has relied on Tanzanian ports to carry its exports such as tobacco, sugar and soybeans to the rest of the world, will have to reroute its goods.",
      "It is not yet clear how hard South Africa, which exports various fruits, including apples and grapes, to Tanzania, will be hit by the ban. South African authorities are yet to comment.",
      "The row comes at a time when Africa is supposed to be moving towards greater free trade through the establishment of a continent-wide free-trade area, which began operating four years ago.",

    "summary": "More and more Australians, regardless of where they live, are delaying or going without the care they need.",
    "story": [
      "From an office perched on the scalloped edge of the continent, Victoria Bradley jokes that she has the most beautiful doctor's practice in Australia.",
      "Outside her window, farmland rolls into rocky coastline, hemming a glasslike bay striped with turquoise and populated by showboating dolphins.",
      "Home to about 3,000 people, a few shops, two roundabouts and a tiny hospital, Streaky Bay is an idyllic beach town.",
      "For Dr Bradley, though, it is anything but. The area's sole, permanent doctor, she spent years essentially on call 24/7.",
      "Running the hospital and the general practitioner (GP) clinic, life was a never-ending game of catch up. She'd do rounds at the wards before, after and in between regular appointments. Even on good days, lunch breaks were often a pipe dream. On bad days, a hospital emergency would blow up her already punishing schedule.",
      "Burnt out, two years ago she quit \u2013 and the thread holding together the remnants of the town's healthcare system snapped.",
      "Streaky Bay is at the forefront of a national crisis: inadequate government funding is exacerbating a shortage of critical healthcare workers like Dr Bradley; wait times are ballooning; doctors are beginning to write their own rules on fees, and costs to patients are skyrocketing.",
      "A once-revered universal healthcare system is crumbling at every level, sometimes barely getting by on the sheer willpower of doctors and local communities.",
      "As a result, more and more Australians, regardless of where they live, are delaying or going without the care they need.",
      "Health has become a defining issue for voters ahead of the nation's election on 3 May, with both of Australia's major parties promising billions of dollars in additional funding.",
      "But experts say the solutions being offered up are band-aid fixes, while what is needed are sweeping changes to the way the system is funded \u2013 reform for which there has so far been a lack of political will.",
      "Australians tell the BBC the country is at a crossroads, and needs to decide if universal healthcare is worth saving.",
      "The cracks in a 'national treasure'",
      "Healthcare was the last thing on Renee Elliott's mind when she moved to Streaky Bay - until the 40-year-old found a cancerous lump in her breast in 2019, and another one four years later.",
      "Seeing a local GP was the least of her problems. With the expertise and treatment she needed only available in Adelaide, about 500km away, Mrs Elliott has spent hundreds of hours and tens of thousands of dollars accessing life-saving care, all while raising three boys and running a business.",
      "Though she has since clawed back a chunk of the cost through government schemes, it made an already harrowing time that much more draining: financially, emotionally and physically.",
      "\"You're trying to get better\u2026 but having to juggle all that as well. It was very tricky.\"",
      "When Australia's modern health system was born four decades ago \u2013 underpinned by a public insurance scheme called Medicare \u2013 it was supposed to guarantee affordable and accessible high-quality care to people like Mrs Elliott as \"a basic right\".",
      "Health funding here is complex and shared between states and federal governments. But the scheme essentially meant Australians could present their bright green Medicare member card at a doctor's office or hospital, and Canberra would be sent a bill. It paid through rebates funded by taxes.",
      "Patients would either receive \"bulk billed\" \u2013 completely free \u2013 care, mostly through the emerging public system, or heavily subsidised treatment through a private healthcare sector offering more benefits and choice to those who wanted them.",
      "Medicare became a national treasure almost instantly. It was hoped this set up would combine the best parts of the UK's National Health Service and the best of the United States' system.",
      "Fast forward 40 years and many in the industry say we're on track to end up with the worst of both.",
      "There is no denying that healthcare in Australia is still miles ahead of much of the world, particularly when it comes to emergency care.",
      "But the core of the crisis and key to this election is GP services, or primary care, largely offered by private clinics. There has historically been little need for public ones, with most GPs choosing to accept Medicare rebates as full payment.",
      "That is increasingly uncommon though, with doctors saying those allowances haven't kept up with the true cost of delivering care. At the same time, staff shortages, which persist despite efforts to recruit from overseas, create a scarcity that only drives up prices further.",
      "According to government data, about 30% of patients must now pay a \"gap fee\" for a regular doctor's appointment - on average A$40 (\u00a319.25; $25.55) out of pocket.",
      "But experts suspect the true figure is higher: it's skewed by seniors and children, who tend to visit doctors more often and still enjoy mostly bulk-billed appointments. Plus there's a growing cohort of patients not captured by statistics, who simply don't go to the doctor because of escalating fees.",
      "Brisbane electrician Callum Bailey is one of them.",
      "\"Mum or my partner will pester and pester and pester\u2026 [but] I'm such a big 'I'll just suffer in silence' person because it's very expensive.\"",
      "And every dollar counts right now, the 25-year-old says: \"At my age, I probably should be in my prime looking for housing\u2026 [but] even grocery shopping is nuts.",
      "\"[I] just can't keep up.\"",
      "The year the Australian Dream died",
      "Australia's looming election brings housing crisis into focus",
      "This is a tale James Gillespie kept hearing.",
      "So his startup Cleanbill began asking the question: if the average Australian adult walked into a GP clinic, could they get a free, standard appointment?",
      "This year, they called almost all of the nation's estimated 7,000 GP clinics \u2013 only a fifth of them would bulk bill a new adult patient. In the entire state of Tasmania, for example, they couldn't find a single one.",
      "The results resonate with many Australians, he says: \"It really brought it home to them that, 'Okay, it's not just us. This is happening nationwide'.\"",
      "And that's just primary care.",
      "Public specialists are so rare and so overwhelmed \u2013 with wait times often far beyond safe levels \u2013 that most patients are funnelled toward exorbitantly expensive private care. The same goes for a lot of non-emergency hospital treatments or dental work.",
      "There are currently no caps on how much private specialists, dentists or hospitals can charge and neither private health insurance nor slim Medicare rebates reliably offer substantial relief.",
      "Priced out of care",
      "The BBC spoke to people across the country who say the increasing cost of healthcare had left them relying on charities for food, avoiding dental care for almost a decade, or emptying their retirement savings to fund treatment.",
      "Others are borrowing from their parents, taking out pay-day loans to buy medication, remortgaging their houses, or selling their possessions.",
      "Kimberley Grima regularly lies awake at night, calculating which of her three children \u2013 who, like her, all have chronic illnesses \u2013 can see their specialists. Her own overdue health checks and tests are barely an afterthought.",
      "\"They're decisions that you really don't want to have to make,\" the Aboriginal woman from New South Wales tells the BBC.",
      "\"But when push comes to shove and you haven't got the money\u2026 you've got no other option. It's heart-breaking.\"",
      "Another woman tells the BBC that had she been able to afford timely appointments, her multiple sclerosis, a degenerative neurological disease, would have been identified, and slowed, quicker.",
      "\"I was so disabled by the time I got a diagnosis,\" she says.",
      "The people missing out tend to be the ones who need it the most, experts say.",
      "\"We have much more care in healthier, wealthier parts of Australia than in poorer, sicker parts of Australia,\" Peter Breadon, from the Grattan Institute think tank says.",
      "All of this creates a vicious cycle which feeds even more pressure back into an overwhelmed system, while entrenching disadvantage and fuelling distrust.",
      "Every single one of those issues is more acute in the regions.",
      "Streaky Bay has long farewelled the concept of affordable healthcare, fighting instead to preserve access to any at all.",
      "It's why Dr Bradley lasted only three months after quitting before \"guilt\" drove her back to the practice.",
      "\"There's a connection that goes beyond just being the GP... You are part of the community.",
      "\"I felt that I'd let [them] down. Which was why I couldn't just let go.\"",
      "She came back to a far more sustainable three-day week in the GP clinic, with Streaky Bay forced to wage a bidding war with other desperate regions for pricey, fly-in-fly-out doctors to fill in the gaps.",
      "It's yet another line on the tab for a town which has already invested so much of its own money into propping up a healthcare system supposed to be funded by state and private investment.",
      "\"We don't want a gold service, but what we want is an equitable service,\" says Penny Williams, who helps run the community body which owns the GP practice.",
      "When the clinic was on the verge of closure, the town desperately rallied to buy it. When it was struggling again, the local council diverted funding from other areas to top up its coffers. And even still most standard patients \u2013 unless they are seniors or children \u2013 fork out about A$50 per appointment.",
      "It means locals are paying for their care three times over, Ms Williams says: through their Medicare taxes, council rates, and then out-of-pocket gap fees.",
      "Who should foot the bill?",
      "\"No-one would say this is the Australia that we want, surely,\" Elizabeth Deveny, from the Consumers Health Forum of Australia, tells the BBC.",
      "Like many wealthy countries, the nation is struggling to cope with a growing population which is, on average, getting older and sicker.",
      "There's a small but increasing cohort which says it is time to let go of the notion of universal healthcare, as we've known it.",
      "Many doctors, a handful of economists, and some conservative politicians have sought to redefine Medicare as a \"safety net\" for the nation's most vulnerable rather than as a scheme for all.",
      "Health economist Yuting Zhang argues free healthcare and universal healthcare are different things.",
      "The taxes the government collects for Medicare are already nowhere near enough to support the system, she says, and the country either needs to have some tough conversations about how it will find additional funds, or accept reasonable fees for those who can afford them.",
      "\"There's always a trade-off... You have limited resources, you have to think about how to use them effectively and efficiently.\"",
      "The original promise of Medicare has been \"undermined by decades of neglect\", the Australian Medical Association's Danielle McMullen says, and most Australians now accept they need to contribute to their own care.",
      "She says freezes to Medicare rebates \u2013 which were overseen by both parties between 2013 and 2017 and meant the payments didn't even keep up with inflation \u2013 were the last straw. Since then, many doctors have been dipping into their own pockets to help those in need.",
      "Both the Labor Party and the Liberal-National coalition accept there is a crisis, but blame each other for it.",
      "Opposition leader Peter Dutton says his government will invest A$9bn in health, including funds for extra subsidised mental health appointments and for regional universities training key workers.",
      "\"Health has become another victim of Labor's cost of living crisis... we know it has literally never been harder or more expensive to see a GP than it is right now,\" health spokesperson Anne Ruston told the BBC in a statement.",
      "On the other side, Albanese - whipping out his Medicare card almost daily - has sought to remind voters that Labor created the beloved system, while pointing out the Coalition's previously mixed support of the universal scheme and the spending cuts Dutton proposed as Health Minister a decade ago.",
      "\"At this election, this little card here, your Medicare card, is what is at stake,\" Albanese has said.",
      "His government has started fixing things already, he argues, and has pledged an extra A$8.5bn for training more GPs, building additional public clinics, and subsidising more medicines.",
      "But the headline of their rescue packages is an increase to Medicare rebates and bigger bonuses for doctors who bulk bill.",
      "Proposed by Labor, then matched by the Coalition, the changes will make it possible for 9 out of 10 Australians to see a GP for free, the parties claim.",
      "One Tasmanian doctor tells the BBC it is just a \"good election sound bite\". He and many other clinicians say the extra money is still not enough, particularly for the longer consults more and more patients are seeking for complex issues.",
      "Labor has little patience for those criticisms, citing research which they claim shows their proposal will leave the bulk of doctors better off and accusing them of wanting investment \"without strings attached\".",
      "But many of the patients the BBC spoke to are sceptical either parties' proposals will make a huge difference.",
      "There's far more they need to be doing, they say, rattling off a wish list: more work on training and retaining rural doctors; effective regulation of private fees and more investment in public specialist clinics; universal bulk billing of children for all medical and dental expenses; more funding for allied health and prevention.",
      "Experts like Mr Breadon say, above all else, the way Medicare pays clinicians needs to be overhauled to keep healthcare access genuinely universal.",
      "That is, the government needs to stop paying doctors a set amount per appointment, and give them a budget based on how large and sick the populations they serve are \u2013 that is something several recent reviews have said.",
      "And the longer governments wait to invest in these reforms, the more they're going to cost.",
      "\"The stars may be aligning now... It is time for these changes, and delaying them would be really dangerous,\" Mr Breadon says.",
      "In Streaky Bay though, locals like Ms Williams wonder if it's too late. Things are already dangerous here.",
      "\"Maybe that's the cynic in me,\" she says, shaking her head.",
      "\"The definition of universal is everyone gets the same, but we know that's not true already.\"",

    "story": [
      "Democrats have struggled to land a unified message in President Donald Trump's first months in office, with fractures both in Congress and among supporters. What comes next for a party in a difficult spot?",
      "The rural, agricultural town of Bakersfield, California, is an odd stop for a pair of East Coast progressive politicians.",
      "After all, Trump won the surrounding county by 20 points in the last election, and the dusty fields and endless orchards feel a world away from the party's power centres in Los Angeles and the Bay Area.",
      "Yet Democratic Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Independent Senator Bernie Sanders packed a local auditorium during a recent stop on their Fighting Oligarchy tour. The rally felt like a 1960s-style sit-in with attendees singing along to a gentle rendition of Woody Guthrie's This Land is Your Land. They launched rowdy boos and jeers every time Sanders inveighed against Trump and tech billionaire Elon Musk.",
      "The visit also felt like an answered prayer for local Democrats and left-leaning Independents who oppose Trump and his policies, while directing much of their fury at their own party, which they feel has failed to mount an effective opposition.",
      "The Democratic party \"should be doing more to try to protect everybody,\" said Karla Alcantar, 26, who attended the rally. \"I feel like some of them have just folded over completely, and there are some that are trying to do the work of all.\"",
      "\"I definitely feel like they should be doing way more,\" she said.",
      "Democrats at a crossroads",
      "It is not a great time to be a Democratic politician in the United States. The party is out of power. Elected officials cannot agree on a course of action to counter Trump's agenda. No clear leader has emerged to unify the unwieldy coalition. Various ideological and generational factions are warring against each other and nobody seems to be winning.",
      "\"I understand that they don't have the power to, like, change like things drastically, but they do have the power to slow down like things even a little bit,\" said rally attendee Juan Dominguez, 26. \"It honestly feels like I'm not seeing any of that.\"",
      "The anger extends beyond the rally-goers.",
      "Fifty-two percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said their party's leadership is moving in the wrong direction, according to a CNN/SSRS poll conducted in mid-March, as opposed to 48% who said it is moving in the right direction.",
      "That same survey suggested a desire for strong opposition: 57% wanted Democrats in Congress to try and stop the Republican party's agenda. It's a complete reversal of a poll in 2017, the year after Trump first won the presidency, that suggested 74% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents wanted leaders to work with Republicans following a divisive election.",
      "\"What they're pressing for is not just Democratic leaders to lash out because that's going to make their followers feel good,\" said former Pennsylvania congressman Conor Lamb, who held a town hall-style event in Pittsburgh last week.",
      "Though Lamb said he is not currently running for office, he felt a hunger within the Democratic base.",
      "\"I think they feel like the survival of the system we have all counted on is itself on the line, and they want us to act with that level of urgency,\" Lamb told the BBC. \"I think it's important for us not to forget just to be advocates for things that are specific and concrete, and really affecting people.\"",
      "Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez's tour is just one attempt to solve that. It stops in conservative-dominated areas and remains laser-focused on the economy, citing cost of living grievances that propelled Trump to a second term, while framing him and his billionaire supporters like Musk as the culprits.",
      "Ocasio-Cortez put the argument simply: \"Oligarchy or democracy?\"",
      "But the Fighting Oligarchy tour is only one theory about how the Democratic Party should evolve.",
      "\"It is completely normal when a party loses, especially the presidency, for there to be this period of soul searching and asking, 'What's next?'\" said Professor Christian Grose, a political scientist at the University of Southern California.",
      "Some Democrats accused their party of falling out of step with more conservative Americans on subjects like transgender rights, or failing to accommodate diverse viewpoints within the party's ideological spectrum. Without widening their potential base, these Democrats argue, they stand little chance of regaining power.",
      "One such gambit by California Governor Gavin Newsom involves moving the party's branding more to the center. Though Newsom has long brushed off White House ambitions, he is among a new generation of Democrats who could vie for the presidency in 2028.",
      "The governor, known nationwide as a liberal defender of abortion and LGBTQ rights, recently launched a podcast to host conversations with politicos who disagree with him.",
      "Newsom's decision to interview right-wing strategist Steve Bannon infuriated many Democrats.",
      "\"I think it's important to have difficult conversations or even have a civil conversation that may be difficult for people to listen to, because everyone is out there trying to tear each other down,\" Newsom said at a recent press conference.",
      "New guard or old guard?",
      "While such debates over whether to moderate or play to the base feature in every party's soul-searching, this year does have a new twist, Mr Grose noted.",
      "\"Some of the questions for the Democrats' strategy is the age question - is it time for a new generation? That is a little unique,\" he said.",

      "\"I'm excited to be here,\" said Carri Gionet. \"I'm hopeful.\"",
      "Tapping into voter frustration has helped opposition parties sweep governments from power in democracies around the world. Canada seemed almost certain to follow suit.",
      "Last year, the Conservatives held a 20-point lead in national polls over the governing Liberals for months. Poilievre's future as the country's next prime minister seemed baked in.",
      "Then a series of shockwaves came in quick succession at the start of 2025, upending the political landscape: Justin Trudeau's resignation, Carney's subsequent rise to Liberal leader and prime minister; and the return of Trump to the White House with the threats and tariffs that followed.",
      "By the time the election was called in mid-March, Carney's Liberals were polling neck-and-neck with the Conservatives, and by early April they had pulled slightly ahead, national surveys suggest.",
      "It has been a stunning reversal of fortunes. Seemingly dead and buried, the Liberals now believe they could win a fourth successive election, and even a majority in Parliament.",
      "Carney is pitching himself as the man most ready to meet this critical moment - a steady central banker who helped shepherd Canada's economy through the 2008 financial crisis and later, the UK through Brexit.",
      "For Conservative voter Gwendolyn Slover, 69, from Summerside in the province of Prince Edward Island, his appeal is \"baffling\".",
      "\"Many people think Mark Carney is some kind of Messiah,\" she said. \"It's the same party, he's one person. And he's not going to change anything.\"",
      "For Carney's supporters, they see a strong resume and a poise that has calmed their anxieties over Trump's threats of steep tariffs and repeated suggestions the country should become the 51st US state - though the president has been commenting less frequently on Canada during the campaign.",
      "\"I'm very impressed by the stability and the serious thought process of Mark Carney,\" said Mike Brennan from Kitchener, Ontario, as he stood in line to meet the Liberal leader at a coffee shop in Cambridge, about an hour outside Toronto.",
      "Mr Brennan is a \"lifelong Liberal\" who did not initially plan to vote for the party in this election because of his dislike for Trudeau.",
      "The departure of former prime minister Trudeau, who had grown increasingly unpopular over his decade in power, released \"a massive pressure valve\", said Shachi Kurl, president of the Angus Reid Institute, a non-profit public opinion research organisation.",
      "\"All of these angry Liberals who are either parking their votes with the [left-wing] NDP or parking their votes with the Conservatives start re-coalescing,\" she said.",
      "Then more disaffected Liberals and other progressive voters began to migrate towards Carney's Liberals, driven by Trump, this election's \"main character\", Ms Kurl said.",
      "\"The threats, the annexation talk, all of that has been a huge motivator for left of centre voters.\"",
      "It has worked to Carney's advantage, with Trump's tariffs threats giving the political neophyte - he is the first prime minister to have never held elected public office - the chance to publicly audition to keep his job during the campaign.",
      "Trump's late-March announcement of global levies on foreign automobile imports allowed Carney to step away from the trail and take on the prime minister's mantle, setting up a call with the president and meeting US Cabinet ministers.",
      "He's never been tested in a gruelling federal election campaign, with its relentless travel, high-pressure demands for retail politics and daily media scrutiny. Yet on the campaign trail, and in the high-stakes debate with party leaders, he is considered to have performed well.",
      "Poilievre, in contrast, is a veteran politician and polished performer. But on the shifting political ground, Conservatives appeared to struggle to find their footing, pivoting their message from Canada being broken to \"Canada First\".",
      "Poilievre had to fend off criticism from political rivals that he is \"Trump lite\", with his combative style, his vows to end \"woke ideology\", and willingness to take on the \"global elite\".",

    "story": [
      "A young female South African doctor has sparked a nationwide conversation about a form of domestic abuse often shrouded in silence - financial abuse.",
      "In a series of viral videos Dr Celiwe Ndaba opened up about how she said she had been financially exploited by her husband, how it had spiralled and led to their separation.",
      "Often sitting in her car on her way to work, the mother of three vlogged over two weeks about how despite her successful career she had become trapped in a toxic marriage for years, feeling manipulated to fund her husband's lifestyle - in particular his desire to drive a Mercedes Benz.",
      "Taking out loans for him to buy such vehicles was the \"worst decision\" of her life, putting the family under huge financial pressure, said Dr Ndaba - who since sharing her story has reverted to using her maiden name and the number of her followers has ballooned.",
      "Despite pleas for her husband to downgrade, she said he refused - accusing her of wanting to \"turn him into a laughing stock by making him drive a small car\".",
      "The medic said she was speaking out as she wanted to issue a warning to others - that it was not only \"uneducated\" and \"less fortunate\" women who find themselves in abusive relationships.",
      "Her estranged husband, Temitope Dada, has not responded to a BBC request for comment.",
      "In the wake of the social media storm, he set up a TikTok account, where in one of his first videos he acknowledged: \"You may know me as\u2026 'Mr Benz or nothing.'\"",
      "The few posts he has made are accompanied by hashtags such as #divorcetrauma - saying the accusations are lies.",
      "Nonetheless, the comments section on Dr Ndaba's TikTok and other social media platforms have transformed into support groups, filled with female breadwinners sharing eerily similar stories.",
      "\"You are brave to speak out so publicly\u2026 I have been suffering in silence,\" one person commented.",
      "Bertus Preller, a lawyer based in Cape Town, believes this is because although South African women are becoming doctors, lawyers and entrepreneurs, getting well-paid jobs does not necessarily free them from the clutches of the patriarchy.",
      "Women's financial independence clashes with \"cultural norms that prioritise male authority\", he says.",
      "If anything, their success appears to make them targets.",
      "Financial abuse occurs when one partner dominates or exploits the other's financial resources, the lawyer explains.",
      "\"It is a subtle yet potent tactic of domestic violence, aimed at keeping the victim under control,\" he says.",
      "In South Africa, this is legally classified as economic abuse under the Domestic Violence Act.",
      "Mr Preller says things like \"unjustly withholding money for essentials or interfering with shared assets,\" are covered by the act.",
      "A university lecturer, who requested anonymity, told the BBC how her husband had lied about his qualifications and eventually left her in financial ruin.",
      "It started with her car that he mostly drove but never refuelled. Then loans she took out for his multiple failed business ventures. Finally, there came an eviction notice as she said he had stopped contributing towards rent, leaving her to shoulder all the expenses for their family, which included three children.",
      "Despite this, they stayed together for close to a decade - even though he was also physically abusive.",
      "\"He's very smart... I was in love with his smartness, his big dreams. But he couldn't follow them up with actions. His pride was his downfall,\" she said.",
      "Even when he managed to get some money, he still did not contribute.",
      "\"He started withholding whatever money he had for himself. He'd go out drinking with his friends, come back - the salary is gone,\" she said.",
      "Legal financial expert Somila Gogoba says that beyond the control of money, financial abuse often has deep psychological roots.",
      "\"For the abuser, this behaviour may stem from feelings of inadequacy, fear of abandonment, or the need for dominance,\" she told the BBC.",
      "\"For the victim, the psychological impact includes feelings of worthlessness, fear, and dependence, which can be paralysing.\"",
      "Research from the University of South Africa suggests these are not isolated cases \u2013 and that women who out-earn their partners face significantly higher risks of intimate partner violence.",
      "Out of their in-depth study of 10 women who were the primary breadwinners of their families, only two were married.",
      "\"For eight of the participants, their choice of being single resulted from their experiences of physical, emotional and sexual violence\u2026 All the women said they believed that their role as female breadwinners was viewed as threatening to the traditional male role of a provider,\" said researcher Bianca Parry.",
      "Ms Gogoba says female breadwinners are less valued than their male counterparts, despite their economic contributions: \"This cultural backdrop can encourage some partners to feel entitled to control the finances, even when they do not contribute equally.",
      "\"This control is not just about money - it is also about power and maintaining a grip on the relationship dynamics.\"",
      "Nombulelo Shange, sociologist lecturer at the University of the Free State, says it is part of a growing pattern in South Africa of middle-class women being financially exploited.",
      "\"Black women face a double patriarchy: Western expectations at work, traditional expectations at home. When these collide, harmful ideologies escalate,\" she told the BBC.",
      "She explained that balancing the pressures of being a successful woman, but playing the role of \"the caregiver, the mother, the good wife, the good neighbour and community member who goes to church every Sunday\", was difficult as women were always taught to tiptoe around men's egos.",
      "Since Dr Ndaba's revelations, women on social media have shared stories of giving their male partners their debit or credit cards when they go out to eat so it appears as though he is paying for the meal.",
      "For Ms Shange this shows how the burden of a happy home is often placed on the woman's shoulders.",
      "\"You think: 'If I just get them a car, they'll be happy.' Love makes you blind. When your person struggles, you struggle too - you want to fix it,\" she said.",
      "By the time the university lecturer divorced her husband, she was left with debts of 140,000 rand ($7,500; \u00a35,600) - all racked up in her name.",
      "\"Before, I could plan things like holidays. Now they are a luxury,\" she said.",
      "Dr Ndaba has been at pains to tell her followers, as she did on one vlog: \"Finance is an important aspect of people's marriages.\"",
      "The lecturer could not agree more, urging young women to take their time when getting to know their partners and have open, honest conversations.",
      "\"Talk about the finances, talk about your background, talk about emotions and character.\"",
      "Ms Gogoba urged more people to protect themselves from their partner, telling them to keep a separate bank account, keep their pins secure and monitor their credit cards.",
      "They all agreed that women should understand that love should not come with an unsustainable price tag.",

      "On a typical day, groups of school children would stare in awe at this reminder of their nation's imposing past, tourists would file through one of Khartoum's must-sees, and on occasion concerts were held in the grounds.",
      "But that was before war broke out two years ago.",
      "As the Sudanese military reasserts its control over the capital, having finally chased out its rival the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), the full scale of the destruction of two years of war is becoming clear.",
      "Government ministries, banks and office blocks stand blackened and burned, while the museum \u2013 a symbol of the nation's proud history and culture \u2013 has been particularly hard hit.",
      "Senior officials say tens of thousands of artefacts were either destroyed or shipped off to be sold during the time the RSF was in control of central Khartoum, where the museum is situated.",
      "\"They destroyed our identity, and our history,\" Ikhlas Abdel Latif Ahmed, director of museums at Sudan's National Corporation for Antiquities and Museums, told the BBC's Newsday programme.",
      "Before the conflict, the National Museum was a gem.",
      "Located at the very heart of Sudan \u2013 close to the Presidential Palace, and the confluence of the Blue Nile and White Nile rivers \u2013 it told a story of the succession of great civilisations that inhabited this area over time.",

      "\"The building was very unique and very beautiful,\" Ms Ahmed said.",
      "\"The militia [the description Sudanese officials give to the RSF] took so many of the unique and beautiful collections, and destroyed and damaged the rest.\"",
      "Looting has been reported at other Sudanese museums and ancient sites. Last September the UN's world heritage organisation, Unesco, warned of a \"threat to culture\" and urged art dealers not to import or export artefacts smuggled out of Sudan.",
      "Before the war, the National Museum was undergoing rehabilitation, and so many of its treasures were boxed up.",
      "That may have made it easier for the collections to be removed.",
      "Sudanese officials say precious artefacts from the National Museum were taken away to be sold.",
      "They strongly suspect RSF fighters took some of the valuables to the United Arab Emirates (UAE). They produced no evidence. However the UN panel of experts on Sudan has reported that the RSF has been exporting significant quantities of gold to the UAE, since even before the war.",
      "The UAE has also been widely accused of funding the RSF, although both parties have always denied these accusations.",
      "\"We had a strong room for the gold collection, they managed to open it and took all the gold,\" Ms Ahmed said.",
      "\"Maybe they kept it for themselves, or maybe they traded it in the market.\"",
      "So the whereabouts of pieces like a gold collar from the pyramid of King Talakhamani at Nuri, which dates to the 5th Century BC, are unknown.",
      "Asked about the value of what was taken, Ms Ahmed replied simply: \"There is no value for the museum artefacts, it's more expensive than you could imagine.\"",
      "The de facto government of Sudan says it will contact Interpol and Unesco to attempt to recover artefacts looted from the National Museum and elsewhere.",
      "However recovering the artefacts seems a difficult and perhaps even dangerous task, with little immediate prospect of success.",
      "The government, and other Sudanese observers, say the RSF's attacks against museums, universities and buildings like the National Records Office are a conscious attempt to destroy the Sudanese state - but, again, the RSF denies this.",
      "Amgad Farid, who runs the Fikra for Studies and Development think-tank, is particularly critical of the looting.",
      "\"The RSF's actions transcend mere criminality,\" he wrote in a piece shared by his organisation.",
      "\"They constitute a deliberate and malicious assault on Sudan's historical identity, targeting the invaluable heritage of Nubian, Coptic, and Islamic civilisations spanning over 7,000 years, constituting a cornerstone of African and global history, enshrined within these museums.",
      "\"This is not an incidental loss amid conflict - it is a calculated endeavour to erase Sudan's legacy, to sever its people from their past, and to plunder millennia of human history for profit.\"",
      "The story of the National Museum \u2013 taken over by armed men, its gold and valuables looted and stolen \u2013 mirrors the individual stories of so many Sudanese in this conflict: they have been forced to flee, their houses occupied, their gold stolen.",
      "According to the UN, nearly 13 million people have been forced from their homes since the fighting began in 2023, while an estimated 150,000 people have been killed.",
      "\"The war is against the people of Sudan,\" Ms Ahmed says, bemoaning the war's human cost, as well as the unimaginable loss of centuries of heritage.",

      "Mr Modry, a retired heart surgeon, is a co-leader of the Alberta Prosperity Project, a grassroots organisation pushing for an independence referendum.",
      "The possibility of a split has long been a talking point in this conservative-leaning province. But two factors have given it new momentum: Trump's comments about making Canada the 51st US state, and the subsequent boost that has given the Liberal Party in the polls ahead of Monday's federal election.",
      "Mr Modry told the BBC the separatist movement has grown in recent months - driven in part, he believes, by the president's rhetoric.",
      "\"We're not interested in that\", he said. \"We're interested in Alberta sovereignty.\"",
      "Jeffrey Rath, however - a lawyer and rancher from Calgary who is another of the project's co-founders - was not as dismissive of Trump's 51st state suggestion. Although he agrees independence is the priority, he could see a future where Alberta joined with the US.",

      "This sense of \"western alienation\", a term used to describe the feeling that the region is often overlooked by politicians in Canada's capital, is nothing new. For decades, many in the oil and gas-rich prairie provinces of Alberta and Saskachtewan have bemoaned how they are underrepresented, despite the region's economic significance for the country as a whole.",
      "That resentment grew under former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberal government, which brought in environmental policies some Albertans view as a direct attack on the region's economic growth.",
      "National polls suggest the Liberals, now under the leadership of Mark Carney, could be headed for their fourth consecutive win come election day on Monday. That it could come in part because of a surge of support in Ontario and Quebec - the eastern provinces where so much of the population is concentrated - only adds to the regional divide.",
      "Judy Schneider, whose husband works in the oil industry in Calgary, told the BBC she would vote \"yes\" in an independence referendum.",
      "She said she didn't see Carney, who spent much of the last decade away from Canada but was raised in Edmonton, Alberta's capital, as a westerner.",
      "\"He can come and say 'I'm from Alberta,' but is he?\" Ms Schneider said.",
      "An independent Alberta remains an unlikely prospect - a recent Angus Reid poll suggested that only one in four Albertans would vote to leave Canada if a referendum were held now. A majority of Canadians, however, feel the issue should be taken seriously, a separate Nanos poll indicated.",
      "Political analysts say the divide will pose a challenge to the country's next prime minister, especially if Carney wins. And even a victory for Calgary-born Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre would \"not solve the imbalance that presently exists between the East and the West,\" Mr Modry, the activist, said.",
      "That wider sentiment has pushed Alberta Premier Danielle Smith, who leads the United Conservative Party, to strike her own path in trade talks with the US, while other provincial leaders and the federal government have co-ordinated their efforts closely. She even visited Trump at his Mar-a-Lago home in Florida.",
      "In Canada, Smith has publicly warned of a \"national unity crisis\" if Alberta's demands - which centre around repealing Trudeau-era environmental laws to accelerate oil and gas production - are not met by the new prime minister within six months of the election.",
      "While Smith has dismissed talk of outright separation as \"nonsense\", critics have accused her of stoking the flames at such a consequential time for Canada's future.",

    "summary": "BBC Verify has looked at the agency's biggest claimed savings, examining the figures and speaking to experts.",
    "story": [
      "Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) - set up to cut US government spending - claims to have saved, on average, more than $10bn a week since President Trump entered office.",
      "\"We're talking about almost $200bn and rising fast,\" Trump told the BBC when talking about Mr Musk's cost-cutting drive on 23 April.",
      "Doge's website says it is focusing on cancelling contracts, grants and leases put in place by previous administrations, as well as tackling fraud and reducing the government workforce.",
      "BBC Verify has looked at the agency's biggest claimed savings, examining the figures and speaking to experts.",
      "Our analysis found that behind some of the large numbers, there is a lack of evidence to back them up.",
      "How does Doge report savings?",
      "In October, Mr Musk pledged to cut \"at least $2 trillion\" from the federal government budget. He subsequently halved this target and on 10 April talked about making savings of $150bn from \"cutting fraud and waste\" by the end of the next financial year in 2026.",
      "The US federal budget for the last financial year was $6.75tn.",
      "Doge publishes a running total of its estimated savings on its website - which stood at $160bn the last time the site was updated on 20 April.",
      "However, less than 40% of this figure is broken down into individual savings.",
      "We downloaded the data from the Doge website on 23 April and added up the total claimed savings from contracts, grants and leases.",
      "Our analysis found only about half of these itemised savings had a link to a document or other form of evidence.",
      "US media has also highlighted some accounting errors, including Doge mistakenly claiming to have saved $8bn from cancelling an immigration contract which in fact had a total value of $8m.",
      "Doge says it is working to upload all receipts in a \"digestible and transparent manner\" and that, as of 20 April, it has posted receipts \"representing around 30% of all total savings\". It also lists some receipts as being \"unavailable for legal reasons\".",
      "What's the evidence behind the biggest saving?",
      "BBC Verify examined the four largest savings listed on the Doge website which had receipts attached.",
      "The department claims these add up to $8.3bn, but after examining the evidence provided and speaking to people familiar with federal contracts, this figure appears to be overstated.",
      "For three of the savings, Doge links to documents on the Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS). This is a database which records contracts given out by the US government.",
      "The documents show a contract's start and end date, the maximum amount the government has agreed to spend, and how much of that has been spent.",
      "David Drabkin, a federal contracts expert who helped develop the FPDS database, said the maximum figure listed should be treated with caution.",
      "\"FPDS does not reflect the actual paid price until some period of time after the contract has been completed and the contract actions have been recorded,\" he says.",
      "\"For example, when buying research and development into a vaccine no one really knows how much that's going to cost - so when a price is set, it's not a definite price but rather an upper limit.\"",
      "So if Doge counts the maximum figure, that can represent projected spending over a number of years, rather than a direct saving from the country's yearly spending.",
      "Doge's largest listed individual saving is $2.9bn.",
      "It comes from cancelling a contract - which started in 2023 under President Biden - for a facility in Texas to house up to 3,000 unaccompanied migrant children.",
      "Doge appears to have taken the \"total contract value\" until 2028 - the end date listed - and subtracted the amount spent so far to get the $2.9bn figure.",
      "But the contract was reviewed annually, meaning renewing it until 2028 was not guaranteed.",
      "A source familiar with this contract - who spoke on condition of anonymity - told BBC Verify that Doge's figure is \"based on speculative, never-used figures\" and that the actual spending depended on how many children were placed at the facility and the services they required.",
      "\"In truth, the government never incurred those costs and could never reach that ceiling amount. The real, documentable savings from early termination were approximately $153 million\", they estimated.",
      "They say this figure comes from tallying up the $18m per month fixed running costs (for things like staffing and security at the facility) from February - when Doge announced the cut - to November - when the contract was subject to annual review.",
      "They also told us that the site - which closed on the same day as the Doge announcement  - never reached its maximum capacity of 3,000 children, and about 2,000 stayed at the Texas facility at its peak, before numbers fell significantly as border crossings decreased.",
      "We contacted the Administration for Children and Families and the Department for Health and Human Services which awarded the contract but are yet to hear back.",
      "What about the other big savings?",
      "The second largest saving listed by Doge comes from cancelling a contract between the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and an IT company called Centennial Technologies which it claims was worth $1.9bn.",
      "The document which Doge links to has a total contract value of $1.9bn and all of the other cost fields, including the amount already spent, are for $0.",
      "However, Mr Drabkin told us this does not necessarily mean that nothing had been spent on the contract.",
      "He said several government departments have poor recording keeping, meaning the amount spent during some contracts might not always be updated in a timely fashion.",
      "Musk to reduce Doge role after Tesla profits plungeWill Elon Musk be able to cut $2 trillion from US government spending?",
      "Musk to reduce Doge role after Tesla profits plunge",
      "Will Elon Musk be able to cut $2 trillion from US government spending?",
      "The contract start date is listed as August 2024 and was estimated to run until 2031.",
      "However, Centennial Technologies' CEO told the New York Times that the agreement had actually been cancelled last autumn during the Biden administration.",
      "The company did not respond to our requests for further comment.",
      "Another IT contract, this time with the Department of Defense, is the third largest claimed saving.",
      "Doge says $1.76bn was saved by cancelling a contract with an IT services company called A1FEDIMPACT.",
      "On the contract document, the total value is listed as $2.4bn. An online database of government contracts called Higher Gov says this amount was the ceiling value.",
      "Again, there is $0 recorded for the amount that had been spent at the time the contract was terminated.",
      "It is unclear where Doge's figure of $1.76bn comes from - we have asked the Pentagon and the supplier about it.",
      "The fourth largest claimed saving of $1.75bn comes from cancelling a USAID grant to Gavi, a global health organisation, which campaigns to improve access to vaccines.",
      "Doge links to a page on USASpending.gov. It shows a grant was paid to Gavi in three instalments, during the Biden administration, totalling $880m.",
      "Gavi confirmed that $880m had been paid out by USAID but said it had not been told the grant had been terminated.",
      "\"Gavi has not received a termination notice related to this grant,\" a spokesperson told us.",
      "We have not found any evidence for the $1.75bn saving claimed by Doge, and a source familiar with the contract said it was unclear where it comes from.",
      "We asked the USAID Office of Inspector General about the grant but it did not respond to us.",
      "While Doge may have cut a significant amount of government spending, the lack of evidence provided for its biggest claimed savings makes it impossible to independently confirm exactly how much.",
      "Doge does not have a press office but BBC Verify has contacted the White House to ask for more evidence of these claimed savings.",
      "Additional reporting by Ned Davies and Alison Benjamin.",

    "story": [
      "The seat at the Vatican had been vacant for two days when a group of grey-clad nuns stood on St Peter's Square and started to sing.",
      "Softly at first then louder, as if to encourage those who joined in timidly, the nuns broke into Ave Maria.",
      "Every so often they shuffled a few inches forward, following the queue for Pope Francis's lying in state. And all the while they sang, their faces turned to St Peter's Basilica to their left, their white veils glistening under their large sun hats.",
      "It was a fitting sight for an extraordinary week in which Rome seemed to regain its reputation as the \"capital of the world\" \u2013 and St Peter's Square as the centre of the Catholic universe.",
      "There is mourning, but also recognition that the Pope, who lived to 88, died quickly and peacefully. \"At least he didn't suffer,\" many say. Yet this isn't the time for celebration either - that will have to wait until after the funeral, when the conclave will spark the usual frenzy of excitement, intrigue and inevitable speculation.",
      "Before then, in Rome these in-between days have taken on a flavour of their own.",
      "Elena, a Romanian woman in her 50s, said she had noticed a \"pensive\" atmosphere in the city. \"There are big crowds around but I have felt everything was a bit quieter, there is something different in the air,\" she told the BBC, guessing that the Pope's death was encouraging people to \"look inside\" more.",
      "She added that everyone she spoke to this week \u2013 even non-believers \u2013 had been marked by his death somehow.",
      "Her friend Lina agreed. She was standing behind the counter of her tobacconist shop in Borgo Pio, a quiet cobblestoned street lined with buildings in earthy tones and flower boxes near the Vatican. \"It's neither a week of tragedy nor one of celebration,\" she said. \"It's a chance for people to think, to reflect, and I think that's much needed.\"",
      "Nearby, people slowly ambled down Via della Conciliazione \u2013 the pedestrian street that connects Italy and the Vatican city state, and the same one the Pope's coffin will travel down on Saturday as he reaches his final place of rest in the basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore.",
      "The 4th Century church is only located around 4km away from St Peter's, but the journey there is set to take around two hours as the car carrying the Pope's coffin will move at walking pace to allow people lining the streets to see it and say their goodbyes, the Vatican said earlier this week.",
      "Two plain-clothed police officers acknowledged that the neighbourhood was much busier than usual, but that it \"felt like a Saturday,\" and that people had been very relaxed.",
      "Security operation in full swing",
      "Still, the signs of the huge security operation mounted by the Vatican and Italian authorities were everywhere.",
      "On Wednesday, a soldier stood outside a religious goods shop brandishing a hefty bazooka-like anti-drone device. Asked whether the contraption could, for instance, disrupt drone frequencies and force them to return to their bases, he replied mysteriously: \"Maybe, among other things.\"",
      "Next to him, a fellow soldier scanned the sky with binoculars. On the day of the funeral, they will be joined by thousands of security personnel from various branches of the police and armed forces, as well as river patrol units, bomb-sniffing dogs and rooftop snipers.",
      "American student Caislyn, who was sat on a bench sketching the dome of St Peter's, said she was \"shocked\" at how safe she felt despite the number of people around.",
      "The 21-year-old attributed that to the fact that \"people are here to pay their respects to Francis, and to enjoy this beautiful city.\" She called the atmosphere \"bittersweet,\" but said she saw the funeral as a \"celebration of life\".",
      "\"He gave such a great example to the world,\" she reminisced.",
      "You can watch and follow the funeral live here on the BBC News website and app. In the UK, there will be live coverage on BBC One from 0830-1230 BST, presented by Reeta Chakrabarti, available to watch on the iPlayer.

      "As Caislyn recalled Francis' commitment to the poorest of society, many others referenced his last-known trip outside the Vatican on Maundy Thursday, when he visited prisoners at the Regina Coeli jail, as he had done many times before.",
      "'He never forgot where he was from'",
      "\"He was close to the people,\" Elena said fondly, adding that she understood why he \"couldn't stay away\" from helping those worst off.",
      "\"I work as a volunteer for homeless people and every time I try to stop, something pulls me back. Why? Because I lived like them for three months, because I come from poverty too. It's not hard for me to feel close to them,\" she said.",
      "\"And I think it was the same for Francis,\" she said, mentioning comments by Francis's sister Maria Elena who told Italian media last month that she and her siblings had grown up in poverty in Argentina.",
      "Elena added: \"He never forgot where he was from. Even when he got to the highest role, he never let it change him.\"",
      "For Belgian tourist Dirk, whose wife was queuing to see the Pope lying in state in the basilica, the sombre atmosphere since the Pope's death is something that \"draws people in, it's something they want to be a part of\".",
      "\"It might just be temporary, it'll probably be over by Monday,\" he laughed.",

      "\"So it remains shocking, the wealth of these churches around us and the poverty of the people sleeping on their doorsteps.\" He shook his head. \"The contrast is jarring to me.\"",
      "Katleho - an upbeat young woman from Lesotho - told the BBC that she felt \"special, happy\" when she received Pope Francis's Easter blessing on the day before he died, when he appeared on St Peter's balcony. \"I thought: I'm a real Catholic now!,\" she laughed.",
      "She said she felt \"so privileged to be joining a multitude of people\" who were paying their respects to Pope Francis this week. \"It's a real shared experience, it's so wonderful,\" she said, skipping off to catch up with the rest of her group.",
      "For three days this week, tens of thousands of people streamed into St Peter's to bid their last farewell to the Argentinian Pope who \u2013 as he put it when he was elected \u2013 had come \"from the end of the world\".",
      "Father Ramez Twal, from Jerusalem, was the last in line in the queue to see Pope Francis's body.",
      "\"It's amazing that we as a group from the Holy Land get to say the last goodbye for our late Pope Francis,\" he said.",
      "\"For us, it's a really emotional moment to say thank you to him for being with us during this terrible time in the Holy Land.",
      "\"He means a lot to me, because he gave us a spiritual way of thinking, he had a love he gave for all, and he taught us to respect each other. We will miss him.\"",
      "As they entered the basilica after hours of queuing, visitors and pilgrims proceeded towards Francis's body, lying in a casket by the high altar built over the tomb of St Peter, the Catholic Church's first pope. Some brandished selfie sticks, others clutched their rosaries or their children's hands. All were very quiet.",

      "Standing at about 4'3\" (130cm), G1 is smaller and more affordable than other humanoid robots on the market, and has such a highly fluid range of motion and dexterity that videos of it performing dance numbers and martial arts have gone viral.",

      "Other carmakers are following a similar path. BMW recently introduced humanoid robots to a US factory. Meanwhile, South Korean car firm Hyundai has ordered tens of thousands of robots from Boston Dynamics, the robot firm it bought in 2021.",
      "Thomas Andersson, founder of research firm STIQ, tracks 49 companies developing humanoid robots - those with two arms and legs. If you broaden the definition to robots with two arms, but propel themselves on wheels, then he looks at more than 100 firms.",
      "Mr Andersson thinks that Chinese companies are likely to dominate the market.",
      "\"The supply chain and the entire ecosystem for robotics is huge in China, and it's really easy to iterate developments and do R&D [research and development],\" he says.",
      "Unitree underlines that advantage - its G1 is cheap (for a robot) with an advertised price of $16,000 (\u00a312,500).",
      "Also, Mr Andersson points out, the investment favours Asian nations.",
      "In a recent report STIQ notes that almost 60% of all funding for humanoid robots has been raised in Asia, with the US attracting most of the rest.",
      "Chinese companies have the added benefit of support from the national and local government.",
      "For example, in Shanghai there is a state-backed training facility for robots, where dozens of humanoid robots are learning to complete tasks.",
      "So how can US and European robot makers compete with that?",
      "Bristol-based Bren Pierce has founded three robotics companies and the latest, Kinisi has just launched the KR1 robot.",
      "While the robot has been designed and developed in the UK, it will be manufactured in Asia.",
      "\"The problem you get as a European or American company, you have to buy all these sub-components from China in the first place.",
      "\"So then it becomes stupid to buy your motors, buy your batteries, buy your resistors, shift them all halfway around the world to put together when you could just put them all together at the source, which is in Asia.\"",
      "As well as making his robots in Asia, Mr Pierce is keeping costs down by not going for the full humanoid form.",
      "Designed for warehouses and factories, the KR1 does not have legs.",
      "\"All of these places have flat floors. Why would you want the added expense of a very complex form factor... when you could just put it on a mobile base?\" he asks.",
      "Where possible, his KR1 is built with mass-produced components - the wheels are the same as you would find on an electric scooter.",
      "\"My philosophy is buy as many things as you can off the shelf. So all our motors, batteries, computers, cameras, they're all commercially available, mass produced parts,\" he says.",
      "Like his competitors at Unitree, Mr Pierce says that the real \"secret sauce\" is the software that allows the robot to work with humans.",
      "\"A lot of companies come out with very high-tech robots, but then you start needing a PhD in robotics to be able to actually install it and use it.",
      "\"What we're trying to design is a very simple to use robot where your average warehouse or factory worker can actually learn how to use it in a couple of hours,\" Mr Pierce says.",
      "He says the KR1 can perform a task after being guided through it by a human 20 or 30 times.",
      "The KR1 will be given to pilot customers to test this year.",
      "So will robots ever break out of factories into the home? Even the optimistic Mr Pierce says it's a long way off.",
      "\"My long term dream for the last 20 years has been building the everything robot. This is what I was doing my PhD work in I do think that is the end goal, but it's a very complicated task,\" says Mr Pierce.",
      "\"I still think eventually they will be there, but I think that's at least 10 to 15 years away.\""

    "published": "Fri, 25 Apr 2025 02:13:47 GMT",
    "summary": "The mineral, once widely-used, releases toxic fibres into the air when disturbed that can cling to the lungs and cause cancer.",
    "story": [
      "Israel's destructive military campaign in Gaza has released a silent killer: asbestos.",
      "The mineral, once widely-used in building materials, releases toxic fibres into the air when disturbed that can cling to the lungs and - over decades - cause cancer.",
      "Nowadays, its use is banned across much of the world, but it is still present in many older buildings.",
      "In Gaza, it is found primarily in asbestos roofing used across the territory's eight urban refugee camps - which were set up for Palestinians who fled or were driven from their homes during the 1948-49 Arab-Israeli war - according to the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP).",
      "In October 2024, UNEP estimated that up to 2.3 million tons of rubble across Gaza could be contaminated with asbestos.",
      "\"The Gaza rubble is a very, very toxic environment,\" says Professor Bill Cookson, director of the National Centre for Mesothelioma Research in London. \"People are going to suffer acutely, but also in the longer term as well, things that children may carry throughout their lives.\"",
      "\"The lives lost now are not going to end here. The legacy is going to continue,\" says Liz Darlison, CEO of Mesothelioma UK.",
      "When asbestos is disturbed by something like an air strike, its fibres - too small to see with the human eye - can be breathed in by those nearby and can then work their way through to the lining of the lungs.",
      "Over many years - usually decades - they can cause scarring which leads to a serious lung condition known as asbestosis, or, in some cases, an aggressive form of lung-cancer named mesothelioma.",
      "\"Mesothelioma is a terrible, intractable illness,\" says Prof Cookson.",
      "\"The really worrying thing,\" he adds, \"is that it's not dose related. So even small inhalations of asbestos fibre can cause subsequent mesothelioma.",
      "\"It grows within the pleural cavity. It's extremely painful. It's always diagnosed late. And it's pretty well resistant to all treatments.\"",
      "Typically, those who contract mesothelioma do so 20 to 60 years after exposure - meaning it will take decades before the possible impact across the territory is felt. A higher level, or longer period, of exposure is believed to accelerate the progression of the disease.",
      "Dr Ryan Hoy, whose research into dust inhalation was cited by the UNEP, says it is extremely difficult to avoid breathing in asbestos fibres because they are \"really tiny particles that float in the air that can get very, very deep into the lungs.\"",
      "They are even harder to avoid, he says, because Gaza is so \"densely populated\". The territory houses approximately 2.1 million people and is 365 sq km (141 sq miles) - about one quarter of the size of London.",
      "Gaza in maps: How 15 months of war have drastically changed the territory",
      "Gaza war death toll could be significantly higher, researchers say",
      "Experts on the ground there say people are unable to manage the risks posed by asbestos or dust inhalation due to the more immediate dangers of Israel's military offensive.",
      "\"At this point in time, [dust inhalation] is not something that is perceived as a worrying thing by the population. They even don't have things to eat, and they're more afraid to be killed by the bombs,\" says Chiara Lodi, medical co-ordinator in Gaza for the NGO M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res.",
      "\"The lack of awareness about the risks of asbestos, combined with the ongoing challenges [people in Gaza] face in trying to rebuild their lives, means they are unable to take the necessary measures to protect themselves,\" a Gaza-based spokesperson for the NGO SOS Children's Villages said.",
      "Many are \"not fully aware of the harmful effects of the dust and debris\", they added.",
      "After a previous conflict in Gaza in 2009, a UN survey of the territory found asbestos in debris from older buildings, sheds, temporary building extensions, roofs and the walls of livestock enclosures.",
      "There are several types of asbestos ranging from so-called \"white asbestos\", which is the least dangerous, to \"blue\", or crocidolite, which is the most. Highly-carcinogenic crocidolite asbestos was previously found in Gaza by the UN.",
      "Globally, around 68 countries have banned the use of asbestos, though some maintain exemptions for special use. It was banned in the UK in 1999, and Israel banned its use in buildings in 2011.",
      "As well as mesothelioma, asbestos can cause other forms of lung cancer, larynx and ovarian cancer.",
      "A further, lesser known risk is that of silicosis, a lung disease caused by breathing in silica dust, usually over many years. Concrete generally contains 20-60% silica.",
      "Dr Hoy says the sheer amount of dust in Gaza could lead to an \"increased risk of respiratory tract infections, upper and lower airway infections, pneumonia, exacerbations of pre-existing lung disease like asthma,\" as well as, \"emphysema and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which can be worsened by acute exposure to dust\".",
      "For years, the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center in New York have been used as a case-study by health experts to examine the effects of a large toxic dust-cloud on a civilian population.",
      "\"The Twin Towers were not in the middle of a war zone,\" says Ms Darlison, \"so it was something we were able to measure and quantify easier\".",
      "As of December 2023, 5,249 of those who were registered with the US government's World Trade Center Health Programme have died as a result of aerodigestive illness or cancer - a far higher figure than the 2,296 people who were killed in the attack itself. A total of 34,113 people were diagnosed with cancer over the same period.",
      "The US and a group of Arab States have proposed competing plans for the reconstruction of Gaza. The UN has warned that the process will have to be managed carefully to avoid disturbing the vast amounts of asbestos-contaminated rubble.",
      "\"Unfortunately,\" says Ms Darlison, \"the very properties that made us use so much of it are the properties that make it difficult to get rid of.\"",
      "A UNEP spokesperson told the BBC that the debris removals process will \"increase the likelihood of asbestos disturbance and the release of hazardous fibres into the air\".",
      "A UNEP assessment indicated that clearing all debris could take 21 years and cost up to $1.2 billion (\u00a3929m).",
      "The Israeli military launched its offensive on Gaza in response to Hamas's attack on Israel in October 2023 that killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and saw 251 people taken hostage.",
      "Israel's offensive has killed more than 53,000 Palestinians in Gaza, mostly women and children, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) did not respond to the BBC's request for comment.",
      "More than 50,000 killed in Gaza since Israel offensive began, Hamas-run ministry says",

    "published": "Fri, 25 Apr 2025 06:56:30 GMT",
    "summary": "Australia has proposed to create a strategic reserve of critical minerals.",
    "story": [
      "Australia's prime minister Anthony Albanese has pledged to invest A$1.2bn (\u00a3580m) in a strategic reserve for critical minerals if he wins next month's election, as trade tensions escalate.",
      "The announcement came after China imposed export restrictions on seven rare earth elements, essential to the production of advanced technologies - including electric vehicles, fighter jets, and robots.",
      "China's controls apply to all countries but were widely seen as retaliation to US President Donald Trump's tariffs.",
      "Albanese said Australia would prioritise minerals that are key to its security, and that of its partners, including rare earths. But could his plan challenge China's dominance?",
      "What are rare earth minerals and why are they important?",
      "Rare earths are a group of 17 elements - named \"rare\" because they are notoriously difficult to extract and refine.",
      "Rare earths, like samarium and terbium, are critical to the production of technologies set to shape the world in the coming decades \u2013 including electric vehicles and highly advanced weapons systems.",
      "Albanese's proposed reserve includes rare earths as well as other critical minerals of which Australia is a top producer - like lithium and cobalt.",
      "Both China and Australia have rare earth reserves. But 90% of rare earth refining \u2013 which makes them usable in technology \u2013 takes place in China, giving the country significant control over supply.",
      "And that has spooked Western governments.",
      "Why is China restricting the export of rare earth minerals?",
      "Beijing said its restrictions on rare earths were in response to Trump's sweeping tariffs on Chinese imports to the US, currently at 145%.",
      "But analysts say Washington's inability to secure the supply of rare earths has become one of the Trump administration's chief anxieties, especially as diplomatic tensions with Beijing have deepened.",
      "Around 75% of US rare earth imports came from China between 2019 and 2022, according to the US Geological Survey.",
      "Philip Kirchlechner, director of Iron Ore Research in Perth, Western Australia, told the BBC that the US and EU had \"dropped the ball\" on recognising the importance of the rare earths over recent decades, as China swiftly developed a monopoly over refinement.",
      "\"China has its foot on the blood vein\u2026 of US and European defence systems,\" he added.",
      "Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, this week said that China halting exports of rare earths used in advanced magnets was affecting the company's ability to develop humanoid robots, in an early symbol of the pain Beijing has the power to inflict on US companies.",
      "Could Australia's proposal change the game?",
      "Albanese's proposal says that minerals in the reserve will be available to both \"domestic industry and international partners\", in a likely reference to allies such as the US and EU.",
      "But Kirchlechner, while welcoming the move as \"long overdue\", added that the proposal is \"not going to solve the problem\".",
      "The fundamental issue is that even if Australia stockpiles more critical minerals, the refining process of rare earths will still largely be controlled by China.",
      "Lithium \u2013 not a rare earth, but a crucial metal in the production electric vehicle batteries and solar panels \u2013 is a good example. Australia mines 33% of the world's lithium, but only refines and exports a tiny fraction. China, on the other hand, mines just 23% of the world's lithium, but refines 57% of it, according to the International Energy Agency.",
      "Australia has been investing in refining rare earths as part of its Future Made in Australia plan, aimed at leveraging the country's critical minerals reserves to drive the green transition.",
      "Arafura Rare Earths, headquartered in Perth, Western Australia, last year received A$840m in funding to create the country's first combined mine and refinery for rare earths. And in November, Australia opened its first rare earths processing plant, also in Western Australia, operated by Lynas Rare Earths.",
      "But the country is expected to depend on China for refining until at least 2026, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, headquartered in Washington.",
      "How will the US and China respond?",
      "China has been trying to seize on the volatility brought by Trump.",
      "In a series of editorials in Australian newspapers, China's ambassador to Canberra lambasted Washington's approach to global trade, and called on Australia to \"join hands\" with Beijing - something that Albanese quickly rejected.",
      "Australia has touted its resource industry in its talks with Trump. Some critical minerals were exempt from a 10% tariff he imposed on imports of most Australian products.",
      "But analysts say Albanese's proposal is mainly aimed at protecting Australia and its partners from strategic adversaries like China.",
      "Alicia Garc\u00eda-Herrero, chief economist for Asia-Pacific at Natixis, told the BBC that Albanese's plan was \"more sophisticated\" than previous proposals, because it included the ability to sell Australia's resources at moments of economic tension.",
      "If China imposes export controls, she added, Australia could begin selling more of its mineral reserves to help lower prices on global markets, and loosen the control China has had on setting prices.",
      "But she said that Australia still cannot completely replace China.",
      "\"If [Australia's] goal is to serve the West, become more instrumental to the West \u2013 especially the US \u2013 there are weak spots China can enter \u2013 and the most important is refining.\"",

      "Though Christianity is the majority religion in the DRC, Christians there have faced death and persecution at the hands of jihadist group Islamic State and associated rebels. Against that backdrop, Cardinal Ambongo is viewed as a fierce advocate for the Church.",
      "But in a 2020 interview, he spoke in favour of religious plurality, saying: \"Let Protestants be Protestants and Muslims be Muslims. We are going to work with them. But everyone has to keep their own identity.\"",
      "Such comments could lead some cardinals to wonder if he fully embraces their sense of mission - in which Catholics hope to spread the Church's word throughout the world.",
      "Peter Kodwo Appiah Turkson",
      "Nationality: Ghanaian",
      "Age: 76",
      "If chosen by his peers, the influential Cardinal Turkson would likewise have the distinction of being the first African pope for 1,500 years.",
      "Like Cardinal Ambongo, he has claimed not to want the job. \"I'm not sure whether anyone does aspire to become a pope,\" he told the BBC in 2013.",
      "Asked if Africa had a good case to provide the next pope based on the Church's growth on the continent, he said he felt the pope shouldn't be chosen based on statistics, because \"those types of considerations tend to muddy the waters\".",
      "He was the first Ghanaian to be made a cardinal, back in 2003 under Pope John Paul II.",
      "Like Cardinal Tagle, Cardinal Turkson was considered a potential pope a decade later, when Francis was chosen. In fact, bookmakers made him the favourite ahead of voting.",
      "A guitarist who once played in a funk band, Cardinal Turkson is known for his energetic presence.",
      "Like many cardinals from Africa, he leans conservative. However, he has opposed the criminalisation of gay relationships in African countries including his native Ghana.",
      "In a BBC interview in 2023, while Ghana's parliament was discussing a bill imposing harsh penalties on LGBTQ+ people, Turkson said he felt homosexuality should not be treated as an offence.",
      "In 2012, he was accused of making fear-mongering predictions over the spread of Islam in Europe at a Vatican conference of bishops, for which he later apologised.",
      "Peter Erdo",
      "Nationality: Hungarian",
      "Age: 72",
      "A cardinal since the age of 51, Peter Erdo is highly regarded in the Church in Europe, having twice led the Council of European Bishops' Conferences from 2006 to 2016.",
      "He is well known among African cardinals and he has worked on Catholic relations with the Orthodox Church.",
      "The archbishop of Budapest and primate of Hungary grew up in a Catholic family under communism, and he is considered a potential compromise candidate.",
      "Erdo played a prominent role in Pope Francis's two visits to Hungary in 2021 and 2023, and he was part of the conclaves that elected Francis and his predecessor Pope Benedict.",
      "His conservative views on the family have found favour with some parts of the Church and he has navigated the \"illiberal democracy\" of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban. During Europe's migrant crisis in 2015, he said the Church would not take in migrants as it was tantamount to human trafficking.",
      "Angelo Scola",
      "Nationality: Italian",
      "Age: 83",
      "Only cardinals under 80 can vote in the conclave, but Angelo Scola could still be elected.",
      "The former Archbishop of Milan was a frontrunner in 2013 when Francis was chosen, but he is thought to have fallen victim to the adage of entering the conclave as Pope and leaving as cardinal.",
      "His name has resurfaced ahead of the conclave, because of a book he is publishing this week on old age. The book features a preface written by Pope Francis shortly before he was admitted to hospital in which he said \"death is not the end of everything, but the beginning of something\".",
      "Francis's words show genuine affection for Scola, but the college of cardinals might  not see his focus on old age as ideal for a new pope.",
      "Reinhard Marx",
      "Nationality: German",
      "Age: 71",
      "Germany's top Catholic cleric is also very much a Vatican insider too.",
      "The Archbishop of Munich and Freising was chosen as an adviser when Francis became pope in 2013. For 10 years he advised the Pope on Church reform and still oversees financial reform of the Vatican.",
      "He has advocated a more accommodating approach towards homosexuals or transgender people in Catholic teaching.",
      "But in 2021 he offered to resign over serious mistakes in tackling child sexual abuse in Germany's Catholic Church. That resignation was rejected by Francis.",
      "Two years ago he left the Council of Cardinals, the Pope's most important advisory body, in what was seen in Germany as a setback for his career in the Church.",
      "Marc Ouellet",
      "Nationality: Canadian",
      "Age: 80",
      "Cardinal Ouellet has twice before been seen as a potential candidate for Pope, in 2005 and 2013.",
      "For years he ran the Vatican's Dicastery for Bishops, which chooses candidates for the episcopate around the world, so he has played a significant and formative role in vetting the future members of the Catholic hierarchy.",
      "As another octogenarian, he will not be able to play a part in the conclave itself, which may hinder his chances.",
      "Ouellet is viewed as a conservative with a modern outlook, who is strongly in favour of maintaining the principle of celibacy for priests.",
      "He opposes the ordination of women priests, but he has called for a greater role for women in running the Catholic Church, saying that \"Christ is male, the Church is feminine\".",
      "Robert Prevost",
      "Nationality: American",
      "Age: 69",
      "Could the papacy go to an American for the first time?",
      "Chicago-born Cardinal Prevost is certainly seen as having many of the necessary qualities for the role.",
      "Two years ago Pope Francis chose Prevost to replace Marc Ouellet as prefect of the Vatican's Dicastery for Bishops, handing him the task of selecting the next generation of bishops.",
      "He worked for many years as a missionary in Peru before being made an archbishop there.",
      "Prevost is not just considered an American, but as someone who headed the Pontifical Commission for Latin America.",
      "He is seen a reformer, but at 69 might be viewed as too young for the papacy. His period as archbishop in Peru was also clouded by allegations of covering up sexual abuse claims, which were denied by his diocese.",
      "Robert Sarah",
      "Nationality: Guinean",
      "Age: 79",
      "Well-liked by conservatives in the Church, Cardinal Sarah is known for his adherence to doctrine and traditional liturgy and was often considered opposed to Pope Francis's reformist leanings.",
      "The son of a fruit-picker, Sarah became the youngest archbishop aged 34 when Pope John Paul II appointed him prelate in Conakry in Guinea.",
      "He has had a long and impressive career, retiring in 2021 as head of the Vatican's office that oversees the Catholic Church's liturgical rites.",
      "While not considered a favourite for the papacy, he could attract strong support from conservative cardinals.",
      "Pierbattista Pizzaballa",
      "Nationality: Italian",
      "Age: 60",
      "Ordained in Italy when he was 25, Pizzaballa moved to Jerusalem the following month and has lived there ever since.",
      "Pope Francis made him Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem five years ago and later cardinal, and Pizzaballa has spoken of the city as \"the heart of the life of this world\".",
      "Fellow cardinals will have been impressed by his deep understanding of Israelis and Palestinians and the ongoing war in Gaza.",
      "However, his relative young age and inexperience as a cardinal may count against him, as could his affinity to Francis among cardinals seeking a change in direction.",
      "Michael Czerny",
      "Nationality: Canadian",
      "Age: 78",
      "Cardinal Czerny was appointed cardinal by Pope Francis and is like him a Jesuit, a leading order of the Catholic Church known for its charitable and missionary work around the world.",
      "Although he was born in the former Czechoslovakia, his family moved to Canada when he was two.",
      "He has worked widely in Latin America and in Africa, where he founded the African Jesuit Aids Network and taught in Kenya.",
      "Czerny is popular with progressives in the Church and was considered close to Pope Francis. He is currently head of the Vatican's Dicastery for Promoting Human Integral Development.",
      "Although a strong candidate, it seems unlikely the cardinals would choose a second Jesuit pope in succession.",

    "summary": "From rare earths to billions in US debt, here's what China has in its arsenal - and how strong they are.",
    "story": [
      "A trade war between the world's two biggest economies is now in full swing.",
      "Chinese exports to the US face up to 245% tariffs, and Beijing has hit back with a 125% levy on American imports. Consumers, businesses and markets are braced for more uncertainty as fears of a global recession have heightened.",
      "Chinese President Xi Jinping's government has repeatedly said it is open to dialogue, but warned that, if necessary, it would \"fight to the end\".",
      "Here's a look at what Beijing has in its arsenal to counter US President Donald Trump's tariffs.",
      "China can take the pain (to a point)",
      "China is the world's second-largest economy, which means it can absorb the impacts of the tariffs better than other smaller countries.",
      "With more than a billion people, it also has a huge domestic market that could take some of the pressure off exporters who are reeling from tariffs.",
      "Beijing is still fumbling with the keys because Chinese people are not spending enough. But with a range of incentives, from subsidies for household appliances to \"silver trains\" for travelling retirees, that could change.",
      "And Trump's tariffs have given the Chinese Communist Party an even stronger impetus to unlock the country's consumer potential.",
      "The leadership may \"very well be willing to endure the pain to avoid capitulating to what they believe is US aggression\", Mary Lovely, a US-China trade expert at the Peterson Institute in Washington DC, told BBC Newshour earlier this month.",
      "China also has a higher threshold for pain as an authoritarian regime, as it is far less worried about short-term public opinion. There is no election around the corner that will judge its leaders.",
      "Still, unrest is a concern, especially because there is already discontent over an ongoing property crisis and job losses.",
      "The economic uncertainty over tariffs is yet another blow for young people who have only ever known a rising China.",
      "The Party has been appealing to nationalist sentiments to justify its retaliatory tariffs, with state media calling on people to \"weather storms together\".",
      "President Xi Jinping may be worried but, so far, Beijing has struck a defiant and confident tone. One official assured the country: \"The sky will not fall.\"",
      "China has been investing in the future",
      "China has always been known as the world's factory - but it has been pouring billions into becoming a far more advanced one.",
      "Under Xi, it has been in a race with the US for tech dominance.",
      "It has invested heavily in homegrown tech, from renewables to chips to AI.",
      "Examples include the chatbot DeepSeek, which was celebrated as a formidable rival to ChatGPT, and BYD, which beat Tesla last year to become the world's largest electric vehicle (EV) maker. Apple has been losing its prized market share to local competitors such as Huawei and Vivo.",
      "Recently Beijing announced plans to spend more than $1tn over the next decade to support innovation in AI.",
      "US companies have tried to move their supply chains away from China, but they have struggled to find the same scale of infrastructure and skilled labour elsewhere.",
      "Chinese manufacturers at every stage of the supply chain have given the country a decades-long advantage that will take time to replicate.",
      "That unrivalled supply chain expertise and government support have made China a formidable foe in this trade war - in some ways, Beijing has been preparing for this since Trump's previous term.",
      "Designed in US, made in China: Why Apple is stuck",
      "Trump's tariffs leave China's neighbours with an impossible choice",
      "Lessons from Trump 1.0",
      "Ever since Trump tariffs hit Chinese solar panels back in 2018, Beijing sped up its plans for a future beyond a US-led world order.",
      "It has pumped billions into a contentious trade and infrastructure programme, better known as the Belt and Road initiative, to shore up ties with the so-called Global South.",
      "The expansion of trade with South East Asia, Latin America and Africa comes as China tries to wean itself off the US.",
      "American farmers once supplied 40% of China's soybean imports - that figure now hovers at 20%. After the last trade war, Beijing ramped up soy cultivation at home and bought record volumes of the crop from Brazil, which is now its largest soybean supplier.",
      "\"The tactic kills two birds with one stone. It deprives America's farm belt of a once\u2011captive market and burnishes China's food security credentials,\" says Marina Yue Zhang, associate professor at the University of Technology Sydney's Australia-China Relations Institute.",
      "The US is no longer China's biggest export market: that spot now belongs to South East Asia. In fact China was the largest trading partner for 60 countries in 2023 - nearly twice as many as the US. The world's biggest exporter, it made a record surplus of $1tn at the end of 2024.",
      "That doesn't mean the US, the world's biggest economy, is not a crucial trading partner for China. But it does mean it's not going to be easy for Washington to back  China into a corner.",
      "Following reports that the White House will use bilateral trade negotiations to isolate China, Beijing has warned countries against \"reaching a deal at the expense of China's interests\".",
      "That would be an impossible choice for much of the world",
      "\"We can't choose, and we will never choose [between China and the US],\" Malaysia's trade minister Tengku Zafrul Aziz told the BBC last week.",
      "China now knows when Trump will blink",
      "Trump held firm as stocks plummeted following his sweeping tariffs announcement in early April, likening his staggering levies to \"medicine\".",
      "But he made a U-turn, pausing most of those tariffs for 90 days after a sharp sell-off in US government bonds. Also known as Treasuries, these have long been seen as a safe investment. But the trade war has shaken confidence in the assets.",
      "Trump has since hinted at a de-escalation in trade tensions with China, saying that the tariffs on Chinese goods will \"come down substantially, but it won't be zero\".",
      "So, experts point out, Beijing now knows that the bond market can rattle Trump.",
      "China also holds $700bn in US government bonds. Japan, a staunch American ally, is the only non-US holder to own more than that.",
      "Some argue that this gives Beijing leverage: Chinese media has regularly floated the idea of selling or withholding purchases of US bonds as a \"weapon\".",
      "But experts warn that China will not emerge unscathed from such a situation.",
      "Rather, it will lead to huge losses for Beijing's investments in the bond market and destabilise the Chinese yuan.",
      "China will only be able to exert pressure with US government bonds \"only up to a point\", Dr Zhang says. \"China holds a bargaining chip, not a financial weapon.\"",
      "A chokehold on rare earths",
      "What China can weaponise, however, is its near monopoly in extracting and refining rare earths, a range of elements important to advanced tech manufacturing.",
      "China has huge deposits of these, such as dysprosium, which is used in magnets in electric vehicles and wind turbines, and Yttrium, which provides heat-resistant coating for jet engines.",
      "Beijing has already responded to Trump's latest tariffs by restricting exports of seven rare earths, including some that are essential for making AI chips.",
      "China accounts for about 61% of rare earths production and 92% of their refining, according to estimates by the International Energy Agency (IEA).",
      "While Australia, Japan and Vietnam have begun mining for rare earths, it will take years before China can be cut out of the supply chain.",
      "In 2024, China banned the export of another critical mineral, antimony, that is crucial to various manufacturing processes. Its price more than doubled amid a wave of panic buying and a search for alternative suppliers.",
      "The fear is that the same can happen to the rare earths market, which would severely disrupt various industries from electric vehicles to defence.",
      "\"Everything you can switch on or off likely runs on rare earths,\" Thomas Kruemmer, director of Ginger International Trade and Investment, told the BBC previously.",
      "\"The impact on the US defence industry will be substantial.\"",

    "summary": "Despite having the world's fastest-growing Catholic population, odds are against Africa producing the next pontiff.",
    "story": [
      "If the sole predictor of who would become the next pope was where the Catholic Church is growing fastest, then it is almost certain he would hail from Africa.",
      "The continent's Catholic population is expanding more rapidly than anywhere else, representing more than half of the global increase.",
      "While there have been at least three pontiffs from Africa, the last - Pope Gelasius I - died more than 1,500 years ago, many would argue it is high time for another.",
      "When the cardinals who vote for the leader of the Roman Catholic Church - known as the cardinal-electors - meet at the Vatican to choose Pope Francis' successor, will these facts influence their decision making?",
      "\"I think that it will be great to have an African pope,\" Father Stan Chu Ilo, a Nigerian Catholic priest and associate professor at DePaul University in Chicago, told the BBC, arguing that the leadership of the Church should better reflect the make-up of the global congregation.",
      "But the cleric admitted it was more likely that the cardinals would pick someone who already had a high profile - \"someone who is already an influential voice\".",
      "\"The challenge is that you don't have any senior African clergy holding any important position today at the Vatican, and that poses a problem,\" he said.",
      "However, he also said that: \"Cardinal [Robert] Sarah of Guinea and Cardinal Fridolin Ambongo [Besungu] of DR Congo have become prominent voices in global Catholicism within the last two years.\"",
      "And he noted that Ghanaian Cardinal Peter Turkson had held different roles at the Vatican, endearing him to many people around the world.",
      "He remains a strong contender for the position, while in 2005 Nigerian Cardinal Francis Arinze was also a potential candidate in the conclave that led to the election of Pope Benedict XVI.",
      "This is despite Pope Francis increasing the proportion of cardinals from sub-Saharan Africa from 8% when he was elected in 2013 to 12% a decade later, according to US-based Pew Research Center.",
      "\"How it has come to this point for the continent of Africa and the Catholic Church is still something that surprises many of us, given Pope Francis's openness to Africa,\" Fr Chu Ilo said.",
      "Francis visited 10 countries in Africa during his pontificate - a time that marked a dramatic increase in the number of Catholics on the continent. The latest figures show there were 281 million Catholics in Africa in 2023, making up 20% of the worldwide congregation.",
      "But some African Catholics do not like this emphasis on origin - like Father Paulinus Ikechukwu Odozor, a professor at the University of Notre Dame in Indiana.",
      "For the Nigerian-born Catholic priest it just smacks of tokenism.",
      "\"It's like people are saying, 'OK, so Africans are growing in these numbers, so why don't we give them a pope,'\" he told me.",
      "\"I have never been one to think that just because you come from Africa, or because you come from Europe, therefore you are prime candidate.",
      "\"No matter where you come from, as soon as you are elected, everybody's issues become your issue.  You have one concern, to build up the body of Christ, no matter where the people are, no matter how many they are, in whatever context they are.\"",
      "The most important thing, he told the BBC, was for the pope to be \"the chief theologian of the Church\".",
      "\"The pope must be somebody who knows tradition very well\" and was able to use that to give people direction, he said.",
      "In his view, more needs to be done to ensure that matters affecting the faithful in Africa are taken seriously by those in positions of power at the Vatican.",
      "He admitted that at times it felt \"as if Africans don't matter, or it's as if their faith is seen as a little bit below par, or counterfeit, and should not be taken seriously\".",
      "\"When Africans feel that their issues are not on the table as they should be, then people begin to ask, well, maybe we can only get ourselves heard or seen if we have our own man there.\"",
      "Pope Francis has been praised for his understanding of the poor and marginalised - which made him particularly loved in Africa.",
      "For example, he spoke out against what he saw as the plundering of natural resources in places such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, a vast country which is home to Africa's largest Catholic community with almost 55 million believers.",
      "His role as peacemaker has also been commended - he went to great lengths to heal divisions following the brutal civil war in the Central African Republic, famously giving a ride on his popemobile to the imam who invited him to pray at a mosque in Bangui in 2015. He also kissed the feet of South Sudan's rival leaders four years later in an attempt to end that country's civil war.",
      "But Pope Francis did face a backlash from the African Church for his stance on LGBT issues.",
      "Africa bishops rejected his 2023 declaration allowing priests to offer blessings to same-sex couples.",
      "The Vatican clarified that the blessings \"neither approve nor justify the situation in which these people find themselves\", and that \"in several countries there are strong cultural and even legal issues that require time and pastoral strategies that go beyond the short term\".",
      "It is an issue that seems to unite the continent, where homosexual relationships are outlawed in many countries.",
      "The three African cardinals, mentioned by observers as possible, if not top, contenders - Turkson, Sarah and Besungu - are all clear in their rejection of a change on this issue.",
      "Congolese Cardinal Besungu has said \"unions of persons of the same sex are considered contradictory to cultural norms and intrinsically evil\".",
      "Cardinal Sarah, an arch traditionalist, has been damning about the West's liberal attitudes, telling a Synod in 2015: \"What Nazi-Fascism and Communism were in the 20th Century, Western homosexual and abortion ideologies and Islamic fanaticism are today.\"",
      "And while Cardinal Turkson has been critical of Ghana's move to impose harsh penalties on LGBT people, he toes the line that same-sex relationships are \"objectively sinful\".",
      "Nonetheless Fr Odozor agreed that despite an increase in the number of cardinals from the African continent, they lack real power in the Church.",
      "And both clerics interviewed by the BBC pointed to an issue that could hinder efforts that Pope Francis had made to make the leadership of the Church more representative - and the possibility of getting a pontiff from Africa.",
      "\"There is still that question of racism in the Church that we never even talk about,\" Fr Odozor said.",
      "\"That could undermine someone, no matter how papal he is or what he does, he will be seen simply as an African pope.\"",
      "As Pope Francis appointed 108 of the 135 cardinals eligible to vote in the conclave, there is a good chance they will choose someone whose emphasis is also on reaching out to the poor and disenfranchised.",
      "It is an approach Fr Chu Ilo called a \"poor-first\" outlook, with a focus on being \"a listening Church\".",
      "But, as when Pope Francis was elected, he said the outcome would be unpredictable.",
      "\"I will answer like a good priest,\" he told me chuckling, when asked for his prediction.",

    "story": [
      "Legendary trumpeter Herb Alpert celebrated his 90th birthday last month by taking the stage at Jazz at Lincoln Center with a new iteration of the Tijuana Brass, marking his return to the iconic group format for the first time in 40 years.",
      "The milestone performance coincides with the 60th anniversary of his landmark album \"Whipped Cream & Other Delights,\" which spent eight weeks at No. 1 after its 1965 release and helped define the sound of the era.",
      "\"It has been overwhelming. I didn't realize I'd get this much attention at 90,\" Alpert said.",
      "Alpert's distinctive brass sound, inspired by bullfights in Tijuana, dominated the 1960s music landscape \u2014 appearing in television commercials, game shows like \"The Dating Game,\" and films including \"Casino Royale.\" At his commercial peak in 1966, Alpert had three albums in the top five simultaneously and outsold The Beatles, The Rolling Stones and Frank Sinatra.",
      "\"Sometimes I was even a little embarrassed by it all,\" Alpert admitted.",
      "His classic hit \"Ladyfingers\" recently found new life on TikTok, generating what Alpert described as \"three billion streams\" on YouTube, a phenomenon he finds \"strange, because I recorded it like 60 years ago.\"",
      "The trumpet virtuoso's career hasn't been without challenges. By 1969, while going through a divorce, Alpert faced a personal crisis with his instrument. He described the trumpet as \"my enemy\" as he struggled with confidence and technique. A breakthrough came after consulting New York brass teacher Carmine Caruso, who reminded him that the trumpet was \"just a piece of plumbing\" and that \"the instrument comes from deep inside you.\"",
      "Alpert also co-founded A&M Records with the late Jerry Moss, operating on a handshake agreement from 1962 until they sold the company in 1990. The two never signed a formal contract, a fact that still moves Alpert to tears when he recalls their partnership.",
      "Now touring with a newly assembled Tijuana Brass, Alpert says the music feels fresh again. Alpert continues to perform with his wife of 52 years, singer Lani Hall, whom he met when his label signed Sergio Mendes and Brasil '66.",
      "\"I try to be as authentic as I can when I play,\" he said. \"I'm playing in the moment of my life. And it's a hard place to get to. But that's the place I'm always looking for.\"",

    "summary": "The \"Frasier\" star is back on the Broadway stage in a jazzy re-working of the Gilbert & Sullivan classic, transplanted to New Orleans.",
    "story": [
      "All David Hyde Pierce has to do is step out on stage, and he gets applause, even before he launches into the idiotic tongue-twister from \"The Pirates of Penzance\":",
      "I am the very model of a modern Major-General,I've information vegetable, animal, and mineral,I know the kings of England, and I quote the fights historicalFrom Marathon to Waterloo, in order categorical",
      "With practically no expression on his face, babbling away, all kinds of commotion around him, he's funny.",
      "I asked, \"Why do you think 'less is more' can be funny?\"",
      "\"Well, I think so much of theater, rightly, is MORE,\" Pierce replied. \"Sometimes, what's unexpected in theater is someone doing less.\"",
      "\"Is there a temptation to overact?\"",
      "\"Always,\" he said. \"You remind me of a great line from 'Frasier,' which was, 'If less is more, think how much more MORE will be!'\"",
      "It is thanks to his 11-year run on the TV mega-hit \"Frasier\" that Pierce has the recognition, and can afford to pick and choose his roles. He's the Major-General in \"Pirates! The Penzance Musical,\" a jazzy re-working of the Gilbert & Sullivan classic, transplanted to New Orleans.",
      "Pierce showed us one of the Gilbert & Sullivan scores from his summer camp from the 1970s (\"It's almost as old as I am\"), which was also the score he used for an episode of \"Frasier\" where he, Kelsey Grammer and David Ogden Stiers sang from \"Penzance.\"",
      "I asked, \"What does Gilbert & Sullivan mean to you?\"",
      "\"Hmm. Well, it must mean something, 'cause it's \u2026 I'm getting emotional,\" Pierce replied. \"Thinking about the question, I guess it's just, it's just because it's been threaded through my life for so long.\"",
      "In his dressing room at the Roundabout Theatre, the wall is covered with photographs of people who were in the dressing room before: \"Famous people, a lot of them dear friends of mine,\" he said. \"I'll be up there eventually. Tradition is very important to us. It's being aware that you're part of something bigger.\"",
      "Pierce's \"Pirates\" dressing room is full of nods to the emotional touchstones that define him, including one of the most important: a photograph of him talking to his dad about a show he was doing, \"at a time when I didn't even know that that's what I was going into, had no idea what was lying ahead,\" he said.",
      "Pierce's father and his grandfather were amateur performers. \"The disease runs in the family,\" he said. \"I just hadn't been diagnosed, I guess!\"",
      "He set out to be a concert pianist. He still plays every day, but decided to become an actor instead while he was a student at Yale.",
      "And what brought him to comedy? \"I think it has to do with what I was drawn to,\" Pierce said. \"I watched reruns of 'The Dick Van Dyke Show' and 'Mary Tyler Moore' and 'All in the Family.' When I was a teenager, 'Monty Python's Flying Circus' came to American television on PBS, and my head blew off. I loved Alec Guinness. Oh, and Buster Keaton. Oh my God, Buster Keaton!\"",
      "It's impossible not to see a hint of Buster Keaton in Pierce's famous ironing board scene from \"Frasier\":",
      "Pierce said, \"I do want people to be able to laugh.\"",
      "\"Why? What does that mean to you? Why is it important?\"",
      "\"I guess it's the perception of connection,\" he said. \"For example, doing a comic film is not nearly as enjoyable for me as doing a comic play. In a comic play, you feel from the audience the connection. That's what I'm in it for. That's where I started out. I love that.\"",
      "For almost as long as he's been in it, his partner along the way, his husband since 2008, has been actor-writer Brian Hargrove. They met at an audition, became friends, and only later discovered they were both gay. \"Brian had me over to dinner at his apartment to do my taxes,\" said Pierce.",
      "\"I used to have a tax business as well as an actor,\" said Hargrove.",
      "\"That's not a metaphor; that's actually what he was doing. Tax practitioner! And then we were going to see this movie, and it came up. We went back to his apartment, and then, as Brian puts it, I never left.\"",
      "That was in 1983. It was Hargrove who suggested moving to California, which led to Pierce being cast as Dr. Niles Crane alongside Kelsey Grammer in \"Frasier.\" Forty years, four Emmys and two Tonys later, he chose not to be in the \"Frasier\" reboot. At the time he was playing Julia Child's husband, Paul, on HBO. \"I've been very happy with what originally came to me, and then when I've been able to make choices in my career and the choices I've made,\" Pierce said. \"My creativity is fueled by change and by diversity.\"",
      "Which is why David Hyde Pierce said yes to \"Pirates\" \u2013 and a new chance to make people laugh in one of his old favorites.",
      "For my military knowledge, though I'm plucky and adventury,Has only been brought down to the beginning of the century;But still, in matters vegetable, animal, and mineral,I am the very model of a modern Major-General!",

      "On Tuesday, the board voted to recommend a pardon for the singer. Ultimately, Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee will make the final decision. A spokesperson told CBS News the governor would follow a \"comprehensive review process\" and added that he generally announces pardons annually in December.",
      "Davidson County Sheriff Daron Hall, who has known Jelly Roll for years, contributed a letter of support to his pardon application.",
      "\"I'm a sucker for redemption,\" Hall said. \"I think he has an opportunity to change lives that none of us who believe we're experts -- and none of us who signed up to do this for a career \u2014 can do.\"",
      "What did Jelly Roll serve jail time for?",
      "Lyrics from the Jelly Roll's hit songs stem from personal experiences with drugs, crime, jail time and a family history of addiction. Starting at 14 years old, Jelly Roll spent a decade in and out of jail for drug possession, dealing, shoplifting and aggravated battery.",
      "He spoke about his road to success with \"Sunday Morning\" last year, from his old cell at the county detention facility in Nashville.",

    "story": [
      "Tina Knowles, the mother of global music superstars Beyonc\u00e9 and Solange, is opening up about her personal relationship with her mother, details about her divorces, her own parenting and the girl group Destiny's Child.",
      "Knowles, a businesswoman, fashion designer and former stylist for Destiny's Child, is telling her life story in her memoir, \"Matriarch,\" where she reveals a complicated but loving relationship with her own mother, who she described as \"overprotective\" and \"fearful.\"",
      "At one point, Knowles said she wanted to be a singer herself and was even in a girl group known as The Veltones.",
      "\"I wanted to be a singer, but you know, this little town was about that big and there were no singers there and that's what my mom said. My mom, as, you know, as much as I loved her and she wanted the best for me, she would've done anything for me to be a singer, she really didn't have any hope.\"",
      "She told \"CBS Mornings\" co-host Gayle King in an exclusive interview that that aspect of her upbringing influenced how she parented.",
      "\"I was gonna trust my kids and even though I never believed in being friends, \u2026 but I wanted to be trusted by them,\" she said, adding that she wanted them to know the sky was the limit when it came to achieving their dreams.",
      "\"'Cause my parents put limitations on me. Not because they wanted to, because they didn't want me to be disappointed or hurt,\" she said. \"I told my girls that all the time, you could be whatever you wanna be. You could do whatever you wanna do and I'm gonna be right there to help make it happen.\"",
      "Impact on parenting",
      "Knowles spoke with King about how different her daughters were growing up. She said once a teacher recommended Beyonc\u00e9 repeat a grade in school. Knowles said, now a global superstar, Beyonc\u00e9 was shy and quiet until she got to know people.",
      "\"Never shy around us,\" Knowles said. \"At home, she was entertaining. She was singing, she was dancing and she was doing all the things that I did. \u2026 So she would get quiet until she got to know you.\"",
      "A former teacher told Knowles in her evaluation that Beyonc\u00e9 was a bright student.",
      "\"I took her to Ms. Little. ... Was an ex-teacher there who was very stern, but she said, 'there's nothing wrong with this girl. This girl is very bright. She just doesn't care to let you know it.'\"",
      "Conversely, Knowles described Solange as \"very outgoing\" and would \"walk into the room and be like, 'yes, I'm here.'\"",
      "When Beyonc\u00e9 and Solange were 12 and 7 years old, Knowles put them in therapy together. It was a controversial decision within her own family as her then husband, Mathew Knowles, objected.",
      "\"He was like, 'I don't want any parts of that,'\" Knowles said.",
      "For Knowles it was important as she started to see separation between her two daughters.",
      "\"Beyonc\u00e9 had become like this little star in the town and she was always so close to Solange and so kind to her, but then she was in the singing group, so everything took place in our house,\" she said. The other girls in the group would tell Solange to shut up and be quiet and all that and I started noticing that she wasn't protecting her sister.\"",
      "Knowles' goal through therapy was to ensure the two grew up close, telling King, \"whatever I have to do to make that happen.\"",
      "Beginnings of Destiny's Child",
      "Knowles said she tried to be a singer, and although for her it didn't work out, she used her skills to help her daughters achieve their dreams.",
      "\"God has always given me these tools from day one that I could go back and pull out and who would've ever thought that I would wind up making costumes for Destiny's Child? Or that I would be doing hair and all the things I did for our group and even the rehearsals and the discipline of that and the harmonies \u2026 I got to use it with the girls,\" she said.",
      "But Knowles admits there were problems along the way. She said the label didn't like the way she styled Destiny's Child.",
      "\"They dressed like an R&B group. We love the big glamour. And their hair was too big 'cause we came from Texas,\" she said. \"They just thought that it was too much for those young girls and that they should be in jeans and t-shirts like all the pop icons at the time. In the meantime, everywhere we went, people were saying,' Where can we get these outfits?'\"",
      "Knowles said the criticism from the label hurt her feelings, but it was a moment she remembers her husband, Mathew, pushing back.",
      "\"He was just bold and when I talk about him, that's one of the things that he went to bat for me all the time, he fought, he protected me.\"",
      "Navigating marriage and parenting criticisms",
      "Knowles also wrote candidly in her memoir about the highs and lows of her 30-year marriage to Mathew Knowles.",
      "She said from the beginning, there was infidelity in their marriage on his part and she realized she needed to be prepared.",
      "\"I was pregnant and things were \u2014 they just got really bad at that time. I knew that I had to make a move and I didn't want to be dependent on him,\" she said.",
      "She started planning what she called her escape plan. Knowles opened a hair salon called Headliners, which was so successful it became the family's main source of income and helped to fund Beyonc\u00e9's budding musical career. Mathew Knowles left his sales executive role at Xerox and started working as Destiny's Child's manager full-time. Their partnership as parents helped to hold their marriage together.",
      "\"People say to me, 'how did you stay so long?' And I'm like, 'well, I was married for 33 years, but 33 years were not bad.' \u2026 You know, maybe 15 of them were bad, but we would have these long stretches where we would do really great.\"",
      "While their marriage struggled, Knowles said they were always present parents, but subject to scrutiny. She recalled the criticism people would say after Solange became pregnant as a teenager.",
      "\"Crazy stuff like, 'well you wasn't paying no attention. You're so busy running behind B that you couldn't see' \u2014 blah, blah, blah. I'm like, 'that is absolutely not true.'\"",
      "Knowles went on to say, people didn't understand Solange's history.",
      "\"They didn't know the backstory of Solange losing her best friend and wanting to hurry up and be a grownup 'cause she thought she wouldn't live so long.\"",
      "Knowles said Solange made it clear she was getting married.",
      "\"I said, 'OK, well let me at least give you a wedding,' you know, and made it memorable for her,\u00a0 but you can't control somebody else's life. It's their life.\"",
      "Knowles also wrote about an untrue rumor that surfaced during Beyonc\u00e9's first pregnancy, where people said she wasn't carrying the baby.",
      "\"She went on a show in Australia and she had this very broad cloth type of dress,\" Knowles said about Beyonc\u00e9. \"She wasn't huge pregnant. She was very proud of her little stomach and she bent over and the fabric of the dress bent \u2026 they started this vicious, horrible rumor that she wasn't pregnant.\"",
      "Knowles expressed her heartache over the situation and anger over people thinking her daughter faked a pregnancy and used prosthetics.",
      "\"I was never so enraged because this should have been a sacred experience and what they didn't know is that my child had been through a couple miscarriages, which were so painful.\"",
      "Knowles admitted she did not speak up even as the devastating rumor escalated, saying that Beyonc\u00e9 thought it would go away and handles these situations well.",
      "\"I'm not so good at that. I will cuss you out about my kids,\" Knowles said. \"That was one of the worst times of my life. It really was. I would cry, I would get so mad and I would get so upset.\"",
      "Divorces and moving forward",
      "When she decided to get divorced from Mathew Knowles, she said she spent a week in bed depressed. Her longtime therapist gave her an exercise to do: Make a list of accomplishments and failures.",
      "\"I had such an easy time writing the bad stuff. When I got to the positive stuff, I had such a hard time,\" she said. \"What I realized about myself is that I wasn't really comfortable with people telling me great things about me.\"",
      "She said she had not taken credit for some of her accomplishments in the past, like her work with Destiny's Child in an effort to be humble. She would tell herself, \"it's not about you.\"",
      "But then she started making her list.",
      "\"I started getting mad and writing those things down,\" she said. \"I started my salon. It was a success. You know, I raised some great kids. All the people I've met in my life, like I have had a hell of a life.\"",
      "Four years after her divorce from Mathew Knowles, Tina Knowles married actor Richard Lawson. They were together for 10 years. She said she feels grateful for the relationship, even though it ultimately ended.",
      "\"I've known Richard for 40-something years and I think he's a great person,\" she said. \"So I don't have any regrets about the time that we spent together. I did feel a lot of pressure about ending the marriage because I had so many people to come up to me and tell me about that hope, but \u2013 it's not a tragedy.\"",
      "She said she would love to find love again, but is at peace if she doesn't.",
      "\"I am finally feeling \u2014 it is sad that I'm 71 years old and I know that I am enough and if I don't I'm gonna be just fine because I got such a full, great life. And I'm so blessed, and you know, it's gonna be \u2013 it's all good.\"",

    "summary": "Tina Knowles shares how a missed mammogram may have led to a delayed detection of breast cancer, and opens up about the support from her daughters, Beyonc\u00e9 and Solange, niece Angie Beyinc\u00e9, and bonus daughter Kelly Rowland.",
    "story": [
      "Tina Knowles, mother of Beyonc\u00e9 and Solange, is opening up about her recent battle with breast cancer in a deeply personal interview with \"CBS Mornings\" co-host Gayle King.",
      "The 71-year-old said she was diagnosed with Stage 1 breast cancer in her left breast after doctors discovered two tumors during a delayed mammogram appointment.",
      "\"I've always tried to take care of myself. I just \u2026 was in disbelief,\" she told King.",
      "The American Cancer Society recommends a mammogram every 1 to 2 years for women over 55. Knowles explained she missed her routine screening during the COVID-19 pandemic and didn't reschedule until last year. Doctors then found two tumors. One was benign, and the other had Stage 1 cancer.",
      "She was later informed that had she maintained her regular screenings, detection might have occurred at Stage 0, which according to the American Cancer Society is when the cancer has not spread beyond the breast tissue.",
      "Despite the delay, the cancer had not spread and was considered slow-growing. Knowles underwent a lumpectomy to remove the tumor from her left breast in August. Knowles is now cancer-free.",
      "Beyonc\u00e9, Solange and some friends came to the hospital to support her ahead of her surgery.",
      "\"I was nervous,\" Knowles said. \"And so they started just joking with me.\" She recalled a moment when Solange played a viral video about the word \"demure\" to lighten the mood.",
      "\"I start laughing. I get out of my head. ... Then I said, 'I'm just so happy that y'all are here.' And I thought about the song 'Walk With Me,' which they used to sing all the time,\" she said.",
      "Solange, along with niece Angie Beyinc\u00e9, sang the song to her before surgery.",
      "\"It's about God walking with you into something and protecting you,\" Knowles said through tears. \"And I went in there feeling just like God has got me.\"",
      "Months later, \u00a0Knowles said that she nearly missed Glamour's 2024 Women of the Year event in October after developing a serious post-surgical infection.",
      "Her family, especially Beyonc\u00e9, urged her to rest.",
      "\"Mama, you're not yourself,\" Knowles said Beyonc\u00e9 told her. \"And so she was like, 'Your health is more important. Don't go.'\"",
      "But the award held special significance for her especially after her recent battle. \"A lot of my life, I just refused to be recognized. I would never take an award. I would never want the attention to me \u2026 and this was my saying, 'I deserve this,'\" she said.",
      "In remarks at the event, Knowles spoke about her daughters always being by her side.",
      "\"That's why when I said, you know, with them, I could get through anything, nobody knew what I was talking about,\" she said.",

      "A look back at the esteemed personalities who left us this year, who'd touched us with their innovation, creativity and humanity.",
      "By CBSNews.com senior producer David Morgan. The Associated Press contributed to this gallery.",
      "In 2013, when the aging Pope Benedict XVI, the conservative leader of the Catholic Church, resigned, the choice of a successor was nothing short of an election on the future direction of the Vatican. From the instant the progressive Argentinian cleric Jorge Mario Bergoglio walked out on the balcony overlooking St. Peter's Square, the papacy of Pope Francis (Dec. 17, 1936-April 21, 2025) signaled and end to \"business as usual.\" He began with his choice of taking the name of a saint who lived in poverty after hearing God call him to \"rebuild my church, for it is in ruins.\"",
      "And the new pope's pronouncements demonstrated a willingness to look beyond accepted Catholic orthodoxy. He frankly discussed topics that were controversial within the Church, including gay priests and the role of women\u00a0in leadership. He also offered a more welcoming tone to the LGBTQ community, saying, \"If someone is gay and he searches for the Lord and has good will, who am I to judge?\"",
      "He spoke out to address the danger of climate change, criticized the global financial system, and favored the opening of borders not just for refugees from conflict but also for economic migrants.",
      "His charisma and humility earned him the label \"the People's Pope,\" while his willingness to take as inspiration the life of the humble founder of the Franciscan order rejuvenated some Catholics, and attracted non-Catholics to the pope's mission. New York Cardinal Timothy Dolan described the \"Francis effect\" to \"Sunday Morning\" in 2017: \"The number of people that will come up to me as I'm walking the streets of New York and say, 'Hey, we like this guy, Francis. I haven't been to church in a while, but I'm taking a second look, okay?'\"",
      "The 266th pope was the first from the Americas. Born in Buenos Aires, the son of an accountant from Italy and the daughter of Italian immigrants, Bergoglio was ordained a priest with the Jesuit order, which he led during the country's violent dictatorship. He was named auxiliary bishop of Buenos Aires in 1992, and in 1998 became archbishop. Three years later, he was elevated to cardinal by Pope John Paul II.",
      "His writings focused on social justice issues that would become among his chief concerns as pope: the poor, Indigenous peoples, the environment, and the need for a missionary church.",
      "His first trip outside Rome as pope was to the island of Lampedusa in the Mediterranean, where he met with newly-arrived migrants. There, he denounced the \"globalization of indifference\" shown to refugees, many of whom had drowned while seeking a better life. In his homily during an open Mass there, Francis said, \"Who has wept for the deaths of these brothers and sisters? Who has wept for the people who were on the boat? For the young mothers carrying their babies? For these men who wanted something to support their families? We are a society that has forgotten the experience of weeping, of 'suffering with'; the globalization of indifference has taken from us the ability to weep! \u2026 Let us ask the Lord for the grace to weep over our indifference, to weep over the cruelty in the world, in ourselves, and even in those who anonymously make socio-economic decisions that open the way to tragedies like this.\"",
      "And despite his overall popularity, Francis did have his critics who believe he had blurred the lines around traditional Church teachings. For example, while stating that marriage was between a man and a woman, he also said that priests could bless same-sex couples.",
      "\"You bet there are some conservatives that are unhappy with Pope Francis,\" Cardinal Dolan told \"Sunday Morning.\" \"There're also some liberals that wish he would move much more radically and expeditiously in some of the reforms. So, you're gonna get it from both sides.\"",
      "In 2017, when \"Sunday Morning\" correspondent Mo Rocca asked the pope why he chose the name Francis, the pontiff replied, \"It just came to me.\"",
      "He then left with a request of his audience: \"Pray for me; I need it.\""

      "A Department of Health and Human Services official said Friday that the health department is not creating an autism registry, contradicting an announcement made days ago by the director of the National Institutes of Health describing his plans to study causes of autism.",
      "\"We are not creating an autism registry. The real-world data platform will link existing datasets to support research into causes of autism and insights into improved treatment strategies,\" an official for the department told CBS News in an emailed statement.",
      "The plans outlined by NIH Director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya to amass a broad swath of confidential health data, as part of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s autism research effort, have been the subject of intense criticism in recent days by advocacy groups and autism researchers.",
      "Some providers diagnosing and treating people with autism have been deluged by requests to scrub their data and cancel appointments, multiple federal health officials told CBS News, over concerns about patient privacy and worries it would be used to support unfounded claims.",
      "News of the HHS reversal contradicting Bhattacharya was first reported by STAT News.",
      "The NIH director previously said, as part of a presentation to a meeting of the agency's outside advisers about the effort, that the NIH would be \"developing national disease registries, including a new one for autism\" to be integrated into a new \"data platform\" to study autism and other chronic diseases.",
      "The HHS official did not say whether Bhattacharya initially misspoke or explain why his plan was reversed. Bhattacharya did not respond to a request for comment. HHS has not responded to a CBS News request for an interview with Bhattacharya about the registry.",
      "Some $50 million will be invested in the research effort, which includes the data platform, the HHS official's statement said, which is \"aimed at understanding the causes of ASD [autism spectrum disorder] and improving treatments by leveraging large-scale data resources and fostering cross-sector collaboration.\"",
      "According to the official, the NIH still plans to explore partnerships with other federal agencies, including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, \"to facilitate a comprehensive real-world health dataset that maintains the highest standards of security and patient privacy while supporting research into autism and other areas such as chronic diseases.\"",
      "In a statement to CBS News, the NIH said its \"secure data repository\" would \"analyze large-scale, de-identified data\" for autism and chronic diseases, similar to the agency's cancer database. The autism research would \"be fully compliant\" with federal privacy laws and regulations, the agency said.",
      "\"These efforts are not about tracking individuals. All NIH-managed databases follow the highest standards of security and privacy, with the protection of personal health information as a top priority,\" the NIH said.",
      "The HHS statement marks the latest change to Kennedy's autism research effort in recent weeks, since he first announced the push at a White House meeting earlier this month.",
      "Bhattacharya told reporters earlier this week that he anticipated grant funding for the autism research would \"hopefully\" be awarded by September. That is later than the initial timeline outlined by Kennedy, who has said that \"by September, we will know what has caused the autism epidemic.\"",
      "\"It's hard to guarantee when science will make an advance. It depends on, you know, nature has its say,\" Bhattacharya has said.",

      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Monday considered a case that could impact whether Americans have to pay out-of-pocket for preventive-care services such as diabetes screenings, HIV-prevention drugs and statins, which are currently provided to patients at no cost under the Affordable Care Act.",
      "The legal battle is the latest to land before the high court that involves the landmark health care overhaul signed into law by then-President Barack Obama in 2010. But this dispute turns on how to classify the 16 members of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, which sits within the Department of Health and Human Services and has been making recommendations on preventive medical services to avoid serious health conditions since 1984.",
      "But last year, a federal appeals court in New Orleans found that the task force's structure violates the Appointments Clause of the Constitution because its members are principal officers who were not properly appointed. Principal officers must be appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate.",
      "If the Supreme Court affirms the decision of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit, major hospital associations and leading nonprofits advocating on behalf of breast cancer and HIV patients have warned it would limit access to life-saving medical care for millions of patients, as insurers would no longer be required to cover at no cost to patients the services recommended by the task force.",
      "\"Patients who relied on the promise of preventive care without out-of-pocket costs for a variety of lifesaving interventions and screenings may now need to bear those costs themselves,\" a coalition of trade groups, led by the American Hospital Association, wrote in a friend-of-the-court brief file with the Supreme Court. \"Realistically, this means that patients will not seek out essential preventive care or adhere to preventive medications after they are prescribed.\"",
      "While the Preventive Services Task Force has for more than three decades been making recommendations on preventive medical services, its role was codified by Congress in 1999. The task force's volunteer members are selected by the health and human services secretary and appointed to a four-year term. There are no restrictions on a member's removal, though Congress has said that all members and its recommendations \"shall be independent and, to the extent practicable, not subject to political pressure.\"",
      "With passage of the Affordable Care Act, Congress required health insurers and group health plans to cover certain preventive services that are recommended by the task force without imposing co-pays, deductibles or other cost-sharing charges on patients.",
      "Congress did not create a list of covered preventive services when it passed the ACA, but instead provided for categories of services that must be covered based on the recommendations of medical experts, including the task force. The Biden and Trump administrations have both estimated that millions of Americans have received these services for free through their insurance plans.",
      "Among the preventive services currently recommended by the task force are screenings for lung, cervical and colorectal cancers, as well as diabetes; statin medications to reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke; and medication to prevent HIV, known as PrEP, which gave rise to the legal battle currently before the Supreme Court.",
      "During arguments on Monday, Justice Brett Kavanaugh suggested the language of the statute that established the task force is different from others involving the structure of independent agencies, which specify its officers are appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate, and limit a president's ability to remove members to certain grounds.",
      "\"All of that's missing here,\" he said.",
      "Kavanaugh told Jonathan Mitchell, who argued that the task force's members are unlawfully appointed, that his argument hinges on the Supreme Court treating the task force as a \"massively important\" agency that makes \"critical decisions\" that affect a key segment of the economy, without any supervision or direction by the secretary.",
      "\"Normally, before that kind of thing would happen, Congress would've provided stronger indications that this task force is enormously important,\" he said, adding that he doesn't see any indicators that the entity is \"more powerful than the secretary of Health and Human Services or the president in terms of how these recommendations are going to affect the health care industry.\"",
      "Justice Elena Kagan also questioned why the secretary's power to remove task force members at will is not enough to show that they are accountable to the leader of the Department Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy, which would undercut Mitchell's characterization of the members as principal officers who must be appointed by the president and Senate-confirmed.",
      "\"If you read this court's decisions, it seems often to be the end-all and the be-all that the court has suggested on many occasions that removal power is really the essence of control: If you have it, you have control. If you don't have it, you don't have control,\" she said.",
      "Kagan also said it would be \"odd\" for Congress to set up a task force, but not say who picks its members.",
      "Other justices questioned the scope of the word \"independent,\" and whether that puts the task force outside of the secretary's supervision.",
      "Justice Sonia Sotomayor likened the task force, which gives technical advice, to her law clerks, who may offer independent judgments but are hired to \"help the decision-makers come to a conclusion.\"",
      "If the Supreme Court finds that the task force members are inferior officers, one possible outcome that was raised during the arguments was sending the case back to the 5th Circuit for more proceedings to decide whether Congress gave the Health and Human Services secretary the authority to appoint them.",
      "Justice Neil Gorsuch first raised that option and noted that the lower court didn't address whether the secretary has that power.",
      "While inferior officers must be appointed by the president and Senate, Congress can choose to vest this appointment power elsewhere, to an agency leader, for instance.",
      "The dispute before the high court arose after the task force recommended in June 2019 that PrEP be included among the preventive services covered without cost-sharing arrangements. A group of four individuals and two small businesses filed a lawsuit targeting the Preventive Services Task Force, and objected to the ACA's requirement that insurers cover certain HIV-prevention drugs that are recommended by it on religious grounds.",
      "The plaintiffs argued that providing coverage of PrEP \"encourages and facilitates homosexual behavior,\" which conflicts with their religious beliefs, and said they want to purchase or provide plans that exclude coverage of that medication.",
      "Five of the six challengers do not participate in the health insurance market, and the sixth, Braidwood Management, provides coverage to 70 employees through a self-insured plan.",
      "The lawsuit, filed in the Northern District of Texas, argued that the task force's structure violates the Constitution's Appointments Clause because its members are principal officers who therefore must be nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate.",
      "The district court sided with the plaintiffs, finding that the task force members were improperly appointed. U.S. District Judge Reed O'Connor also invalidated all preventive-care coverage recommendations that had been implemented since the ACA was signed into law in March 2010, and barred the government from enforcing the health care law's coverage requirements in response to the task force's recommendations going forward.",
      "The 5th Circuit affirmed the lower court's finding that the task force's structure is unconstitutional, but disagreed with the universal relief it provided as to the task force's prior requirements for preventive-care coverage.",
      "In concluding that the task force's members are principal officers, the 5th Circuit said they were not properly appointed because they wield \"unreviewable power\" \u2014 issuing preventive-care recommendations for services that insurers, in turn, must cover under the Affordable Care Act.",
      "The Biden administration appealed to the Supreme Court and the Trump administration has continued to defend the board's structure.",
      "Hashim Mooppan, principal deputy solicitor general, told the justices that the task force members are inferior officers because they are \"subject to ample supervision\" by the Health and Human Services secretary when issuing recommendations on preventive care services that must be covered by insurers and group health plans.",
      "Additionally, the task force members can be removed by the head of the Health and Human Services Department at-will, and the secretary can review its recommendations and prevent them from taking effect, Mooppan said.",
      "Given these \"collective powers of supervision,\" the task force can't issue recommendations that bind the insurance industry unless the secretary permits it to do so, he said.",
      "In court filings, the Trump administration also noted that even if the task force members were principal officers who had to be appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate, the constitutional violation would be remedied by severing a provision of federal law that the 5th Circuit found insulates it from the Health and Human Services secretary's supervision.",
      "Doing that would allow the task force to \"make recommendations that will have legal effect only under appropriate supervision by the secretary,\" then-acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris wrote in a February brief.",
      "But lawyers for Braidwood Management have said that the task force members are principal officers who must be appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate in part because federal law dictates that their recommendations be kept \"independent\" and \"not subject to political pressure.\"",
      "\"Congress has chosen to create an independent task force and shield it from political pressure,\" Mitchell, who argued on behalf of Braidwood Management, told the justices.",
      "He said that it's \"not clear\" Congress would even have approved a regime under which the secretary \u2014 a political appointee \u2014 rather than an independent task force decides the preventive care that insurers have to cover.",
      "Even if the Supreme Court finds that the members are inferior officers, as the Trump administration argues, Mitchell said that category of executive branch officials still requires appointment by the president and Senate, unless Congress says otherwise.",
      "He also disputed that the court can fix these constitutional violations by separating out the problematic provision of the law and empowering the secretary to veto the task force's recommendations for mandated preventive-care coverage. The task force, Mitchell said, would still have unreviewable discretion when it decides not to require coverage of a particular service.",
      "In filings with the Supreme Court, outside medical organizations have warned that a decision invalidating the structure of the task force would have significant ramifications for access to preventive care.",
      "The Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation said that the elimination of cost-sharing for breast cancer preventive-care measures has had a \"profound impact\" on public health because screenings lead to earlier detection and treatment, and fewer deaths.",
      "\"The costs of such preventive care \u2014 if not fully covered by insurance, which is the effect of the district court's decision \u2014 dissuade individuals from utilizing the services, and thus lead to later detection, later-stage diagnoses, more aggressive treatment plans, higher treatment costs, and more deaths,\" the organization said in a brief.",
      "The HIV and Hepatitis Policy Institute said the task force's recommendations have been \"essential\" to preventing HIV, hepatitis and other infectious diseases for millions of patients.",
      "\"Without continued access to the no-cost prevention assured under the ACA and consequent new transmissions, our nation will witness a reversal of decades of progress as HIV resurges,\" the group said in a brief, joined by 19 other organizations.",
      "But groups backing Braidwood have argued that the task force is insulated from political accountability, as the ACA left no room for supervision by the Health and Human Services secretary or any other principal officer who answers to the president.",
      "A decision from the Supreme Court is expected by the end of June or early July.",

      "Small business owners are begging for relief from steep new U.S. tariffs on foreign goods, saying the higher import taxes imposed on dozens of key trading partners are threatening their livelihoods.",
      "Senator Ed Markey, ranking member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, said in a letter to the Small Business Administration (SBA) on Friday that smaller enterprises deserve exemptions from the Trump administration's tariffs, which the Massachusetts Democrat criticized as \"recklessly imposed.\"",
      "Markey also noted that the Trump administration has moved to shield corporate giants such as Apple and Google from the impact of some its trade policies, and he pressed the White House to protect small businesses. The U.S. earlier this month moved to exempt smartphones, computers and other high-tech products from the new tariffs, a boon to major tech manufacturers.",
      "\"Small businesses are the lifeblood of the American economy, but because they operate on razor-thin margins, they are uniquely vulnerable to rising costs caused by the Trump Tariffs. These businesses simply do not have the financial cushion to absorb price shocks or the resources to navigate sudden changes to an already complex supply channel,\" Markey wrote.",
      "Under President Trump, the U.S. has hiked tariffs on Chinese imports to as much as 145%, while products from most other countries are subject to 10% tariffs. Mr. Trump also announced steep \"reciprocal tariffs\" on dozens of U.S. trading partners, but earlier this month\u00a0paused them for 90 days.",

    "summary": "The push by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency to slash federal funding will cost taxpayers money, nonpartisan group finds. Here's why.",
    "story": [
      "Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, says it has saved $160 billion through its push to root out wasteful or fraudulent government spending. But that effort may also have come at a cost for taxpayers, with a new analysis from a nonpartisan research and advocacy group estimating that DOGE's actions will cost $135 billion this fiscal year.",
      "The analysis seeks to tally the costs associated with putting tens of thousands of federal employees on paid leave, re-hiring mistakenly fired workers and lost productivity, according to the Partnership for Public Service (PSP), a nonpartisan nonprofit that focuses on the federal workforce.",
      "PSP's estimate is based on the $270 billion in annual compensation costs for the federal workforce, calculating the impact of DOGE's actions, from paid leave to productivity hits. The $135 billion cost to taxpayers doesn't include the expense of defending multiple lawsuits challenging DOGE's actions, nor the impact of estimated lost tax collections due to staff cuts at the IRS.",
      "DOGE has sought to slash federal spending by urging government workers to accept a deferred resignation plan, which allowed many employees to retain full pay and benefits through September without working. Another 24,000 government employees who were fired as part of the reform effort have since been rehired after a court ruling.",
      "Other agencies also have rehired some workers after mistakenly firing them, such as bird flu experts\u00a0who were dismissed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Federal workers have also had to take on tasks such as documenting their weekly accomplishments, which has lowered productivity, Max Stier, president of the Partnership for Public Service, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"We haven't seen much focus on the waste [DOGE] is creating,\" Stier told CBS MoneyWatch about his group's decision to analyze the costs of DOGE's cuts. \"This is an effort that was created to address waste, but we were seeing the opposite.\"",
      "\"Ultimately it's the public that will end up paying for this,\" he added, noting that he expects the taxpayers costs to grow after other DOGE cuts take effect.",
      "The White House took issue with the analysis.",
      "\"The continued attempts to sow doubt in the massive accomplishments of this never-before-seen effort to make government more efficient speaks more about the illegitimacy of those peddling these falsehoods than good work of DOGE,\" White House spokesman Harrison Fields said. \"The American public are in lockstep with the president's mission and will not be swayed by more lies coming from the legacy media.\"",
      "Why job cuts could raise costs",
      "The IRS, which is planning on cutting roughly\u00a040% of its workforce, could forego $323 billion in tax revenue over the next decade due to lower tax compliance and a decline in audits, according to an estimate from the Yale Budget Lab.",
      "To be sure, the DOGE cuts could pay off over time, with a leaner, more focused federal workforce. For example, the direct savings from those layoffs will amount to $38 billion over 10 years, the Partnership for Public Service estimated.",
      "But Stier maintains that the costs for taxpayers could grow as they ripple through the economy, such as reductions in funding of health and science research. One analysis by researchers at institutions including the University of Maryland and University of Pennsylvania estimates that cuts to health research will result in a $16 billion annual economic loss, with 68,000 jobs lost.",
      "\"One can always imagine a miracle occurring, but none of this makes sense on so many different levels,\" Stier said.",
      "DOGE's \"wall of receipts\"",
      "DOGE keeps a running public tally of the federal money the task force says it has saved, posted on its\u00a0website in what is called a \"wall of receipts.\" But some of those savings have been overstated, a February CBS News investigation found.",
      "At the same time, DOGE's $160 billion in savings is far less than Musk's previously stated goal of shrinking annual government spending by $2 trillion, or almost one-third of the federal budget. Many experts say that far more ambitious objective is unlikely to be achieved without cutting major federal programs like Social Security and Medicare, which President Trump has vowed not to touch.",
      "Musk said Tuesday that he'll curtail his work at DOGE starting in May. His decision comes as Tesla, the electric vehicle maker he runs, saw a 71% plunge in first-quarter profit and a 20% decline in vehicle sales as some consumers snubbed the brand due to objections to Musk's government work.",
      "Musk said he still plans to spend one to two days a week on DOGE-related work, focusing on eliminating government waste.",
      "\"I'll have to continue to keep doing it for the remainder of the president's term to make sure the waste and fraud doesn't come roaring back,\" he said during Tesla's first-quarter earnings call on Tuesday.",

    "summary": "Prices on thousands of of goods sold on Amazon, Temu and Shein are rising as U.S. tariffs on China boost import costs.",
    "story": [
      "American consumers are starting to feel the impact of President Trump's tariffs on Chinese imports, especially online.",
      "Since the second week in April, sellers on Amazon have raised their prices on nearly 1,000 products, according to data from SmartScout, a price analysis software tool. The average price hike \u2014 nearly 30%, according to the company's analysis.",
      "Costs rose on a wide range of items, from tech accessories such as phone chargers to women's clothing, SmartScout founder and CEO Scott Needham told CBS MoneyWatch. Anker, a top-selling brand on Amazon that sells mobile charging devices, has increased prices on roughly 25% of its products on the site, for example.",
      "\"It's one of first concerted efforts I've seen where nothing explains the price hikes other than tariffs,\" Needham said.",
      "Tariffs are paid by importers, and they typically pass on much or even all of those additional costs to consumers. Amazon CEO Andrew Jassy told CNBC\u00a0earlier this month that he expected U.S. tariffs to boost prices on a host of consumer goods.",
      "The Trump administration has imposed tariffs of as much as 145% on Chinese imports, while China has retaliated with levies of 125% on U.S. goods entering the country. Mr. Trump has long accused China of unfair trade practices, saying that tariffs will reinvigorate the domestic manufacturing sector and spur economic growth.",
      "Amazon said the 900-plus products whose prices have risen reflect just 1% of the top 100,000 products across its site. The company also noted that the most common price hike amount was just 6%, and that SmartScout's 30% average price figure was skewed by \"a relatively small number of products that had very large increases.\"",
      "\"Amazon consistently offers the lowest prices across the widest selection. We have not seen the average selling prices of products change up or down appreciably outside of typical fluctuations across the hundreds of millions of items on Amazon, and we continue to meet or beat prices versus other retailers on the vast majority of items,\" Amazon said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Shein, Temu prices also rising",
      "Other major e-commerce players and retailers have also lifted prices to offset higher import costs, sometime by adding \"tariff surcharges\" to customers' bills. Chinese e-commerce sites Shein and Temu each announced\u00a0last week that they would hike prices after the U.S. closed a loophole that had allowed goods worth less than $800 to enter the U.S. duty-free.",
      "Those price hikes took effect today. On Temu's site, a pair of running sneakers that last week cost $14 now runs about $27.",
      "The jump illustrates retailers' struggles to navigate President Trump's tariff agenda. Sky-high tariffs can make manufacturing goods in countries like China uneconomical. But revamping supply chains or moving manufacturing to another country can take years and cost hundreds of millions or even billions dollars, experts say.",
      "Uncertainty over tariff rates and how long such levies could remain in place is also making it difficult for companies to plan.",
      "Mr. Trump said this week that the U.S. and China were actively negotiating over how to resolve their trade differences and that he expected tariffs on Chinese imports to fall \"substantially.\" But officials in Beijing quickly\u00a0denied the sides were in talks, and instead reiterated its demand that the U.S. revoke its tariffs against the nation.",
      "\"The chances are that tariffs on China are cut from their current more than 100% effective rate, but there is no clear timeline,\" analysts with Oxford Economics, an investor advisory firm, said in a report on Friday.",

      "Americans are having fewer babies, with the annual birth rate now standing near a record low. It's a trend that has implications for the nation's long-term outlook \u2014 and has drawn attention from the Trump administration, with the New York Times reporting that a proposal for a $5,000 \"baby bonus\" may be one option for juicing the birth rate.",
      "\"Sounds like a good idea to me,\" President Trump said on Tuesday at a White House event when asked about the possibility of a federal baby bonus.",
      "Yet the idea may be far from becoming a reality, with a White House official telling CBS MoneyWatch that no final decision on such a plan has been made.",
      "A declining birth rate can spell long-term economic problems, including a shrinking labor force that's financially strapped to pay for medical services and retirement benefits for an aging population. But reversing a nation's declining birth rate could take far more than a one-time payment that, for most parents, would be quickly consumed by the costs of diapers, child care and other essentials.",
      "Other countries with similar demographic trends have tried an array of strategies to revive their birth rates, but in most cases with short-lived results or no impact at all.",
      "Some experts point out that by tackling long-standing economic issues \u2014 such as providing affordable day care and paid parental leave after the birth of a child \u2014 the government could provide a more hospitable environment for families. The U.S. is one of a only a handful of nations that doesn't provide paid leave for parents, including countries such as Papua New Guinea and Suriname.",
      "\"President Trump is proudly implementing policies to uplift American families, from securing order [at the] border to keep violent criminals out of our communities, to lowering taxes and the cost of living,\" White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said in an email in response to a question about the baby bonus idea. \"The President wants America to be a country where all children can safely grow up and achieve the American dream.\"",
      "By 2050, 26 states will take an economic hit due to their aging populations changes, with GDP declining by $162.3 billion from 2050 to 2100 over that period, according to a new analysis from PwC. Those states range from Maine to Mississippi.",
      "Here's what to know about baby bonuses.",
      "How much has the U.S. birth rate declined?",
      "About 3.6 million babies were born in the U.S. last year, according to the most recent CDC data. That's little changed from the prior year, when the number of births hit a new record low.",
      "The fertility rate, or the average number of children born to each woman in the U.S., dropped to about 1.6 in 2023, down from 3.7 in 1960, when the nation was in the midst of the post-war baby boom, according to data from the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.",
      "What's causing the decline?",
      "That's unclear from an economic or policy standpoint, according to economists Melissa Kearney of University of Maryland, Philip Levine of Wellesley College and Luke Pardue of the Aspen Economic Strategy Group, the authors of a 2022\u00a0analysis of the birth rate decline in the economics publication Econofact.",
      "But, they added, \"Shifting priorities could be the primary driver for the decline in the birth rate since 2007.\"",
      "Survey and anecdotal data suggests that \"young adults have different preferences for having children, aspirations for life and views about parenting norms that are driving the decline in the U.S. birth rates,\" they wrote.",
      "Could financial incentives increase the birth rate?",
      "Other countries that have tried similar monetary incentives have had mixed success.",
      "Australia introduced a baby bonus in 2004, providing $3,000 Australian dollars to parents for each birth, an amount that was eventually hiked to A$5,000.",
      "After an initial bump in births when the policy was introduced, Australia's birth rate has continued to decline, dropping from about 2 children on average for each woman to about 1.5 in 2023, below the U.S. rate, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics.",
      "Likewise, Hungary has introduced a number of incentives to convince its citizens to have more children, from providing baby grants to tax breaks for families with three or more children. Its birth rate increased slightly in the 2010s after hitting a record low of about 1.2 in 2011.",
      "But after rising to 1.6 in 2021, Hungary's birth rate is once again dropping, demographic data shows.",
      "\"Baby bonuses have not worked for Hungary. Why would we replicate this here in [the U.S.]?\" wrote Gabriella Hoffman, the director of the Center for Energy and Conservation at Independent Women's Forum, in a social media post.",
      "How much does it cost to raise a child?",
      "Raising a child in the U.S. doesn't come cheap, with one recent analysis finding parents will spend about $300,000 to raise a child to age 18.",

      "Already, the U.S. has a Child Tax Credit of about $2,000 per child, but that is claimed on a parent's annual tax return, which means families must wait until tax season to collect the benefit.",
      "\"Unlike the Child Tax Credit, a baby bonus could come right after a child is born \u2014 there would be no wait until next year's tax season to get the money that parents need for a crib and a car seat today,\" wrote senior policy analyst Leah Sargeant in a recent post at the Niskanen Center, a political think tank. \"It can be more generously structured than the CTC because it is a supplement for a single, critical year, not an ongoing payment.\"",
      "How much would a $5,000 baby bonus cost the U.S.?",
      "If the parent of every child born in the U.S. annually qualified for a $5,000 bonus, the cost could mount to more than $15 billion a year.",

    "story": [
      "U.S. stocks wavered on Friday, signaling an end to a three-day rally that was driven by investor hopes of a de-escalation in the trade war.",
      "The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 20 points, or 0.1%, to close at 40,114, while the S&P 500 added 40 points, or 0.7%, to close at 5,525. The Nasdaq Composite gained 1.3% thanks to boost from a handful of Big Tech stocks, including Nvidia.",
      "Mr. Trump had adopted a softer stance on trade in recent days, allaying investors' concerns and helping trigger a three-day relief rally following a volatile trading day on Monday. Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics, said in a Friday research note that negative activity in the market played a \"key role\" in the president's decision to reconsider his steep tariffs on imported Chinese goods, which currently total 145%.",
      "Meanwhile, the markets are also reacting to mixed signals from the White House about potential trade deals.",
      "Mr. Trump this week hinted at a possible trade deal with China, but the Chinese government has denied the two countries are in\u00a0active negotiations.\u00a0CNN did report\u00a0that China was rolling back the 125% retaliatory tariffs on U.S. semiconductors, a sign it could be relaxing its stance.",
      "\"We're in a headline driven market, and we're prone to volatility spikes and outsized trading ranges in both directions,\" said Bret Kenwell, a U.S. investment analyst at eToro. \"And you know, it's probably going to remain that type of market until we at least have more clarity on what's going on.\"",
      "In a Time interview released Friday morning, Mr. Trump suggested his administration has struck 200 trade deals with countries, and that those would be announced in the next three to four weeks.",
      "CEOs: \"Elevated uncertainty\"",
      "On Thursday and Friday, several companies cautioned that uncertainty created by Mr. Trump's trade war is making it difficult to give financial forecasts for the upcoming year.",
      "Intel weighed on the market after the chip company said it's seeing \"elevated uncertainty across the industry\" and gave a forecast for upcoming revenue and profit that fell short of analysts' expectations. Its stock fell 6.8% even though its results for the beginning of the year topped expectations.",
      "Eastman Chemical fell 5.9% after it gave a forecast for profit this spring that fell short of analysts' expectations. CEO Mark Costa said that the \"macroeconomic uncertainty that defined the last several years has only increased\" and that future demand for its products \"is unclear given the magnitude and scope of tariffs.\"",
      "Skechers U.S.A., the shoe and apparel company, pulled its financial forecasts for the year due to \"macroeconomic uncertainty stemming from global trade policies\" even though it just reported a record quarter of revenue at $2.41 billion. Its stock fell 4.3%.",
      "Trade deals",
      "Over the last few weeks, the president and members of his administration have been meeting with different countries to discuss bi-lateral trade deals. This comes after Mr. Trump paused the implementation of so-called \"reciprocal tariffs\" for 90 days \u2014 providing a sigh of relief to markets and consumers alike. This pause, UBS analysts said, demonstrates that the president is aware of how tariffs might be negatively impacting market activity.",
      "\"So, while we expect equity markets to remain choppy, the risk-reward for stocks is looking more appealing, especially now that we know that Trump is attuned to the risks from his tariff policies,\" said David Lefkowitz, head of U.S. equities at UBS Global Wealth Management in a research note.",
      "Lefkowitz said that the tariff-induced slowdown will hinder corporate profit growth, but projected the economy would rebound next year as businesses and consumers acclimate to tariffs and the Fed introduces rate cuts.",
      "Tariffs on China could be slashed to as low as 50 to 65%, the Wall Street Journal this week\u00a0reported. But even if tariffs do come down as a result of trade negotiations, that doesn't mean the U.S. economy is out of the woods yet. The remaining levies could still stifle economic growth, analysts say.",
      "\"The April 2 rose garden start on tariffs might have been the high water mark, but you're still talking about a significant burden that is being imposed on companies and the economy from tariffs,\" said Adam Crisafulli, an analyst at Vital Knowledge. \"And that's not going away.\"",
      "While the U.S. stock market lost some steam on Friday, an ease in 10-year Treasury yields and a rebound in U.S. dollar index provided welcome signs of relief. The 10-year Treasury fell from a peak of 4.4% earlier this week to 4.3% on Friday, while the value of the U.S. dollar ticked up to throughout the week, strengthening against the euro and other rival currencies.",

    "summary": "Learning Resources CEO Rick Woldenberg says his tariff costs will surge more than 40-fold to $100 million, while sales could fall.",
    "story": [
      "Learning Resources CEO Rick Woldenberg thinks the Trump administration's sweeping tariffs will be catastrophic for both his family-owned toy business and for the broader U.S. economy. That's why he's suing President Trump.",
      "Woldenberg's business has 500 employees and sells thousands of learning-based toys like Spike the Fine Motor Hedgehog and the Pretend & Play Calculator Cash Register. Its lawsuit, filed Tuesday in the U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., accuses Mr. Trump and other members of his administration of overreaching the president's authority in imposing the broad-based import duties. Congress has historically held the power to authorize new tariffs or make trade deals with other nations.",
      "With the administration's higher tariffs in place, the math is dire for Learning Resources, Woldenberg said. The company's import duties are set to increase from $2.3 million prior to the Trump administration to $100 million \u2014 a roughly 4,000% increase, he said.",
      "\"This path is catastrophic\"",
      "At the same time, Woldenberg said he expects his company's sales to drop 25% this year as consumers scale back spending due to the economic impact of the tariffs. Prior to Mr. Trump's trade war, the CEO had forecast an 8% increase in sales. Economists on Wall Street\u00a0say the tariffs\u00a0will slow U.S. economic growth while boosting inflation.",
      "\"This path is catastrophic,\" Woldenberg told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Forces have been unleashed in the economy \u2014 the world economy as well as the U.S. economy \u2014 that will have consequences that will be irreparable.\"",
      "Learning Resources' suit asks the court to find that Mr. Trump's tariffs are unlawful and to block the administration from collecting the levies. Based in Vernon Hills, Illinois, Learning Resources is a private, family-owned business founded in 1984.",
      "The White House didn't immediately respond to a request for comment about the suit or the company's financial challenges caused by the tariffs.",
      "For now, Woldenberg said he's focused on figuring out how to shift manufacturing out of China, where about 60% of his products are produced. Goods imported from that nation are now facing U.S. tariffs of 145%.",
      "Because tariffs are paid by the companies that import the products, Woldenberg's business \u2014 not China \u2014 is on the hook for paying for Mr. Trump's high import duties.",
      "One question facing Woldenberg is whether he can shift production out of China fast enough to keep ahead of Mr. Trump's tariffs. In recent years, Learning Resources has added factories in India and Vietnam, but that effort has only moved the needle so far, he said.",
      "\"In a two- or three-year period we moved 16% of our product from China to those markets and got things going,\" Woldenberg said. \"That took a lot of effort, cost us a couple million dollars, at least, in out-of-pocket expenses to move it from Point A to Point B, and a huge amount of man hours on our side to essentially redevelop all those products.\"",
      "Despite that effort, however, the company has to date moved only about 16% of its manufacturing capacity out of China to other countries, Woldenberg said.",
      "Reshoring realities",
      "Mr. Trump maintains that tariffs will revive the domestic manufacturing sector because the costs of the import taxes will spur both American and foreign businesses to reshore their factories to the U.S. But economists \u2014 and Woldenberg \u2014 are skeptical, pointing out that such a shift would require committing hundreds of millions, or even billions, of dollars to building and expanding U.S. factories.",
      "\"The fact that [Mr. Trump] believes in it is something that I think is irrelevant \u2014 there are people that believe in ghosts, OK?\" Woldenberg said.",
      "Learning Resources' financial resources aren't deep enough to build its own factory, Woldenberg said. He noted that he's also tried to find plants in the U.S. that could make some of his products because he believed toys with a \"Made in USA\" label could appeal to some customers.",
      "\"If we had six to 10 products that were made in America, we could go and say, 'Look! Made in America. You want made in America? Here's Made in America,\" he said. \"We can't even find somebody to make six or 10 products.\"",
      "The reason, he said, is U.S. manufacturers don't have the capability to make the types of products he's selling, while the costs of manufacturing them himself would be prohibitive. \"I cannot produce a factory that can produce our product at a competitive price,\" Woldenberg said.",
      "To be sure, some businesses have announced plans to build new U.S. plants or hire more workers in recent months. They include tech giant Apple, which in February\u00a0said\u00a0that it's committed to spending more than $500 billion on expanding its U.S. manufacturing capabilities over four years.",
      "But Apple \"is in a different stratosphere than me,\" Woldenberg noted. \"They also have like a dozen products. We have 2,000.\"",
      "Skittish workers",
      "Meantime, Woldenberg said he's committed to keeping his 500 workers employed, likening the current challenges to those his business faced during the pandemic. Now, as then, his employees are worried about the impact of Mr. Trump's trade war and whether their jobs might be at risk, he said.",
      "\"Two days before we were kicked out of our office in March of 2020, I had an all-company meeting and I said, 'We define this as a community problem ... the goal is to get everybody across the river.' And we did that,\" he said. \"No one lost an hour of pay.\"",
      "Woldenberg added, \"I have a very strong commitment to getting them through this, and it's unwavering, and I'll do everything that I can.\"",
      "Even so, Woldenberg wants to see the Trump administration drop their tariff plans.",
      "\"They should go back to the way things were on January 19th and figure out another plan. This one is not working,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "Avelo Airlines is targeting a new passenger segment: migrants being sent to detention centers across the U.S. The budget carrier will also use its planes to fly migrants out of the country under the Trump administration's hardline immigration policies.",
      "Avelo has signed a contract with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to handle deportation flights for U.S. Immigration Control and Enforcement (ICE), the company told CBS MoneyWatch. Avelo, which launched in 2021, said the move is necessary for the Houston-based airline to remain financially stable.",
      "\"We realize this is a sensitive and complicated topic,\" Avelo founder and CEO Andrew Levy said in a statement to CBS News earlier this month after the company struck a deal with ICE. \"After significant deliberations, we determined this charter flying will provide us with the stability to continue expanding our core scheduled passenger service and keep our more than 1,100 crewmembers employed for years to come.\"",
      "The domestic and international flights ferrying migrants will begin May 14 out of a new hub at Mesa Gateway Airport in Phoenix, where Avelo will station three Boeing 737-800 planes to handle the transports. Unlike the company's regular commercial flights, the aircraft used for the trips will not bear Avelo's logo, the company said.",
      "Avelo described the agreement with ICE as a \"long-term charter program.\" The exact terms of the deal were not made public.",
      "The airline is now recruiting flight attendants to staff the flights, according to a\u00a0job posting\u00a0for what it calls a \"charter program for the Department of Homeland Security.\" The job pays $28 an hour for the first year of service.",
      "\"We are seeking energetic, highly motivated Flight Attendants who wish to join a committed group of safety and service professionals at Avelo Airlines,\" the listing reads.",
      "\"Flights will be both domestic and international trips to support DHS's deportation efforts,\" the post adds, although it makes no references to migrants.",
      "Avelo offers flights across the U.S. and to international destinations including the Dominican Republic, Jamaica and Mexico. It operates out of eight hubs across the U.S., flying out of the following airports: Concord-Padgett Regional Airport in North Carolina; Hollywood Burbank Airport in California; Lakeland International Airport in Florida; Raleigh-Durham International Airport in North Carolina; Sonoma County Airport in California; Tweed-New Haven airport in Connecticut; Wilmington Airport in New Hampshire; and Wilmington International Airport in North Carolina.",
      "The company previously operated charter flights as Casino Express Airlines before rebranding as Avelo in 2021, according to S&P Capital IQ.",
      "Avelo declined to comment further on its contract with the government. DHS confirmed to CBS MoneyWatch that Avelo is contracting with ICE to assist with deportation flights.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security has long contracted with CSI Aviation, an aviation broker that provides private air charter services, medical flights for patients in emergencies and government flight services. Under its new contract with ICE, Avelo will operate as a sub-carrier of CSI.",
      "DHS also subcontracts with other air charter companies, which provide planes and operate the flights. One such charter outfit is GlobalX. It handles roughly 70% of DHS' flights, according to immigrant advocate Tom Cartwright of Witness at the Border, an activist group monitoring ICE operations.",
      "GlobalX did not reply to a request for comment on its work with DHS.",
      "Cartwright, who tracks ICE flights through publicly available sources, expressed surprise at Avelo agreeing to shuttle migrants destined for detention centers or deportation.",
      "\"I have never seen a retail airline that sells to consumers being used in this way,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Typically, charter companies that don't fly retail-type flights. They are not selling tickets directly to consumers.\"",
      "According to data on USAspending.gov, a U.S. government website that tracks federal spending, DHS' roughly 6-month contract this year with CSI Aviation is worth at least $78.1 million. Its value could rise to as much as $162.2 million.",
      "The purpose of the agreement, the site states, \"is to provide daily scheduled large aircraft & special high risk charter flights to facilitate ICE's enforcement and removal of operations of illegal aliens.\"",
      "CSI Aviation did not immediately respond to CBS MoneyWatch's request for comment on its contract with the federal government.",
      "Cruising for revenue",
      "Airline industry experts said charter outfits like CSI typically aren't familiar to the general public.",
      "\"Nobody has usually ever heard of the airlines,\" Scott Keyes, founder of Going.com, a flight deals site, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"They are charter airlines that don't have a set schedule on a website,\" he said.",
      "However, an upstart airline hunting for additional revenue streams outside of selling tickets to members of the flying public is not unusual.",
      "\"It's very difficult to compete with the Deltas and Uniteds of the world, so they try any number of tactics,\" Keyes explained. \"They fly to and from smaller cities, they offer bargain-basement prices. There are all different types of counter-positioning things they do.\"",
      "But Avelo's move is more surprising because most commercial airlines don't have enough spare aircraft and crew for specialized operations like migrant flights, noted Seth Miller, founder and editor in chief of PaxEx Aero, an aviation consulting service. Miller said he opposes Avelo working with U.S. immigration authorities on ethical grounds.",
      "Avelo's contract with DHS is also drawing criticism from an immigrant advocacy group. A petition started by the New Haven Immigrants Coalition urging people to boycott Avelo until it severs ties with ICE has collected more than 34,650 signatures.",
      "\"We reject the Trump Administration's inhumane deportation practices, reject cooperation from the State of Connecticut in support of Avelo as long as they are complicit in these practices and pledge to boycott Avelo as long as they are profiting from ICE flights,\" the petition states.",
      "Although federal contracts can provide steady business for airlines and charter carriers, Avelo's partnership with DHS poses a reputational risk, experts told CBS MoneyWatch.",

      "The Trump administration said it will accelerate permit approvals for mining, drilling and fossil fuel production and transportation on public land, fast-tracking a review process that would normally take years.",
      "In announcing the emergency procedures Wednesday, the Department of the Interior, which oversees the management of federal lands and natural resources, said the permitting process will now take up to \"28 days at most\" \u2014 a drastic departure from the current one- to two-year timeline.",
      "The government agency said the move is in response to President Trump's January 20 declaration of a national energy emergency. In an executive order on the first day of his second term, the White House said it would \"eliminate harmful, coercive 'climate' policies that increase the costs of food and fuel.\"",
      "The speedy permitting policy opens the door for the U.S. to expand oil and gas projects and for Mr. Trump to make good on his promise to \"Drill, baby, drill\" \u2014 a common refrain on his campaign trail. The new guidelines will apply to a wide range of energy projects, including crude oil, natural gas and coal.",
      "The U.S. leads the world in\u00a0oil\u00a0and\u00a0gas\u00a0production, with an output of 20 million barrels of oil a day and accounting for roughly a quarter of global gas production, according to the International Energy Agency.",
      "The DOI said it would use emergency authorities under the National Environmental Policy Act, Endangered Species Act and the National Historic Preservation Act to expedite the permitting process.",
      "\"The United States cannot afford to wait,\" Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum said in a statement\u00a0on Wednesday. \"President Trump has made it clear that our energy security is national security, and these emergency procedures reflect our unwavering commitment to protecting both.\"",

      "Environmental advocates rebuked the announcement, saying that in addition to adverse environmental impacts on public land and water sources, the expedited procedures will strip away community members' ability to weigh in on projects happening in their own backyards. Experts say the move is expected to draw legal challenges.",
      "\"What they're proposing to do is basically forgo environmental review or public participation or anything meaningful,\" said Michael Burger, executive director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University. \"The implications of that are extreme.\"",
      "The environmental review process has developed over time, he said, and goes back decades. The Endangered Species Act, one of three statues the DOI is targeting, was signed into law by President Richard Nixon in 1973. Section 7 of the Act requires consultation among agencies \"to ensure their activities are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence\" of federally protected species, according to the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service.",
      "A win for oil and gas industries",
      "The announcement on Wednesday was a win for the American Petroleum Institute, the oil and gas industry's largest lobbying group, which has\u00a0cheered\u00a0Mr. Trump's energy agenda.",
      "\"Our nation's permitting system is broken, and reform is essential to ensuring access to affordable, reliable energy,\" Holly Hopkins, VP of upstream policy at the American Petroleum Institute, said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Former officials from several different federal agencies who served under Mr. Trump's previous term and the Biden administration have told CBS News on background that looming workforce reductions could throw a wrench in the department's plans to speed up the permitting process. Also, breaking with long-standing practices could lead to major slipups, such as oil spills, they added.",
      "The Department of the Interior employs about 70,000 staff members, according to its website. But cuts could be on the horizon. An internal White House document obtained by The Washington Post indicated that as many as 1 in 4 department employees could be let go as a part of a broader series of staff cuts across government agencies.",
      "\"How can you accomplish so much with fewer and fewer people?\" said Burger of Columbia's Sabin Center. \"The only result is less and less oversight.\"",
      "Athan Manuel, director of the Lands Protection Program at the Sierra Club, agreed, adding that gutting the federal agency could hinder the Trump administration's objectives.",
      "\"They just don't seem to understand that these employees run the gamut from wildlife biologists to firefighters, to people who permit oil and gas drilling or permit mines on federal lands,\" he said. \"If it's going to wholesale cut staff, some of the things they care about are going to get caught up in that.\"",
      "The Department of Interior did not respond to request for comment on how layoffs might impact its ability to issue permits on a tighter timetable.",

      "As the late pontiff lies in state in St. Peter's Basilica\u00a0before his funeral at St. Peter's Basilica on Saturday, April 26, Americans are searching for flights to pay their respects in person. Flight searches to Rome surged 250% in the three days following Pope Francis' death on Monday, compared with searches over the same period in 2024, according to travel booking site Expedia.com.",
      "Searches for lodging in Rome through the fare aggregator have also shot up 35% for the same dates, compared to the same period a year ago.

      "Scott Keyes, founder and CEO of flight deals website Going.com, said search interest in travel to Rome for April 21-23 has nearly tripled since the pope's death, compared with the three previous days.",
      "For tourists thinking of booking a jaunt to Italy, the bad news is that the surge in demand for fights to Rome is driving up airfares, according to Going.com. For flights from the U.S. to Rome departing between April 22-25 and returning April 27-30, airfares are up about 33% compared to flight prices in the days leading up to Pope Francis' death.",
      "Fish noted that ticket prices typically rise closest to the travel date, and Expedia is expecting prices for flights to Rome to rise as Friday approaches. That's in part because airlines can't immediately add more capacity despite increased demand, she noted. \"So what you'll likely see is crowded flights and prices spiking today and tomorrow.\"",

      "\"China needs to change. The country knows it needs to change. Everyone knows it needs to change. And we want to help it change \u2014 because we need rebalancing too,\" Bessent said in the speech.",
      "Beijing's export-reliant economic model is \"unsustainable\" and harms both China and the rest of the world, Bessent added. At the same time, the Treasury chief maintained that \"America First does not mean America alone,\" a comment that comes after the Wall Street Journal reported the Trump administration is considering slashing tariffs on China to de-escalate tensions between the two largest global economies.",
      "The stock market rose sharply on Wednesday following news that the trade war could cool off, and after President Trump said he has no plans to oust Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.",
      "Earlier this month, China hiked its retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods to 125%, matching the level of tariffs that President Trump has placed on Chinese imports \u2014 although those import taxes can rise as high as 145% for some products from China.",
      "Bessent made it clear in his speech that the Trump administration wants to see changes in China's export-based economy.",
      "\"It's an unsustainable model that is not only harming China but the entire world,\" Bessent said in a Washington speech, stressing concerns around trade imbalances that Mr. Trump says he hopes to address through sweeping tariffs.",
      "IMF, World Bank",
      "In the same speech, Bessent also said the International Monetary Fund and World Bank need to be made \"fit for purpose\" again, and added that both institutions have strayed from their initial missions.",
      "The IMF \"has no obligation to lend to countries that fail to implement reforms,\" Bessent said. \"Economic stability and growth should be the markers of the IMF's success \u2014 not how much money the institution lends out.\"",
      "He added that the World Bank should also \"no longer expect blank checks for vapid, buzzword-centric marketing accompanied by half-hearted commitments to reform.\"",

    "story": [
      "London\u00a0\u2014 European Union watchdogs fined Apple and Meta hundreds of millions of euros Wednesday as they stepped up enforcement of the 27-nation bloc's digital competition rules. The European Commission imposed a 500 million euro ($571 million) fine on Apple for preventing app makers from pointing users to cheaper options outside its App Store. The commission, which is the EU's executive arm, also fined Meta Platforms 200 million euros ($228 million) because it forced Facebook and Instagram users to choose between seeing ads or paying to avoid them.",
      "The punishments were smaller than the blockbuster multibillion-euro fines that the commission has previously slapped on Big Tech companies in antitrust cases.",
      "Apple and Meta have to comply with the decisions within 60 days or risk unspecified \"periodic penalty payments,\" the commission said.",
      "The decisions were expected to come in March, but officials apparently held off amid an escalating trans-Atlantic trade war with President Trump, who has repeatedly complained about regulations from Brussels affecting American companies.",
      "The penalties were issued under the EU's Digital Markets Act, also known as the DMA. It's a sweeping rulebook that amounts to a set of do's and don'ts designed to give consumers and businesses more choice and prevent Big Tech \"gatekeepers\" from cornering digital markets.",
      "The DMA seeks to ensure \"that citizens have full control over when and how their data is used online, and businesses can freely communicate with their own customers,\" Henna Virkkunen, the commission's executive vice-president for tech sovereignty, said in a statement.",
      "\"The decisions adopted today find that both Apple and Meta have taken away this free choice from their users and are required to change their behavior,\" Virkkunen said.",

      "\"The European Commission is attempting to handicap successful American businesses while allowing Chinese and European companies to operate under different standards,\" Meta Chief Global Affairs Officer Joel Kaplan said in a statement provided by the U.S. tech giant. \"This isn't just about a fine; the Commission forcing us to change our business model effectively imposes a multi-billion-dollar tariff on Meta while requiring us to offer an inferior service. And by unfairly restricting personalized advertising the European Commission is also hurting European businesses and economies.\"",
      "Apple accused the commission of \"unfairly targeting\" the iPhone maker, and said it \"continues to move the goal posts\" despite the company's efforts to comply with the rules.",
      "In the App Store case, the Commission had accused the iPhone maker of imposing unfair rules preventing app developers from freely steering consumers to other channels.",
      "Among the DMA's provisions are requirements to let developers inform customers of cheaper purchasing options and direct them to those offers.",
      "The commission said it ordered Apple to remove technical and commercial restrictions that prevent developers from steering users to other channels, and to end \"non-compliant\" conduct.",
      "Apple said it has \"spent hundreds of thousands of engineering hours and made dozens of changes to comply with this law, none of which our users have asked for.\"",
      "\"Despite countless meetings, the Commission continues to move the goal posts every step of the way,\" the company said.",
      "Apple has also faced a broad antitrust lawsuit in the U.S., where the\u00a0Justice Department alleged\u00a0that the California company illegally engaged in anti-competitive behavior in an effort to build a \"moat around its smartphone monopoly\" and maximize its profits at the expense of consumers. Fifteen states and the District of Columbia have joined the suit as plaintiffs.",
      "The EU's Meta investigation centered on the company's strategy to comply with strict European data privacy rules by giving users the option of paying for ad-free versions of Facebook and Instagram.",
      "Users could pay at least 10 euros ($11) a month to avoid being targeted by ads based on their personal data. The U.S. tech giant rolled out the option after the European Union's top court ruled Meta must first get consent before showing ads to users, in a decision that threatened its business model of tailoring ads based on individual users' online interests and digital activity.",
      "Regulators took issue with Meta's model, saying it doesn't allow users to exercise their right to \"freely consent\" to allowing their personal data from its various services, which also include Facebook Marketplace, WhatsApp and Messenger, to be combined for personalized ads.",
      "Meta rolled out a third option in November giving Facebook and Instagram users in Europe the option to see fewer personalized ads if they don't want to pay for an ad-free subscription. The commission said it's \"currently assessing\" this option and continues to hold talks with Meta, and has asked the company to provide evidence of the new option's impact.",

    "story": [
      "Since the start of President Trump's second term in office, a number of corporations have announced plans to expand their production capabilities in the U.S.",
      "The announcements come as some of the Trump administration's new tariffs\u00a0take effect, with other import duties still pending. Although not all the companies expecting to grow their manufacturing footprint in the U.S. have directly cited the tariffs as a motivating factor, the White House has touted such moves as furthering Mr. Trump's goal of stoking job-creation on home soil.",
      "In March, for example, the White House\u00a0celebrated\u00a0pharmaceutical company Johnson & Johnson's plan to invest $55 billion in U.S. manufacturing, calling it a \"massive victory in President Donald J. Trump's\u00a0unrelenting pursuit\u00a0of American manufacturing dominance\" in a statement on its website.",
      "For most companies, making such a shift would require committing hundreds of millions, or even billions, of dollars to building and expanding U.S. factories, economists say.",
      "Many trade experts are skeptical that even the threat of higher tariffs and political pressure from the White House are enough to spur companies to make such strategic pivots. More commonly, they note, the decision on where to locate factories hinges far more on factors including labor and energy costs; tax rates; political instability; and the regulatory environment.",
      "Economists note that tariffs can help nurture emerging industries and create manufacturing jobs in sectors where consumers can easily substitute a cheaper domestic product for a higher cost foreign one. Levies on foreign imports that aren't key components in other products may also drive domestic investment.",
      "To date, however, the Trump administrations tariffs have been broad-based, rather than narrowly targeted to support a given industry. That is likely to suppress their potential to foster job growth, according to Goldman Sachs economists.",
      "\"The broader statistical evidence points to negative net employment effects\" of tariffs, analysts with the investment bank said in an April 13 report. \"While the range of estimates is wide, academic studies generally find that a 10 [percentage point] increase in tariff rates raises employment in protected industries by 0.2-0.4% but that each 1 [percentage point] increase in tariff-driven costs lowers employment by 0.3-0.6%.\"",

      "\"Requiring reformulation by the end of 2026 ignores scientific evidence and underestimates the complexity of food production. The process is neither simple nor immediate, and the resulting supply disruptions will limit access to familiar, affordable grocery items,\" the International Association of Color Manufacturers said in a statement after the announcement.",
      "The group representing milk, cheese and yogurt manufacturers, the International Dairy Foods Association, announced a \"voluntary\" pledge for some of its members stop adding artificial colors to products supplied to school lunches.",
      "The National Confectioners Association, which represents candy brands, was noncommittal in\u00a0their response, saying that they \"look forward to working with the Trump Administration and Congress on this issue.\"",
      "A\u00a0statement from the Consumer Brands Association, which represents industry giants from Coca-Cola to WK Kellogg, also stopped short of pledging to remove all synthetic dyes by 2026, but said they \"appreciate that the administration has reasserted their leadership\" in response to a patchwork of state laws.",
      "\"Removing these safe ingredients does not change the consumer packaged goods industry's commitment to providing safe, affordable and convenient product choices to consumers,\" the association said.",
      "Why Makary opposes synthetic dyes",
      "Ending the use of artificial dyes has long been a goal of Kennedy's agenda, over concerns that these colors are inflating the consumption of unhealthy foods and raising the risk of potentially worrying behavioral changes in children, among other risks.",
      "\"Why are we taking a gamble? Parents, moms and dads have also tried to raise attention to this issue. Some parents have observed that these chemicals cause hyperactivity and even aggressive behavior, and that it subsides when the chemicals are removed from the diet,\" said Makary.",
      "Makary said that the scientific community \"has conducted a number of studies raising concerns about the correlation\" between synthetic dyes derived from petroleum and health conditions like ADHD, obesity, stomach or digestive issues and allergies.",
      "\"Other studies have found that artificial colors that create vibrant colors mess with the child's developing brain to make ultra-processed foods more attractive, even when the child already feels full,\" said Makary.",
      "Under the Biden administration, the FDA moved to revoke the authorization for one synthetic dye, Red 3, after studies suggested that the color additive could cause cancer in laboratory animals at high doses.",
      "The food and drug industry has a few years to stop using the food dye completely. Makary said they are asking companies to stop using the dye sooner than the deadlines laid out by the agency under the law, which are as late as 2028 for drugmakers.",
      "While FDA officials at the time said the way that Red 3 caused cancer in animals did not apply to humans, officials said their hands were tied by a law called the Delaney Clause that required them to pull any additives from the market shown to cause cancer in animals.",
      "The agency has faced calls for years to pull other synthetic food dyes derived from petroleum like Red 40, which is largely absent from food in some other countries.",
      "Pressure on the agency has stepped up in recent years, after an influential report by California authorities\u00a0in 2021 concluded that synthetic food dyes \"can cause or exacerbate neuro-behavioral problems in some children.\" A handful of states have now moved to ban the use of these synthetic food dyes in school meal programs.",
      "For years in Europe, companies adding Red 40 and some other synthetic dyes have also had to add a warning label to their products saying that they \"may have an adverse effect on activity and attention in children.\"",
      "However, FDA officials had previously said that the data was a far cry from being enough to merit banning the dyes. The agency also closely oversees the production of synthetic food dyes, checking for impurities that might result in a safety risk.",
      "Makary said Tuesday's announcement calling for food companies to stop using the artificial dyes \"fulfills the administration's promise to use both gold-standard science and common sense.\"",
      "\"For the last 50 years, we have been running one of the largest uncontrolled scientific experiments in the world, on our nation's children, without their consent,\" said Makary.",

    "published": "Wed, 23 Apr 2025 06:49:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Allianz survey finds that nearly two-thirds of Americans are more worried about running out of money in retirement than they are about dying.",
    "story": [
      "Faced with inflation, taxes and concerns over the size of Social Security benefits, most Americans are more afraid of going broke in retirement than they are of death.",
      "That's according to a new study from Allianz Life that surveyed 1,000 U.S. adults aged 25 years and older with annual incomes of $50,000 and above. In total, 64% of respondents across generations said they are more stressed about running out of funds in their golden years than the prospect of death.",
      "\"It's much higher right now than it has been for quite a while,\" said Kelly LaVigne, VP of consumer insights at Allianz Life. The company has been polling people on the question of whether dying or running out of money worries them more since 2022.",
      "Americans say they need $1.26 million to finance a comfortable retirement, according to a\u00a0recent study by Northwestern Mutual. That's $200,000 lower than last year's estimate, but still a far cry from the median amount of $87,000 people have saved in their retirement accounts, according to Federal Reserve Board's\u00a0Survey of Consumer Finances.",
      "Among the different age groups, Gen Xers, for whom retirement is fast approaching, are the most concerned about running out of money before they die. Seventy percent of the age group expressed concern, followed by 61% of boomers. Ages 61 to 79, boomers are already in their retirement era, while Gen Xers, ages 45 to 60, will be the next generation to retire.",
      "\"Certainly for boomers who are already in retirement, inflation is a big deal because you only have a certain amount of money that you're going to have for the rest of your life,\" said LaVigne.",
      "Tough time to save money",
      "Though Inflation rates have eased since peaking in June 2022, the cost of basic living expenses\u00a0is still rising, making it difficult for Americans to sock away extra savings. Over 50% of those surveyed by Allianz said high inflation contributed to their fear of running out of money in retirement.",
      "Other factors contributing to Americans' fears include high taxes and concern over whether monthly Social Security payments will provide them with enough financial support. For the average American, Social Security benefits typically replaces about 40% of their income, LaVigne said.",
      "Recent shake-ups at the Social Security Administration carried out by the Trump Administration's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, have also stoked fears about the stability of the government agency.",
      "LaVigne's advice for distressed savers: Don't let fear stop you from seeking help. \"You really want to make sure that you're working with a professional to help you get through the times like this, where there's a lot of uncertainty,\" he said.",

      "More than 5 million borrowers are in default and 4 million more could be in the same position in a few months, which would put nearly a quarter of the federal student loan portfolio in default, according to the Education Department. Less than 40% of borrowers are current on their student loan payments.",
      "In the next two weeks, those in default will receive emails informing them of the next steps and urging them to look into repayment options. Wage garnishment notices will be sent out later this summer.",
      "No federal student loan has been referred to collections since March 2020 when President Trump paused payments and interest accrual during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Biden administration extended that pause, which ended in October 2024.",
      "Former President Joe Biden sought to wipe out student loan debt for tens of millions of people during his four years in the White House, but the effort was repeatedly rejected by courts, including a 2023 ruling by the Supreme Court. Still, the Biden administration erased student loan debt for more than 5 million borrowers through other forgiveness programs.",

    "summary": "President Trump said he isn't planning on firing Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell, one day after calling Powell a \"major loser.\"",
    "story": [
      "President Trump said Tuesday he has \"no intention of firing\"\u00a0Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell, one day after the president called Powell a \"major loser\" and publicly lobbied the central bank chief to lower interest rates at a faster clip.",
      "When asked by reporters in the Oval Office if he has any plans to fire Powell, Mr. Trump said he \"never did\" and claimed \"the press runs away with things\" \u2014 though he once again pressed Powell to cut interest rates, which remain elevated after the Fed hiked rates to quell inflation.",
      "\"This is a perfect time to lower interest rates,\" Mr. Trump said. \"If he doesn't, is it the end? No, it's not. But it would be good timing.\"",
      "Last week, Mr. Trump argued in a social media post that Powell is \"always TOO LATE AND WRONG,\" and said his \"termination cannot come fast enough,\" drawing speculation that the president could try to oust Powell before his four-year term ends next year.",
      "Powell has led the Fed since 2018, after Mr. Trump initially nominated him for the job. Former President Joe Biden nominated Powell for a second term, bringing his time atop the central bank to at least May 2026.",
      "It's not clear if Mr. Trump has the power to fire Powell. According to federal law and past legal precedent, members of the Federal Reserve board \u2014 which includes the chair \u2014 can only be removed from their jobs before their terms expire \"for cause.\" However, the Trump administration has argued it has the legal right to fire members of other independent federal agencies, setting up a court fight over the issue that could have broad consequences.",
      "The administration will \"study\" whether it has the right to fire Powell, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett told reporters last week.",
      "For his part, Powell\u00a0said last year he will not step down if Mr. Trump asks him to leave his job.",
      "Why is Trump criticizing Powell \u2014 and why does it matter?",
      "Mr. Trump's feud with Powell revolves around the Fed's decision to leave interest rates steady so far this year, after lowering rates from a decades-long high in late 2024. The decision has broad implications. Cutting interest rates can lead to higher economic growth and lower borrowing costs for businesses and consumers, which is why Mr. Trump is lobbying for cuts. But lower rates can also boost inflation. And while the inflation rate is now well below its 2022 peak, it remains above the Fed's 2% year-over-year benchmark.",
      "Powell has cited \"uncertainty\" for the Fed's decision to pause rate cuts. Last week, Powell warned\u00a0that Mr. Trump's steep tariffs on foreign imports could lead to higher inflation and slower economic growth, posing a \"challenging scenario\" for the central bank.",
      "Days later, Mr. Trump repeatedly lashed out at Powell on social media, calling him \"Mr. Too Late\" on Monday and arguing the Federal Reserve should slash rates more aggressively because there is \"virtually No Inflation.\"",
      "The showdown \u2014 and the possibility Mr. Trump could try to fire Powell \u2014 have sparked concerns about whether the Federal Reserve will maintain its independence, allowing it to make decisions about economic policy without political influence. Stocks slumped Monday amid concerns about upheaval at the Fed, before rebounding Tuesday.",
      "In an interview Sunday with \"Face the Nation,\" Austan Goolsbee, the president of the Chicago Federal Reserve, warned that a loss of independence would \"undermine the credibility of the Fed.\" Countries without independent central banks typically have worse inflation, slower economic growth and more sluggish job markets, he said.",
      "Meanwhile, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters earlier Tuesday the president \"has the right to express...his displeasure with the Fed, and he has the right to say he believes interest rates should be lower.\" Leavitt also said Mr. Trump believes the Fed has \"been making moves and taking action in the name of politics.\"",
      "Mr. Trump has lashed out at Powell for years. The president sharply criticized Powell when the Fed hiked interest rates in 2018, before calling the central banker his \"most improved player\" after the COVID-19 pandemic prompted steep rate cuts in 2020.",

    "story": [
      "Tesla CEO Elon Musk is facing a corporate reckoning on Tuesday, with the electric car maker's first-quarter results showing sales and profit fell short of analyst expectations while the billionaire was focused on leading the Trump administration's cost-cutting efforts.",
      "Ahead of the quarterly report, investors submitted questions to Tesla they hoped to get answered during the company's earnings conference call. A top issue flagged by investors is Elon Musk himself, with dozens asking about his focus on the Trump administration's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, and when he might redirect his energies to running Tesla.",
      "\"Can Elon please provide some reassurance that at some point soon he will be done with DOGE and politics?\" one investor asked. \"Many Tesla shareholders wish he would reprioritize the majority of his time and effort to engineering.\"",
      "That's a question that Wall Street also wants answered. Tesla's stock price has plunged 53% from its most recent high in December, when the stock was pushed higher after President Trump's electoral victory on optimism that Musk's role advising Mr. Trump would help the EV maker's bottom line.",
      "But Musk's activities with DOGE \u2014 including cutting tens of thousands of federal workers and accessing taxpayers' personal data \u2014 have alienated some consumers and sparked protests across the globe, causing the stock price to deflate.",
      "Investors got an answer on Tuesday afternoon, with Musk announcing on a call to discuss the company's earnings that he plans to scale back his time spent on DOGE, beginning next month.",
      "\"Starting probably in next month, in May, my time allocation to DOGE will drop significantly,\" Musk said.",
      "But Musk added he plans to continue his involvement with DOGE throughout Mr. Trump's term, saying he will likely spend one to two days a week on government issues moving forward. \"Starting next month, I'll be allocating far more of my time to Tesla,\" he said.",
      "Musk also defended his work on DOGE, saying that he needed to \"fight the waste and fraud and try to get the country back on the right track.\"",
      "Tariff impact",
      "The company cautioned that \"trade policy\" and \"changing political sentiment\" could impact demand for its products in the near term. Mr. Trump's tariffs are expected to result in higher prices for many vehicles, including Teslas.",
      "Musk also said he would like to see lower tariffs, but that the decision is Mr. Trump's. \"I'm advocating for lower tariffs, rather than higher, but that's all I can do,\" the Tesla CEO said in the earnings call.",
      "The company's first-quarter results were \"grim,\" equity analyst Adam Crisafulli of Vital Knowledge said in a note to investors. [E]xpectations were very low, but these are still bad numbers.\"",
      "Tesla's transformation into a symbol of the Trump administration has dampened demand for the vehicles, and could reduce demand for Tesla vehicles by 15% to 20% due to consumers who don't want to be associated with the billionaire, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a research note.",
      "\"Musk needs to leave the government, take a major step back on DOGE, and get back to being CEO of Tesla full-time,\" Ives concluded.",
      "What time is the Tesla earnings call?",
      "Tesla's earnings fell short of analyst expectations. The company reported a per-share profit of 27 cents, compared with an average forecast of 41 cents per share, according to analysts surveyed by FactSet.",
      "Net income tumbled 71% to $409 million, versus $1.39 billion in the year-earlier quarter. Sales slid 9% to $19.3 billion, far short of the $21.3 billion expected by analysts.",
      "Tesla shares, which have fallen 41% this year, were largely flat in after-hours trading.",
      "Earlier this month, Tesla said its delivery of vehicles in the first three months of 2025 fell nearly 13% as demand for the automaker's electric cars continued to weaken, with deliveries also falling well short of analysts' expectations.",
      "In assessing Tesla's latest financial results, Crisafulli thinks Tesla boosters are likely to focus on the company's plan to start testing its Robotaxi and a humanoid robot called Optimus later this year, as well as beginning production of a lower cost vehicle in the months ahead.",
      "But more bearish observers will conclude \"there's no reason to think things are about to get a lot better\" at Tesla, he said, adding that its Robotaxi service is well behind Alphabet's Waymo self-driving vehicle rollout.",
      "Under this view, \"Musk's personal brand has been permanently tarnished by his political activities in the last several months, and exiting DOGE won't change that. On top of all this, the stock remains very expensive,\" Crisafulli said.",
      "In addition to insights into Musk's role at Tesla, investors will also be listening for updates on several strategic initiatives. The company is expected to roll out a cheaper version of its best-selling vehicle, the Model Y SUV, later in the year. Tesla has also said it plans to start a paid driverless robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, in June.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/chapter-7-bankuptcy-file-consumer-debt/",
    "published": "Tue, 22 Apr 2025 16:18:38 -0400",
    "summary": "Record consumer debt, years of steep inflation and other factors are driving more Americans to considering filing for bankruptcy.",
    "story": [
      "The number of Americans considering bankruptcy is soaring to its highest level since just before the pandemic, a potentially alarming sign as clouds gather over the economy.",
      "Personal bankruptcy inquiries surged in the first three months of the year, according to data from LegalShield, a provider of consumer legal services. The jump could augur a potential wave of\u00a0bankruptcy filings\u00a0as consumers start to buckle under a record level of debt and as\u00a0tariffs fuel inflation, the company warned in a report this week.",
      "Personal bankruptcy filings in the U.S. averaged about 750,000 a year before COVID-19, but fell sharply during the pandemic itself as Americans were buoyed by trillions of dollars in government aid and relief.",
      "LegalShield now expects bankruptcies to surge as soon as this this summer. \"Consumers are calling lawyers to ask questions because they can't pay their bills or are having trouble, and they ask about the process of filing for bankruptcy,\" Matt Layton, LegalShield senior vice president of consumer analytics, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Why are more Americans mulling bankruptcy?",
      "Heavy consumer debts, years of stiff inflation and higher interest rates are squeezing Americans' budgets, according to Layton. Billing disputes, debt collections and other leading indicators of bankruptcy are also on the rise.",
      "\"Our members are calling and saying, 'I don't have enough money at the end of month to pay my bills.' They're asking which ones to pay and which ones to put off. They're saying, 'They're coming to get my car \u2014 what can I do about these things?'\" Layton said.",
      "The jump in Americans who are considering declaring bankruptcy reflects the tough economic economic and financial conditions that have prevailed 2020, experts said. Total household debt as of the end of 2024 hit an all-time of\u00a0$18 trillion, while the percentage of Americans falling seriously behind on their debts also rose last year, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.",
      "\"Quarterly filings from the U.S. courts will come out soon, and I'd expect to see a quarter-over-quarter increase in personal bankruptcy filings from the end of 2024 to the beginning of 2025,\" Pamela Foohey, a bankruptcy professor at the University of Georgia School of Law, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"I am not surprised attorneys say they're hearing from people who are looking to file for bankruptcy now because it's April. This is when people get their tax returns, so they have money to file for bankruptcy with,\" she added, noting that it costs money to file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, the most common type of personal filing. \"If they are getting their tax return, that's the time to file because they have an infusion of money.\"",
      "Economists warn that the Trump administration's economic policies, including heavy tariffs on China and other key trading partners, is likely to stoke inflation while dampening economic growth. Still, the flood of people weighing bankruptcy now reflects the steady rise in financial stress in recent years rather than current economic conditions, Foohey emphasized.",
      "\"Rising [bankruptcy] filings will show that people have been struggling with their finances for years when they do file, and things have been getting incrementally worse month after month now for years,\" she said. \"It's been building, and it's only going to get worse unless something is done about inflation, unless something is done about tariffs.\"",
      "When should you file for bankruptcy?",
      "As Foohey notes, bankruptcy typically comes after a prolonged period of financial stress. Although some Americans struggle to overcome the stigma of bankruptcy, experts recommend filing for protection sooner rather than later in order to shield their assets from creditors.",
      "Filing for bankruptcy can help an individual liquidate their assets to pay off their debt or create a repayment plan. Individuals may file for file\u00a0Chapter 7\u00a0or\u00a0Chapter 13\u00a0bankruptcy, and all bankruptcy cases are handled in federal courts.",
      "But bankruptcy expert Robert Lawless, a professor at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign College of Law, said declaring bankruptcy accomplishes one thing: wiping out people's debt.",
      "\"It doesn't get you a job, it doesn't get you a raise, it doesn't put money on the table,\" he said. \"Filing for bankruptcy protection doesn't make sense when things are still on the way down. It makes sense to file when you're in the hole, but starting to climb out of it.\"",

    "story": [
      "The wife of an active-duty Coast Guardsman was arrested earlier this week by federal immigration authorities inside the family residential section of the U.S. Naval Air Station at Key West, Florida, after she was flagged in a routine security check, officials said Saturday.",
      "\"The spouse is not a member of the Coast Guard and was detained by Homeland Security Investigations pursuant to a lawful removal order,\" said Coast Guard spokesperson Lt. Cmdr. Steve Roth in a statement confirming Thursday's on-base arrest. \"The Coast Guard works closely with HSI and others to enforce federal laws, including on immigration.\"",
      "The arrest happened on move-in day at the base",
      "According to a U.S. official, the woman's work visa expired around 2017, and she was marked for removal from the United States a few years later. She and the Coast Guardsman were married early this year, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss an enforcement incident.",
      "Though the Trump administration has made immigration arrests a top priority for federal law enforcement, it did not immediately appear the on-base arrest of the military spouse was part of a broader sweep.",
      "The official said that when the woman and her Coast Guard husband were preparing to move into their on-base housing on Wednesday, they went to the visitor control center to get a pass so she could access the Key West installation. During the routine security screening required for base access, the woman's name was flagged as a problem.",
      "Base personnel contacted the Naval Criminal Investigative Service, which looked into the matter, said the official. NCIS and Coast Guard security personnel got permission from the base commander to enter the installation and then went to the Coast Guardsman's home on Thursday, the official said. They were joined by personnel from Homeland Security Investigations, a unit within Immigration and Customs Enforcement.",
      "HSI eventually took the spouse into custody, and the official said they believe she is still being detained. Officials did not provide the name of the country she is from.",
      "The Coast Guard referred questions about the woman's identity, immigration status and charges to ICE, which did not respond to a request for comment on Saturday. The Department of Homeland Security also did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "The husband of the arrested woman is a Coast Guardsman assigned to the USCGC Mohawk, a 270-foot-long cutter based at Key West. The couple was moving into U.S. government housing at the nearby Naval Air Station.",
      "An online database that tracks ship movements shows the Mohawk has been docked in its home port since mid-March. A March 16 media release says the ship had recently returned following a 70-day deployment to the Eastern Pacific Ocean on a mission to intercept shipments of illegal drugs.",
      "In a statement, the Navy said that it \"fully cooperated with federal law enforcement authorities on this matter. We take security and access at naval installations seriously.\"",

      "The Washington Hilton is also known for one of the darkest moments in presidential history. On March 30, 1981, President Ronald Reagan had just finished speaking at a union convention and was emerging from the hotel when he was struck by a bullet from would-be assassin John Hinckley Jr. .",
      "Reagan survived and returned to the hotel less than six months later.",
      "Now, there is a plaque that commemorates the assassination attempt.

If you and I ignored that order, we'd be in jail. But you've got members of Congress out there saying, 'You don't have to open the door for ICE, they need a warrant. You don't have to talk to ICE.'

    "story": [
      "A Department of Health and Human Services official said Friday that the health department is not creating an autism registry, contradicting an announcement made days ago by the director of the National Institutes of Health describing his plans to study causes of autism.",
      "\"We are not creating an autism registry. The real-world data platform will link existing datasets to support research into causes of autism and insights into improved treatment strategies,\" an official for the department told CBS News in an emailed statement.",
      "The plans outlined by NIH Director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya to amass a broad swath of confidential health data, as part of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s autism research effort, have been the subject of intense criticism in recent days by advocacy groups and autism researchers.",
      "Some providers diagnosing and treating people with autism have been deluged by requests to scrub their data and cancel appointments, multiple federal health officials told CBS News, over concerns about patient privacy and worries it would be used to support unfounded claims.",
      "News of the HHS reversal contradicting Bhattacharya was first reported by STAT News.",
      "The NIH director previously said, as part of a presentation to a meeting of the agency's outside advisers about the effort, that the NIH would be \"developing national disease registries, including a new one for autism\" to be integrated into a new \"data platform\" to study autism and other chronic diseases.",
      "The HHS official did not say whether Bhattacharya initially misspoke or explain why his plan was reversed. Bhattacharya did not respond to a request for comment. HHS has not responded to a CBS News request for an interview with Bhattacharya about the registry.",
      "Some $50 million will be invested in the research effort, which includes the data platform, the HHS official's statement said, which is \"aimed at understanding the causes of ASD [autism spectrum disorder] and improving treatments by leveraging large-scale data resources and fostering cross-sector collaboration.\"",
      "According to the official, the NIH still plans to explore partnerships with other federal agencies, including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, \"to facilitate a comprehensive real-world health dataset that maintains the highest standards of security and patient privacy while supporting research into autism and other areas such as chronic diseases.\"",
      "In a statement to CBS News, the NIH said its \"secure data repository\" would \"analyze large-scale, de-identified data\" for autism and chronic diseases, similar to the agency's cancer database. The autism research would \"be fully compliant\" with federal privacy laws and regulations, the agency said.",
      "\"These efforts are not about tracking individuals. All NIH-managed databases follow the highest standards of security and privacy, with the protection of personal health information as a top priority,\" the NIH said.",
      "The HHS statement marks the latest change to Kennedy's autism research effort in recent weeks, since he first announced the push at a White House meeting earlier this month.",
      "Bhattacharya told reporters earlier this week that he anticipated grant funding for the autism research would \"hopefully\" be awarded by September. That is later than the initial timeline outlined by Kennedy, who has said that \"by September, we will know what has caused the autism epidemic.\"",
      "\"It's hard to guarantee when science will make an advance. It depends on, you know, nature has its say,\" Bhattacharya has said.",

    "summary": "Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told \"Face the Nation\" that the Kremlin is \"ready to reach a deal,\" but some elements need to be \"fine tuned.\"",
    "story": [
      "Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said Thursday that the Kremlin is \"ready to reach a deal\" with the U.S. on Ukraine, though he also said some elements need to be \"fine tuned.\"",
      "\"The President of the United States believes, and I think rightly so, that we are moving in the right direction,\" Lavrov said in an interview Thursday with \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Lavrov declined to say what is being discussed in negotiations or whether any deal was imminent. He said the negotiations are \"not supposed to be public.\"",
      "\"The negotiations continue, and until the end of the negotiations, we cannot disclose what it is about,\" Lavrov said.",
      "The comments came after Russia struck Kyiv overnight Thursday, killing at least eight people and injuring more than 70, in the deadliest assault on the Ukrainian capital in months as President Trump pushes a proposal for an end to the war.",
      "Asked by Brennan what made it worth killing civilians after Ukraine had said in March that it's ready for a ceasefire, Lavrov said \"we only target military goals or civilian sites used by the military,\" adding that \"President Putin expressed this for so many times, and this is not different this time as well.\"",
      "Lavrov suggested that the attack was intentional, arguing that \"if this was a target used by the Ukrainian military,\" then the minister of defense and commanders in the field \"have the right to attack them.\"",
      "Still, on the talks with Ukraine, there are \"several signs that we are moving in the right direction,\" Lavrov said. Among them, he cited Mr. Trump as \"probably the only leader on Earth who recognized the need to address the root causes of this situation.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Mr. Trump issued a rare rebuke of the Russian president in a post on Truth Social Thursday morning, saying he's \"not happy\" with the Kyiv strikes, while noting that they took place as he worked to reach a peace deal. It was \"very bad timing,\" he said and addressed Putin, saying, \"Vladimir, STOP!\"",
      "Russia launched the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, after first sending troops into eastern Ukraine in 2014. Russia has claimed its offensive invasion was provoked by Ukraine and the West, an assertion that has been rejected by the U.S. and Europe.",
      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly said he believes Russia wants peace and continues to publicly criticize Ukraine's democratically elected leader, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, in spite of Ukraine's acceptance of his proposed 30-day ceasefire. And along the campaign trail, he pledged to negotiate an end to the war in a day. But almost 100 days into his administration, an agreement eludes him.",
      "On Wednesday, Vice President JD Vance warned that Russia and Ukraine must reach a peace deal, as envoys from the U.K., France, the U.S, Ukraine and Germany met in London. Vance said the White House has \"issued a very explicit proposal to both the Russians and the Ukrainians, and it's time for them to either say yes, or for the United States to walk away from this process.\"",
      "Vance said the window for diplomacy was closing, and the U.S. envisions a freeze of military conflict more or less along existing lines. The Institute for the Study of War estimates that Russia holds roughly 18% of Ukrainian territory. In the meantime, U.S. envoy Keith Kellogg met in London with European allies and Ukraine on Wednesday. European partners are concerned that the U.S. position is focused on pressuring Ukraine, which is the victim of the Russian invasion, and not extracting any concessions to date from the aggressor.",
      "Later Wednesday, Mr. Trump accused Zelenskyy of prolonging the conflict by saying he wouldn't accept Russian control of Crimea as part of a ceasefire agreement. Crimea, located in Ukraine's southern peninsula, has been occupied by Russia since 2014.",
      "Mr. Trump said in a post that the U.S. had not asked Zelenskyy to recognize Crimea as Russian territory, though he also said, \"Crimea was lost years ago,\" while Barack Obama was president. Mr. Trump said the parties are \"very close to a Deal, but the man with 'no cards to play' should now, finally, GET IT DONE.\"",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters in the Oval Office Thursday afternoon that \"we're putting a lot of pressure on Russia,\" although it was unclear what pressure he was referencing. The U.S. has not placed new sanctions on Russia, and the president has argued he considers it a concession by Putin that he has not seized Ukraine in its entirety. Mr. Trump reiterated that he thinks Russia \"wants to make a deal,\" but \"it takes two to tango.\"",
      "\"You have to have Ukraine want to make a deal too, and they're being hit very hard, and I do believe they want to make a deal,\" the president said.",
      "Zelenskyy reposted on social media a 2018 statement by then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo about Crimea that said, \"the United States reaffirms as policy its refusal to recognize the Kremlin's claims of sovereignty over territory seized by force in contravention of international law.\"",
      "That policy of arming Ukraine, and rejecting Russia's seizure of territory by force seems to have changed during the second Trump administration.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who joined the president Thursday at the bilateral meeting with Norway's prime minister in the Oval Office, added that \"this war is endable,\" citing a \"great meeting\" on Wednesday, and meetings to come over the weekend.",
      "\"We've shown them the finish line, we need both of them to say yes,\" Rubio said. \"But what happened last night with those missile strikes should remind everybody of why this war needs to end.\"",

      "While it has not accused Khalil of any criminal wrongdoing, the Trump administration has cited two legal grounds to argue the Columbia University activist should nonetheless be deported from the U.S.",
      "The administration has accused Khalil of committing immigration fraud by withholding certain information on his green card application and argued he's also deportable due to a determination by Secretary of State Marco Rubio that his presence and activities pose \"adverse foreign policy consequences\" for the U.S. Khalil's lawyers have refuted both accusations.",
      "Earlier this month, an immigration judge in Louisiana ruled the administration could continue its bid to deport Khalil, saying she could not second-guess Rubio's determination, which cites a rarely used law. She held in abeyance the immigration fraud accusation.",
      "This week, Khalil formally submitted an application in immigration court to request asylum and withholding of removal, another legal protection from deportation, according to his attorneys.",
      "That immigration court case in Louisiana is progressing alongside a lawsuit in federal district court in New Jersey challenging the legality of Khalil's detention.

      "A federal judge in California issued a preliminary injunction Thursday blocking the Trump administration from pulling funds from so-called \"sanctuary cities\" following a lawsuit brought by San Francisco and other local governments across the U.S.",
      "\"The Cities and Counties have also demonstrated a likelihood of irreparable harm,\" Judge William Orrick of the Northern District of California wrote in the order. \"The threat to withhold funding causes them irreparable injury in the form of budgetary uncertainty, deprivation of constitutional rights, and undermining trust between the Cities and Counties and the communities they serve.\"",
      "Orrick heard arguments at a hearing that took place in San Francisco on Wednesday afternoon.",
      "The plaintiffs are seeking to block President Trump from enforcing executive orders that would halt federal funding to cities and other local governments that limit local cooperation with federal immigration agents through sanctuary policies.",
      "Officials in San Francisco and Santa Clara County, California initially filed a lawsuit in February, which has since been joined by several other cities and counties in California, along with Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minnesota; Santa Fe, New Mexico; and Seattle, Washington.",
      "\"The Court's ruling puts an immediate pause on the Trump Administration's illegal attempts to freeze federal funding simply because it disagrees with local governments' constitutionally protected decision not to use local resources for immigration enforcement,\" Santa Clara County Counsel Tony LoPresti said in a statement.",
      "San Francisco City Attorney David Chiu said in a statement ahead of Wednesday's hearing that Trump administration officials \"want to commandeer local police officers as federal [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] agents, while strong-arming local officials with threats of withholding federal funds that support our police department, our efforts to address homelessness, and our public health system.\"",
      "\"As we have seen, the Trump Administration has now deported someone by error, and ICE agents have unlawfully arrested United States citizens,\" Chiu alleged.",
      "In an interview with CBS News Bay Area Thursday afternoon, Chiu said, \"We're really grateful to the judge here for reiterating what we knew from eight years ago.\"",
      "San Francisco sued the first Trump administration in 2017 after it tried to withhold federal funds from the city because of its sanctuary policies. The city prevailed in that suit in 2018 after an appeals court ruled the policies were legal and the withholding of funds was unconstitutional.",
      "\"We prevailed then as we just prevailed this morning,\" Chiu went on to say.",

    "summary": "President Trump's executive order would require documentary proof of U.S. citizenship in order to register to vote in federal elections.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A federal judge on Thursday agreed to block portions of President Trump's executive order that seeks to overhaul U.S. elections, including a provision that would require documentary proof of U.S. citizenship in order to register to vote in federal elections.",
      "U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly agreed to partially grant a preliminary injunction sought by three different groups of plaintiffs, including voting rights groups and the Democratic Party, finding that they are likely to prevail in their challenge.",
      "The judge blocked the Trump administration from implementing two provisions of the executive order signed by the president last month: the first orders the Election Assistance Commission, a federal independent regulatory commission, to add a \"documentary proof of U.S. citizenship\" requirement to the standardized national voter registration form; and the second ordered federal voter registration agencies to \"assess\" citizenship before providing a federal voter registration form to people who receive public assistance.",
      "Kollar-Kotelly, appointed by former President Bill Clinton, said that the president generally does not have the power to regulate federal elections.",
      "\"Our Constitution entrusts Congress and the states \u2014not the president \u2014 with the authority to regulate federal elections,\" Kollar-Kotelly wrote in a 120-page opinion. \"Consistent with that allocation of power, Congress is currently debating legislation that would effect many of the changes the president purports to order. And no statutory delegation of authority to the executive branch permits the president to short-circuit Congress's deliberative process by executive order.\"",
      "In response to the decision, Harrison Fields, a White House spokesperson, said, \"President Trump will keep fighting for election integrity, despite Democrat objections that reveal their disdain for commonsense safeguards like verifying citizenship. Free and fair elections are the bedrock of our Constitutional Republic, and we're confident in securing an ultimate victory in the courtroom.\"",
      "Mr. Trump's directive follows years of unfounded claims raised by him and his allies that the 2020 election was rigged against him, allegations the president has continued to amplify during his second term in the White House. The order claims that the U.S. \"now fails to enforce basic and necessary election protections employed by modern, developed nations, as well as those still developing.\"",
      "\"Free, fair, and honest elections unmarred by fraud, errors, or suspicion are fundamental to maintaining our constitutional Republic. The right of American citizens to have their votes properly counted and tabulated, without illegal dilution, is vital to determining the rightful winner of an election,\" the executive order states.",
      "While Congress has the power to decide how federal elections are run, and has done so through laws like the National Voter Registration Act and the Help America Vote Act, the Constitution gives state legislatures the authority to set the \"times, places and manner\" of holding elections.",
      "In addition to the now-blocked citizenship-related requirements, the president's executive order seeks to give the White House's Department of Government Efficiency and states access to certain databases to identify any noncitizens who are registered to vote; orders the attorney general to enforce two laws against states that include absentee or mail-in ballots received after Election Day in the final tally of votes for president and Congress; and orders the Election Assistance Commission to condition federal funds on states adopting Election Day as the deadline for receiving ballots.",
      "Those provisions were at the center of the lawsuits filed by a slew of voting rights groups and arms of the Democratic Party, including the Democratic National Committee and the party's congressional leaders. They argued that the president did not have the power to issue those changes and could not make them unilaterally.",
      "Kollar-Kotelly agreed that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed in their challenge to two sections of the order, requiring documentary proof of citizenship on the federal voter registration form and requiring people enrolled in public assistance programs to have their citizenship assessed before getting the federal voter registration form.",
      "But she declined to stop the Trump administration from implementing the other parts of the president's order as the litigation moves forward.",
      "The Justice Department will likely appeal the decision.",
      "As to the proof-of-citizenship requirement, Kollar-Kotelly wrote neither the Constitution nor federal voter registration law gives the president the authority to direct the Election Assistance Commission to change what is on the federal registration form.",
      "\"The president is free to state his views about what policies he believes that Congress, the EAC, or other federal agencies should consider or adopt. But in this case, the president has done much more than state his views: He has issued an 'order' directing that an independent commission 'shall' act to 'require' changes to an important document, the contents of which Congress has tightly regulated,\" the judge wrote. \"That command exceeds the president's authority.\"",
      "On the second provision that Kollar-Kotelly blocked, she said people applying for public assistance programs are entitled to the federal voter registration form, not recipients who have complied with the identification requirements imposed by the programs.",
      "She said provisions of the National Voter Registration Act \"make clear that voter registration agencies' only role in enforcing states' citizenship requirement for voting is to provide the federal form to the applicant, who must then self-certify citizenship by signing the application 'under penalty of perjury.' The statute leaves no role for agencies to 'assess citizenship,' and the president lacks any lawful authority to contravene the NVRA by requiring agencies to do so.\"",
      "Roman Palomares, national president of the voting rights group LULAC, cheered Kollar-Kotelly's decision as a victory for voters and democracy.",
      "\"Efforts to silence the voice and votes of the U.S. electorate must not stand because our democracy depends on all voters feeling confident that they can vote freely and that their vote will be counted accurately,\" he said in a statement.",
      "The American Civil Liberties Union and co-counsel partners, which are representing the League of Women Voters, said in a joint statement that the judge's decision provides protections for eligible voters, many of which do not have easy access to a passport or other citizenship documents.",
      "\"The president's attempted takeover of federal elections is a blatant overreach to seize power that doesn't belong to him. Under the Constitution, that power belongs to the U.S. Congress and states,\" they said. \"The president lacks authority to rewrite the country's election rules on his own by weaponizing an independent, bipartisan commission to harm eligible voters. The order should ultimately be struck down.\"",

    "story": [
      "A New Hampshire federal judge on Thursday restricted the Trump administration's ability to cut or withhold federal funding from public schools that participate in some diversity and equity initiatives.",
      "U.S. District Judge Landya McCafferty, appointed by former President Barack Obama, found that actions by the Trump administration and Education Secretary Linda McMahon to withhold funds would \"cripple the operations of many educational institutions,\" and are a violation of executive branch power in overseeing local school districts.",
      "The ruling is not nationwide, and is limited to any public schools that work with the plaintiffs in the case, the National Education Association and the Center for Black Educator Development. The NEA is America's largest teachers union, with more than 3 million members.",
      "The suit was filed after the Trump administration demanded that all 50 states agree that their public schools would not participate in programs that violate the Trump administration's definition of violating the 1964 Civil Rights Act.",
      "In a February letter to states, the Education Department asserted that U.S. public schools have embraced \"pervasive and repugnant race-based preferences,\" that \"emanated throughout every facet of academia,\" including schools engaging with the \"false premise that the United State is built upon 'systemic and structural racism.'\"",
      "The letter instructed schools to ensure that their policies \"comply with existing civil rights laws,\" or risk potentially losing billions in Title I money that helps low-income students across the country.",
      "If the Trump administration succeeded with its attempts to keep diversity efforts out of schools, McCafferty wrote that public schools would likely eliminate teaching roles that involve race or censor teachers who teach about race.",
      "\"Would the Department conclude that a history teacher leading a class discussion on the economic development of the antebellum south has violated Title VI? What about an English teacher assigning students to write a paper comparing the persecution of Tom Robinson\u2014whom Atticus Finch championed in To Kill a Mockingbird\u2014to that of Emmett Till? And how would such lessons even relate to a \"diversity, equity, and inclusion\" program?\" McCafferty wrote in her opinion. \"These are not hypotheticals. School teachers throughout the country are asking themselves these and similar questions in the wake of the 2025 Letter.\"",
      "McCafferty also found that the Trump administration's definition of diversity, equity and inclusion as unlawful is \"in stark contrast to the dictionary definition of DEI\" and \"inconsistent with the ordinary meaning of the phrase.\"",
      "National Education Association President Becky Pringle said in a statement to reporters that \"today's ruling allows educators and schools to continue to be guided by what's best for students, not by the threat of illegal restrictions and punishment.\"",
      "White House spokesperson Harrison Fields said President Trump is \"protecting the civil rights of all Americans by ending radical DEI programs that violate Supreme Court precedent in order to safeguard the Constitution's promise of equality before the law. Any judge objecting to this effort is making a mockery of the Constitution they swore an oath to uphold.\"",
      "The crackdown on diversity and equity programs in schools is part of a broader rebuke of DEI initiatives by the Trump administration. Shortly after taking office, Mr. Trump signed executive orders directing an end to diversity, equity and inclusion programs in the federal government, and required federal contractors to certify that they do not engage in certain DEI initiatives.",

    "story": [
      "A federal judge on Wednesday temporarily halted her order requiring the Trump administration to provide information on its efforts so far to retrieve Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador last month \u2014 just one day after accusing the administration of demonstrating \"bad faith\" in the proceedings.",
      "Earlier Wednesday, the Department of Justice asked Maryland-based U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis to stay her directive to provide testimony and documents on Abrego Garcia for seven days, and Abrego Garcia's lawyers filed a response. Hours later, Xinis granted a stay of the discovery process until April 30 at 5 p.m. with \"the agreement of the parties.\"",
      "The reason for the stay is unclear since both parties' filings are sealed. Xinis did not explain her reasoning.",
      "Abrego Garcia's attorney, Simon Sandoval-Moshenberg, told CBS News in a statement his team is \"not at liberty to speak about the current status of the case at this time,\" citing the seal on the court documents. \"We remain focused on bringing Kilmar Abrego Garcia home, and we will not rest until he is brought home,\" he added.",
      "The Justice Department declined to comment.",
      "Xinis' decision to stay discovery for a week came one day after Abrego Garcia's legal team accused the Trump administration of failing to follow her order for expedited discovery in the case. In a scathing order Tuesday, Xinis said the administration had shown a \"willful and bad faith refusal to comply with discovery obligations,\" and ordered the government to respond to questions by Wednesday at 6 p.m.",
      "Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran man who entered the U.S. illegally in 2011, was detained last month and flown to El Salvador, part of a wave of hundreds of migrants \u2014 including alleged gang members \u2014 sent by the Trump administration to the country's notorious Terrorist Confinement Center (CECOT) supermax prison. A judge previously barred Abrego Garcia from being removed to El Salvador in 2019, citing the risk of persecution by the country's gangs.",
      "The Trump administration conceded in court Abrego Garcia's deportation was an \"administrative error,\" but has declined to return him to the U.S., accusing him of membership in the MS-13 gang \u2014 which his lawyers deny, noting he hasn't been charged with a crime.",
      "Abrego Garcia's case has turned into a legal showdown. Xinis ordered the Trump administration to \"facilitate\" his return to the U.S., which the Supreme Court affirmed, but the administration has argued it's up to El Salvador to return him. Xinis has suggested the government hasn't adequately complied with her orders.",
      "The U.S. has claimed that much of the information is protected because it involves state secrets, government deliberations and attorney client privilege. But Xinis has rejected the argument and demanded that the Trump administration provide specific justifications for each claim of privileged information by Wednesday evening.",
      "A three-judge panel on the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals scolded the administration last week, saying its claim that it can't do anything to free Abrego Garcia \"should be shocking.\" That ruling came one day after a federal judge in Washington, D.C., found probable cause to hold the Trump administration in criminal contempt in a different case for violating his orders to turn around planes carrying deportees to El Salvador.",

    "summary": "President Trump signed an executive order that directed the Pentagon to develop a policy that would bar transgender people from serving in the military.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump on Thursday asked the Supreme Court to allow his administration's policy prohibiting transgender people from serving in the military to take effect while legal challenges to the ban move forward.",
      "The request for the Supreme Court's intervention comes after a federal appeals court left in place a lower court order that prevents the Trump administration from enforcing the ban nationwide. The administration has attacked these broad orders, known as nationwide or universal injunctions, issued by federal district court judges as improperly setting policy for the country.",
      "Mr. Trump banned transgender people from serving in the military during his first term in office, which the Supreme Court in 2019 allowed to take effect,\u00a0but the policy was rescinded by former President Joe Biden. When Mr. Trump returned to office in January for his second term, he issued a new executive order that declared it to be U.S. government policy to \"establish high standards for troop readiness, lethality, cohesion, honesty, humility, uniformity, and integrity,\" and said that policy is \"inconsistent with the medical, surgical, and mental health constraints on individuals with gender dysphoria.\"",
      "The president's directive said that \"adoption of a gender identity inconsistent with an individual's sex conflicts with a soldier's commitment to an honorable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle, even in one's personal life. A man's assertion that he is a woman, and his requirement that others honor this falsehood, is not consistent with the humility and selflessness required of a service member.\"",
      "On the heels of the president's order, the Defense Department issued a new policy in February that generally disqualifies from military service people with gender dysphoria or who have undergone medical interventions for gender dysphoria. The plan from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth required all military branches to start identifying transgender service members and begin the process of separating them from service on March 26 unless they obtained a waiver.",
      "Roughly 1,892 active-duty members of the military received gender-affirming care from the Defense Department between January 2016 and May 2021, according to a\u00a0January report\u00a0from the Congressional Research Service. The Justice Department has said that the Pentagon does not have data on service members by gender identity, but a defense official said that as of Dec. 9, there were about 4,200 troops who had been diagnosed with gender dysphoria. There are more than 1.2 million active-duty members of the military, according to the Defense Department.",
      "Between 2015 and 2024, the Defense Department spent $52 million for care to active-duty service members to treat gender dysphoria, according to a\u00a0Feb. 26 memo\u00a0from the Pentagon.",
      "The case before the Supreme Court arose out a challenge to the ban filed in Washington state, which was brought by seven transgender service members, one transgender person who wants to join the military and an advocacy group. They argued that the president's ban violates the Constitution's guarantee of equal protection and the First Amendment.",
      "A federal district court in March agreed to block implementation of the executive order and required the Trump administration to maintain the policy put in place by its predecessor.",
      "In his opinion granting a preliminary injunction, U.S. District Judge Benjamin Settle said the Trump administration did not put forth any evidence that allowing transgender people to serve openly harmed military readiness, unit cohesion or lethality.",
      "\"The government's unrelenting reliance on deference to military judgment is unjustified in the absence of any evidence supporting 'the military's' new judgment reflected in the Military Ban \u2014 in its equally considered and unquestionable judgment, that very same military had only the week before permitted active-duty plaintiffs (and some thousands of others) to serve openly,\" he wrote.",
      "Settle was appointed to the district court in Tacoma by President George W. Bush and was a captain in the U.S. Army Judge Advocate General Corps, serving as a prosecutor in Fort Bragg, North Carolina, and defense counsel in Fort Lewis, Washington.",
      "Settle wrote in his opinion that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of their claims, and said they raised \"serious and important questions.\"",
      "\"Because the military has operated smoothly for four years under the Austin Policy, any claimed hardship it may face in the meantime pales in comparison to the hardships imposed on transgender service members and otherwise qualified transgender accession candidates, tipping the balance of hardships sharply toward plaintiffs,\" he said, referencing former Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, who led the Pentagon under Biden. \"There can be few matters of greater public interest in this country than protecting the constitutional rights of its citizens.\"",
      "The Justice Department then asked the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit to pause that decision, allowing it the ban to take effect, but it denied the request.",
      "A similar challenge to Mr. Trump's ban was filed in federal district court in Washington, D.C., where it, too, was blocked from taking effect. But the federal appeals court in Washington agreed to temporarily halt that order and heard arguments Tuesday on whether to keep its block in place while the appeal continues.",
      "In its emergency appeal to the Supreme Court, Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued that the courts should give \"substantial deference\" to the Defense Department's military judgments.",
      "\"Absent a stay, the district court's universal injunction will remain in place for the duration of further review in the Ninth Circuit and in this court \u2014 a period far too long for the military to be forced to maintain a policy that it has determined, in its professional judgment, to be contrary to military readiness and the nation's interests,\" he wrote.",
      "Sauer rejected the claim that the administration's rules discriminate based on transgender status and sex and said the policy draws classifications based on a medical condition \u2014 gender dysphoria \u2014 and related medical interventions, which means it satisfies the lowest, most deferential standard of judicial review.",
      "\"The Constitution entrusts to the political branches the authority to determine the composition of the armed forces. The department exercised that authority in adopting the 2025 policy to exclude 'individuals who have a current diagnosis or history of, or exhibit symptoms consistent with, gender dysphoria,'\" he wrote. \"The district court's injunction nevertheless forces the military to maintain a different policy \u2014 one that the department has concluded is inconsistent with 'the best interests of the military services' and with 'the interests of national security.'\"",

    "summary": "President Trump's meme coin had lost 88% of its value. But an offer of dinner with the president helped boost its price on Wednesday.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's meme coin, which had slumped 88% from its most recent high, got a boost Wednesday after its website invited the top 220 holders of the digital token to an \"intimate private dinner\" with the president.",
      "After the dinner offer was posted on the $TRUMP meme coin website and X account, the value of the meme coin surged as much as $5.32, or 58%, to $14.32 on Wednesday afternoon. That gain only partially erased the meme coin's decline in value, which hit a peak of $75.35 on January 19 the day before Mr. Trump's inauguration.",
      "The dinner offer promises $TRUMP coin investors the opportunity to \"Hear close-up, from President Trump, about the future of Crypto!\" Mr. Trump, who has vowed to turn the U.S. into the cryptocurrency capital of the world, has also pushed his own ventures into the realm of digital products, issuing everything from NFTs billed as \"Trump digital trading cards\" to a cryptocurrency platform called World Liberty Financial.",
      "CIC Digital LLC, an affiliate of The Trump Organization, and Fight Fight Fight LLC together own 80% of the meme coins, according to the Trump coin site. Fight Fight Fight is a Delaware LLC, according to the Wall Street Journal.",
      "The White House and the Trump Organization didn't immediately respond to a request for comment about the promotion.",
      "Invitations to the dinner event with Mr. Trump will only be offered to those who own the most $TRUMP meme coins, according to the website. The top 25 holders will get a bonus of \"an Exclusive Reception before Dinner with YOUR FAVORITE PRESIDENT!\" the website marketing the dinner said.",
      "\"Our leaderboard updates hourly in real time. Your $TRUMP coin count puts you in the running. The competition is fierce. Own $TRUMP \u2014 or watch from the sidelines,\" according to the website marketing the coin.",
      "The leaderboard will be determined by the average holdings of $TRUMP owners from April 23 to May 12, according to the website. \"The more $TRUMP you hold \u2014 and the longer you hold it \u2014 the higher Your Ranking will be,\" it said.",
      "The dinner will take place on May 22 at the Trump National Golf Club in Washington, D.C., according to the site.",
      "Offer draws swift criticism",
      "Meme coins, which have no economic or transactional value, are cryptocurrencies linked to celebrities or internet trends, such as Dogecoin, which was inspired by the\u00a0image of a Shiba Inu dog. Elon Musk named his federal cost-cutting group, the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, after the token.",
      "Both Mr. Trump and his wife, Melania, debuted meme coins just days before his inauguration, although both tokens have lost much of their value since their debuts. The $MELANIA meme coin now sells for about 49 cents each, down from a peak of $13.76 on Jan. 20.",
      "The presidential dinner promotion drew criticism from lawmakers and anti-corruption groups. Sen. Chris Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut, on social media blasted the offer as the \"most brazenly corrupt thing a President has ever done.\"",
      "Tony Carrk, U.S. executive director with Accountable.US, a nonpartisan advocacy group focused on corporate and government ethics, said in a statement that Mr. Trump \"is openly inviting investors to have a bidding war over who can buy the most access to him while he laughs all the way to the bank.\"",

    "published": "Wed, 23 Apr 2025 22:10:19 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump also signed an executive order to enforce laws on the books about universities disclosing large foreign gifts.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Wednesday signed an executive order aiming to change the college accreditation process so colleges are accredited based on \"results,\" with the president wondering aloud about looking into the math capabilities of students admitted to Harvard University and Yale University.",
      "The president also signed an order to enforce laws on the books requiring universities to disclose when they accept large foreign gifts, with one of Mr. Trump's top aides specifically calling out Harvard as a school they believe has violated the law. Federal law requires higher education institutions that receive federal funds to disclose any gifts or contracts from a foreign source valued at $250,000 or more in a calendar year, and some in Congress are trying to lower that threshold to $50,000.",
      "The new executive orders come as the president has singled out Harvard University. His administration has frozen billions in federal funding to Harvard, demanded sweeping changes to school policies and suggested it should lose its tax-exempt status.",
      "Colleges and universities are accredited to ensure they meet basic standards by third-party entities, not the federal government, though the Department of Education decides which accrediting agencies to recognize. The accreditation process has broad implications since the government uses it to\u00a0determine which schools are allowed to participate in federal student aid programs, which distribute billions in student loans and grants.",
      "The executive order directs the Department of Education to \"hold accountable\" any college accreditors that \"fail to meet the applicable recognition criteria or otherwise violate Federal law\" \u2014 including by terminating or suspending the accreditors' federal recognition. It specifically singles out accrediting agencies that require schools to \"engage in unlawful discrimination ... under the guise of 'diversity, equity, and inclusion' initiatives.\" The order also says the Department of Education should start recognizing new college accreditors.",
      "The Trump administration believes accreditation entities have become too focused on \"woke ideology\" instead of results, White House staff secretary Will Scharf said. The executive order Mr. Trump signed affects law schools and graduate programs as well.",
      "\"The basic idea is to force accreditation to be focused on the merit and the actual results that these universities are providing, as opposed to how woke these universities have gotten,\" Scharf said ahead of Mr. Trump signing the executive order. \"So we're setting up new accreditation pathways, we're charging the Department of Education to really look holistically at this accreditation mess and hopefully make it much better.\"",
      "Mr. Trump wanted to know if the executive order he was signing will \"look into\" people who he says go to prestigious schools like Harvard or Princeton but can't do basic math.",
      "\"Will we look into the past people that they've taken?\" Mr. Trump asked Scharf. \"For instance, I hear all about certain great schools. And then we read where they're going to teach people basic math, math that we can all do very easily, but they can't do there.\"",
      "\"When universities are not performing appropriately, whether that's in admission or whether that's in their actual instructional activities, that's certainly something that accreditors should be considering that right now we believe they're not doing a good enough job of,\" Scharf responded.",
      "The president also signed an executive order charging federal departments and agencies to make sure universities are following the law in disclosing the acceptance of large foreign gifts.",
      "\"We believe that certain universities, including, for example, Harvard, have routinely violated this law and this law has not been effectively enforced,\" Scharf said. \"So this executive order charges your departments and agencies with enforcing the laws on the books with respect to foreign gifts to American universities.\"",
      "Scharf didn't offer evidence or details on how Harvard has allegedly violated the foreign gift disclosure law. Harvard told CBS News in a statement it has filed foreign gift reporting reports \"for decades as part of its ongoing compliance with the law.\"",
      "Harvard University on Monday announced it filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, alleging the administration unlawfully froze billions in federal funding. Tensions have escalated between the administration and Harvard, which had\u00a0rejected the administration's\u00a0demands to change many of the school's policies and leadership. Several other schools, including Columbia University, have faced similar funding freezes, with the Trump administration alleging the schools have responded inadequately to antisemitism.",
      "The president on Wednesday also signed executive actions to ensure the effectiveness and efficiency of Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), make sure schoolchildren are adequately trained in artificial intelligence, boost apprenticeships and allow educators to enforce school discipline policies.",

But it has been a set for his TV appearances, including one with Fox this week in which he blamed the media and former Defense Department employees for the revelation that he sent sensitive details about military strikes in a Signal group chat that he created.",
      "He did not deny news reports that he shared real-time operational information with family members before strikes in Yemen were carried out. He didn't explain why his wife, who is not a Defense Department employee, was in the text chat. That was the second Signal group with whom Hegseth shared planning details about the Houthi airstrikes, which took place in mid-March. The first Signal chat, a principals group which comprised top national security officials, was created by national security adviser Michael Waltz, and its existence was exposed by Atlantic editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg, who was added to the group in error by Waltz.",
      "Hegseth claims he did not disclose classified information in either of the chat groups. The Defense Department acting inspector general is reviewing his disclosures.",
      "\"We're focused on recruiting, on rooting out DEI, on securing our southwest border, on the president's agenda, and it's going very well at the Pentagon, and I'm proud of it,\" Hegseth said Tuesday on Fox.",
      "The Pentagon restricted access to its briefing room on Feb. 21, barring reporters unless officials were speaking. Previously, press could use the room, one of the few places they could connect to Wi-Fi in the secure building, to file stories and to conduct on-camera reports.",

      "\"I truly love the job of being a United States senator, but in my heart I know it is time to pass the torch. So, I am announcing today I will not be seeking reelection at the end of my term,\" Durbin said in a video posted to his social media accounts.",
      "When he finishes his current term, Durbin will be tied with former Illinois Sen. Shelby Collum, who served from 1883 to 1913, as the longest-serving U.S. senator in Illinois history.",
      "Durbin, 80, expressed his gratitude to the people of Illinois for electing him to the Senate for so many years, and said he was honored by the responsibility bestowed on him.",
      "\"Right now the challenges facing our country are historic and unprecedented,\" he continued. \"The threats to our democracy and our way of life are very real, and I can assure you, I'll do everything in my power to fight for Illinois and the future of our country every day of my remaining time in the Senate.\"",
      "Durbin called his fellow Illinois senator, Tammy Duckworth, a \"trusted friend and effective leader,\" and said she will be a \"real asset\" to the state and the nation as Illinois' next senior senator.",
      "Durbin is the senior senator for Illinois. He was first elected to the U.S. Senate in 1996, filling the seat left vacant by longtime Sen. Paul Simon.",
      "He is the 5th most senior member of the Senate, and also serves at the Senate Democratic Whip, the second-highest ranking position for the party in the Senate. He was first elected to this leadership post by Senate Democrats in 2005, and has been reelected to it every two years since.",
      "Durbin is the ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee. He also serves on the Appropriations Committee and the Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee. His retirement is expected to serve as the impetus for a broader shakeup of the Democratic Senate leadership.",
      "He introduced the Dream Act, which would give undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children and grew up here a path to citizenship, in 2001 alongside Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah). He was also a force behind the establishment of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival Program, or DACA, created by President Barack Obama in 2012.",
      "He also championed the First Step Act, which was signed into law by President Trump in 2018, a bipartisan criminal justice bill that reformed sentencing laws and provided more opportunities for incarcerated people to re-enter society upon their release.",
      "Durbin and his wife, Loretta Schaefer Durbin, live in Springfield, Illinois. He has three children \u2013 Paul, Jennifer and Christine, his oldest daughter who died in 2008 from complications from a congenital heart condition.",
      "While no one has officially signaled their intentions to toss their names into the ring for Durbin's seat, some of the Illinois politicians most often talked about as a potential replacements include 14th District U.S. Rep. Lauren Underwood, Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton and 8th District U.S. Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi.",
      "Colleagues pay tribute to Durbin's career",
      "A number of legislators took time Wednesday morning to share tributes to Durbin's long career in politics.",
      "Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, a fellow Democrat, praised Durbin \"for his exemplary career of public service as well as the profound and lasting positive impact he's had on Illinois families and our nation.\" He added:",
      "\"Known for his legendary work ethic, Senator Durbin has led the fight to expand access to affordable health care, invest in our state's infrastructure, tackle gun violence, defend Dreamers, improve public health, protect working families, and more. His expert leadership on the Senate Judiciary Committee ensured the confirmation of a record 235 federal judges, shaping the courts and securing our most fundamental American rights for many years to come.\"",
      "Speaking at an event in Decatur, Illinois, Gov. JB Pritzker honored Durbin, saying, \"Let's all recognize someone serving us for decades in Washington D.C., representing the state of Illinois with enormous integrity and honor, is something we should all appreciate no matter what political party someone belongs to.\"",
      "Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton said Durbin \"has given Illinois a lifetime of principled leadership \u2014 grounded in decency, driven by purpose, and always guided by the people he served,\" and added \"Illinois is stronger because of him and the work he's championed will carry on.\"",
      "Rep. Delia Ramirez, a colleague and fellow Democrat, called Durbin a \"trusted leader, a mentor to many, and a champion for working people in Illinois.\"",
      "\"As he announces his much-deserved retirement, I am feeling thankful for his work and service to the people of Illinois and our nation,\" she wrote. \"Thank you, Senator, for the opportunity to learn from you and partner with you on so many important issues. As the proud daughter of immigrants, the spouse of a Dreamer, and the Congresswoman of IL-03, I also extend my deepest gratitude for your unwavering commitment to defending our immigrant communities.\"",
      "Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson thanked Durbin for \"over 40 years of fighting for the people of Illinois.\" He called him a \"principled and pragmatic leader,\" praised his bipartisanship and his work in the senate.",
      "\"Time and time again, he delivered real results to the working people of Chicago \u2013 investing in our airports and our train stations, defending Dreamers and immigrants, and fighting to end gun violence. He was a champion for young children and early childhood education, and he fought for mental health services for our young people,\" Johnson said in a statement. \"Our city, our state, and our country are stronger due to his decades of service.\"",
      "Former President Barack Obama, who served alongside Durbin in the Senate before his presidential run, also released a statement on the decision, writing, \"As an Illinois voter, I couldn't be prouder that our senator for the last 28 years has been one of the finest in the country. Dick Durbin has always fought the good fight on behalf of working families, and his integrity shines through in everything he does.\"",
      "With Durbin vacating his Senate seat, many prominent Democrats are expected to throw their hat in the ring. CBS News Chicago Political Analyst and former Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot said it's not impossible that a Republican could win the seat.",
      "\"I think that is a very remote possibility, given the nature of electorate here in Illinois, but I will sound a cautionary note. President Trump did very well not only across Illinois south of I-80, but made inroads in Cook County and DuPage County, and quite frankly did better than expected in the city of Chicago,\" she said.",
      "Lightfoot said she has no plans to run for the seat herself.",
      "\"No, I don't see that happening,\" she said. \"I can tell you private citizen Lightfoot is just fine where I am.\"",
      "Political scientist and professor Stephen Caliendo said there's more than meets the eye behind many of the statements from politicians in response to this announcement today.",
      "\"Part of what you're seeing with the praise for Senator Durbin, not to suggest at all that it's not authentic, but it's also seeking his blessing,\" he said. \"I don't know that he would come forward with a specific endorsement. Certainly not this early in a race, he wouldn't, but anybody who runs would love to have him alongside them on the campaign trail.\"",
      "Caliendo said November 2026 really isn't far away, and the race for campaign money has really already started. He believes several members of Congress from Illinois could run, with Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi holding a huge fundraising lead, with more than $18 million on hand in his campaign fund.",
      "\"He's been hoarding money for some time, and the others have been in a little bit tighter races for their seats, so they've had to spend a little bit more in recent campaigns, but he's been collecting money and certainly the suggestion would be that he was desiring a higher office,\" Caliendo said.",
      "Rep. Lauren Underwood has more than $1 million available in her campaign fund after raising nearly $400,000 between January and March, mostly from individual contributions. Rep. Robin Kelly has more than $2 million I her campaign fund, after raising more than $185,000 between January and March, also nearly all of it from individual contributions.",
      "Stratton also is considered a likely Senate candidate now that Durbin is retiring. She has less than $100,000 in her campaign fund, but can't use it for a Senate race since the money was raised for a state race, not a federal race. However, she could potentially get significant financial backing from Pritzker, a billionaire who hasn't been shy about spending big to support political allies.",

    "published": "Fri, 25 Apr 2025 13:20:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Shortening permitting procedures for mining and oil drilling could adversely affect the environment, communities and endangered species, experts say.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration said it will accelerate permit approvals for mining, drilling and fossil fuel production and transportation on public land, fast-tracking a review process that would normally take years.",
      "In announcing the emergency procedures Wednesday, the Department of the Interior, which oversees the management of federal lands and natural resources, said the permitting process will now take up to \"28 days at most\" \u2014 a drastic departure from the current one- to two-year timeline.",
      "The government agency said the move is in response to President Trump's January 20 declaration of a national energy emergency. In an executive order on the first day of his second term, the White House said it would \"eliminate harmful, coercive 'climate' policies that increase the costs of food and fuel.\"",
      "The speedy permitting policy opens the door for the U.S. to expand oil and gas projects and for Mr. Trump to make good on his promise to \"Drill, baby, drill\" \u2014 a common refrain on his campaign trail. The new guidelines will apply to a wide range of energy projects, including crude oil, natural gas and coal.",
      "The U.S. leads the world in\u00a0oil\u00a0and\u00a0gas\u00a0production, with an output of 20 million barrels of oil a day and accounting for roughly a quarter of global gas production, according to the International Energy Agency.",
      "The DOI said it would use emergency authorities under the National Environmental Policy Act, Endangered Species Act and the National Historic Preservation Act to expedite the permitting process.",
      "\"The United States cannot afford to wait,\" Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum said in a statement\u00a0on Wednesday. \"President Trump has made it clear that our energy security is national security, and these emergency procedures reflect our unwavering commitment to protecting both.\"",
      "Lawsuits to come, experts say",
      "Environmental advocates rebuked the announcement, saying that in addition to adverse environmental impacts on public land and water sources, the expedited procedures will strip away community members' ability to weigh in on projects happening in their own backyards. Experts say the move is expected to draw legal challenges.",
      "\"What they're proposing to do is basically forgo environmental review or public participation or anything meaningful,\" said Michael Burger, executive director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University. \"The implications of that are extreme.\"",
      "The environmental review process has developed over time, he said, and goes back decades. The Endangered Species Act, one of three statues the DOI is targeting, was signed into law by President Richard Nixon in 1973. Section 7 of the Act requires consultation among agencies \"to ensure their activities are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence\" of federally protected species, according to the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service.",
      "A win for oil and gas industries",
      "The announcement on Wednesday was a win for the American Petroleum Institute, the oil and gas industry's largest lobbying group, which has\u00a0cheered\u00a0Mr. Trump's energy agenda.",
      "\"Our nation's permitting system is broken, and reform is essential to ensuring access to affordable, reliable energy,\" Holly Hopkins, VP of upstream policy at the American Petroleum Institute, said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Former officials from several different federal agencies who served under Mr. Trump's previous term and the Biden administration have told CBS News on background that looming workforce reductions could throw a wrench in the department's plans to speed up the permitting process. Also, breaking with long-standing practices could lead to major slipups, such as oil spills, they added.",
      "The Department of the Interior employs about 70,000 staff members, according to its website. But cuts could be on the horizon. An internal White House document obtained by The Washington Post indicated that as many as 1 in 4 department employees could be let go as a part of a broader series of staff cuts across government agencies.",
      "\"How can you accomplish so much with fewer and fewer people?\" said Burger of Columbia's Sabin Center. \"The only result is less and less oversight.\"",
      "Athan Manuel, director of the Lands Protection Program at the Sierra Club, agreed, adding that gutting the federal agency could hinder the Trump administration's objectives.",
      "\"They just don't seem to understand that these employees run the gamut from wildlife biologists to firefighters, to people who permit oil and gas drilling or permit mines on federal lands,\" he said. \"If it's going to wholesale cut staff, some of the things they care about are going to get caught up in that.\"",
      "The Department of Interior did not respond to request for comment on how layoffs might impact its ability to issue permits on a tighter timetable.",
      "According to the new procedural guidelines issued by the agency this week, companies seeking a permit are required to confirm in writing that they want their project covered by the expedited process \u2014 meaning that not everyone will necessarily opt in. Those that do could stand to lose big, Manuel said.",
      "\"Companies are very cautious before they sink millions of dollars into a well or to a mining project,\" he said. \"So I think they benefit from going slowly because they don't want to be stuck with a stranded asset or literally drill a dry hole here.\"",

      "There are other meat-eating caterpillars that \"do lots of crazy things, but this takes the cake,\" said study author Dan Rubinoff with the University of Hawaii at Manoa.",

      "\"I think the term is out there in the ether, and just fit with what these caterpillars are doing. It's a bit tongue in cheek because arthropods don't actually have bones,\" Rubinoff told\u00a0the Reuters news agency.",
      "A host of caterpillars native to Hawaii use silk glands to spin protective cases studded with lichen, sand and other materials. This one is the first to use ant heads and fly wings.",
      "\"It really is an astonishing type of case,\" said Steven Montgomery, an entomology consultant in Hawaii who was not involved with the new study.",
      "Scientists found just 62 of the carnivorous caterpillars in over 20 years of observing.",
      "Predatory caterpillars are extremely rare and the bone collectors found in Hawaii will even eat each other, researchers said.",
      "The bone collector's origins date back at least 6 million years, making the caterpillars more than one million years older than the Hawaiian islands themselves. Today, they dwell on an isolated patch of mountain forest alongside invasive species.",

Harry was attending the event with his wife, Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex.",
      "\"The easiest thing to say is to keep your kids away from social media\" to protect them, Harry said.",
      "The memorial, which will be open for 24 hours, is made up of 50 smartphones that each display an image of a child who organizers say lost their life because of social media, the BBC reported.",
      "Prince Harry and Meghan have been supporting families that say social media played a role in the deaths of their children, and have backed calls for tech companies to share information from those children's phones with parents.",
      "\"It is a universal truth that our children are in harms way by what's happening online,\" Meghan said. \"I think for those who do choose to be online and to be on social media \u2014 as adults as well \u2014 that we get to set the example and really put as much good and joy into the world as we can.\"",
      "A number of families from the U.K. traveled to New York to request better protections for children from tech companies. Some of them took part in a separate protest outside Meta's offices.",
      "Among those families was Ellen Roome, the mother of a 14-year-old, Jools, who died in 2022. Roome believes it happened after an online challenge went wrong, and that his social media accounts could hold evidence, the BBC reported. An inquest found Jools died by suicide.",

    "story": [
      "Scammers are using artificial intelligence to alter their appearance and build fake profiles to apply for remote job postings, research shows.",
      "Already, scammers can use AI at almost every step in the job application process to hide their true identities. They can generate fake resumes, professional headshots, websites and Linkedin profiles. Compiled together, AI can help create what looks like the perfect candidate for an open role.",
      "Once they're in, these fraudsters can steal company secrets or install malware.",
      "While identity theft is not new, AI is helping scammers scale their operations, and the problem is growing. According to research and advisory firm Gartner,\u00a0an estimated one in four job applicants will be fake by 2028.",
      "How to spot a fake",
      "A recording of an interview with what appeared to be an AI-generated job seeker went viral on LinkedIn, posted by Dawid Moczadlo, co-founder of cybersecurity firm Vidoc Security. He told CBS News he was shocked when he realized what was happening.",
      "\"I felt a little bit violated, because we are the security experts,\" Moczadlo said.",
      "Moczadlo said when he suspected the person was using an AI filter, he asked a simple question: \"Can you take your hand and put it in front of your face?\"",

      "This was the second time the company had interviewed someone who turned out to be AI-generated. Moczadlo said it completely changed the company's hiring process. Now, potential employees are flown in for a one-day, in-person interview. The company covers travel and pays for a full day of work. It believes the extra cost is worth the peace of mind.",
      "A pattern of deception",
      "These incidents aren't isolated. The Justice Department has uncovered multiple networks in which North Koreans used fake identities to land remote jobs in the U.S. They often use AI to build fake identities and work U.S.-based IT jobs to funnel U.S. dollars to their home country.",
      "The Justice Department estimates these schemes generate hundreds of millions of dollars annually, with much of those funds going directly to the North Korean Ministry of Defense and the country's nuclear missile program.",
      "Moczadlo said researchers told him Vidoc's fake job seekers followed a similar pattern to several of these North Korean networks, though Vidoc's incident is still under investigation.",
      "\"We are really lucky that we are security experts.\" Moczadlo added, \"but for companies that have regular people like hiring managers or regular startup founders, it's really hard for them to spot something like this.\"",
      "The reaction inspired Vidoc's co-founders to build a guide to help HR professionals across industries spot potentially fraudulent applicants.",
      "If you're wondering if this has ever happened to you, the CBS News Confirmed team has compiled some general best-practices to check that the person you're speaking to is real:",
      "1. Look closer at their LinkedIn profile: While the profile might look legitimate at first glance, check the creation date by clicking on the \"More\" button and then selecting \"About this profile.\" You can also check that the person has connections at the places they say they've worked.",
      "2. Ask cultural questions: If someone says they grew up in a specific country or city, ask about things only a local might know, like their favorite cafes and restaurants.",
      "3. In-person is best: At the end of the day, especially as AI technology advances, the only way to really know that a person is who they say they are, is to meet them face-to-face.",

    "story": [
      "London\u00a0\u2014 European Union watchdogs fined Apple and Meta hundreds of millions of euros Wednesday as they stepped up enforcement of the 27-nation bloc's digital competition rules. The European Commission imposed a 500 million euro ($571 million) fine on Apple for preventing app makers from pointing users to cheaper options outside its App Store. The commission, which is the EU's executive arm, also fined Meta Platforms 200 million euros ($228 million) because it forced Facebook and Instagram users to choose between seeing ads or paying to avoid them.",
      "The punishments were smaller than the blockbuster multibillion-euro fines that the commission has previously slapped on Big Tech companies in antitrust cases.",
      "Apple and Meta have to comply with the decisions within 60 days or risk unspecified \"periodic penalty payments,\" the commission said.",
      "The decisions were expected to come in March, but officials apparently held off amid an escalating trans-Atlantic trade war with President Trump, who has repeatedly complained about regulations from Brussels affecting American companies.",
      "The penalties were issued under the EU's Digital Markets Act, also known as the DMA. It's a sweeping rulebook that amounts to a set of do's and don'ts designed to give consumers and businesses more choice and prevent Big Tech \"gatekeepers\" from cornering digital markets.",
      "The DMA seeks to ensure \"that citizens have full control over when and how their data is used online, and businesses can freely communicate with their own customers,\" Henna Virkkunen, the commission's executive vice-president for tech sovereignty, said in a statement.",
      "\"The decisions adopted today find that both Apple and Meta have taken away this free choice from their users and are required to change their behavior,\" Virkkunen said.",
      "Both companies indicated they would appeal.",
      "\"The European Commission is attempting to handicap successful American businesses while allowing Chinese and European companies to operate under different standards,\" Meta Chief Global Affairs Officer Joel Kaplan said in a statement provided by the U.S. tech giant. \"This isn't just about a fine; the Commission forcing us to change our business model effectively imposes a multi-billion-dollar tariff on Meta while requiring us to offer an inferior service. And by unfairly restricting personalized advertising the European Commission is also hurting European businesses and economies.\"",
      "Apple accused the commission of \"unfairly targeting\" the iPhone maker, and said it \"continues to move the goal posts\" despite the company's efforts to comply with the rules.",
      "In the App Store case, the Commission had accused the iPhone maker of imposing unfair rules preventing app developers from freely steering consumers to other channels.",
      "Among the DMA's provisions are requirements to let developers inform customers of cheaper purchasing options and direct them to those offers.",
      "The commission said it ordered Apple to remove technical and commercial restrictions that prevent developers from steering users to other channels, and to end \"non-compliant\" conduct.",
      "Apple said it has \"spent hundreds of thousands of engineering hours and made dozens of changes to comply with this law, none of which our users have asked for.\"",
      "\"Despite countless meetings, the Commission continues to move the goal posts every step of the way,\" the company said.",
      "Apple has also faced a broad antitrust lawsuit in the U.S., where the\u00a0Justice Department alleged\u00a0that the California company illegally engaged in anti-competitive behavior in an effort to build a \"moat around its smartphone monopoly\" and maximize its profits at the expense of consumers. Fifteen states and the District of Columbia have joined the suit as plaintiffs.",
      "The EU's Meta investigation centered on the company's strategy to comply with strict European data privacy rules by giving users the option of paying for ad-free versions of Facebook and Instagram.",
      "Users could pay at least 10 euros ($11) a month to avoid being targeted by ads based on their personal data. The U.S. tech giant rolled out the option after the European Union's top court ruled Meta must first get consent before showing ads to users, in a decision that threatened its business model of tailoring ads based on individual users' online interests and digital activity.",
      "Regulators took issue with Meta's model, saying it doesn't allow users to exercise their right to \"freely consent\" to allowing their personal data from its various services, which also include Facebook Marketplace, WhatsApp and Messenger, to be combined for personalized ads.",
      "Meta rolled out a third option in November giving Facebook and Instagram users in Europe the option to see fewer personalized ads if they don't want to pay for an ad-free subscription. The commission said it's \"currently assessing\" this option and continues to hold talks with Meta, and has asked the company to provide evidence of the new option's impact.",
      "The European Commission has also\u00a0slapped Google with antitrust penalties several times, including a record $5 billion fine levied in 2018 over the search engine's abuse of the market dominance of its Android mobile phone operating system.",

      "A hearing kicked off today in Washington, D.C., that could determine whether Google remains in its current form, or if it could face penalties such as selling off its popular Chrome web browser.",
      "The so-called remedy hearing is the consequence of a court ruling last August that found Google is operating a monopoly and uses its dominant market position to crush rivals and put a lid on innovation.",
      "The U.S. Department of Justice is arguing that Google should be forced to divest its Chrome browser, which the agency describes as \"one of the largest entry points that exists for searches.\" By selling Chrome, rivals could have a chance to compete for search queries, the government argues, but such a change would drastically reshape Google's parent, Alphabet, a tech giant with a $1.8 trillion market valuation.",
      "\"Google can compete, but they simply don't want to compete on a level playing field,\" Justice Department attorney David Dahlquist said on Monday during his opening before the court. \"Google is now fearful of competing against rivals who will only get stronger with the proposed remedies in place.\"",
      "The hearing comes just days after Google was branded an abusive monopolist in a separate case that ruled the tech giant had illegally exploited some of its online marketing technology to boost profits. The more recent case focused on Google's online advertising business, which has been built around its search engine and other widely used products, including Chrome and YouTube.",
      "Here's what to know about the current remedy hearing.",
      "What is the Google hearing about?",
      "U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta\u00a0ruled in August\u00a0that Google has illegally exploited its dominance to squash competition and stifle innovation.",

      "Requiring Google to share some data to help new entrants overcome barriers to entry;",
      "Syndicating search and advertising data that would allow rivals to use Google's search results to improve their quality.",
      "Some of the changes sought by the DOJ would last for years, with Sheridan noting that the requirements would \"include Google enabling ongoing access to its search index, making available user and ads search data (for up to 10 years), syndicating its search text ads data for up to 1 year and syndicating its search results, ranking signals & query understanding information (for queries originated in the U.S.) for up to 10 years.\"",
      "What would happen to Chrome?",
      "Jon Sallet, representing a group of states that joined the Justice Department in the case, said in his opening statements that his first priority is the divestiture of Chrome.",
      "Chrome is a \"massively attractive asset\" with over 4.1 billion global users, he added. \"This kind of asset doesn't come up very often.\"",
      "Divestitures can happen in a number of ways, such as a spinoff or sale of a business unit. In some cases, the existing shareholders of a company \u2014 in this case, Google parent Alphabet \u2014 receive new shares in the divested business.",
      "AT&T may be one of the best-known companies to have been broken apart after being accused of operating a monopoly. The phone giant split into several smaller companies as part of a 1982 settlement with the U.S. government, leading to the creation of several smaller regional phone operators, such as Bell South and Bell Atlantic.",
      "Splitting off Chrome would likely deliver a financial hit to Google's revenue, Goldman's Sheridan added. It would not only limit Google Search revenue, but would also restrict search query volume and access to user data, he noted.",
      "What is Google's response to the DOJ?",
      "Google attacked the government's proposed antitrust remedies, with its lead attorney, John Schmidtlein, calling them \"fundamentally flawed\" and arguing that they would unfairly penalize the company for its innovation.",
      "\"Google earned its market position through hard work and ingenuity,\" Schmidtlein said.",
      "A divestiture of Chrome would be \"far from simple,\" he said, noting that the remedy would go beyond the browser to include the open-source Chromium project Google created and has supported for years.",
      "\"The decree demands not only Chrome but also everything critical to Chromium's functionality,\" Schmidtlein said. \"What does that even mean? They're leaving it up to a technical committee, but there's no clarity on what constitutes necessary assets.\"",
      "He criticized the process, saying it lacks a clear path for evaluating potential buyers, and warned that Google would effectively be barred from the browser market for 10 years. \"I can't think of an antitrust remedy that approaches this,\" he added.",

    "story": [
      "When the charred remains of prominent commercial real estate attorney Gary Farris were discovered on a burn pile with a bullet lodged in a rib bone, detectives knew they were facing a homicide investigation. The crime scene was on a sprawling 10-acre property in Cherokee County, Georgia, where Gary Farris lived with his wife Melody and their son Scott.",
      "It was July 2018 when detectives found Gary Farris' blood and a second bullet in the basement of the home and questioned how his body could have ended up on the burn pile, about 50 yards away. Soon after their arrival on scene, investigators found themselves entangled in a family drama with mother and son pointing the finger at each other.",

      "Investigators learned Scott Farris was responsible for the day-to-day operations on the farm and that his work and personal expenses were covered by his father. According to Melody Farris, around the time of Gary Farris' death there was tension between him and Scott Farris, mainly about Scott needing to get another job. Scott Farris, however, says that is not true and tension in the home was caused by Melody Farris disappearing for weeks at a time and spending Gary Farris' money.",
      "Gary Farris was the sole bread winner and allowed Melody and Scott Farris access to accounts in his name. Scott Farris said his mother was away for extended periods of time because she was having an affair with her lover who lived in Tennessee.",
      "In June 2019, after an almost 12-month investigation, Melody Farris was arrested for the murder of Gary Farris.",
      "When her trial began in October 2024, her defense team said she was innocent and pointed the finger at Scott Farris. They said at his size, about 6 feet 8 inches, 280 pounds, he was more capable of moving Gary's 6-foot-4-inch, 300-pound body than his much smaller mother.",
      "But police and prosecutors believed Melody Farris was the murderer. Prosecutors argued, among other things, that Melody Farris was the only one home at the time they believe Gary Farris was killed. And at trial they called a witness from the Cherokee County Sheriff's Office Intelligence Division who analyzed phone records and discovered that Gary Farris' cellphone moved from the house to the burn pile and back to the house after investigators believe his body was already on the burn pile. Melody Farris was the only one home at that time as well.",
      "On Nov. 4, 2024, Melody Farris was found guilty of murdering her husband. She had not spoken publicly until her sentencing hearing a month later when she shocked the courtroom, saying, \"Not only did I not do this, I know who did. I know Scott killed his father.\"",
      "Immediately after Melody Farris was sentenced to life in prison, with the possibility of parole after 30 years, she walked into an exclusive interview with Van Sant, where she continued to profess her innocence.",
      "Melody Farris told Van Sant she saw Scott Farris near the burn pile the morning before Gary Farris' body was discovered. She said she believes Scott Farris used his pickup truck to get Gary Farris' body to the burn pile. And she went as far as saying Scott Farris planted the bullet that was found in the basement to frame her. Melody Farris says she believes Scott Farris killed his father because he wanted the farm to be his and would refer to it as his property in conversation.",
      "Melody Farris told Van Sant, \"\u2026 it's the perfect murder. You kill your daddy. You set your mother up. She goes to prison. You get everything.\"",
      "Scott Farris also sat down with Van Sant and told him, \"I absolutely had nothing to do with my father's death. And it was 100% Melody Farris who murdered my father. That is the truth.\"",

      "Scott Farris says he was an easy target because he lived on the property with his parents and was former military. Investigators were able to rule him out as a suspect and he was not charged with anything relating to the death of his father.",

      "When Massachusetts State Police detectives responded to a reported suicide in Westfield, Massachusetts, on May 8, 2018, they found Amy Fanion dead on her dining room floor with a gunshot wound to her head. Her husband, Brian Fanion, a Westfield Police detective, had called 911, reporting that Amy Fanion had shot herself.",
      "At the scene, detectives made several discoveries that raised questions. The gun used in the shooting was Brian Fanion's service weapon. And there was a lack of gunshot residue on Amy's head, which was unusual in a self-inflicted gunshot wound. What had happened in that dining room that morning? \"48 Hours\" contributor Nikki Battiste takes a look at the evidence in an encore of \u00a0\"The Detective's Wife\"\u00a0now streaming on Paramount +.",
      "Detective Brendan O'Toole took Brian Fanion to the State Police barracks in Russell, Massachusetts, to get his statement of the events surrounding his wife's sudden death. At the end of the interview, \u00a0O'Toole asked Fanion to turn over his phone for data extraction. Fanion complied but gave a caveat.",
      "\"I turned off the recorder and that's when Brian told me \u2026 'you're going to see some things on there and it's not what it appears to be,'\" O'Toole told \"48 Hours.\"",
      "Investigators would discover thousands of deleted text messages between Brian Fanion and a woman named Corrine Knowles, known as Cori. Brian Fanion had told O'Toole he and Knowles were just friends, but the text messages conveyed that the relationship had become something more.",
      "On May 17, three days after Amy Fanion's wake, O'Toole and Detective Mike Blanchette confronted Brian Fanion about his relationship with Knowles as well as the lack of gunshot residue found on Amy Fanion's wound.",
      "\"I mean, there's no doubt she was shot \u2026 but the question is, from what distance,\" O'Toole asked Fanion.",
      "Within a week, investigators seized all of Fanion's electronics, including his office computer and laptop at the Westfield Police Department. When Detective Tom Forest from the Cyber Crime Unit examined the computer's hard drive, it revealed peculiar web searches and online activity he considered notable to the investigation. The online activity began about three months before Amy Fanion's death, around the time Brian Fanion and Knowles' friendship turned flirtatious.",
      "\"\u2026 it's only when this affair starts up \u2026 that all of these incriminating searches start to appear,\" Hampden County Assistant District Attorney Mary Sandstrom told \"48 Hours.\"",
      "The first of these inquiries was related to common household poisons. On the morning of Feb. 12, Brian Fanion searched \"household poisons,\" \"dangerous sources of radiation,\" \"worst sources of radiation\" and \"common prescription overdoses.\" He also visited web pages titled, \"9 Surprising Sources of Radiation in Your Home;\" \"Carbon Monoxide: The Invisible Killer;\" \"Common and dangerous poisons;\" \"16 Common Household Items That Could Kill You;\" \"What Over-the-Counter Medications Can You Overdose From?;\" \"Which Drug Causes the Most Deaths Each Year?\" and, finally, \"Prescription Drugs Linked to Most Fatal Overdoses.\"",
      "At trial, Brian Fanion's defense attorney Jeffrey Brown argued that the Fanions were preparing to have a young niece stay with them and that some of the websites were related to potential hazards their 200-year-old house might pose.",
      "At the beginning of March 2018, Fanion repeatedly Googled his potential lover, Cori Knowles. On April 2, as things heated up between Fanion and Knowles, he began questioning the nuances of affairs, searching \"can you have an affair without sex.\"",
      "Two weeks later, on April 17, Fanion began researching divorce laws in Massachusetts. Several web pages he visited were related to pension rights after divorce. Fanion was planning for his upcoming retirement, and according to Knowles in an interview with police, he feared losing part of his pension if he were to divorce his wife. The following day, Brian Fanion's inquiries into infidelity resumed, visiting web pages titled \"My perfect affair \u2013 how I'm getting away with it\" and \"Emotional Infidelity: Worse Than A Sexual Affair?\"",
      "Eleven days before Amy Fanion died, on April 27, Brian Fanion searched \"gsr testing\" on his work computer. That morning between 9:22 and 9:38 a.m., Brian Fanion visited five web pages related to gunshot residue. Among those web pages were \"Gunshot Residue Collection: The Decisions that Make or Break a Case\" and a news report on YouTube called \"What gunshot residue tests tell us.\" Sandstrom told \"48 Hours\" this had nothing to do with Brian Fanion's work at the Westfield Police Department.",
      "\"He wasn't assigned to any active investigations in April and May of 2018 \u2026 that would necessitate looking up gunshot residue,\" Sandstrom told \"48 Hours.\" \"Nobody in the Westfield Police Department does gunshot residue testing.\"",
      "On May 7, 2018, the day before Amy Fanion was shot dead, Fanion repeatedly searched how to remove frequent contacts from his phone. At his trial, Fanion's defense argued that he was in the process of getting a new phone and wanted to know how to erase data from his current one. Sandstrom prosecuted the case.",
      "\"Now, the defendant suggests that he did these searches because he's in the process of getting a new phone right before his wife's demise,\" Sandstrom told the jury. \"But he's not looking to delete all data off of his phone \u2026 he's searching how to delete the frequently contacted list because he doesn't want evidence of his relationship with Corrine being discovered by the state police.\"",
      "Fanion's trial for the murder of Amy Fanion began on Feb. 23, 2023. Sandstrom's first witness was Amy Fanion's sister, Anna Hansen. Hansen testified that after Amy's death, Brian Fanion confided that he was concerned about some searches he had made.",
      "\"I asked him what that search was, and he said how to make a murder look like a suicide,\" Hansen said on the witness stand. Under cross examination by the defense, Detective Tom Forest testified that he never found any searches related to those terms.",
      "On the morning of May 8, 2018, while Brian Fanion was still at work, he searched \"massachusetts medical examiner offices\" and visited a website that listed the units within the Massachusetts State Police forensics section.",
      "In her closing arguments, Sandstrom stated that that morning, Brian Fanion was preparing for his wife's murder. \"He's looking up and researching the units that will appear \u2026 after he's committed this murder. \u2026 the evidence in this case proves beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant knew he was going to murder Amy Fanion when he left the Westfield Police Department at 11:47 a.m. on May 8th.\"",
      "Brian Fanion's defense argued that Amy Fanion had anger issues and suffered from severe anxiety. After Amy's death, many members of her family signed a letter in support of Brian, stating that they were certain Amy had taken her own life. Several members of Amy Fanion's family took the stand, and although they were called as witnesses for the prosecution, their testimonies supported Brian Fanion's defense.",
      "After a month-long trial, the jury found Brian Fanion guilty of the first-degree murder of Amy Fanion. He was sentenced to life in prison. His conviction is under appeal.",

    "story": [
      "The wife of an active-duty Coast Guardsman was arrested earlier this week by federal immigration authorities inside the family residential section of the U.S. Naval Air Station at Key West, Florida, after she was flagged in a routine security check, officials said Saturday.",
      "\"The spouse is not a member of the Coast Guard and was detained by Homeland Security Investigations pursuant to a lawful removal order,\" said Coast Guard spokesperson Lt. Cmdr. Steve Roth in a statement confirming Thursday's on-base arrest. \"The Coast Guard works closely with HSI and others to enforce federal laws, including on immigration.\"",
      "The arrest happened on move-in day at the base",
      "According to a U.S. official, the woman's work visa expired around 2017, and she was marked for removal from the United States a few years later. She and the Coast Guardsman were married early this year, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss an enforcement incident.",
      "Though the Trump administration has made immigration arrests a top priority for federal law enforcement, it did not immediately appear the on-base arrest of the military spouse was part of a broader sweep.",
      "The official said that when the woman and her Coast Guard husband were preparing to move into their on-base housing on Wednesday, they went to the visitor control center to get a pass so she could access the Key West installation. During the routine security screening required for base access, the woman's name was flagged as a problem.",
      "Base personnel contacted the Naval Criminal Investigative Service, which looked into the matter, said the official. NCIS and Coast Guard security personnel got permission from the base commander to enter the installation and then went to the Coast Guardsman's home on Thursday, the official said. They were joined by personnel from Homeland Security Investigations, a unit within Immigration and Customs Enforcement.",
      "HSI eventually took the spouse into custody, and the official said they believe she is still being detained. Officials did not provide the name of the country she is from.",
      "The Coast Guard referred questions about the woman's identity, immigration status and charges to ICE, which did not respond to a request for comment on Saturday. The Department of Homeland Security also did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "The husband of the arrested woman is a Coast Guardsman assigned to the USCGC Mohawk, a 270-foot-long cutter based at Key West. The couple was moving into U.S. government housing at the nearby Naval Air Station.",
      "An online database that tracks ship movements shows the Mohawk has been docked in its home port since mid-March. A March 16 media release says the ship had recently returned following a 70-day deployment to the Eastern Pacific Ocean on a mission to intercept shipments of illegal drugs.",
      "In a statement, the Navy said that it \"fully cooperated with federal law enforcement authorities on this matter. We take security and access at naval installations seriously.\"",

    "published": "Sat, 26 Apr 2025 21:10:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The blast happened at the Rajaei port just outside of Bandar Abbas, a major shipping site in Iran.",
    "story": [
      "A massive explosion and fire rocked a port Saturday in southern Iran, purportedly linked to a shipment of a chemical ingredient used to make missile propellant, killing at least 14 people and injuring about 750 others, officials said.",
      "Interior Minister Eskandar Momeni said on Telegram early Sunday that there were \"14 dead and 750 injured so far in the explosion,\" according to Agence France-Presse.",
      "The blast at the Shahid Rajaei port happened as\u00a0Iran and the United States met Saturday in Oman\u00a0for the third round of negotiations over Tehran's rapidly advancing nuclear program.",
      "While no one in Iran outright suggested that the explosion came from an attack, even Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, who led the talks, on Wednesday acknowledged that \"our security services are on high alert given past instances of attempted sabotage and assassination operations designed to provoke a legitimate response.\"",
      "CBS News partner network BBC News reported that verified videos appeared to show a growing fire prior to the explosion. Social media videos showed black billowing smoke after the blast. Others showed glass blown out of buildings miles away from the epicenter of the explosion.",
      "For hours, authorities in Iran offered no clear explanation for what caused the blast at the port, which is just outside of Bandar Abbas, though they did deny that the explosion had anything to do with the country's oil industry.",
      "However, the port took in a shipment of \"sodium perchlorate rocket fuel\" in March, the private security firm Ambrey said. The fuel is part of a shipment from China by two vessels to Iran first reported in January by the Financial Times. The fuel was going to be used to replenish Iran's missile stocks, which had been depleted by its direct attacks on Israel during\u00a0the war with Hamas in the Gaza Strip.",
      "\"The fire was reportedly the result of improper handling of a shipment of solid fuel intended for use in Iranian ballistic missiles,\" Ambrey said.",
      "Ship-tracking data analyzed by The Associated Press put one of the vessels believed to be carrying the chemical in the vicinity in March, as Ambrey said. Iran hasn't acknowledged taking the shipment. The Iranian mission to the United Nations didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on Saturday.",
      "It's unclear why Iran wouldn't have moved the chemicals from the port, particularly after\u00a0the Beirut port blast in 2020. That explosion, caused by the ignition of hundreds of tons of highly explosive ammonium nitrate, killed more than 200 people and injured more than 6,000 others. However, Israel did target Iranian missile sites where Tehran uses\u00a0industrial mixers to create solid fuel.",
      "Social media footage of the explosion on Saturday at Shahid Rajaei saw reddish-hued smoke rising from the fire just before the detonation. That suggests a chemical compound as being involved in the blast.",
      "\"Get back get back! Tell the gas (truck) to go!\" a man in one video shouted just before the blast. \"Tell him to go, it's going to blow up! Oh God, this is blowing up! Everybody evacuate! Get back! Get back!\"",
      "On Saturday night, the state-run IRNA news agency said that the Customs Administration of Iran blamed a \"stockpile of hazardous goods and chemical materials stored in the port area\" for the blast, without elaborating.",
      "Shahid Rajaei has been a target before. A 2020 cyberattack attributed to Israel targeted the port. It came after Israel said that it thwarted a cyberattack targeting its water infrastructure, which it attributed to Iran.",
      "Social media videos showed black billowing smoke after the blast. Others showed glass blown out of buildings kilometers, or miles, away from the epicenter of the explosion. State media footage showed the injured crowding into at least one hospital, with ambulances arriving as medics rushed one person by on a stretcher.",
      "Hasanzadeh, the provincial disaster management official, earlier told state television that the blast came from containers at Shahid Rajaei port in the city, without elaborating. State television also reported that there had been a building collapse caused by the explosion, though no further details were offered.",
      "The Interior Ministry said that it launched an investigation into the blast. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian also offered his condolences for those affected by the blast.",
      "Shahid Rajaei port in Hormozgan province is about 650 miles southeast of Iran's capital, Tehran, on the Strait of Hormuz, the narrow mouth of the Persian Gulf through which 20% of all oil traded passes.",

      "Mr. Trump and the first lady walked into St. Peter's Square and were directed to their front row seats around 4 a.m. ET, ahead of the service.

      "A person close to Steve Witkoff, the U.S. special envoy to the Middle East, acknowledged that the meeting had started and later ended. The source spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the closed-door talks. Iranian state television also reported their conclusion.",
      "Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi nor Witkoff\u00a0told state television after the talks that the parties exchanged written points throughout the day in discussions that he described as \"very serious and work-focused.\"",
      "\"This time, the negotiations were much more serious than in the past, and we gradually entered into deeper and more detailed discussions,\" he said. \"We have moved somewhat away from broader, general discussions \u2014 though it is not the case that all disagreements have been resolved.

      "A senior U.S. administration official said that the talks were \"positive and productive.\"",
      "\"This latest round of direct and indirect discussions lasted over four hours,\" the official said on condition of anonymity to discuss the talks. \"There is still much to do, but further progress was made on getting to a deal. We agreed to meet again soon, in Europe, and we thank our Omani partners for facilitating these talks.\"",

Authorities offered no immediate cause for the blast, which appeared to have been caused by a highly combustible material \u2014 though officials ruled out its oil and gas industry. The private security firm also linked to a shipment of a chemical ingredient used to make missile propellant to the port as well.",

      "The U.S. technical team, which is expected to arrive in Oman on Friday, will be led by Michael Anton, the director of U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio's policy planning staff. Anton does not have the nuclear policy experience of those who led America's efforts in the 2015 talks.",
      "Iran has insisted that keeping its enrichment is key. But Witkoff has muddied the issue by first suggesting in a television interview that Iran could enrich uranium at 3.67%, then later saying that all enrichment must stop. The demand that all enrichment stop has also been repeated by U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio.",

      "Francis sharply disagreed with Mr. Trump's approach on issues including immigration, the treatment of migrants and climate change. The Argentine pontiff and the American president sparred early in their relationship over immigration. In 2016, Francis, alluding to then-candidate Trump and his campaign slogan of \"Build the wall,\" called anyone who builds a wall to keep out migrants \" not Christian.\" Mr. Trump said the comment was \"disgraceful.\"",
      "But after Francis' death, the Republican president praised him as a \"good man\" who \"worked hard\" and \"loved the world.\" Mr. Trump also directed that U.S. flags be flown at half-staff in Francis' honor.",
      "Mr. Trump had said on a couple of occasions before leaving Washington that he would have \"a lot\" of meetings with counterparts on the sidelines of the funeral. But he seemed to back away from that as he flew to Rome.",
      "\"Frankly, it's a little disrespectful to have meetings when you're at the funeral of a pope,\" the president told reporters accompanying him aboard Air Force One. Nonetheless, Mr. Trump said, \"I'll be talking to people. I'll be seeing a lot of people.\"",
      "Mr. Trump didn't elaborate when asked if he'd just be meeting leaders in passing or holding more in-depth talks. He suggested he might have meetings at Villa Taverna, the U.S. ambassador's residence, where he spent the night.",
      "\"It's a little tough because we don't have much time,\" Mr. Trump said, noting his late arrival in Rome. He was scheduled to head back to the United States immediately after the funeral.",

      "Pope Francis's funeral began shortly after 10 a.m. local time (4 a.m. Eastern, 1 a.m. Pacific) at the Vatican, outside St. Peter's Basilica. The ceremony was presided over by the dean of the College of Cardinals, Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re.",
      "The funeral followed the Vatican's liturgical book for papal funeral rites, called the Ordo Exsequiarum Romani Pontificis. It was broken down into three separate\u00a0phases, or \"stations\": The\u00a0preparation\u00a0of the body, the\u00a0viewing\u00a0of the body, and then the\u00a0burial.",
      "An updated edition of the ancient papal funeral rites was approved by Pope Francis last year, changing some longstanding traditions, including the type of coffin used.",
      "Saturday's service began with music sung by the Sistine Chapel Choir. The first reading was done by American Vatican News journalist, Kielce Gussie.",
      "During the homily, Cardinal Re said \"mercy and the joys of the gospel\" were two priorities of Pope Francis, \"in contrast to the culture of waste.\"",
      "\"He often reminded us... that we all belong to the same human family and that no one is saved alone,\" Re said.",
      "Re said Pope Francis \"raised his voice, imploring peace,\" because \"war always leaves the world worse than it was before. It is always a painful and tragic defeat for everyone.\"",
      "He said Pope Francis encouraged people to \"build bridges, not walls.\"",

      "Pope Francis' funeral was attended by thousands of members of the public, as well as religious leaders and heads of state from around the world.",

      "Many popes have been laid to rest inside the Vatican, in the Vatican grottoes, a system of vaults on the lower level of St. Peter's Basilica \u2014 but in his last will and testament, Francis requested he be laid to rest in the church that had special meaning for him.",
      "\"I wish that my last earthly journey conclude precisely in this ancient Marian sanctuary where I went for prayer at the beginning and end of each Apostolic journey to confidently entrust my intentions to the Immaculate Mother and thank Her for her docile and maternal care,\" Francis said in his will.",
      "\"The tomb must be in the earth; simple, without particular decoration and with the only inscription: Franciscus,\" he wrote.",
      "Burial rites were to be led at the site by the Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church,\u00a0Cardinal Kevin Farrell.",
      "Among those that were gathered for the arrival of the pope's coffin at St. Mary Major were individuals from communities Pope Francis supported, including prisoners with special permission, homeless people, members of the trans community and victims and survivors of sex trafficking, the Vatican said.",
      "When will they choose the next pope?",
      "After the funeral, nine days of mourning began, called the Novemdiales.",
      "Eligible cardinals under the age of 80 \u2014 currently a group of about 135 \u2014 will gather in Rome to prepare for the papal conclave, the centuries-old process to select\u00a0the next pope. The conclave usually begins around two weeks after a pope's death, so in this case, likely in early May.",
      "During the conclave, eligible cardinals will isolate themselves and, behind closed doors in the Vatican's Sistine Chapel, they will cast ballots for their choice, repeating the process until a candidate receives a two-thirds-plus-one majority. The ballots, which are paper, are burned after each round of voting.",
      "If no choice has been reached, the ballots from that round send up black smoke from the chimney as they burn. When a new pope is finally selected, a cloud of white smoke is sent up to signal the momentous news to the world.",

      "\"Today, the last settlement in the Kursk region, the village of Gornal, has been liberated from Ukrainian forces,\" Gerasimov said during a video conference meeting with Putin, according to AFP.",
      "Ukrainian officials did not confirm the claim. In its morning update Saturday, Ukraine's General Staff said that its forces continue to hold back Russian troops in the Kursk sector, pushing back against Russian claims that Ukraine has been fully dislodged from the territory.",
      "In a statement, Putin congratulated the Russian soldiers and commanders and said that Kyiv's incursion had \"completely failed\".",
      "\"The complete defeat of our enemy along Kursk's border region creates the right conditions for further successes for our troops and in other important areas of the front,\" he said.",
      "Ukraine launched an audacious offensive into the border Kursk region in August last year, catching even its Western allies off guard and dealing an embarrassing blow to Moscow. It took control of an estimated 500 square miles of land. Ukraine had hoped that controlling the Russian territory would give it leverage during any future ceasefire talks. However, their gains were slowly eroded and Ukrainian troops continued to lose control of the territory throughout early 2025.",
      "Now, Russian troops are at the border and are poised to beef up threats to the Ukrainian region of Sumy, which faces Kursk, AFP reported.",
      "Gerasimov also confirmed Saturday that North Korean soldiers fought against Ukrainian troops in Russia's Kursk region. Gerasimov said that they took part in \"combat missions shoulder to shoulder with Russian servicemen during the repelling of the Ukrainian incursion\" and \"demonstrated high professionalism, showed fortitude, courage and heroism in battle.\"",
      "In the fall, Ukraine, the U.S. and South Korea all said that North Korea, which previously had supplied weapons to Moscow, had\u00a0deployed 10,000-12,000 of its troops\u00a0to Russia to fight in Kursk.",
      "Moscow and Pyongyang until now had responded vaguely to the South Korean and Western claims of the troop deployment, emphasizing that their military cooperation conforms with international law, without directly admitting the presence of the North Korean forces in Russia.",
      "The news out of Kursk came as U.S. President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy met in Vatican City on the sidelines of Pope Francis' funeral.",
      "The two presidents met at St. Peter's Basilica for about 15 minutes and agreed to continue negotiations later on Saturday, Ukrainian presidential spokesman Serhii Nykyforov said.",
      "White House Communications Director Steven Cheung also confirmed the meeting and said they \"met privately today and had a very productive discussion.\"",

      "\"The President of the United States believes, and I think rightly so, that we are moving in the right direction,\" Lavrov said.",
      "Meanwhile, in a statement Friday night, Zelenskyy said that \"very significant meetings may take place\" in the coming days, and that an unconditional ceasefire was needed.",
      "\"Real pressure on Russia is needed so that they accept either the American proposal to cease fire and move towards peace, or our proposal \u2014 whichever one can truly work and ensure a reliable, immediate, and unconditional ceasefire, and then \u2014 a dignified peace and security guarantees,\" he said.",

    "story": [
      "Even before Saturday's funeral service for Pope Francis at the Vatican, the leader known as \"the People's Pope\" had already broken with some traditions in the ways pontiffs are laid to rest. His body\u00a0lay in state for three days in St. Peter's Basilica, where members of the public have been filing past to pay their respects.",
      "Unlike his predecessors, who were buried in three nested coffins \u2014 one made of cypress, one made of lead, and one made of elm \u2014 the famously humble Francis chose to be buried in a simple wooden coffin.",
      "That change came as part of recently updated funeral planning for pontiffs, published late last year and approved by Francis.",
      "The updated Ordo Exsequiarum Romani Pontificis, as it's called in Latin, also says that the public should be able to view the pope's body in an open coffin.",
      "Another break from tradition is its direction that the ascertainment of the pope's death should take place in a chapel, not his room.",
      "\"A second edition [of the official funeral rites for pontiffs] became necessary, first of all because Pope Francis has requested it, as he himself has stated on several occasions of the need to simplify and adapt certain rites so that the celebration of the funeral of the Bishop of Rome may better expresses [sic] the faith of the Church in the Risen Christ,\" Archbishop Diego Ravelli, Master of Apostolic Ceremonies, said in a statement released by the Vatican at the time of the update.",
      "Archbishop Ravelli also said, \"The renewed rite also needed to emphasise even more that the funeral of the Roman Pontiff is that of a pastor and disciple of Christ and not of a powerful person of this world.\"",
      "The other major break from papal funeral tradition is the place where Francis has chosen to be buried.",
      "In his last will and testament, published shortly after his death, Francis requested that he be laid to rest outside the Vatican, in the Papal Basilica of St. Mary Major (Santa Maria Maggiore, in Italian). He often visited that ancient church in Rome to pray before and after his travels.",

    "summary": "Pope Francis's death at the age of 88 means the Catholic Church must choose a new leader. Here's how cardinals elect the next pontiff at the conclave.",
    "story": [
      "The reign of Pope Francis is over, and as the Catholic Church mourns his death, it is also looking to the future. Soon after Saturday's funeral, a papal conclave must be held to choose his successor, and the question now turns to which man \u2014 and it will be a man, as women cannot be ordained priests in the Catholic Church \u2014 will emerge and step onto the balcony in papal regalia to greet the crowds massed in St. Peter's Square at the Vatican.",
      "Below is a look inside the conclave process, with a step-by-step breakdown of how the next pope will be chosen and anointed under Michelangelo's iconic fresco on the ceiling of the Vatican's Sistine Chapel.",
      "What is the papal conclave, exactly?",
      "The papal conclave is the closely-guarded gathering of the cardinal electors \u2014 all serving cardinals under the age of 80 \u2014 to elect the next pope.",
      "The exact number varies, but there are currently about 135 cardinal electors who will convene at the Vatican from around the world to choose the successor to Pope Francis.",
      "Of those eligible this time around, a large majority \u2014 108 of them \u2014 were appointed by Pope Francis during his 12-year papacy. They come from 71 different countries; 10 are from the United States.",
      "When will the papal conclave begin?",
      "The Vatican has not yet announced the date when the conclave will begin, but under church rules, it must be within 15 to 20 days after the pope's death, which in this case would fall in the first or second week of May.",
      "How does the papal conclave work?",
      "How this assembly proceeds to choose the next pope is a process that dates back hundreds of years \u2014 an intricate, choreographed procession of rituals and ballots.",
      "On the first day of the papal conclave, the cardinal electors will shut themselves off from the outside world and begin the momentous task of choosing \u2014 likely from among their own ranks \u2014 the man who will become the 267th Bishop of Rome, better known as the pope.",
      "On Day One, the cardinals celebrate a morning Mass in St. Peter's Basilica. In the afternoon, they walk in a solemn procession into the Sistine Chapel, which will have undergone a security sweep to check for any illicit recording devices before their arrival.",
      "For centuries, the cardinal electors were physically locked inside the Sistine Chapel until they elected a new pontiff, left to eat and sleep beneath Michelangelo's vivid Renaissance masterpiece. These days, they do leave to rest and share meals at Santa Marta House \u2014 a hotel-like residence inside Vatican City where Francis had his own personal apartment during his pontificate \u2014 for however many days it takes them to come to a decision.",
      "Once the cardinals have all filed into the chapel, its great bronze doors are dramatically closed and sealed, and the first day's voting begins.",
      "How does the voting for a new pope work?",
      "The cardinals will have already discussed the merits of each papal prospect during days of \"general congregations\" at the Vatican before the conclave, but now the voting begins. Choosing the new pope requires not just a majority, but a two-thirds plus-one vote among the cardinal electors for a candidate to win. Pope Benedict XVI, who led the church prior to Francis, raised the threshold and enshrined the two-thirds requirement into church law two days before he stepped down.",
      "Each cardinal must swear an oath of absolute secrecy before they vote. If they disclose any information from within the conclave they will be excommunicated by the church.",
      "To vote, each cardinal writes their chosen candidate's name on a ballot, disguising his handwriting, then walks to an altar at the front of the chapel and deposits the paper onto a ceremonial plate. He then tips the ballot from the plate into a chalice-urn.",
      "As they are counted and the handwritten entries recorded by three cardinals at the altar, known as scrutineers, the ballots are deposited into another urn.",
      "A third urn, made of gilded bronze and silver and adorned with Christian imagery, is used to ferry ballots from any cardinals too ill to leave their sleeping quarters to the chapel for counting.",
      "After the first vote is held on the first afternoon, the cardinals' ballots are placed into one of two small ovens inside the Sistine Chapel and burned. A plume of smoke flows up a chimney and into the air over St. Peter's Square, watched for eagerly by the faithful, and the world's media.",
      "If that round of voting yields no winner, the smoke will be black \u2014 a sign to the world that the Holy See remains vacant.",
      "How long can a conclave last?",
      "The voting process will repeat itself the following day, with the cardinals holding two ballots in the morning and two in the afternoon. If the morning sessions are inconclusive, black smoke will be seen again around lunchtime \u2014 early morning on the U.S. East Coast.",
      "If there's still no winner following the afternoon votes, more black smoke will stream into the early evening Roman sky.",
      "If there's no two-thirds majority after three days, voting is paused for a day to allow time for prayer, discussion and a \"brief spiritual exhortation\" by the senior cardinal in the Order of Deacons.",
      "Then the voting process resumes. A conclave will last until enough of the cardinal electors agree on a choice for the next pope.",
      "How long has it taken to choose a new pope in the past?",
      "The longest conclave in history was the one that brought Pope Gregory X to the papacy in 1281. It lasted almost three years from the time the cardinals first began their voting.",
      "Recent conclaves, however, have lasted just days. Pope John Paul II needed eight ballots, over two days, to become the pontiff in 1978. His successor, Benedict XVI, was chosen on the fourth ballot, after two days, in 2005.",
      "Francis, in 2013, needed a mere five ballots, with the voting taking just 24 hours.",
      "What will happen once the conclave chooses the next pope?",
      "When enough cardinals agree on a candidate and the vote reaches the two-thirds-plus-one threshold, the chosen man is asked if he accepts the role. He will acknowledge by simply saying the word for \"I accept\" in Latin: \"Accepto.\"",
      "At that point, he becomes the new pope and will state his chosen pontifical name before the assembled cardinals. The most common papal name has been John, used 21 times. Others, including Simplicius, Hilarius and Zosimus, have only ever been used once. Pope Francis was also the first to choose his papal name.",
      "The ballots are then burned in the stove, but this time, a chemical additive is left out to create the much-anticipated plume of \"fumata bianca,\" white smoke.",
      "There has been confusion during some past conclaves over the color of the smoke rising over the chapel, so two conclaves ago, in 2005, a new tradition began. In addition to the white smoke, bells now chime, heralding the news that the Roman Catholic Church has a new leader.",
      "The new pope then immediately goes into a chamber adjoining the Sistine Chapel to be clad in the papal robes.",
      "As the faithful and the curious crowd into St. Peter's Square below, the cardinal deacon steps out onto the central balcony of St. Peter's Basilica to introduce the new pontiff with the famous phrase, \"Habemus papa\" \u2014 We have a pope.",
      "Finally, the new leader of the Catholic Church emerges into the spotlight to deliver his first blessing.",

      "\"Every papal conclave comes down, in some sense, to a referendum on the papacy that has just ended,\" John Allen, a longtime observer of the Vatican and editor of the Catholic news site \"Crux,\" said. Several of the likely frontrunners would represent continuity with the direction set by Pope Francis, he said, while others would signal \"a change in a slightly more traditional, conservative direction.\"",
      "No matter their leanings, Allen said, the cardinal electors will be looking for someone who can equal Pope Francis' stature on the world stage. \"They want, in part, someone who can have the same capacity to make it absolutely impossible for the wider world to ignore what the Catholic Church has to say.\"",

      "At 65 years old, he is known as a supporter of orthodoxy and defends priestly celibacy and the Church's moral teachings. He is also known as a promoter of social justice and a champion of the poor and voiceless, and is outspoken in his criticism of the Congolese government.",
      "Cardinal Mario Grech, secretary general for the Synod of Bishops",

      "Cardinal Luis Tagle of the Philippines",
      "Cardinal Luis Tagle, 67, and pro-prefect for the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples, is known as the \"Asian Francis\" for his missionary spirit as well as his emphasis on caring for the poor and welcoming of LGBTQ and divorced and remarried Catholics.",
      "He is the former archbishop of Manila, in the Philippines, which is one of the most Catholic countries on the continent of Asia, and studied in the U.S. for seven years. His election would signal a continuation of Francis' pontificate.",
      "Cardinal Matteo Zuppi, archbishop of Bologna, Italy",

      "\"He was a pope among the people, with an open heart towards everyone,\" Re said.

      "Read the full text of Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re's homily",
      "This is the translated text of the homily given by Cardinal Re during the funeral of Pope Francis:",
      "In this majestic Saint Peter's Square, where Pope Francis celebrated the Eucharist so many times and presided over great gatherings over the past twelve years, we are gathered with sad hearts in prayer around his mortal remains. Yet, we are sustained by the certainty of faith, which assures us that human existence does not end in the tomb, but in the Father's house, in a life of happiness that will know no end.",
      "On behalf of the College of Cardinals, I cordially thank all of you for your presence. With deep emotion, I extend respectful greetings and heartfelt thanks to the Heads of State, Heads of Government and Official Delegations who have come from many countries to express their affection, veneration and esteem for our late Holy Father.",
      "The outpouring of affection that we have witnessed in recent days following his passing from this earth into eternity tells us how much the profound pontificate of Pope Francis touched minds and hearts.",
      "The final image we have of him, which will remain etched in our memory, is that of last Sunday, Easter Sunday, when Pope Francis, despite his serious health problems, wanted to give us his blessing from the balcony of Saint Peter's Basilica. He then came down to this Square to greet the large crowd gathered for the Easter Mass while riding in the open-top Popemobile.",
      "With our prayers, we now entrust the soul of our beloved Pontiff to God, that he may grant him eternal happiness in the bright and glorious gaze of his immense love.",
      "We are enlightened and guided by the passage of the Gospel, in which the very voice of Christ resounded, asking the first of the Apostles: \"Peter, do you love me more than these?\" Peter's answer was prompt and sincere: \"Lord, you know everything; you know that I love you!\" Jesus then entrusted him with the great mission: \"Feed my sheep.\" This will be the constant task of Peter and his successors, a service of love in the footsteps of Christ, our Master and Lord, who \"came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life a ransom for many\" (Mk 10:45).",
      "Despite his frailty and suffering towards the end, Pope Francis chose to follow this path of self-giving until the last day of his earthly life. He followed in the footsteps of his Lord, the Good Shepherd, who loved his sheep to the point of giving his life for them. And he did so with strength and serenity, close to his flock, the Church of God, mindful of the words of Jesus quoted by the Apostle Paul: \"It is more blessed to give than to receive\" (Acts 20:35).",
      "When Cardinal Bergoglio was elected by the Conclave on 13 March 2013 to succeed Pope Benedict XVI, he already had many years of experience in religious life in the Society of Jesus and, above all, was enriched by twenty-one years of pastoral ministry in the Archdiocese of Buenos Aires, first as Auxiliary, then as Coadjutor and, above all, as Archbishop.",
      "The decision to take the name Francis immediately appeared to indicate the pastoral plan and style on which he wanted to base his pontificate, seeking inspiration from the spirit of Saint Francis of Assisi.",
      "He maintained his temperament and form of pastoral leadership, and through his resolute personality, immediately made his mark on the governance of the Church. He established direct contact with individuals and peoples, eager to be close to everyone, with a marked attention to those in difficulty, giving himself without measure, especially to the marginalised, the least among us. He was a Pope among the people, with an open heart towards everyone. He was also a Pope attentive to the signs of the times and what the Holy Spirit was awakening in the Church.",
      "With his characteristic vocabulary and language, rich in images and metaphors, he always sought to shed light on the problems of our time with the wisdom of the Gospel. He did so by offering a response guided by the light of faith and encouraging us to live as Christians amid the challenges and contradictions in recent years, which he loved to describe as an \"epochal change.\" He had great spontaneity and an informal way of addressing everyone, even those far from the Church.",
      "Rich in human warmth and deeply sensitive to today's challenges, Pope Francis truly shared the anxieties, sufferings and hopes of this time of globalization. He gave of himself by comforting and encouraging us with a message capable of reaching people's hearts in a direct and immediate way.",
      "His charisma of welcome and listening, combined with a manner of behavior in keeping with today's sensitivities, touched hearts and sought to reawaken moral and spiritual sensibilities. Evangelization was the guiding principle of his pontificate. With a clear missionary vision, he spread the joy of the Gospel, which was the title of his first Apostolic Exhortation, Evangelii gaudium. It is a joy that fills the hearts of all those who entrust themselves to God with confidence and hope.",
      "The guiding thread of his mission was also the conviction that the Church is a home for all, a home with its doors always open. He often used the image of the Church as a \"field hospital\" after a battle in which many were wounded; a Church determined to take care of the problems of people and the great anxieties that tear the contemporary world apart; a Church capable of bending down to every person, regardless of their beliefs or condition, and healing their wounds.",
      "His gestures and exhortations in favor of refugees and displaced persons are countless. His insistence on working on behalf of the poor was constant.",
      "It is significant that Pope Francis' first journey was to Lampedusa, an island that symbolizes the tragedy of emigration, with thousands of people drowning at sea. In the same vein was his trip to Lesbos, together with the Ecumenical Patriarch and the Archbishop of Athens, as well as the celebration of a Mass on the border between Mexico and the United States during his journey to Mexico.",
      "Of his 47 arduous Apostolic Journeys, the one to Iraq in 2021, defying every risk, will remain particularly memorable. That difficult Apostolic Journey was a balm on the open wounds of the Iraqi people, who had suffered so much from the inhuman actions of ISIS. It was also an important trip for interreligious dialogue, another significant dimension of his pastoral work. With his 2024 Apostolic Journey to four countries in Asia-Oceania, the Pope reached \"the most peripheral periphery of the world.\"",
      "Pope Francis always placed the Gospel of mercy at the center, repeatedly emphasizing that God never tires of forgiving us. He always forgives, whatever the situation might be of the person who asks for forgiveness and returns to the right path.",
      "He called for the Extraordinary Jubilee of Mercy in order to highlight that mercy is \"the heart of the Gospel.\"",
      "Mercy and the joy of the Gospel are two key words for Pope Francis.",
      "In contrast to what he called \"the culture of waste,\" he spoke of the culture of encounter and solidarity. The theme of fraternity ran through his entire pontificate with vibrant tones. In his Encyclical Letter Fratelli tutti, he wanted to revive a worldwide aspiration to fraternity, because we are all children of the same Father who is in heaven. He often forcefully reminded us that we all belong to the same human family.",
      "In 2019, during his trip to the United Arab Emirates, Pope Francis signed A Document on Human Fraternity for World Peace and Living Together, recalling the common fatherhood of God. Addressing men and women throughout the world, in his Encyclical Letter Laudato si' he drew attention to our duties and shared responsibility for our common home, stating, \"No one is saved alone.\"",
      "Faced with the raging wars of recent years, with their inhuman horrors and countless deaths and destruction, Pope Francis incessantly raised his voice, imploring peace and calling for reason and honest negotiation to find possible solutions. War, he said, results in the death of people and the destruction of homes, hospitals and schools. War always leaves the world worse than it was before: it is always a painful and tragic defeat for everyone.",
      "\"Build bridges, not walls\" was an exhortation he repeated many times, and his service of faith as Successor of the Apostle Peter always was linked to the service of humanity in all its dimensions. Spiritually united with all of Christianity, we are here in large numbers to pray for Pope Francis, that God may welcome him into the immensity of his love.",
      "Pope Francis used to conclude his speeches and meetings by saying, \"Do not forget to pray for me.\"",
      "Dear Pope Francis, we now ask you to pray for us. May you bless the Church, bless Rome, and bless the whole world from heaven as you did last Sunday from the balcony of this Basilica in a final embrace with all the people of God, but also embrace humanity that seeks the truth with a sincere heart and holds high the torch of hope.",

    "story": [
      "Theologian and Fox News contributor Jonathan Morris joins 'America's Newsroom' to discuss what's to come in the wake of Pope Francis' death.",
      "Viewership of the movie \"Conclave,\" which depicts the choosing of a new pope, has spiked in the days since Pope Francis died. But how much of the Academy Award winner is accurate to the real event about to take place?",
      "The Rev. Bryan Pham, a Jesuit priest and associate director for Catholic Studies at Gonzaga University in Spokane, Washington, told Fox News Digital he believes the movie was accurate according to the \"timeline and sequence of events of how to handle the death of a pope, the relaying of information, the gathering of the cardinals, and general procedures of getting the new pope elected.\"",
      "Pham, who was a graduate student in Rome during the last conclave that elected Pope Francis in 2013, also said the \"side conversations among the cardinals as they try to identify the challenges and the needs of the church when considering the qualities of the next pope\" rang true.",
      "HOW POPE FRANCIS' EXAMPLE 'SOUNDS A LOT LIKE JESUS'",
      "Ralph Fiennes in \"Conclave\" (Alamy)",
      "\"Although, in real-life, these conversations happen in what is called \u2018general congregation\u2019 and is much more formal,\" he said. \"But of course, cardinals are also mere mortals, so gossips and side-conversations do happen.\"",
      "\"Conclave,\" which came out last year and won the Oscar in March for best adapted screenplay, stars Ralph Fiennes as the cardinal in charge of the conclave after a fictional pope dies. It also stars Stanley Tucci, Isabella Rossellini and John Lithgow.",
      "Pham said the real conclave was an \"extraordinary experience,\" adding that some parts of the movie sensationalized the centuries-old ritual.",
      "\"Where \u2018Conclave\u2019 was clearly a Hollywood movie that wants to be sensational, create potential scandals for shock value in order to make money and perhaps perpetuate the anti-Catholic sentiment (especially in the United States)\" was \"everything else that played into the negative aspect of the Catholic mystique that perpetuate the Catholic Church as primitive and byzantine,\" he said.",

      "\"That said, I thought the movie was done well,\" Pham said. \"There were beautiful imageries, and the cinematography was excellent. The actors were also top-notch. I only wish Isabella Rossellini had a more prominent role (or lines); she is such an accomplished actor to be cast in such a relatively minor role.\"",
      "Fox News contributor Raymond Arroyo, who has personally witnessed three conclaves and is heading back to Rome for this one, said viewership of the movie spiked because it\u2019s \"in the zeitgeist. Anytime you have a pope die, you know, the visuals, the rituals of the church and the ceremony that accompanies the election of a pope is fascinating.\"",
      "Pope Francis died on Monday. (Lisa Maree Williams/Getty Images)",
      "Amazon Prime made \"Conclave\" available for free on its streaming service on Monday after the pope died.",
      "Arroyo said he thinks a superior movie to \"Conclave\" is 1968\u2019s \"The Shoes of the Fisherman,\" starring Anthony Quinn, which also depicts a conclave and is \"more gripping and dramatic and interesting.\"",
      "Arroyo agreed with Pham that the movie gets \"some of the details of the ritual, which is evocative and beautiful and fascinating\" right.",
      "\"And frankly, that's the best part of \u2018Conclave,' which is otherwise a very boring, draggy movie,\" Arroyo said.",
      "He noted that \"the writing of the ballot, the going up and swearing before Michelangelo's last judgment,\" raising their ballots and making an oath to the last judgment, placing the ballots in a vessel and having them counted by counters was all accurate.",
      "\"Conclave\" won the Oscar this year for best adapted screenplay. (Alamy)",
      "\"They count votes, and then they run a needle and string through them,\" he continued. \"So, all of that is correct. What's wrong is kind of the surrounds of the thing. The politics, the conversations playing out. It was very cartoonish, melodramatic dialogue.\"",
      "\"None of that happens in that way,\" he said, \"and the intrigue, I wish it were that interesting and fascinating, all the intrigues and people dying, having kids out of wedlock and all that, that's not happening.",

      "\"And they would, as depicted in the movie, if memory serves, they get on a bus, and they take them over to the Sistine Chapel, and they go in, and they're locked in for the day. You know they're basically locked in.\"",
      "Arroyo said that tradition goes back to one conclave when the cardinals weren\u2019t able to elect a pope for a year, \"and the conclave kept dragging on, and they hadn't elected a pope, so they decided to lock them in the place and not give them food or water, pressure them to make a decision.\"",

      "\"I thought the movie \u2018Conclave\u2019 exploited the church's visuals to drive home a message and a version of the church that just isn't on point,\" he said. \"I mean, when the nuns [were] lecturing all the cardinals while they're eating, that would never happen.

      "Arroyo said the concept \"runs counter to everything the church has ever taught. You know, Jesus didn't say follow me in doubt. He said follow me and believe. So that's what you're called to do. And no, doubt is not part of that.\"",
      "He continued, \"The wonder of miracles is that, you know, they defy reality, they defy natural law. That's the wonder of it: it shatters reality in some ways. But there's no doubt involved in that. It either happened or didn't happen. But if it happens, it wakes a lot of people up, and that's what happened initially. And that's why these people gave their lives for what Jesus said and for Christ himself. They gave their life because he rose again.\"",
      "\"That idea of doubt being at the heart of faith and at the heart of the church is a stupid one,\" he said, \"and one that people, I think a certain cast of mind, would like the church to pursue that path.\"",
      "The movie, he said, \"cast a certain ideological vision that they imagined the church should be, and it was an open, it's basically an open church, cut off from the very traditions that they celebrated and that the movie profits off of.\"",

      "The Supreme Court issued a ruling in a separate case on April 7, allowing the Trump administration to continue its deportations under the 1798 Alien Enemies Act (AEA), proving a significant victory for President Donald Trump's immigration agenda. The justices noted that the deportations could continue so long as the AEA detainees received proper notice.",
      "\"More specifically, in this context, AEA detainees must receive notice after the date of this order that they are subject to removal under the Act,\" the opinion reads. \"The notice must be afforded within a reasonable time and in such a manner as will allow them to actually seek habeas relief in the proper venue before such removal occurs.\"",
      "Due process is a constitutional principle that ensures fairness in legal and administrative proceedings, which includes giving proper notice and an opportunity to be heard in a timely manner by an impartial tribunal. The Supreme Court pointed to Reno v. Flores, a 1993 Supreme Court case, in writing, '\"It is well established that the Fifth Amendment entitles aliens to due process of law' in the context of removal proceedings.\"",

      "\"Chief Justice [John] Roberts is trying to get unanimity within the Supreme Court,\" Aronberg said. \"He wants everyone on the same page. And he also wants to avoid a constitutional crisis with the executive branch. So with all these competing interests in mind, he's trying to be more conciliatory than confrontational with the White House. But that can only go so far.\"",

      "\"For now, the Supreme Court is relying on, if there's going to be a habeas suit, it's going to be in the U.S. District Court and then that judge is going to have to rule,\" Ries explained. \"And I'm sure there will be appeals and some or all of it may end up back at the Supreme Court.\"",

      "It's considered the largest password compilation ever released.\u00a0With such a vast collection of breached credentials circulating, the risk of credential stuffing, identity theft and unauthorized access to online accounts and systems remains high.

      "Username and password on tablet\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why does password strength matter?",
      "Think of weak passwords as an open door for hackers. Recent reports show that many common passwords can be cracked in literally seconds. Simple or reused passwords are especially vulnerable to automated attacks, and once one account is breached, others are often quickly compromised.",
      "If a company you\u2019re signed up with experiences a\u00a0data breach and your login info is leaked, attackers can try that same password on other platforms, potentially unlocking a lot more than just one account.",
      "Strong passwords act as your first line of defense. They\u2019re long, complex and unique, making it significantly harder for attackers to guess or force their way in. When every account has its own strong password, even if one gets leaked, the rest stay safe.",
      "Think of it this way. A weak password is like using the same key for your house, car and office and leaving it under the doormat. A strong password? It\u2019s like a unique, high-security key for every door in your digital life.",

Grab a pen (or just keep a mental tally) and score yourself based on this 7-point password strength test.\u00a0Each \"yes\" earns you a point.\u00a0So, let\u2019s see how your password holds up in today\u2019s threat landscape.",
      "Length is your first line of defense. Short passwords \u2014 think six or eight characters \u2014 can be cracked in minutes by modern hacking tools. At 12 characters or more, you\u2019re making it exponentially harder for attacks to succeed.",
      "Mixing uppercase and lowercase letters strengthens your password by increasing complexity. For example, instead of using something like \"t8g5k9w2,\" use \"T8g5K9w2\" \u2014 same characters, just more variety. Mix it up.",
      "Adding numbers makes your password harder to crack. Instead of sticking to just letters \u2014 like \"Trkplmsh\" \u2014 try something like \"Tr8k5Plm2sh.\" Randomly placed numbers increase complexity and make your password much more secure.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "Symbols like !, @, #, and $ add another layer of security. For example, a password like \"T8g5K9w2\" becomes even stronger as \"T8g5#K9w2!.\" Special characters increase complexity and help defend against attacks.",
      "Reusing passwords is like handing hackers a master key. If one account gets breached, and you\u2019ve reused that password elsewhere, you\u2019re toast. One password, one purpose. No exceptions.",
      "Your name, birthday or \"Fluffy1990\" (your dog\u2019s name and birth year) might feel clever, but they\u2019re goldmines for attackers who can scrape social media or breached data. Keep it impersonal and unpredictable.",
      "Even good passwords can go stale. It\u2019s a smart move to update them every 90 days, or sooner if a site you use has a security issue.",

      "What should I do if my password strength is low?",
      "If your score didn\u2019t quite hit that seven out of seven mark, no worries. The good news? You\u2019ve already taken the first step by identifying the weak spots. Now, you\u2019ve got two options:",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "To keep your passwords secure, use ones that are at least 12 characters long with a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers and special characters. Avoid using personal information or common patterns. Always use a different password for each account, and enable\u00a0two-factor authentication whenever it's available.",
      "While you can build a strong password on your own, let\u2019s be real, it\u2019s not always easy. Coming up with something that\u2019s at least 12 characters long, includes uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, special symbols and isn\u2019t based on anything personal? That\u2019s a tall order. And even if you do manage to craft the perfect one, you\u2019ve still got to remember it, especially if you\u2019re using a different strong password for every account (which you absolutely should be).",
      "This is the easier, faster and frankly smarter route. A password generator creates long, complex, completely random passwords for you \u2014 no guesswork or mental gymnastics required. These tools are designed to pump out passwords that check all the boxes, making them far harder to crack. If you want an easy and secure option, many password managers include built-in password generators that follow best practices for maximum strength.",
      "Either way, the key takeaway is this: Don\u2019t settle for weak or recycled passwords. Whether you go DIY or use a tool, upgrading your password strength is one of the simplest ways to protect yourself online.",
      "Illustration of online banking login on laptop\u00a0 (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What is the best password manager?",
      "Password security can seem like a tough thing to maintain manually. The good news is that password managers take the hassle out of it by generating, storing and autofilling strong, unique passwords for you.",
      "We recommend a password manager that is secure, user-friendly and includes features like a password health tool, data breach monitoring and a built-in password generator to help you create strong, unique passwords. Essentially, they are a digital safe designed to encrypt and store your login credentials, passkeys, credit card details, personal information and even sensitive files. It remembers everything for you, organizes your credentials neatly and fills in login forms with a single click. When you sign up for a new site, it autosaves the password with no effort required.",
      "The best part? A password manager puts an end to password reuse. Instead of leaning on that tired old \"Fluffy1990\" for every account, it generates strong, unique passwords tailored to each site, boosting security for both your personal and professional life. So, with a password manager, you\u2019ll no longer have to ask yourself, how secure is my password?",

      "With data breaches becoming increasingly common, it's clear that password security isn't a \"set it and forget it\" task. It's an ongoing process.

These kinds of breaches often happen quietly, exposing large amounts of customer information without touching a company\u2019s main systems. It\u2019s becoming a serious concern for both businesses and their customers.",
      "One of the latest cases involves Hertz, the car rental giant, which recently confirmed that customer data was exposed because of a cyberattack on one of its software vendors.",

      "What happened at Hertz?",
      "Hertz, the global car rental company that also operates Dollar and Thrifty, has\u00a0disclosed a data breach affecting thousands of its customers. The incident stems from a cyberattack on one of its third-party vendors, software provider Cleo, in October 2024 and December 2024. The breach did not compromise Hertz\u2019s internal systems directly but involved data that had been shared with the vendor as part of its operational workflow.",
      "The compromised data varies by region but includes sensitive personal information such as names, dates of birth, contact details, driver\u2019s license numbers and, in some cases, Social Security numbers and other government-issued IDs. Certain financial information, including payment card details and workers\u2019 compensation claims, was also among the stolen records.",
      "In the U.S., disclosures were filed with regulatory bodies in California, Texas and Maine. Specifically, 3,457 individuals were affected in Maine and 96,665 in Texas. The total global impact, however, is believed to be far greater. Customers in Australia, Canada, the EU, New Zealand and the U.K. were also notified via breach notices on Hertz\u2019s regional websites.",
      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",
      "The breach is believed to be the work of the Clop ransomware gang, a well-known Russia-linked hacking group. Clop exploited a zero-day vulnerability in Cleo\u2019s enterprise file transfer software, technology used by many large organizations to securely transmit sensitive business data. In 2024, the gang launched a mass-hacking campaign targeting Cleo users, ultimately stealing data from more than 60 companies, including Hertz.",
      "Interestingly, while Hertz was named on Clop\u2019s dark web leak site in 2024, the company initially stated it had \"no evidence\" its systems or data had been compromised.",
      "When contacted by CyberGuy, a Hertz spokesperson said, \"At Hertz, we take the privacy and security of personal information seriously. This vendor event involves Cleo, a file transfer platform used by Hertz for limited purposes. Importantly, to date, our forensic investigation has found no evidence that Hertz's own network was affected by this event. However, among many other companies affected by this event, we have confirmed that Hertz data was acquired by an unauthorized third party that we understand exploited zero-day vulnerabilities within Cleo's platform in October 2024 and December 2024.\"",

      "What does this mean for customers?",
      "While Hertz\u2019s internal systems were not breached, the exposure of personal data, including driver\u2019s license numbers, contact details and government-issued IDs, poses serious risks. Affected individuals may be vulnerable to identity theft, fraudulent account openings and targeted\u00a0phishing attempts. If Social Security numbers were involved, the potential for harm increases significantly. Anyone who rented from Hertz, Dollar or Thrifty between October and December 2024 should be on high alert.",

Watch out for phishing scams and use strong antivirus software:\u00a0With access to your email, phone number or identification documents, attackers can craft convincing phishing emails pretending to be from healthcare providers or banks.

To defend yourself, use a strong antivirus program.\u00a0Get my picks of the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "2. Scrub your data from the internet using a personal data removal service:\u00a0The more exposed your personal information is online, the easier it is for scammers to use it against you. Following the Hertz breach, consider removing your information from public databases and people-search sites.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "3. Safeguard against identity theft and use identity theft protection:\u00a0Hackers now have access to high-value information from the Hertz breach, including Social Security numbers, driver's license and bank information. This makes you a prime target for identity theft. They can also assist you in freezing your bank and credit card accounts to prevent further unauthorized use by criminals. Signing up for identity theft protection gives you 24/7 monitoring, alerts for unusual activity and support if your identity is stolen.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",

      "4. Set up fraud alerts: Requesting fraud alerts notifies creditors that they need extra verification before issuing credit in your name. You can request fraud alerts through any one of the three major credit bureaus; they\u2019ll notify the others. This adds another layer of protection without completely freezing access to credit.",
      "5. Monitor your credit reports: Check your credit reports regularly through\u00a0AnnualCreditReport.com, where you can access free reports from each bureau once per year or more frequently if you\u2019re concerned about fraud. Spotting unauthorized accounts early can prevent larger financial damage.",
      "6. Change passwords and use a password manager: Update passwords on any accounts tied to compromised data. Use unique passwords that are hard to guess and let a password manager do the heavy lifting by generating secure ones for you. Reused passwords are an easy target after breaches. Consider\u00a0password managers for convenience and security. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "7. Be wary of social engineering attacks: Hackers may use stolen details like names or birth dates from breaches in phone scams or fake customer service calls designed to trick you into revealing more sensitive info. Never share personal details over unsolicited calls or emails. Social engineering attacks rely on trust, and vigilance is key.",

      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Cyber risk doesn\u2019t always come from a company\u2019s own network. It often originates in unseen corners of the digital supply chain. Even as companies double down on internal cybersecurity, they must be equally rigorous in how they vet and monitor third-party vendors. For consumers, it\u2019s no longer enough to trust the big brand on the label. The data trail is wider, the attack surface larger and the consequences far more opaque.",

      "Why are these extensions bad?",
      "The main concern is the level of access these extensions quietly request and how they use it. With permissions to read tabs, access cookies, intercept web requests and inject scripts into pages, they can monitor nearly everything you do in your browser. This includes tracking your browsing activity, observing login sessions and altering the content of websites you visit, all without your knowledge.",
      "These extensions are not simply misconfigured tools. They appear to be intentionally designed with surveillance in mind. Many store their configuration data locally, which allows remote servers to update their behavior at any time. This setup is commonly seen in spyware, where changes can be made after installation without alerting the user. The code is heavily obfuscated, making it difficult for researchers to understand what the extensions are actually doing.",
      "In some cases, the extensions appear to do nothing at all when clicked. However, they continue to send data in the background. For instance, the Fire Shield Extension Protection remained inactive until the researcher manually triggered it with a specific extension ID. Only then did it begin to transmit browsing activity and other data, revealing behavior that would be hard for an average user to detect.",

      "5 ways to stay safe from sketchy extensions",
      "If you\u2019re worried about the above extensions, here are five ways to safeguard your sensitive information and maintain your online privacy.",
      "1)\u00a0Keep your browser up to date: Chrome gets regular updates that get rid of most security issues. Make sure you turn on automatic updates for your browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge) so you\u2019re always running the latest version without thinking about it. See my guide on\u00a0keeping your devices and apps updated for more information.",
      "2) Install extensions only from trusted sources:\u00a0Official browser stores like the Chrome Web Store have rules and scans to catch bad actors. They\u2019re not perfect, but they are still a better option when compared to a random website on the internet. Extensions from unknown websites or third-party downloads are far more likely to hide malware or spyware.",
      "3) Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0A good antivirus can warn you before you install malicious software, such as sketchy browser extensions. It can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, helping keep your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks of the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "4) Be skeptical of extensions requesting unnecessary access: Some extensions overreach on purpose. A calculator tool asking for your browsing history or a weather app wanting your login data is a huge red flag.",
      "Before installing, ask, \"Does this permission match the extension\u2019s job?\" If the answer\u2019s no, don\u2019t install it. Watch out for broad permissions like \"Read and change all your data on websites you visit\" unless it\u2019s clearly justified (e.g., a password manager). If an update suddenly adds new permission requests, dig into why. It might mean the extension has been sold or hacked.",
      "5) Change your passwords and do it safely: If you\u2019ve ever saved passwords in your browser (e.g., via Chrome\u2019s built-in password manager or the \"Save Password\" prompt), those credentials could be at risk if a malicious extension was installed. These built-in managers store passwords locally or in your Google, Microsoft or Firefox account, and a compromised browser can give bad actors a way in.",
      "This doesn\u2019t typically apply to dedicated password manager extensions, which encrypt your data independently and don\u2019t rely on browser storage. However, if you're unsure whether an extension has been compromised, it's always smart to update your master password and enable two-factor authentication.",
      "For maximum safety, change your most important passwords (email, bank, shopping, cloud services) from a different, secure device, such as your phone or another computer, where the questionable extension was never installed. Avoid using the same browser that may have been exposed. Then consider switching to a\u00a0password manager to create and store strong, unique logins going forward. I\u2019ve reviewed the top options in my\u00a0best password managers of 2025 guide. See which one fits your needs best.",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The fact that several of these extensions carried Google\u2019s own \"Featured\" badge should serve as a wake-up call. It points to a serious lapse in oversight and raises concerns about how thorough Chrome\u2019s extension review process actually is. When millions of users unknowingly install spyware under the impression that it has been vetted and approved, the issue is no longer just about bad actors. It reflects a deeper failure within the platform itself. Google needs to take stronger responsibility by improving transparency and tightening its review standards.",

It\u2019s one of the first truly autonomous AI agents, able to do its own research, make decisions and even carry out plans, all with barely any human oversight.",
      "Sounds impressive, right? But here\u2019s the thing: While all this innovation opens up exciting possibilities, it also brings some serious privacy and security questions. Whether you\u2019re eager to try out the latest AI or you\u2019d rather steer clear, it\u2019s worth understanding what Manus could mean for your personal data and digital safety.",

      "Your data could be used to train AI, even if you go nowhere near it",
      "This has already been happening for a while with other AI models. There have been\u00a0several class-action lawsuits against tech companies for scraping personal data for\u00a0use in AI training, with one lawsuit claiming that OpenAI uses \"stolen private information, including personally identifiable information, from hundreds of millions of internet users, including children of all ages, without their informed knowledge or consent.\"",
      "Many companies also sell or share data with third parties, including for the purposes of AI training. For example, X has been using personal data to train its AI, Grok, and is also sharing user data with third parties to train AI models. So whether you use AI (including\u00a0Manus AI when it\u2019s released to the public) or not, there\u2019s still a good chance that they have your personal information.",
      "First truly autonomous AI agent (Manus) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "GOOGLE'S NEW AI TECH MAY KNOW WHEN YOUR HOUSE WILL BURN DOWN",
      "Why should you care if AI has your data?",
      "It boils down to data privacy and security. When AI companies collect personal information \u2013 things like your name, email address, home location, social media posts and even photos \u2013 they often store it in large databases to train their models. If those databases aren\u2019t properly secured, they can become gold mines for hackers. Think of them as digital \"honey pots\": sweet and tempting to cybercriminals because of all the personal data inside.",
      "This isn\u2019t just a theoretical risk. Just this year, another AI company,\u00a0DeepSeek, experienced a major leak that exposed more than a million sensitive records. When this kind of information gets out, it can end up on the dark web where scammers and identity thieves are more than happy to scoop it up. That\u2019s how people end up dealing with everything from identity theft and impersonation to tons of spam calls, phishing emails and targeted scams.",
      "But data leaks aren\u2019t the only danger. Even when the information is secure, it can be misused or manipulated in ways that are hard to detect. One of the biggest new threats is something called a prompt injection attack.",
      "In simple terms, prompt injection is a way for attackers to trick an AI into doing something it wasn\u2019t supposed to. Researchers recently found that attackers can embed hidden commands in seemingly harmless text, like a website bio, email signature or even a social media post. When the AI reads that text during training or browsing, it can accidentally follow the hidden instructions, which might tell it to leak information, change how it behaves or give unauthorized access to private data.",
      "First truly autonomous AI agent (Manus) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "DANGERS OF OVER-SHARING WITH AI TOOLS",
      "Manus AI poses even bigger risks",
      "Unlike most AI tools that respond to commands you give them directly, Manus is autonomous, meaning it can act on its own, follow links, read content and make decisions without human approval. While that sounds pretty cool, it\u2019s also what makes it a lot harder to spot when something goes wrong.",
      "If Manus encounters malicious content, it could unknowingly follow a hidden prompt, compromise your data or alter its behavior, and there may be no obvious sign that anything has happened until it\u2019s too late. There are also some concerns about where Manus sends and stores data. Security researchers have traced data back to servers in Shenzhen, China, raising red flags about surveillance, jurisdiction and who might ultimately have access to your information.",
      "So even if Manus isn\u2019t scraping anything too sensitive today, the combination of weak oversight, powerful automation and questionable data practices makes it far riskier than your average AI assistant.",

      "So, how can you protect yourself?",
      "As I\u2019ve mentioned, whether you use Manus AI or not, your personal information will still likely end up in its datasets, so the best way to protect yourself is to make your information difficult to find. Here are some things you can do.",
      "1) Be cautious about using Manus: With that level of autonomy, especially since it\u2019s a very new AI (not to mention the inconsistency in its privacy policy regarding governance), I wouldn\u2019t recommend using it quite yet. There\u2019s just too much damage it can do if it malfunctions or is subject to a prompt injection attack.",
      "2) Keep your personal information under wraps: With so many companies selling and trading personal information, many of them to tech companies to train AI, it\u2019s a good idea to withhold your data unless you absolutely can\u2019t avoid sharing it.",
      "3) Actively remove your personal information from the internet so your data can\u2019t be scraped by AI models like Manus: Set your social media to private, limit data collection through privacy settings and remove your information from data brokers and people-search sites. Autonomous cloud-based agents such as Manus are designed to extract and analyze vast amounts of online data, and your publicly available information can be swept into their training datasets without your knowledge or consent.",
      "While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "4) Use strong antivirus software to help defend against the broader attack surface created by autonomous AI systems: Manus\u2019 ability to act independently and interact with external systems increases the risk of adversarial attacks and malware transmission, so robust endpoint security is essential to protect your devices and data.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "5) Use privacy-focused products and services: Whenever you cannot avoid sharing personal information, opt for companies that prioritize your privacy. For example, use the DuckDuckGo browser instead of Chrome and Brave or Proton Mail instead of Gmail.\u00a0Check out the best private and safe browser alternatives to Google.",
      "6) Keep all software updated, including your operating system, browsers and security tools, to patch vulnerabilities that attackers might exploit: As AI agents like Manus operate in the cloud and may interact with your systems, unpatched software can become an easy target for exploitation or unauthorized access. Therefore, it's always a good idea to keep software, operating systems, browsers and security tools\u00a0updated at all times.",
      "7) Enable multifactor authentication (MFA) on all your accounts: As AI-driven attacks and automated data extraction become more common,\u00a0MFA adds a crucial layer of defense, making it much harder for attackers to compromise your accounts, even if an AI system leaks or scrapes your credentials.",
      "8) Use strong, unique passwords for every account: As cloud-based AI agents like Manus can interact with external systems and potentially access sensitive data, unique passwords help prevent a breach of one account from leading to a broader compromise.

      "Flying robots bring precision and efficiency to harvesting",
      "Tevel\u2019s Flying Autonomous Robots (FARs) are redefining fruit harvesting by combining artificial intelligence with advanced computer vision. These drones navigate through orchards, identifying and picking only the fruit that has reached peak ripeness. Their ability to maneuver carefully around branches allows them to harvest without bruising or harming the trees. Unlike human pickers, these drones can operate continuously, working day and night to get the job done faster and more consistently.",
      "Farmers benefit from detailed, real-time information about the harvest, including the size, color and ripeness of each fruit, all accessible through a mobile app. This data helps optimize harvesting schedules and reduce waste. FARs have already been deployed in orchards across the United States, Italy, Chile and Israel, where they have helped reduce labor costs by up to 30% while improving harvest accuracy. Multiple drones work together from a mobile platform, covering large orchard areas efficiently.",

      "If there\u2019s one thing I\u2019ve learned from covering data breaches over the years, it\u2019s that you should never take a company\u2019s initial numbers at face value. When a breach becomes public, most companies try to minimize the damage by reporting fewer victims or staying vague about what kind of data was exposed.",
      "Sometimes, to be fair, they genuinely don\u2019t have the full picture yet. But that rarely gets communicated clearly. The same thing just happened again with an insurtech company that has now doubled the number of people affected by a breach it disclosed last year.",
      "STAY PROTECTED & INFORMED! GET SECURITY ALERTS & EXPERT TECH TIPS \u2013 SIGN UP FOR KURT\u2019S \u2018THE CYBERGUY REPORT\u2019 NOW",
      "A woman working on her laptop (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What you need to know",
      "Texas-based insurance administrative services provider Landmark Admin has revised the scope of its May 2024 cyberattack, revealing that nearly twice as many people were impacted as initially reported. Back in October 2024, Landmark disclosed that suspicious activity was detected in its network on May 13, prompting an investigation. At the time,\u00a0it was estimated that the breach affected 806,519 individuals. But in a recent update filed with the Maine Attorney General\u2019s office, that number has now jumped to 1,613,773.",
      "Landmark serves as a third-party administrator offering backend support to major insurers like Liberty Bankers Life and American Benefit Life. This means millions of sensitive insurance policy records flow through its systems, making it a tempting target for cybercriminals.",
      "The compromised information varies for each individual but may include a wide range of sensitive personal data. This includes full names, home addresses, Social Security numbers, tax identification numbers, driver's license or state-issued identification numbers, passport numbers and bank account details. In some cases, medical information, dates of birth, health insurance policy numbers and details related to life and annuity policies may also have been exposed.",

      "6 ways you can stay safe from insurance data breach",
      "If your information was part of the Landmark breach or any similar one, it\u2019s worth taking a few steps to protect yourself.",
      "1) Consider identity theft protection services: Since the Landmark data breach exposed personal and financial information, it\u2019s crucial to stay proactive against identity theft. Identity theft protection services offer continuous monitoring of your credit reports, Social Security number and even the dark web to detect if your information is being misused. These services send you real-time alerts about suspicious activity, such as new credit inquiries or attempts to open accounts in your name, helping you act quickly before serious damage occurs.",
      "Beyond monitoring, many identity theft protection companies provide dedicated recovery specialists who assist you in resolving fraud issues, disputing unauthorized charges and restoring your identity if it\u2019s compromised. They often include up to $1 million to cover losses and legal fees and a white-glove fraud resolution team in which a U.S.-based case manager helps you recover any losses.\u00a0See my tips and best picks on how to protect yourself from identity theft.",
      "2) Monitor your accounts and transactions:\u00a0The Landmark data breach revealed bank details to attackers, which means they can misuse those details to steal your money. You should check your online accounts and transactions regularly for any suspicious or unauthorized activity. If you notice anything unusual, immediately report it to the service provider or authorities. You should also review your credit reports and scores to see if there are any signs of identity theft or fraud.",
      "3) Contact your bank and credit card companies:\u00a0Since Landmark hackers obtained bank and credit card information, they could use it to make purchases or withdrawals without your consent. You should inform your bank and credit card companies of the situation. They can help you freeze or cancel your cards, dispute any fraudulent charges and issue new cards for you. You should also contact one of the three major credit reporting agencies (Equifax, Experian or TransUnion) and request a fraud alert to be placed on your credit file. This will make it more difficult for identity thieves to open new accounts in your name without verification.",
      "4) Use personal data removal services:\u00a0The data breach leaks loads of information about you, and all this could end up in the public domain, which essentially gives anyone an opportunity to scam you.\u00a0One proactive step is to consider personal data removal services, which specialize in continuously monitoring and removing your information from various online databases and websites. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "5) Have strong antivirus software:\u00a0Landmark hackers have people's email addresses and full names, which makes it easy for them to send you a phishing link that installs malware and steals all your data. These messages are socially engineered to catch them, and catching them is nearly impossible if you're not careful. However, you\u2019re not without defenses.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "6) Enable two-factor authentication:\u00a0While passwords weren\u2019t part of the data breach, you still need to enable\u00a0two-factor authentication (2FA). It gives you an extra layer of security on all your important accounts, including email, banking and social media. 2FA requires you to provide a second piece of information, such as a code sent to your phone, in addition to your password when logging in. This makes it significantly harder for hackers to access your accounts, even if they have your password. Enabling 2FA can greatly reduce the risk of unauthorized access and protect your sensitive data.",
      "WINDOWS 10 SECURITY FLAWS LEAVE MILLIONS VULNERABLE",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "The real risk with breaches like this isn't just the initial leak. It's the slow drip of consequences that follow. As more names and numbers surface, the fallout becomes harder to contain, and the people impacted are left scrambling to protect themselves. Landmark\u2019s delayed clarity is a reminder that in the world of cyberattacks, timelines rarely work in the public\u2019s favor. By the time the full picture emerges, the damage may already be done.",

      "\u200b\u200bImagine powering your boat not with gasoline but with clean hydrogen fuel. That\u2019s exactly what Yamaha, together with Roush Industries and Regulator Marine, is working on right now. They\u2019re developing the world\u2019s first hydrogen-combustion outboard engine, aiming to make boating greener and more sustainable.",
      "This is part of Yamaha\u2019s big plan to reach carbon neutrality by 2050, using a mix of electric, alternative fuels and now hydrogen technology.",

      "Hydrogen fuel motor (Yamaha) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "The big, big moment: First hydrogen fill-up",
      "To reach their goal, a specially modified Regulator Marine 26XO boat was taken to a hydrogen fueling station. The team filled its tanks with hydrogen for the very first time, which was a huge milestone. This 26-foot boat runs on a tweaked version of Yamaha\u2019s powerful 450hp XTO outboard engine, but instead of gasoline, it\u2019s fueled by gaseous hydrogen.",
      "Matt Van Benschoten from Roush, who\u2019s been deeply involved in the project, called it\u00a0\"a big moment.\" He handled the tricky job of designing and integrating the hydrogen fuel system, making sure everything was safe and worked smoothly.",

      "RIDE THE WAVES WITH THE MOST ADVANCED WAKE BOAT EVER",
      "What\u2019s different about this hydrogen outboard?",
      "Yamaha started with their largest offshore outboard, the XTO 450, and made some smart changes to handle hydrogen. They adjusted parts like the cylinder heads, fuel lines and injectors to work with hydrogen\u2019s unique properties. But most of the engine is still the same as the gasoline version.",
      "The boat itself was modified to fit three high-pressure hydrogen tanks, each holding fuel at 700 bar (that\u2019s super-high pressure). These tanks are designed to expand as they fill up, so Yamaha\u2019s engineers had to come up with clever mounting solutions that let the tanks move a bit without causing problems. Though Yamaha hasn't disclosed the gasoline equivalency of the hydrogen tanks, they are striving to achieve optimal capacity for marine industry applications.",

      "4-LEGGED HYDROGEN-POWERED ROBOT YOU CAN ACTUALLY RIDE",
      "Safety first: Smart systems on board",
      "Safety is a huge focus here. The boat uses a standard hydrogen refueling connector and follows strict protocols to make sure filling up is safe and efficient. There\u2019s even tank monitoring feedback between the boat and the fueling station that monitors tank conditions and can stop refueling if things get too hot.",
      "Inside the boat, multiple hydrogen detectors keep an eye on gas levels. If hydrogen starts to build up, the system alerts the captain. If it gets too high, the engine shuts down and vents the gas safely. Plus, Roush designed a special ventilation system to make sure any leaked hydrogen escapes from the highest points on the boat, since hydrogen is lighter than air and rises.",

      "Yamaha first showed off this hydrogen outboard at the Miami Boat Show, then took it to the SEMA Show in Las Vegas to get the automotive and marine industries talking about hydrogen infrastructure. They\u2019ve built two boats so far: one for display and one for real-world testing. Now, the team is focused on fine-tuning the system, running safety tests and figuring out how far the boat can go on a tank of hydrogen. They\u2019re also working on making refueling faster and more convenient.",
      "Hydrogen fuel motor (Yamaha) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Challenges and possibilities of hydrogen technology",
      "Right now, the tanks are cylindrical and take up a lot of space, limiting how much hydrogen the boat can carry. However, in the future, Yamaha hopes to use other tank alternatives to integrate more efficiently and fit better inside the boat hull. Finding the right parts for these super-high-pressure hydrogen systems isn\u2019t easy either; the supply chain is still catching up. However, with partners like Roush and Regulator Marine, Yamaha is pushing through these challenges.",
      "And it\u2019s not stopping there. Yamaha recently acquired electric outboard maker Torqeedo, showing they\u2019re serious about exploring all kinds of clean marine propulsion technologies.",
      "Ben Speciale, president of Yamaha's U.S. Marine Business Unit, tells Cyberguy, \"Our hydrogen outboard concept is on the water now, and we\u2019re learning more about how to optimize its performance every day. We believe a multiple-technology solution is the best way to achieve cleaner products on the water, and hydrogen represents one of those pathways within our product line. We\u2019re optimistic about the future of hydrogen in the marine industry, and we look forward to sharing specific performance data as it becomes available.\"",

      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson says an Apple Watch saved psychiatrist Amanda Faulkner by detecting deadly leukemia early.",
      "In recent years, smartwatches have gone far beyond just telling the time or tracking steps. These little gadgets on our wrists are becoming powerful health tools, quietly monitoring our bodies and sometimes even alerting us to serious medical issues before we realize something\u2019s wrong. From tracking heart rate and sleep patterns to measuring blood oxygen levels, smartwatches are helping people stay more in tune with their health than ever before.",

      "Apple Watch saves woman\u2019s life (Amanda Faulkner) (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "The life-saving power of wearable technology",
      "Take Amanda Faulkner\u2019s story, for example. Amanda, a consultant psychiatrist from New Zealand, was feeling unusually tired and hot one summer, but she just put it down to the heat or maybe perimenopause. She was busy with over 60 patients and didn\u2019t think much of it. But her new\u00a0Apple Watch kept sending alerts that her resting heart rate was way higher than normal, jumping from her usual 55 beats per minute up into the 90s.",
      "At first, she thought the watch was wrong. She was fit and healthy, after all, and she had even recently been hiking. However, the notifications kept coming every morning, and eventually Amanda decided to see her GP. That decision probably saved her life.",
      "Within hours of tests, she was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia, a rare and aggressive blood cancer. Doctors told her that if she had waited another 48 hours, she might not have survived.",

      "HOW TO CHECK YOUR HEARTBEAT WITH THE EKG APP ON YOUR APPLE WATCH",
      "The wider impact of Amanda\u2019s story",
      "Amanda\u2019s experience shows just how powerful these wearable devices can be, not as medical diagnosis tools but as early warning systems that encourage people to seek help sooner. Apple, for instance, is clear that its heart monitoring features aren\u2019t meant to replace doctors but to provide useful information that can prompt users to get checked out. Elevated heart rates can signal many things, from infections to allergic reactions, and catching these signs early can make all the difference.",
      "Amanda's husband, Mike, told us, \"The positive press from this story has also led to many friends and family members deciding to act on health concerns and/or buy an\u00a0Apple Watch, and I have seen many similar comments on social media where the post has been replicated. She has also had complete strangers come to see her in the hospital to discuss their own cancer journeys, and as Amanda cannot work in her role as a psychiatrist, these interactions have been great, allowing Amanda to \u2018help\u2019 people again, which, after all, is her vocation in life.\"",
      "Amanda remains in treatment, including chemotherapy and an upcoming stem cell transplant, but she remains optimistic and grateful for the smartwatch that gave her a fighting chance. She urges others, especially women who often have their symptoms dismissed, to trust their instincts and advocate for their health.",

      "HOW TO MONITOR BLOOD PRESSURE WITH YOUR APPLE WATCH",
      "Limitations and risks of smartwatch health monitoring",
      "While smartwatches offer incredible benefits, it\u2019s important to recognize their limitations. These devices are not medical-grade tools and can sometimes produce false positives or miss critical health issues. Overreliance on smartwatch data may lead to unnecessary anxiety or, conversely, false reassurance. Additionally, not everyone\u2019s body responds the same way, and factors like skin tone, movement or device placement can affect accuracy. Privacy and data security are also concerns, as sensitive health information is transmitted and stored digitally. It\u2019s essential to view smartwatches as supplementary tools that can prompt users to seek professional medical advice rather than definitive diagnoses.",

      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Smartwatches are more than just tech accessories; they\u2019re becoming essential health companions. While they don\u2019t replace professional medical advice, their ability to monitor vital signs continuously and alert users to potential problems is transforming how we approach health. Amanda Faulkner\u2019s story is a powerful reminder that sometimes the smallest devices can make the biggest difference, literally saving lives by catching warning signs early. So, if your smartwatch starts \"nagging\" you about your health, it might just be worth paying attention to it.",

      "Here are five reasons why a flare-up between India and Pakistan matters:",
      "The Kashmir attack could lead to an armed conflict between 2 neighbors",
      "Under intense domestic pressure, India has hinted at the possibility of a limited military strike on Pakistan in response to what it called the \"terror attack\" with \"cross-border links.\" Pakistan has made it clear that it will respond militarily to an attack.",
      "This raises fears that an escalation by any one side could lead to a wider war. The last time the two nations came to blows was in 2019, when a suicide car bombing killed 40 Indian soldiers in Kashmir.",
      "In 2021, the sides renewed a ceasefire agreement along their border, which has largely held. That relative calm was broken on Thursday after a brief exchange of fire between their armies.",
      "Kashmir is a nuclear flashpoint between the archrivals",
      "Both India and Pakistan are armed with nuclear weapons. There are fears that any conventional war or skirmish between them could potentially turn into a nuclear exchange.",
      "India and Pakistan fought two major wars, in 1965 and 1971, but in 1974, India conducted its first nuclear tests, raising the stakes in any military conflict. It triggered a nuclear race and Pakistan reached that same milestone in 1998.",
      "Kashmiri villager women walk past the blown-up family home of Asif Shiekh, a militant who officials say is involved in the deadly attack on tourists in Pahalgam, at Monghama village in Tral, south of Srinagar, Indian-controlled Kashmir, Friday.\u00a0 (AP Photo/Dar Yasin)",
      "Since then, India and Pakistan have had one major border skirmish in 1999 that killed at least 1,000 combatants. The fighting only stopped after the U.S. intervened.",
      "A conflict could bring in China",
      "India and China are geopolitical rivals whose armies clashed along the disputed Himalayan border in 2020. Ties between the Asian giants have improved since, but they still maintain large numbers of troops on their borders. Their borders are also contiguous to Pakistan's, making it the world\u2019s only three-way nuclear junction.",
      "Beijing also controls a part of the Kashmir region that New Delhi says belongs to India.",
      "On the other hand, China is also a main ally of Pakistan and has helped advance its missile programs, creating additional military concerns for New Delhi. Meanwhile, India maintains strong defense ties with the U.S., which has long sought to limit Beijing\u2019s rise in the Indo-Pacific region.",
      "Experts say any conflict between India and Pakistan is unlikely to stay strictly between them, as their strategic partners are likely to get involved.",
      "Kashmir tensions can lead to a war over water",
      "In response to the massacre, India suspended a crucial treaty that governs the flow of river waters into Pakistan. Pakistan said it would consider any attempt to stop the flow of water from India an \"act of war.\"",
      "Under the Indus Water treaty, India is obliged to let six rivers flow freely to Pakistan. If India follows through and restricts the flow, it could have a devastating impact on Pakistan's agriculture as it battles acute water shortages.",
      "It's also a major environmental issue. Water insecurity is a big concern in both India and Pakistan due to rapidly growing populations and climate change.",

It has hurt India's human rights record and raised concerns that global powers are not doing enough to pressure New Delhi and hold it accountable.",
      "Militants fighting against Indian rule have also killed scores of civilians, including Hindu pilgrims.",

      "The port took in a shipment of \"sodium perchlorate rocket fuel\" in March, the private security firm Ambrey said. The fuel is part of a shipment from China by two vessels to Iran first reported in January by the Financial Times. The fuel was going to be used to replenish Iran's missile stocks, which had been depleted by its direct attacks on Israel during the war with Hamas in the Gaza Strip.",

However, Israel did target Iranian missile sites where Tehran uses industrial mixers to create solid fuel.",

Israeli officials didn't respond to requests for comment regarding Saturday's explosion.",

      "Indian and Pakistani soldiers briefly exchanged fire along their highly militarized frontier in the disputed Himalayan region of Kashmir, Indian officials said Friday, as tensions soared between the nuclear-armed rivals following a deadly attack on tourists.",
      "India has described the massacre in which gunmen killed 26 people, most of them Indian, as a \"terror attack\" and accused Pakistan of backing it. Pakistan denied any connection to the attack near the resort town of Pahalgam in India-controlled Kashmir. It was claimed by a previously unknown militant group calling itself the Kashmir Resistance.",

      "Pakistan responded angrily that it has nothing to do with the attack, and canceled visas issued to Indian nationals, closed its airspace for all Indian-owned or Indian-operated airlines and suspended all trade with India. Nationals from both sides began heading back to their home countries through the Wagah border near Pakistan\u2019s eastern city of Lahore on Friday.",
      "Islamabad also warned that any Indian attempt to stop or divert the flow of water would be considered an \"act of war.\" The suspension of the water treaty could lead to water shortages at a time when parts of Pakistan are already struggling with drought and declining rainfall.",
      "Pakistan has also warned it could suspend the Simla Agreement \u2014 in what would be a major and worrying step. The peace treaty signed after the 1971 India-Pakistan war established the Line of Control, a highly militarized de facto border that divides Kashmir between the countries.",

We haven\u2019t seen him since and nothing was ever recovered from this house despite multiple raids,\" said Afroza, the aunt of one of the local men accused, Asif Sheikh.

      "\"The potential Russian naval logistics facility in Sudan would support Russian power projection in the Red Sea and Indian Ocean,\" John Hardie, deputy director of the Russia Program at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD), told Fox News Digital. He added that \"this issue has gained greater importance for Moscow, given the uncertainty over the future of its Tartus naval logistics facility.\"",
      "A Russian naval base in the Indian Ocean has strategic military implications \u2014 it\u2019s a relatively short sailing distance to the Red Sea and the Suez Canal, a choke point through which an estimated 12% of the world\u2019s shipping passes, while 61% of global oil tanker traffic is also said to use the canal. Koffler said this poses a significant security threat.",

      "\"If Russia perceives an impending escalation against Russia, let\u2019s say in Ukraine \u2014 such as an impending deployment of NATO forces or draconian economic measures designed to tank [the] Russian economy \u2014 I would not rule out the possibility that Putin could authorize something disruptive to exploit the choke point and destabilize or disrupt global shipping, as a way of deterring Western actions threatening Russia.\"",
      "The deal permitting Moscow to build a military base has been given the green light, although there are serious logistical challenges involved. \"The agreement between Sudan and Russia was finalized in February, following a meeting between Sudan's Foreign Minister Ali Yusef Sharif and Russia\u2019s Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in Moscow,\" Koffler explained.",

      "\"There can be no overstating the brutality and destructiveness of the RSF assault on Zamzam (refugee camp),\" Sudan researcher Eric Reeves told Fox News Digital this week. \"The camp that has existed since 2004 is no longer, even as it had grown to more than 500,000 people.\"",
      "Ominously, Reeves added that \"the real dying has only just begun. Nearly the entire population of Zamzam has fled, and in all directions the threat of RSF violence remains. This creates insecurity of a sort that prevents humanitarians from reaching these scattered people. Tremendous numbers will die either from RSF violence or the lack of food, water and shelter.\"",

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The merch is out and available for a price on the Trump Organization website: $50 for a \u201cTrump 2028\u201d hat; $36 for a shirt that reads \u201cTrump 2028 (Re-write the Rules).\u201d",
      "The rules aren\u2019t so easily undone. Donald Trump can\u2019t be elected again in 2028 under the constitutional amendment limiting presidents to two terms. Any number of Trump\u2019s Republican allies will tell you that a third term is inconceivable given the enormous hurdles required to pass a new amendment.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s not going to run for another term,\u201d former Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich told NBC News. But, he added, Trump has reason to talk about it: \u201cDon\u2019t underestimate the degree to which he believes any Trump-centered noise is good, because it starves his opponents.\u201d",
      "Yet Trump continues to flirt with the prospect of serving until 2033, when he would be 86 years old. Whether he\u2019ll follow through or not, his assertion that a third term is no joke is something that would-be contenders ignore at their own peril.",
      "Teasing a third term freezes the 2028 GOP presidential field until aspiring candidates have a clearer understanding of whether and how far Trump intends to push the limits of the Constitution.",
      "Anyone who front-runs Trump and mounts a campaign before he declares his intentions might offend the MAGA movement.",
      "Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Josh Hawley of Missouri, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis \u2014 none are likely to start building a campaign unless and until Trump concedes this term is his last.",
      "Doing so would invite \u201ctotal and complete rejection,\u201d said Steve Bannon, a senior White House official in Trump\u2019s first term who is exploring ways for Trump to serve a third term. \u201cTrump is MAGA; MAGA is Trump.\u201d",
      "Asa Hutchinson, a former Arkansas governor who ran against Trump for the Republican presidential nomination in 2024, said Trump\u2019s third-term musings \u201cparticularly impact JD Vance and Ron DeSantis and anyone else who wants the favor of Donald Trump. They know they have to stay out of the mix until Donald Trump gives the blessing to go after it and says that he would not be seeking a third term.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s not likely to happen any time soon. The party expects Trump to draw out an announcement about his future as long as he can, according to a Republican who is close to possible 2028 candidates. The more Trump delays, the more he commands attention and averts the perception that he\u2019s a lame duck.",
      "The White House has considerable leverage at this point. No serious GOP presidential hopeful would want Trump\u2019s ire.",
      "Consider the case of DeSantis. Trump endorsed him in the 2018 Florida gubernatorial primary and viewed his subsequent 2024 presidential primary challenge as a betrayal.",
      "On top of that, Trump\u2019s political base began to distrust DeSantis after he jumped in the race against Trump, a sentiment that hasn\u2019t subsided. Before the GOP Iowa caucuses last year, Laura Loomer, one of Trump\u2019s most vocal supporters, told DeSantis in the lobby of a hotel: \u201cYou killed your political career, and I hope you\u2019re happy.\u201d",
      "The best way for putative candidates to stay on the right side of Trump is by going along with the notion that he might indeed run, a Trump political adviser said.",
      "\u201cI think anyone looking to 2028 is probably the first person to purchase one,\u201d said the adviser, referring to the \u201cTrump 2028\u201d hat, who was granted anonymity to share internal thinking.",
      "Vance may be better positioned than most rivals as Trump floats the idea of a third term. He has a built-in platform as a sitting vice president, complete with the perks that the job brings.",
      "At his disposal is a taxpayer-funded staff and an airplane that he can use to build his foreign policy bona fides. It helps that his boss is a bit of a homebody and has eschewed extensive travel. This month, Vance met with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni in Rome to discuss tariffs. He had an audience with Pope Francis shortly before the pontiff\u2019s death.",
      "With Trump controlling the Republican National Committee, Vance last month became the group\u2019s finance chairman, allowing him to befriend well-heeled donors who can be helpful to a future campaign.",
      "Vance has made no movements toward his own presidential run and has yet to seriously think about the idea, a source close to the vice president said.",
      "When asked if he views himself as Trump\u2019s successor, Vance insisted last month that his own White House bid was not an urgent priority but acknowledged the circumstances under which he\u2019d become a strong candidate. He also suggested that any serious moves would come after the 2026 midterm elections.",
      "\u201cIf I do really well for the next four years, everything else will take care of itself,\u201d Vance said in an interview with NBC News. \u201cNow, like, yeah, in two and a half years, will that become harder? Will people be more focused on politics than on what the White House is maybe doing that particular day? Maybe.\u201d",
      "Others can\u2019t be as confident. DeSantis faces term limitations and will be out of office in 2027, so he won\u2019t have the stage that the Florida governor\u2019s office provides. Still, that might not dampen his ambitions.",
      "\u201cHe absolutely believes he can still be president. While most on the outside looking in do not think he has viability, that\u2019s just not how he thinks. It\u2019s not how he views the world,\u201d a longtime DeSantis ally said.",
      "If Trump finds a way to run, though, his grip on the GOP is such that  serious opposition may well evaporate.",
      "The most direct way for Trump to circumvent the 22nd Amendment is to change it. But that\u2019s nearly an insurmountable obstacle in these polarized times, requiring three-quarters of the states to go along, for starters.",
      "More fanciful ideas for overcoming the legal barrier involves a scenario in which Vance runs for president and picks Trump as his running mate. If they win, Vance then steps aside and Trump becomes president again.",
      "Were Vance to go along with that, attention might turn from the 22nd Amendment to the 12th. That amendment states that no one who is ineligible under the Constitution to be president shall be eligible to serve as vice president.",
      "So the question then becomes, is Trump ineligible to be Vance\u2019s running mate given that he\u2019s barred under the 22nd Amendment from being elected to a third term? And, here, the answer may come down to a careful textual reading of the two amendments at issue.",
      "An argument might be made that because the 22nd Amendment says only that Trump can\u2019t be elected president a third time, that doesn\u2019t mean he can\u2019t be president if Vance were to resign and turn the job over to him.",
      "Such a scenario \u201cis contrary to the intent of the amendments\u201d but is not \u201csquarely foreclosed by the words,\u201d said Kermit Roosevelt, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania Carey Law School (and the great, great grandson of former President Theodore Roosevelt).",
      "Whether Vance would go along is a mystery. He has not publicly discussed the possibility, and spokespeople and advisers have declined requests to elaborate on what Vance is thinking about such a 2028 calculus.",
      "In an interview with Trump on April 22, Time magazine asked his thoughts about a swap with his No. 2.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know anything about, what, look, all I can say is this: I am being inundated with requests,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m doing a good job.\u201d",
      "While \u201cthere are some loopholes that have been discussed that are well known,\u201d he said, \u201cI don\u2019t believe in loopholes. I don\u2019t believe in using loopholes.\u201d",
      "Keeping the nation guessing, it turns out, is paying off. On Thursday, none other than the president\u2019s second-oldest son, Eric Trump, posed for a picture on X, smiling and sporting a \u201cTrump 2028\u201d hat."

      "Sanders was a lightning rod during draft season. While many projected him as a first-round selection \u2014 anywhere as high as No. 3 to the New York Giants or No. 21 to the Pittsburgh Steelers \u2014 he went undrafted on the first two nights.",
      "Ultimately, he was selected in the fifth round by Cleveland. Five quarterbacks \u2014 Miami\u2019s Cam Ward, Ole Miss\u2019 Jaxson Dart, Louisville\u2019s Tyler Shough, Alabama\u2019s Jalen Milroe and Oregon\u2019s Dillon Gabriel \u2014 went ahead of Sanders.",

      "Florida is poised to become the second state to ban the long-standing practice of adding fluoride to public water systems. State senators have already cleared a bill that would prohibit community water fluoridation, and Florida\u2019s House is expected to vote on a similar bill in the coming week.",
      "The word \u201cfluoride\u201d isn\u2019t found anywhere in the Florida Farm Bill, but it would be included because the legislation aims to ban \u201cthe use of certain additives in a water system\u201d throughout the state.",
      "If Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, signs the bill, Florida will become the second to ban fluoride from water supplies. Utah\u2019s Gov. Spencer Cox, also a Republican, signed a bill in late March that prohibits any person or government entity from adding the cavity-fighting mineral from the state\u2019s water systems. The Utah rule will go into effect on May 7.",
      "Similar legislation is making its way through other states, including Kentucky, Massachusetts and Nebraska.",
      "In Wisconsin, nearly 80 communities have already voted to stop adding fluoride, according to the state\u2019s Department of Natural Resources, and others in the state are considering a ban. And Union County in North Carolina voted last year to remove fluoride from drinking water.",
      "Like the anti-vaccine movement, the push to pull fluoride from water has been gaining momentum for several decades. It\u2019s grown more powerful with Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as head of the Department of Health and Human Services. Earlier this month, Kennedy said he was planning to tell the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to stop recommending fluoride be added to water supplies.",
      "The agency doesn\u2019t make official recommendations on fluoride, however. Those come from the U.S. Public Health Service, composed of members from various federal health public health agencies.",
      "He also said at the event, without providing evidence, that \u201cwe know that there is no systemic advantage\u201d to preventing tooth decay by drinking fluoridated water. \u201cYou can achieve that benefit from brushing teeth.\u201d",
      "Water fluoridation has long been heralded as one of the top public health initiatives of the last century for its ability to drive down tooth decay.",
      "While defending fluoride in a Florida Senate debate on April 16, Sen. Tina Scott Polsky, a Democrat, said, \u201cFind me a dentist who thinks we should get rid of fluoride.\u201d The bill passed the Senate on April 16. The Florida House is controlled by Republicans and is expected to vote against fluoridation.",
      "Lorna Koci, head of the Utah Oral Health Coalition, an advocacy group that promotes oral health initiatives among Medicaid beneficiaries, said the movement against fluoride has nothing to do with health and science. \u201cIt really is a political issue,\u201d she said.",
      "Kennedy, who has no training in medicine or dentistry, has previously referred to fluoride as \u201cindustrial waste\u201d on the social media platform X and said on MSNBC that the faster the mineral goes away, the better.",
      "A \u2018four-letter word\u2019",
      "Historically, dentists and other oral health experts would have been vocal defenders of fluoride. Now, many feel that they\u2019re in a losing battle against the anti-fluoride movement and worry about speaking publicly in favor of the mineral.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s like a four-letter word,\u201d a public health dentist in the Southeast said. The mere mention of fluoride, even in the context of public education, is forbidden by superiors, the staffer said.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t defend the science we believe in,\u201d said another public health dentist in the Upper Midwest. Opposition to both fluoride and vaccines has become more vocal locally because of what\u2019s happening on the national level, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s basically giving them a boost.\u201d Public health dentists work with a state or county to increase dental care access in underserved communities and promote oral health overall.",
      "Last month, the Trump administration pulled more than $11 billion earmarked for state public health departments. As part of the mass layoffs at health agencies ordered by Kennedy, HHS gutted the CDC\u2019s oral health division, which provides funds to states and local jurisdictions to promote good dental health practices, including the use of fluoride.",
      "Dentists argue that while fluoridated toothpaste is critical in preventing cavities, underserved communities may not be able to afford it. Many, they say, are unable to go to a dentist for fluoride treatments.",
      "Dr. Johnny Johnson, a pediatric dentist and president of the American Fluoridation Society, a fluoride advocacy group, said legislators opposed to water fluoridation \u201cneed to be skewered over total disregard for our residents\u2019 health.\u201d",
      "An HHS spokesman didn\u2019t respond to a question about how the federal government might address those disparities.",
      "Speaking publicly about the benefits of the mineral might result in a target on the backs of health departments already strapped for cash, fluoride advocates say.",
      "A year ago, \u201cfluoride was fine to bring up\u201d in discussions with public health leaders, said Koci.",
      "Now, \u201cI think many people in public health are feeling like they need to just lay low. It\u2019s probably very risky to be taking a position on a topic that is so political and controversial.\u201d",
      "Major public health groups, including the American Dental Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the CDC, support the use of fluoridated water. All cite studies that show it reduces tooth decay by 25%.",
      "Before the Florida Senate vote, more than a dozen jurisdictions in the state, including Seminole County, had banned water fluoridation despite decades of the mineral being safely used in the water supply and evidence that it fights cavities.",
      "In November 2024, the state\u2019s surgeon general, Joseph Ladapo, said communities should stop adding fluoride to drinking water because of what he called \u201cneuropsychiatric risk.\u201d",
      "At least one of those bans has been overruled. Miami Mayor Daniella Levine Cava promised to veto her county commissioners\u2019 vote to remove fluoride.",
      "\u201cWhile it may be relatively simple to stop adding fluoride as directed in the resolution, the long-term effects of doing so are anything but simple, and so we must consider the long-term consequences,\u201d Levine Cava said during a news conference earlier this month. \u201cEnding fluoridation could have real and lasting harm, especially for children and families who cannot afford regular dental care.\u201d",
      "Similar to the anti-vaccine movement, which has focused on widely debunked research associating the mumps, measles and rubella shots with autism, groups opposed to fluoride tend to seize on a study that suggests the mineral is a neurotoxin that lowers children\u2019s level of intelligence.",
      "A study published in 2019 suggested that IQ levels were slightly lower in kids whose mothers had higher measures of fluoride in their urine during pregnancy. The research was far from conclusive.",
      "Other studies looking at how fluoride affects children\u2019s brains have been called \u201clow quality\u201d by health scientists and were conducted in other countries.",
      "Another public health dentist said that faced with extensive funding cuts for any public health measures, fluoride isn\u2019t \u201cthe hill they want to die on.\u201d",
      "Dentists predict they\u2019ll see a jump in dental decay, especially among kids, in the coming years.",
      "Dr. Tom Reid, president of the Wisconsin Dental Association, said that within the next three to five years, those towns can expect to see a significant increase in rates of tooth decay.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s disheartening,\u201d Reid said. Dentists aren\u2019t pushing for fluoride for their own benefit, he said. \u201cWe\u2019re really trying to act in what is the best for the health of our patients, for the health of our communities.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s what happened in the Canadian city of Calgary, for example, after leaders there voted to remove fluoride from public water in 2011. A decade later, they voted to reinstate community water fluoridation amid a significant rise in cavities among kids.",
      "In Seminole County, Florida, which voted earlier this month to get fluoride out of the water system, utilities director Johnny Edwards said during the meeting that it would save the county at least $100,000.",
      "When asked whether the county would set aside that money to treat a potential increase in cavities, Chris Patton, a spokesman for the county, chuckled. No, he said, it will simply be reabsorbed into the county\u2019s utilities department."

    "story": [
      "SRINAGAR, India \u2014 After trekking through streams and forests in Indian-administered Kashmir, Sheetal Kalthia and her vacationing family had just arrived in a remote, picturesque meadow when they heard gunshots.",
      "Kalthia, who was with her husband and their two children, said they \u201csensed that something was wrong and ran to hide behind the tent, but they suddenly were standing in front of us.\u201d",
      "Militants armed with rifles had descended on tourists in the meadow from the surrounding woods, identifying non-Muslims and then separating the men from the women and children.",
      "One of the militants \u201cshot six to seven men in front of me,\u201d Kalthia said, before shooting her husband, Shailesh.",
      "\u201cMy husband died in my lap, and I couldn\u2019t do anything about it,\u201d she told reporters Thursday at his funeral in their hometown of Surat in the Indian state of Gujarat.",
      "Twenty-six people were killed in the Tuesday attack, which took place in one of Kashmir\u2019s top tourist destinations, the Baisaran Valley, whose lush green meadows, dense pine forests and snowcapped mountains have led it to be called India\u2019s \u201cmini Switzerland.\u201d",
      "It was the deadliest attack on Indian civilians in almost two decades, and took place while Vice President JD Vance and his family were visiting another part of India. All but one of those killed were Indian nationals; the other was from Nepal.",
      "The attack near the town of Pahalgam in Kashmir, a disputed Himalayan region that is the only Muslim-majority part of India, has devastated the local tourism industry on which many rely for their livelihood. It also undermined Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s insistence that the security situation had stabilized after a decadeslong separatist insurgency.",
      "New Delhi has responded with fury, immediately downgrading ties with neighboring Pakistan, which it has long accused of supporting cross-border terrorism. Indian officials say the gunmen had ties to militant groups based in Pakistan, which denies any involvement.",
      "Relations between the two nuclear powers, which both rule parts of Kashmir and have fought two wars over the region, are now at their lowest point in years after tit-for-tat treaty suspensions and the expulsion of diplomats and civilians. On Saturday, Indian and Pakistani troops exchanged gunfire for the second day in a row along the Line of Control that divides the two parts of Kashmir.",
      "Modi, a Hindu nationalist who has overseen a crackdown on dissent in Kashmir, vowed retribution for the attack. The family homes of several suspects have been demolished.",
      "\u201cI say to the whole world, India will identify, track and punish every terrorist and their backers,\u201d he said Thursday.",
      "President Donald Trump, who is close with Modi, said the Indian leader has his \u201cfull support.\u201d",
      "For Indians watching Modi\u2019s speech, it was an echo of 2019 when a convoy of Indian security forces was blown up in Kashmir and he responded by launching aerial strikes on Pakistan.",
      "Six years later, Indian nationalism is higher than ever, the Pakistan military\u2019s grip on power has weakened, and the U.S. is no longer in Afghanistan, which analysts say historically deterred violence between India and Pakistan.",
      "\u201cThat perhaps gives India a bit of a blank check to do whatever it pleases,\u201d said Chietigj Bajpaee, a senior research fellow for South Asia at Chatham House, a London-based think tank.",
      "A region simmering with rage",
      "Resentment between India and Pakistan dates to 1947, when Hindu-majority India gained independence from British colonial rule and Muslim-majority Pakistan was established as a separate state in a deadly partition in which hundreds of thousands of people were killed while migrating across the newly formed border.",
      "The border lines were clearly defined and accepted except for the mountainous state of Jammu and Kashmir, which is among the most militarized places in the world. Both Pakistan and India lay full claim to it, but most of it is Indian-administered, while Pakistan controls a small chunk to the west.",
      "Tensions have escalated since Modi revoked Kashmir\u2019s semiautonomous status in 2019, effectively putting the region under direct control of the federal government in a move that was criticized by rights groups and raised fears that Kashmir\u2019s ethnic and religious identity would be diluted by Hindu settlers.",
      "Modi\u2019s government said the move ended decades of armed rebellion in the region. Elections were held last year and hailed as a sign of normalcy.",
      "\u201cOne indicator of normalcy that the government was always giving out was, look, there are so many tourists visiting,\u201d said Lt. Gen. Deependra Singh Hooda, former head of the Indian Army\u2019s Northern Command, who was stationed in Jammu and Kashmir from 2012 to 2016.",
      "Praveen Donthi, a New Delhi-based senior analyst at the International Crisis Group, said the attack was a \u201ccolossal intelligence failure.\u201d",
      "Modi\u2019s narrative of peace and stability \u201cled to complacency, which is why they did not see this coming,\u201d he said.",
      "'Bodies lying on the ground'",
      "Pallavi Rao and her husband, Manjunath, had taken their son to Kashmir to celebrate his near-perfect score on his high school diploma exams. They had enjoyed a boat ride on the popular Dal lake in Kashmir\u2019s main city of Srinagar before heading to Pahalgam about 30 miles away.",
      "The militants found them in the meadow.",
      "After her husband was shot in the head, Rao told reporters, she and her son asked the militants to kill them too. They refused, saying, \u201cWe won\u2019t kill you. Go tell Prime Minister Modi.\u201d",
      "A local pony handler, Syed Adil Hussain Shah, was also killed while trying to save the tourists.",
      "\u201cHe used to earn 300 rupees [$3.50] in a day, our only source of income in the family,\u201d Ravisa Hussain Shah, his younger sister, told NBC News in an interview at their home in the village of Hapatnur.",
      "Among the first to reach the scene was Sajad Ahmad Bhat, 31, a shawl seller and tour guide.",
      "\u201cI saw bodies lying on the ground,\u201d he said.",
      "Bhat carried one of the victims almost 2.5 miles to safety, video of which went viral online.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know who the boy was. But he was crying and seeking help. His hands and sweater were soaked in blood,\u201d he said.",
      "Since the attack, India has suspended a 1960 water treaty with Pakistan and closed the only functional land border crossing. Pakistan, which said any disruption to its water supply would be considered an \u201cact of war,\u201d has closed its airspace to Indian airlines and halted all trade with its neighbor.",
      "Analysts inside Pakistan say the government may use the situation to bring the Kashmir issue back into global discussions.",
      "\u201cPakistan can say, look, this happens because of India\u2019s human rights violations in Kashmir,\u201d said Farhan Siddiqi, a professor of international relations at Quaid-i-Azam University in Islamabad.",
      "On Wednesday, Kashmir observed a complete shutdown as locals and politicians marched through the streets denouncing the killings. Roads throughout Kashmir were deserted, with shops closed and no transport on the roads.",
      "\u201cWe wanted to exhibit that Kashmiris are nonviolent and peaceful people, and any innocent killings shouldn\u2019t take place on our soil,\u201d said Javed Ahmad Tenga, president of the Kashmir Chamber of Commerce and Industry.",
      "The United Nations has urged India and Pakistan to \u201cexercise maximum restraint\u201d and called for \u201cmeaningful, mutual engagement.\u201d But Donthi and others say strong Indian military action against Pakistan is likely.",
      "\u201cAnything less than the airstrikes in 2019 will not do. The public is seeking something much bigger,\u201d Donthi said. \u201cAfter riding the tiger of hypernationalism, the government has backed itself into a corner. This is their litmus test and they have to come out with flying colors.\u201d",
      "Junaid Kathju reported from Srinagar, India, and Mithil Aggarwal reported from Hong Kong."

    "summary": "The stripped-down festivities at the White House Correspondents' Association's annual dinner were a reflection of the somber tone in Washington at the beginning of President Donald Trump\u2019s second term.",
    "story": [
      "There was no president. There was no comedian. What remained at the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association\u2019s annual dinner on Saturday night were the journalists and the First Amendment.",
      "The stripped-down festivities were a reflection of the somber tone in Washington at the beginning of President\u00a0Donald Trump\u2019s\u00a0second term, in which he has battled with the press on multiple fronts and wrested from the correspondents\u2019 association the power to decide which outlets have the most access to Trump.",
      "Trump\u2019s deeper involvement in politics began after then-President Barack Obama roasted the New Yorker\u2019s presidential ambitions during the 2011 correspondents\u2019 dinner. He skipped the annual gala during his first term, and his absence had been widely expected this year.",
      "The association scrapped a scheduled appearance at this year\u2019s dinner by\u00a0comedian Amber Ruffin\u00a0after she referred to the new administration as \u201ckind of a bunch of murderers\u201d on a podcast last month. The organization, a nonprofit that helps White House journalists provide robust coverage of the presidency, decided to forgo the event\u2019s traditional levity and focus on celebrating journalism.",
      "Association President Eugene Daniels said in an email to the organization\u2019s 900 members last month that the dinner was meant to \u201chonor journalistic excellence and a robust, independent media covering the most powerful office in the world.\u201d",
      "The event, which raises money for journalism scholarships, remains a highlight of the Washington social calendar. The ballroom at the Washington Hilton was still packed with journalists, newsmakers and even a few celebrities. Daniels singled out Debra Tice, whose son Austin has been missing for a decade since disappearing in Syria.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been tested and attacked. But every single day our members get up, they run to the White House \u2014 plane, train, automobile \u2014 with one mission, holding the powerful accountable,\u201d Daniels said.",
      "He later showed a video of past presidents, from Ronald Reagan to Joe Biden, who addressed the dinner, saying that the association invites the president to demonstrate the importance of a free press in safeguarding democracy.",
      "Trump counter-programmed the last dinner during his first term, holding a rally to compete with the event in 2019, before the coronavirus pandemic canceled the 2020 dinner. This year, Trump had just\u00a0flown back from Pope Francis\u2019 funeral in Rome\u00a0and had no events Saturday night.",
      "The Trump administration has had multiple skirmishes with the press in recent months. The FCC is investigating several media companies, the administration is working to\u00a0shut down Voice of America\u00a0and other government-run outlets, and The Associated Press has\u00a0sued the administration\u00a0for reducing its access to events because it has not renamed the Gulf of Mexico in line with Trump\u2019s executive order.",
      "A federal judge has\u00a0issued a preliminary injunction ordering the administration\u00a0to stop blocking the AP from presidential events. In response, the White House adopted a new press policy that gives the administration sole discretion over who gets to question Trump and sharply curtails the access of three news agencies, including AP, that serve billions of readers around the world.",
      "For many years previously, the correspondents\u2019 association determined which news organizations had access to limited space events.",
      "Alex Thompson of Axios, who won The Aldo Beckman Award for his coverage of the coverup of Biden\u2019s decline while in office, addressed complaints from some on the right that the press had gone too soft on the Democrat.",
      "\u201cWe \u2014 myself included \u2014 missed a lot of this story, and some people trust us less because of it,\u201d Thompson told the room of journalists. \u201cWe bear some responsibility for faith in the media being at such lows.\u201d",
      "Saturday\u2019s dinner also recognized the winners of a number of journalism awards, in addition to Thompson. They included:",
      "\u2014The Award for Excellence in Presidential Coverage Under Deadline Pressure (Print): Aamer Madhani and Zeke Miller of the AP, for reporting on the\u00a0White House altering its transcript\u00a0to erase Biden calling Trump supporters \u201cgarbage.\u201d",

      "\u201cFor an awful lot of people, that\u2019s going to mean leaning on buy now, pay later loans, for better or for worse,\u201d he said.",
      "He stopped short of calling the results a recession indicator but said conditions are expected to decline further before they get better.",
      "\u201cI do think it\u2019s going to get worse, at least in the short term,\u201d said Schulz. \u201cI don\u2019t know that there\u2019s a whole lot of reason to expect these numbers to get better in the near term.\u201d",
      "The loans, which allow consumers to split up purchases into several smaller payments, are a\u00a0popular alternative to credit cards\u00a0because they often don\u2019t charge interest. But consumers can see\u00a0high fees if they pay late, and they can run into problems if they stack up multiple loans. In Lending Tree\u2019s survey, 60% of BNPL users said they\u2019ve had multiple loans at once, with nearly a fourth saying they have held three or more at once.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just really important for people to be cautious when they use these things, because even though they can be a really good interest-free tool to help you kind of make it from one paycheck to the next, there\u2019s also a lot of risk in mismanaging it,\u201d said Schulz. \u201cSo people should tread lightly.\u201d",
      "Lending Tree\u2019s findings come after\u00a0Billboard revealed\u00a0that about 60% of general admission Coachella attendees funded their concert tickets with buy now, pay later loans, sparking a debate on the state of the economy and how consumers are using debt to keep up their lifestyles.\u00a0A recent announcement from DoorDash that it would\u00a0begin accepting BNPL financing from Klarna\u00a0for food deliveries led to widespread mockery and jokes that Americans were struggling so much that they were now being forced to finance cheeseburgers and burritos.",
      "Over the last few years, consumers have held up relatively well, even in the face of persistent inflation and high interest rates, because the job market was strong and wage growth had kept up with inflation \u2014 at least for some workers.",
      "Earlier this year, however, large companies including\u00a0Walmart\u00a0and\u00a0Delta Airlines\u00a0began warning that the dynamic had begun to shift and they were seeing cracks in demand, which was leading to worse-than-expected sales forecasts."

      "The Cleveland Browns selected Colorado quarterback Shedeur Sanders with the 144th pick in the fifth round of the NFL draft on Saturday, a surprising slide down the boards for a prospect considered by many a first-round lock.",
      "Sanders was a lightning rod during draft season. While many projected him as a first-round selection \u2014 anywhere as high as No. 3 to the New York Giants or No. 21 to the Pittsburgh Steelers \u2014 he went undrafted on the first two nights.",
      "Ultimately, he was selected in the fifth round by Cleveland. Five quarterbacks \u2014 Miami\u2019s Cam Ward, Ole Miss\u2019 Jaxson Dart, Louisville\u2019s Tyler Shough, Alabama\u2019s Jalen Milroe and Oregon\u2019s Dillon Gabriel \u2014 went ahead of Sanders.",
      "Minutes after the pick was made, Sanders posted to X, simply saying, \u201cThank you GOD.\u201d",
      "The Browns shortly afterward posted a sizzle reel of Sanders with the caption, \u201cAnother playmaker in the mix.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe felt like he was a good solid prospect at the most important position,\u201d Andrew Berry, Browns executive vice president and general manager, said in a statement issued by the team. \u201cWe view him as a highly accurate pocket passer who does a good job of taking care of the ball ... We\u2019re excited to work with him.\u201d",
      "Sanders joins a crowded quarterback room in Cleveland and is the second play caller picked by the Browns this draft, after Dillon Gabriel. Veteran QBs Joe Flacco and Kenny Pickett are already on the roster.",
      "Entering Saturday, Sanders was the best prospect still available, according to NBC Sports\u2019 Connor Rogers, who ranked Sanders 30th on his NFL draft board.",
      "Sanders, the son of NFL Hall of Famer and Buffaloes coach Deion Sanders, began his collegiate career at Jackson State in 2021 when his father was the head coach. Both left for Colorado after the 2022 season, and Shedeur Sanders spent his final two years in college with the Buffaloes.",
      "In his senior season, Sanders won Big 12 offensive player of the year,  completing 74.0% of his passes, with 37 touchdowns and 10 interceptions. He also threw 4,134 yards.",
      "Sanders was a key figure in Colorado\u2019s turnaround as a football program. The school won only one game the season before his arrival. In 2024, the Buffaloes won nine games for the first time since 2016.",
      "In the lead-up to the draft, Sanders was the target of several scouts and coaches, with his character off the field often being called into question."

    "published": "Sat, 26 Apr 2025 17:59:15 GMT",
    "summary": "Under the Biden administration, the U.S.",
    "story": [
      "Under the Biden administration, the U.S. Department of Education made\u00a0regular announcements\u00a0that it was forgiving student debt for thousands of people under various relief programs and repayment plans.",
      "That\u2019s changed under\u00a0President Donald Trump.",
      "In his first few months in office, Trump \u2014 who has long been critical of education debt cancellation \u2014 signed an executive order aimed at\u00a0limiting eligibility for the popular Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, and his Education Department revised some\u00a0student loan repayment plans\u00a0to no longer conclude in debt erasure.",
      "\u201cYou have the administration trying to limit PSLF credits, and clear attacks on the income-based repayment with forgiveness options,\u201d said Malissa Giles, a consumer bankruptcy attorney in Virginia.",
      "The White House did not respond to CNBC\u2019s request for comment.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about the current status of federal student loan forgiveness opportunities.",
      "Forgiveness chances narrow on repayment plans",
      "The Biden administration\u2019s new student loan repayment plan,\u00a0Saving on a Valuable Education, or SAVE, isn\u2019t expected to survive under Trump, experts say.\u00a0A U.S. appeals court already\u00a0blocked\u00a0the plan\u00a0in\u00a0February after a GOP-led challenge to the program.",
      "SAVE came with two key provisions that lawsuits targeted: It had lower monthly payments than any other federal student loan repayment plan, and it led to quicker debt erasure for those with small balances.",
      "\u201cI personally think you will see SAVE dismantled through the courts or the administration,\u201d Giles said.",
      "But the Education Department under Trump is now arguing that the ruling by the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals required it to end the loan forgiveness under repayment plans beyond SAVE. As a result, the Pay As You Earn and Income-Contingent Repayment options no longer wipe debt away after a certain number of years.",
      "More from CNBC:",
      "Nearing retirement? These strategies can protect from tariff volatilityExperts see higher stagflation risks. Here\u2019s what it means for your moneyShould investors dump U.S. stocks for international equities? What experts think",
      "Nearing retirement? These strategies can protect from tariff volatility",
      "Experts see higher stagflation risks. Here\u2019s what it means for your money",
      "Should investors dump U.S. stocks for international equities? What experts think",
      "There\u2019s some good news: At least one repayment plan still leads to debt erasure, said higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz. That plan is called Income-Based Repayment.",
      "If a borrower enrolled in ICR or PAYE eventually switches to IBR, their previous payments made under the other plans will count toward loan forgiveness under IBR, as long as they meet the IBR\u2019s\u00a0other requirements, Kantrowitz said. (Some borrowers may opt to take that strategy if they have a lower monthly bill under ICR or PAYE than they would on IBR.)",
      "Public Service Loan Forgiveness remains",
      "Despite Trump\u2019s executive order in March aimed at limiting eligibility for\u00a0Public Service Loan Forgiveness, the program remains intact. Any changes to the program would likely take months or longer to materialize, and may even need congressional approval, experts say.",
      "PSLF, which President George W. Bush signed into law in 2007, allows many not-for-profit and government employees to have their federal student loans canceled after 10 years of payments.",
      "What\u2019s more, any changes to PSLF can\u2019t be retroactive, consumer advocates say. That means that if you are currently working for or previously worked for an organization that the Trump administration later excludes from the program, you\u2019ll still get credit for that time \u2014 at least up until when the changes go into effect.",
      "For now, the language in the president\u2019s executive order was fairly vague. As a result, it remains unclear exactly which organizations will no longer be considered a qualifying employer under PSLF, experts said.",
      "However, in his first few months in office, Trump has targeted immigrants,\u00a0transgender and nonbinary people\u00a0and those who work to increase diversity across the private and public sector. Many nonprofits work in these spaces, providing legal support or doing advocacy and education work.",
      "For now, those pursuing PSLF should print out a copy of their payment history on\u00a0StudentAid.gov\u00a0or request one from their loan servicer. They should keep a record of the number of qualifying payments they\u2019ve made so far, said Jessica Thompson, senior vice president of The Institute for College Access & Success.",
      "\u201cWe urge borrowers to save all documentation of their payments, payment counts, and employer certifications to ensure they have any information that might be useful in the future,\u201d Thompson said.",
      "Other loan cancellation opportunities to consider",
      "Federal student loan borrowers also remain entitled to a number of other student loan forgiveness opportunities.",
      "The\u00a0Teacher Loan Forgiveness program\u00a0offers up to $17,500 in loan cancellation to those who\u2019ve worked full time for \u201ccomplete and consecutive academic years in a low-income school or educational service agency,\u201d among other requirements, according to the Education Department.",
      "(One thing to note: This program can\u2019t be combined with PSLF, and so borrowers should decide which avenue makes the most sense for them.)",
      "In less common circumstances, you may be eligible for a full discharge of your federal student loans under\u00a0Borrower Defense\u00a0if your school closed while you were enrolled or if you were misled by your school or didn\u2019t receive a quality education.",
      "Borrowers may qualify for a\u00a0Total and Permanent Disability\u00a0discharge if they suffer from a mental or physical disability that is severe and permanent and prevents them from working. Proof of the disability can come from a doctor, the Social Security Administration or the Department of Veterans Affairs.",
      "With the federal government rolling back student loan forgiveness measures, experts also recommend that borrowers explore the many\u00a0state-level relief programs\u00a0available. The Institute of Student Loan Advisors has\u00a0a database\u00a0of student loan forgiveness programs by state."

    "story": [
      "More than 23 years after the Twin Towers collapsed, blanketing lower Manhattan in toxic dust and debris, the number of people diagnosed with 9/11-related illnesses is still growing.",
      "Since 2011, the main resource for people exposed to the fumes has been the World Trade Center Health Program, which covers treatment for cancer, asthma and post-traumatic stress disorder, among other health conditions.",
      "Of the roughly 132,000 people enrolled in the program as of December, 64% have at least one condition linked to 9/11. Cancer is the most common, affecting more than 40,000 members.\u00a0Some people join the program after an illness has developed, while others join to receive annual screenings that could detect illnesses in the future.",
      "The program\u2019s fate has seesawed over the past 10 weeks as the Trump administration fired and rehired certain staffers, only to terminate them again last month, according to lawyers and advocates for people with 9/11-related exposures. They added that the staffing cuts have made it harder to enroll members or confirm that their treatment is covered by federal funding.",
      "\u201cThese cuts are going to potentially delay treatment, delay diagnosis and early detection of their cancers, and it\u2019s going to cost lives,\u201d said Todd Cleckley, a nurse medical specialist at Barasch & McGarry, a law firm representing 9/11 responders and survivors.",
      "\u201cThe health program already operated on a very slim staffing margin,\u201d he added. \u201cWe\u2019re only beginning to see what those negative impacts will be.\u201d",
      "Sixteen of the program\u2019s staffers were swept up in the Trump administration\u2019s firing of probationary workers in February. The administration reinstated the positions roughly a week later, following outcry from both Republicans and Democrats in Congress.",
      "Then in late March the Department of Health and Human Services announced it was laying off around 20,000 federal employees. Those layoffs again included 16 staffers at the World Trade Center Health Program, plus the program\u2019s director, according to lawyers and advocates. The director was reinstated on April 5 after more bipartisan opposition, they said, but the staffers were not.",
      "The HHS layoffs were part of a massive restructuring that gutted the agency responsible for the World Trade Center program, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). In addition to the 16 staffers, HHS terminated other institute employees in charge of certifying that patients\u2019 9/11-related illnesses were eligible for federal funding, lawyers and advocates said.",
      "\u201cThey weren\u2019t on the World Trade Center Program payroll, but they did things that are essential to the program running,\u201d said Benjamin Chevat, executive director of 9/11 Health Watch, a nonprofit group that helps ensure people have access to the program\u2019s services.",
      "Lawyers and advocates plan to visit Capitol Hill on Tuesday to ask lawmakers to reinstate staffers. HHS did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "New York City Mayor Eric Adams said that his office has reached out to the federal government \u201cabout restoring these important resources.\u201d",
      "\u201cNew York City is dedicated to providing quality health care to the heroes who responded on 9/11 and the survivors of the most tragic day in America\u2019s history,\u201d Adams said in a statement. \u201cOur partnership with the federal government to deliver these services is vital, providing access to life-saving, time-sensitive treatment for every firefighter, police officer, volunteer, and everyday New Yorkers who remember that day, and remember what it took to rebuild the next morning.\u201d",
      "Before the staffing cuts, 9/11 responders and people who lived, worked or attended school or day care in the disaster area could apply to join the program and typically get accepted within a few weeks. But Chevat said no one has been enrolled since April 1. The program usually enrolls around 200 people per month, on average.",
      "Michael Barasch, a partner at Barasch & McGarry, said he\u2019s still submitting applications on behalf of his clients, but \u201cthey\u2019re not hearing from the health program, so we don\u2019t know if or when they will ever get an appointment.\u201d",
      "Members of the program receive annual screenings at certified health clinics, which are largely concentrated in the New York area. There, doctors evaluate people for a host of mental and physical illnesses with known ties to 9/11. If a doctor determines there\u2019s a link, the clinic submits paperwork to federal employees, who must certify that the condition is eligible for funding before patients can be treated at no cost. More than 8,200 cancer diagnoses were certified last year.",
      "New certifications haven\u2019t been issued since the start of April, shortly after HHS announced it was dismantling NIOSH, Chevat said.",
      "The delays could have dire consequences for people who were exposed to toxic dust and debris, lawyers and advocates said. Many cancers \u2014 once identified \u2014 must be treated right away.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ll never hear me say something inflammatory just to make a headline, but it is a fact: People will die because of these decisions,\u201d Barasch said.",
      "The collapse of the Twin Towers released cancer-causing chemicals such as asbestos, benzene and dioxins that lingered in the air for days to weeks. A 10-year study found an elevated risk of leukemia and prostate and thyroid cancers among rescue and recovery workers who responded to the disaster. Other cancers, such as lung cancer and mesothelioma, may develop decades after exposure to asbestos, so future diagnoses are expected.",
      "\u201cWe were breathing in glass and asbestos and everything else that you could imagine,\u201d said Michael O\u2019Connell, who assisted with search-and-rescue operations as an early-career firefighter after 9/11. \u201cWe slept in it, we ate in it, we bled in it. We didn\u2019t leave it. We were in that zone for almost nine months.\u201d",
      "Roughly six years later, O\u2019Connell was diagnosed with a rare inflammatory disease called sarcoidosis that caused debilitating pain in his joints and skin. He received treatment through the World Trade Center Health Program, which he credits for helping him manage his symptoms. The idea that new members might not be able to enroll or receive treatment is \u201cdeeply disturbing,\u201d he said.",
      "If the NIOSH staffers aren\u2019t reinstated, lawyers and advocates said, hospitals may not get reimbursed for chemotherapy or surgeries and eventually may stop offering them to patients. Barasch said he has already received calls from clients worried about whether they can continue to get chemo.",
      "\u2018\u201cIt\u2019s bureaucratic cruelty,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re trying to save money, which is fine, but don\u2019t do it on the backs of the 9/11 community.\u201d",
      "Mariama James, a lower Manhattan resident who was pregnant with her third child during 9/11, said she has been waiting to see if the program will cover a treatment for her sleep apnea. She now expects that process to be delayed.",
      "\u201cHow are they going to get a new medication covered if the doctors from NIOSH have been fired?\u201d James said. \u201cI\u2019ll be waiting forever for that medication.\u201d",
      "The World Trade Center Health Program was already vulnerable before the layoffs due to budgetary constraints, Barasch added. In December, Congress opted not to include a long-term funding package for the program in a bipartisan spending deal. Several lawmakers anticipate that the budget shortfall could force the program to close enrollment or scale back treatment for current members starting in October 2028. A bipartisan bill introduced in the Senate in February calls for more funding to be made available until the program expires in 2090.",
      "In addition to lobbying for program staffers to be rehired, lawyers and advocates will ask legislators on Tuesday to back the bill."

      "Countless other people have been pranked, and the reactions are all equally as hysterical \u2014 from a dad hearing his child could eat someone he found in his high school yearbook, to a mom hearing her child could eat her high school fling."

      "On Oct. 1, 2017, a gunman opened fire from the 32nd floor of hotel onto a crowd watching Jason Aldean perform at the\u00a0Route 91 Harvest Festival in Las Vegas. Police reported at least 58 people were killed in the shooting and more than 500 people were injured.",

      "\"I had a lot of fans die,\" Church said. \"And I played the (Grand Ole) Opry right after that, and didn\u2019t want to be there.

      "\"That was a part of their travel and some of \u2018em got shot,\" he said. \"They died. And I remember being at the Opry, that night and... it\u2019s still raw in a lot of ways, but just not something that affects you. And it broke me, in a way.\"",
      "Church performed at the Grand Ole Opry just days after his performance in Vegas. While onstage, he paid tribute to the victims with a new heartfelt song called \u201cWhy Not Me.\"",
      "In the song, he says, \"And when the morning sun hits the mountain / And a glorious still calms the breeze / I\u2019ll ask the God of infinite wisdom / Why you and why not me?\""

      "Director Isaiah Saxon tells TODAY.com about how his ideas came to life for the ochi, the name of the wild beasts who live in the forests surrounding a remote village on the fictional island of Carpathia, where the family-friendly movie is set.",
      "\u201cThe goal with designing the ochi was to create a realistic-feeling undiscovered primate species, so that a kid watching the film could wonder, \u2018Have I just not seen the BBC nature special yet on this animal?\u2019 Like, this feels like a real animal,\u201d Saxon says.",
      "\"The Legend of Ochi,\" out April 25, stars Helena Zengel alongside Finn Wolfhard, best known from his role as Mike Wheeler on \u201cStranger Things.\u201d When Zengel\u2019s character Yuri discovers a baby ochi who has been left behind, she\u2019s determined to do whatever it takes to get the adorable creature back to its pack.",
      "The pair go on an adventure through woodlands, waters and even a grocery store, where the baby ochi quickly melts the hearts of the characters and viewers alike.",
      "Filmed in the Carpathian mountains of Romania, the film takes fantastical elements from its location \u2014 but the magic of the baby ochi is that it is a puppet, Wolfhard tells TODAY.com.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t see the ochi actually in action until I was on set, and the puppeteers showed me. Basically, they said, \u2018Do you want to meet him?\u2019 And I just looked at the puppet, and it looked up at me and blinked and had head movements,\u201d Wolfhard said. \u201cIt was like a truly real creature.\u201d",
      "There are complicated mechanics behind bringing the ochi to life, Wolfhard says, but it all comes together to make the ochi appear like a real-life animal.",
      "\u201cThe ochi had a whole team of people, and all the puppeteers are actors because they are all trying to get a very specific performance out of the ochi,\u201d Wolfhard says. \u201cIt was six people piloting one creature, as opposed to just one actor, but they were such amazing performers. That\u2019s why I like working with practical effects \u2014 it\u2019s so fun because you have that human connection with it.\u201d",
      "Saxon says inspiration for the gremlins came in part from his longtime obsession with Chinese golden snub-nosed monkeys. He also took elements from lemurs, tarsiers and other primates for the look of the ochi, while borrowing from birdsong and the noises dolphins make for the language the animals use in the film.",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t looking to movie creatures or mythical creatures. It was looking to nature,\u201d he says. \u201cI really wanted to pull from the wide variety of superpowers that you do find in nature, and real patterns in zoology, and put them into one fictional animal.\u201d",
      "The cuteness factor for the baby ochi was important from the start, Saxon says. After drafting up several drawings of what the ochi would look like for the film, Saxon says he reached out to John Nolan Studios in London to create animatronics for the creatures.",
      "\u201cThey made a prototype that was completely furless and had no facial movement, but immediately, the five puppeteers brought it to life, it was just completely convincing that this was a real being,\u201d Saxon recalls. \u201cIt was absolutely adorable from the break.\u201d",
      "Saxon says designing the baby ochi as a puppet adds characteristics that play into how lovable the creature becomes throughout the film.",
      "\u201cA lot of the little imperfections that you might see in a baby primate trying to move learn how to move their own body, those are the types of little things that come through in rod puppeteering,\u201d he says. \u201cSo it had that vulnerability from the beginning, from the puppetry.\u201d",
      "Once the crew was on set filming in Romania, \u201cthere was a tremendous amount of effort in just like, policing his cuteness,\u201d Saxon says of the baby ochi.",
      "He joked about a \u201clast-minute rhinoplasty\u201d to make the baby\u2019s nose cuter after realizing it wasn\u2019t quite right, and other situations on set to ensure the creature had the look he was going for.",
      "The film, which launched in theaters in New York City and Los Angeles on April 17, is headed to theaters nationwide on April 25. But the hype for the charm of the baby ochi is only just beginning, as viewers start to react to the gremlin on social media.",
      "\"I just watched THE LEGEND OF OCHI and I want everyone to know that I would die for this little guy,\" one user posted on X.",
      "\"I completely adored THE LEGEND OF OCHI. It pulls inspiration from Amblin movies like E.T., Jim Henson\u2019s classics, and even Ghibli, but still takes tons of *weird* swings that create its own identity full of wonder,\" another X user wrote. \"They literally don\u2019t make family adventures like this anymore.\"",

All five actors joined moderator Josh Horowitz for a discussion about the film and spilled some secrets from the set.",
      "During the panel, which was held April 12, Horowitz asked if the movie was considered a \u201chighly sought-after project at the time\u201d before it became a box office success.",

She said that the director planned to make \u201cThe Breakfast Club\u201d first.

      "\u201cI skipped all of my high school reunions, so this just was something that finally I felt I needed to do just for myself,\u201d Est\u00e8vez said about attending the expo. \u201cBut Josh, this one felt special. It\u2019s here in Chicago, where we made the film, and obviously the 40th anniversary, and it just felt like it was time.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "Nikki Glaser realized that her hosting the 2025 Golden Globes was initially no laughing matter for its attendees.",
      "The comedian hosted the awards show this past January, following her viral performance in last year\u2019s Netflix special \u201cThe Roast of Tom Brady.\u201d Glaser garnered laughs from grilling the former Patriots quarterback, but while hosting the Golden Globes, she sensed another emotion from her audience: that of fear.",
      "\u201cI think, when I first walked out (to do the opening monologue), I knew the energy was like, \u2018We don\u2019t know what she\u2019s going to do. We\u2019ve seen her do the Tom Brady roast, most recently.\u2019 That\u2019s kind of where I popped for most people,\u201d Glaser said during a conversation at the Time100 Summit on April 23.",
      "During the roast for Tom Brady, she dug deep into topics that ranged from him losing millions of dollars in crypto to his divorce from Gisele B\u00fcndchen.",
      "Glaser said that after the Golden Globes, several people confirmed they were \u201creally, really scared\u201d of what she was going to say. If she knew how \u201cterrified\u201d people were from her previous performance, Glaser explained she would have tried to do \u201csomething to diffuse\u201d that terror \u201ca little bit.\u201d",
      "She compared how the awards show audience might have felt to attending a comedy show with someone wearing an attention-grabbing T-shirt, while you want anything but to get picked on.",
      "\u201cI always feel for that girl. I am that girl,\u201d Glaser said of not wanting the attention.",
      "Despite sensing initial nerves from the audience, Glaser\u2019s opening monologue turned out to be a hit, and fellow comedians like Tina Fey and Jon Stewart sang her praises.",
      "While Glaser admitted to feeling bad about some jokes she made during Brady\u2019s roast, she said she \u201creally wasn\u2019t sorry about anything\u201d she said at the Golden Globes because she didn\u2019t \u201csay anything that was calling anyone out.\u201d",
      "Glaser has already been cleared to come back as host for the 2026 Golden Globes, and she feels optimistic that the vibes from the crowd will be different next year.",
      "\u201cNext time, it\u2019s going to be a lot more fun, because I think they know the tone that I have now, where it\u2019s like ... \u2018I\u2019m not going to embarrass you. And if you laugh, I\u2019m only going to make you look good, because you\u2019re going to look so relatable laughing,\u2019\u201d she said.",

      "For Penn Badgley, leading the Netflix thriller \u201cYou\u201d has been \u201cprofound,\u201d he tells TODAY.com.",
      "\u201cIf you stay with any character this long and try to ground what you\u2019re doing and just make it real, new, spontaneous, you\u2019re always going to find new depths,\u201d Badgley says.",
      "The fifth and final season of \u201cYou\u201d does just that and shows Joe returning to New York to what seemingly appears to be a happily ever after with his wife Kate (Charlotte Ritchie) and his son Henry. But it wouldn\u2019t be \u201cYou\u201d without a new obsession, which comes in the form of Bronte (Madeline Brewer).",
      "As viewers saw midway through the fifth season, Bronte is not who she says she is.",
      "Instead, Bronte, whose real name is Louise Flannery, is an old student of Guinevere Beck who questions her death and catfishes Joe into falling in love with her to take him down for his numerous murders.",
      "Coming to the end of playin Joe Goldberg, Badgley says he\u2019s learned the \u201ciconography\u201d of what does it mean to be a man, a father and husband.",
      "\"We\u2019re not talking about that obvious kind of awful, aggressive stuff. I just mean the more nuanced way that desire can change love and turn it into something more like possession, manipulation and jealousy,\" he says.",
      "So after 10 deadly episodes \u2014 with questionable actions by most, if not all characters \u2014 here is what happens at the end of \u201cYou\u201d Season 5.",
      "What happens to Joe in the 'You' series finale?",
      "The beginning of the final episode sees Bronte and Joe running away to a secluded place in the middle of nowhere. Joe believes Kate found a way to send his confession to police and is trying to leave the country.",
      "Bronte continues to lie to Joe about her intentions to be with him \u2014 despite having moments where she loves to feel loved by him.",
      "Joe has been working with a man named Will to somehow connect him with Henry. While Bronte has a gun pointed at him, Joe gets the chance to talk to his son, who is disappointed with him.",
      "\u201cWhat did you do to mommy?\u201d Henry asks Joe, who denies any wrongdoing.",
      "\u201cDo you remember when you used to tell me there were no monsters in my room?\u201d Henry continues. \u201cYou lied. It was you. You\u2019re the monster.\u201d",
      "Henry hangs up on Joe, which in turn infuriates him.",

      "After Joe gets off the phone with Henry, he turns mad and lunges at Bronte. He shoots her on her side and the chase begins.",
      "Bronte attempts to run from Joe, but then he appears to drown her in the lake. Police arrive on the scene and now Joe makes a run for it, killing an officer in his attempt to hide.",
      "In a plot twist, Bronte is alive and points a gun at him.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s over, Joe,\u201d she says.",
      "\u201cKill me. I deserve it,\u201d he yells, while Bronte says, \u201cOh, you would f------ love that, wouldn\u2019t you. No way!\u201d",
      "Instead of killing him, she shoots at his groin.",
      "Joe is arrested by the police, goes on trial and spends his last days in prison.",
      "Joe talks about being lonely for the rest of his life, however, he is seen receiving fan mail from people who are obsessed with him.",
      "Why doesn't Joe die in the 'You' finale?",
      "Among the biggest questions is: Why didn\u2019t Joe die at the end of \u201cYou\u201d? Badgley shares his thoughts on the final events in Joe\u2019s life.",
      "\u201cI think because he either would have to do it himself, which ... I think, not the right way to do it. I don\u2019t know that that\u2019s fair, I don\u2019t know that\u2019s ever good,\u201d Badgley tells TODAY.com. \u201cIf somebody else had to do it, well, then that makes them a murderer, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d",
      "The actor says that even if the act of killing Joe is vengeance or retribution, \u201cIs that justice? Is that good for them? Is that fair for them?\u201d",
      "\u201cYou have to saddle them with that kind of a traumatic experience, especially because it would have been Bronte probably, or a woman,\u201d he continues. \u201cSo I think he needed to end up alive in some kind of circumstance where he would have to contend with what he\u2019s done \u2014 and to do it without his treasured genitalia... That\u2019s a twist.\u201d",
      "No, according to Badgley.",
      "Joe is seen in his prison cell reading \u201cThe Executioner\u2019s Song\u201d by Norman Mailer.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know about that book. At that point, it was my last day, and I was like, \u2018You know what, Joe, I\u2019m going to fake read this book. Good day to you, sir,\u2019\u201d Badgley says.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t even think I was holding the real book ... Norman Mailer is amazing, not somebody I\u2019ve read a lot.\u201d",
      "What happens to the other characters?",
      "The series wraps up loose threads on all the characters.",

      "Charges against Harrison (Pete Ploszek) for the murder of wife Reagan (Anna Camp) are dropped, while Maddie (also Anna Camp) is tried for arson and her sister\u2019s murder. However, she does not serve time and instead goes to rehab for a pill addiction. She and Harrison are expecting twins.",

      "Even in death, Pope Francis\u2019 moral voice rang out across the world.",
      "With 40,000 packed into Vatican City\u2019s St. Peter\u2019s Square, another 250,000 in the surrounding streets and millions more watching on TV and online, world leaders, including President Donald Trump, were reminded of Francis\u2019 central messages during his funeral Saturday.",
      "\u201c\u2018Build bridges, not walls\u2019 was an exhortation he repeated many times,\u201d Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re said during the homily for the late pope. \u201cHis gestures and exhortations in favor of refugees and displaced persons are countless. His insistence on working on behalf of the poor was constant.\u201d",
      "And war \u201calways leaves the world worse than it was before: It is always a painful and tragic defeat for everyone,\u201d Re said.",
      "Francis often railed against the geopolitical tides. He urged more compassion for immigrants and refugees at a time when the White House and other governments are cracking down. He called for an end to the war in Gaza and denounced climate change and exploitative capitalism \u2014 when those crises have only intensified.",
      "Under warm, blue skies with the world watching, the homily was a reminder of Francis\u2019 often lonely voice in a world characterized by economic and military hard power. It also brought to mind the unspoken questions, on this day at least, about whether the late pontiff\u2019s replacement will continue these progressive notes or revert to a more conservative bent.",
      "The relatively simple funeral for Francis, who died at age 88 on Monday, was attended by some 170 heads of state and other dignitaries. Trump sat among Ukraine\u2019s Volodymyr  Zelenskyy, France\u2019s Emmanuel Macron, Brazil\u2019s President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva and Britain\u2019s Prince William.",
      "Francis\u2019 casket was taken on a final journey in the so-called popemobile through the streets of Rome, past landmarks such as the Colosseum, to St. Mary Major Basilica, where he had chosen to be buried.",
      "The people lining the streets had come from all over the world.",
      "\u201cI could not have been anywhere else today. For me, Pope Francis was a wonderful pope, a gift that the lord gave us,\u201d said Katherine Gilligan, 59, who was visiting Rome last week from Jacksonville, Florida, and decided to postpone her return journey when Francis died. \u201cHe has loved us and taught us piety. It will be difficult for there to be another pope like him.\u201d",
      "At St. Mary Major Basilica, his casket was met, according to his wishes, by dozens of Rome\u2019s impoverished and needy, including prisoners, migrants, homeless and transgender people.",
      "It was just one reflection of a pope who did things a bit differently. He had even adjusted his own funeral plans: Whereas previous popes have been entombed in three nested coffins, made of cypress, lead and oak, Francis requested he be buried in a single, simple wooden casket lined with zinc.",
      "Even so, this was an event of epic majesty. From the arcing dome of St. Peter\u2019s Basilica, one of the largest churches in the world, to the striking image of a square divided between a mass of red on one side \u2014 the cardinals and bishops \u2014 and black on the other \u2014 attending dignitaries.",
      "In life, Francis had declined to live in the Vatican\u2019s gilded Apostolic Palace, choosing instead its far more plebeian guesthouse, Casa Santa Marta, where he died after a period of well-publicized illness.",
      "Francis had plenty of critics, both conservatives who believed he focused too much on progressive causes, and more liberal audiences who felt he did not go far enough with his reforms.",
      "Either way, the absence of his frequent and outspoken interjections on world affairs will leave a void to be filled. And though he spoke with a freedom unafforded to more prominent global figures, his funeral was still a deeply political event.",
      "Re\u2019s reminder that Francis preferred bridges over walls conjured the late pope\u2019s criticism of Trump\u2019s first-term promise to build a U.S.-Mexico border wall.",
      "\u201cA person who thinks only about building walls, wherever they may be, and not building bridges is not Christian,\u201d he said at the time.",
      "One day before his death, Francis met with Vice President JD Vance after sharply rebuking the Trump administration for cracking down on immigration and slashing international aid. In February, he said a \u201cmajor crisis\u201d was taking place in the United States, referring to \u201ca program of mass deportations.\u201d",
      "Perhaps inevitably with so many powerful figures in attendance, the funeral served as a forum for real-world geopolitics. Trump was seen locked in a sit-down discussion with Zelenskyy, two of the parties who say they are trying to negotiate a peace deal alongside Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin.",
      "The Ukrainian leader said on X afterward that it was a \u201cgood meeting.\u201d But there was little immediate sign that Francis\u2019 death would solve a crisis he was unable to affect in life.",
      "Nevertheless, despite scandal within the church and uncertainty without, there was plenty of Francis\u2019 platform that few would disagree with.",
      "Re reflected this while closing the homily: \u201cEmbrace humanity that seeks the truth with a sincere heart and holds high the torch of hope.\u201d"

      "MUSCAT, Oman \u2014 A massive explosion and fire rocked a port Saturday in southern Iran purportedly linked to a shipment of a chemical ingredient used to make missile propellant, killing at least 25 people and injuring more than 800 others.",
      "Helicopters dumped water from the air on the raging fire hours after the initial explosion, which happened at the Shahid Rajaei port just as Iran and the United States met Saturday in Oman for the third round of negotiations over Tehran\u2019s rapidly advancing nuclear program.",
      "No one in Iran outright suggested that the explosion came from an attack. However, even Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, who led the talks, on Wednesday acknowledged that \u201cour security services are on high alert given past instances of attempted sabotage and assassination operations designed to provoke a legitimate response.\u201d",
      "Iranian Interior Minister Eskandar Momeni gave the casualty figure in an interview on state television. But there were few details on what sparked the blaze just outside of Bandar Abbas, which burned into Saturday night, causing other containers to reportedly explode.",
      "Security firm says port received chemical for missile fuel",
      "The port took in a shipment of \u201csodium perchlorate rocket fuel\u201d in March, the private security firm Ambrey said. The fuel is part of a shipment from China by two vessels to Iran first reported in January by the Financial Times. The fuel was going to be used to replenish Iran\u2019s missile stocks, which had been depleted by its direct attacks on Israel during the war with Hamas in the Gaza Strip.",
      "\u201cThe fire was reportedly the result of improper handling of a shipment of solid fuel intended for use in Iranian ballistic missiles,\u201d Ambrey said.",
      "Ship-tracking data analyzed by The Associated Press put one of the vessels believed to be carrying the chemical in the vicinity in March, as Ambrey said. Iran hasn\u2019t acknowledged taking the shipment. The Iranian mission to the United Nations didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment on Saturday.",
      "It\u2019s unclear why Iran wouldn\u2019t have moved the chemicals from the port, particularly after the Beirut port blast in 2020. That explosion, caused by the ignition of hundreds of tons of highly explosive ammonium nitrate, killed more than 200 people and injured more than 6,000 others. However, Israel did target Iranian missile sites where Tehran uses industrial mixers to create solid fuel.",
      "Social media footage of the explosion on Saturday at Shahid Rajaei saw reddish-hued smoke rising from the fire just before the detonation. That suggests a chemical compound being involved in the blast \u2014 like in the Beirut explosion.",
      "\u201cGet back get back! Tell the gas (truck) to go!\u201d a man in one video shouted just before the blast. \u201cTell him to go, it\u2019s going to blow up! Oh God, this is blowing up! Everybody evacuate! Get back! Get back!\u201d",
      "On Saturday night, the state-run IRNA news agency said that the Customs Administration of Iran blamed a \u201cstockpile of hazardous goods and chemical materials stored in the port area\u201d for the blast, without elaborating.",
      "An aerial shot released by Iranian media after the blast showed fires burning at multiple locations in the port, with authorities later warning about air pollution from chemicals such as ammonia, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide in the air. Schools in Bandar Abbas will be closed Sunday as well.",
      "Port a major destination for Iranian cargo",
      "Shahid Rajaei has been a target before. A 2020 cyberattack attributed to Israel targeted the port. It came after Israel said that it thwarted a cyberattack targeting its water infrastructure, which it attributed to Iran. Israeli officials didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment regarding Saturday\u2019s explosion.",
      "Social media videos showed black billowing smoke after the blast. Others showed glass blown out of buildings kilometers, or miles, away from the epicenter of the explosion. State media footage showed the injured crowding into at least one hospital, with ambulances arriving as medics rushed one person by on a stretcher.",
      "Hasanzadeh, the provincial disaster management official, earlier told state television that the blast came from containers at Shahid Rajaei port in the city, without elaborating. State television also reported that there had been a building collapse caused by the explosion, though no further details were offered.",
      "The Interior Ministry said that it launched an investigation into the blast. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian also offered his condolences for those affected in the blast.",
      "Shahid Rajaei port in Hormozgan province is about 1,050 kilometers 650 miles southeast of Iran\u2019s capital, Tehran, on the Strait of Hormuz, the narrow mouth of the Persian Gulf through which 20% of all oil traded passes."

      "Gracie boarded the Titanic in Southampton on April 10, 1912, and was assigned first-class cabin C51. His book is seen as one of the most detailed accounts of the events of the night the ship sank, Aldridge said. Gracie did not fully recover from the hypothermia he suffered, and died of complications from diabetes in late 1912.",

      "Trump has for weeks been advocating in favor of a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine, and on Friday he hinted that a deal could be close to the finish line, urging Russia and Ukraine to meet for \u201cvery high level\u201d talks.

      "President Donald Trump called on Russia and Ukraine to hold direct ceasefire negotiations for the first time in years, urging the two sides to build on Friday\u2019s meeting between President Vladimir Putin and U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff.",
      "\u201cA good day in talks and meetings with Russia and Ukraine.\u00a0They are very close to a deal, and the two sides should now meet, at very high levels, to \u2018finish it off,\u2019\u201d Trump wrote in a Truth Social post. \u201cWe will be wherever is necessary to help facilitate the END to this cruel and senseless war!\u201d",
      "Representatives for Russia and Ukraine did not immediately respond to requests for comment Friday night on Trump\u2019s post.",
      "The two countries have not held direct talks since the early days of Russia\u2019s invasion in February 2022.",
      "Yuri Ushakov, a foreign policy aide to Putin, called the meeting between the Russian leader and Witkoff, who also has participated  in ceasefire talks with Ukraine, \u201cproductive.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis conversation allowed to bring positions of Russia and the United States closer together not only on Ukraine, but also on a number of other international matters,\u201d Ushakov said in a statement.",
      "\u201cI would like to note that in accordance with the agreement reached by the presidents of Russia and the United States, productive Russian-American dialogue at various levels will continue in the most active mode,\u201d he added.",
      "Witkoff did not immediately respond to a request from Reuters for comment.",
      "Putin told a Russian state TV reporter on Monday that he was open to resuming ceasefire talks with Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in return said on Monday that Ukraine \u201cwas ready for any conversation\u201d that would halt strikes on civilians.",
      "Trump\u2019s call for direct negotiations came the same day he was quoted in an interview with Time saying that \u201cCrimea will stay with Russia,\u201d the latest example of the U.S. president pressuring Ukraine to concede land to Russian invaders.",
      "\u201cZelenskyy understands that,\u201d Trump said, referring to the strategic Crimean Peninsula, which Russian illegally annexed in 2014. \u201cEverybody understands that it\u2019s been with them for a long time.\u201d",
      "One of Ukraine\u2019s most prominent politicians, Kyiv mayor and former boxing champion Vitali Klitschko, has conceded that his country may have to give up territory to Russia if it wants to achieve a peace deal \u2014 a major departure from the policies of his country\u2019s\u00a0president.",
      "Klitschko told the BBC on Friday morning while discussing ceasefire options that \u201cone of the scenarios is to give up territory.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not fair,\u201d he added, \u201cbut for the peace, temporary peace, maybe it can be a solution, temporary.\u201d",
      "Serhiy Leshchenko, an adviser in Zelenskyy\u2019s office, told the BBC that the comments on ceding territory earlier Friday by Klitschko were \u201ccounterproductive.\u201d",
      "Klitschko and Zelenskyy are political opponents who have clashed before. But the Kyiv mayor is now one of the most prominent Ukrainian politicians to suggest that these demands could soften.",
      "The Ukrainian government has repeatedly ruled out relinquishing land to Moscow. That\u2019s left a gulf between its position and that of Russia and the Trump administration, which has been a central force in negotiations to end the war.",
      "The meeting between Putin and Witkoff on Friday came at roughly the same time Zelenskyy said in a post on X that it was \u201cclear\u201d at least one of Russia\u2019s sweeping strikes on Kyiv in the early hours of Thursday involved \u201ca ballistic missile from North Korea.\u201d",
      "If confirmed, that would suggest that Pyongyang is sending materiel \u2014 as well as thousands of troops \u2014 to Russia\u2019s western front and signal broadening support for Moscow from one of the West\u2019s most bellicose and secretive foes.",
      "In a long post Friday, Zelenskyy said that while Ukraine had agreed to the Trump administration\u2019s proposed ceasefire 45 days ago, \u201cRussia rejects all of this. That is why this cannot be resolved without pressure. Pressure on Russia is necessary.\u201d",
      "Trump, who has often been accused of being more lenient toward Russia than Ukraine, insisted to journalists Thursday that \u201cyou don\u2019t know what pressure I\u2019m putting on Russia\u201d \u2014 without elaborating. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, meanwhile, said the Kremlin was \u201cready to reach a deal\u201d but that some details needed to be \u201cfine-tuned.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s those details that have so far been irreconcilable between the parties.",
      "As a president who once promised he could achieve peace in 24 hours, Trump eagerly wants to land a deal, particularly as he marks his first 100 days in office next week.",
      "Trump recently conceded that his campaign promise to end the war in a single day was an \u201cexaggeration\u201d made \u201cin jest,\u201d but still maintains that he is the only person who can broker a peace deal between the two nations.",
      "\u201cIf somebody else is president, no chance,\u201d Trump said in his interview with Time.",
      "Russia is hesitant to give up what it sees as its battlefield and diplomatic advantage \u2014 including an amenable president in the White House \u2014 according to regional analysts. And Ukraine is reluctant to sign an agreement that it believes will bring both painful territorial concessions and vulnerability to future attacks by the Kremlin.",
      "Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and his forces currently control around a fifth of its territory, including Crimea. Zelenskyy reiterated his stance Thursday, saying there was \u201cnothing to talk about\u201d when it came to relinquishing territory on a more permanent basis. \u201cIt is our land, the land of the Ukrainian people,\u201d he said.",
      "That stance had already prompted an angry reaction this week from Trump, who on social media Wednesday accused Zelenskyy of making \u201cinflammatory statements\u201d by refusing to cede land for peace.",
      "As well as diplomatically, Ukraine is under pressure on the front lines and in the skies, where Russia continues its nightly bombardment of civilians."

      "He could also be called the f\u00fatbol pope.",
      "The soccer world has been paying tribute to the late pontiff from Argentina, who used his love of f\u00fatbol \u2014 the term for soccer in Spanish \u2014\u00a0as a way to connect with people around the world, especially with young people. Francis was also known to use football in analogies to convey messages of teamwork, inclusion, hard work and unity.\u00a0He promoted the \u201cMatch for Peace,\u201d where the sport\u2019s top players take part in a friendly match to promote peace and unity.",
      "FIFA President Gianni Infantino said this week on Instagram that on the occasions where he spent time with the pope, \u201che always shared his enthusiasm for football and highlighted the important role our sport plays in society, particularly in the education and protection of children around the world.\u201d",
      "His hometown team devotion \u2014\u00a0and its ultimate tribute",

      "The pontiff was a card-carrying member of his hometown soccer club, San Lorenzo de Almagro, which was founded by a priest and is named after a saint. As fan No. 88235, the first Latin American pope kept paying dues to the club even after he was at the Vatican.",
      "Francis was such a fan that in 2014, when San Lorenzo won the coveted Copa Libertadores title, the team's leadership went to the Vatican to share in the celebration and gave the pope a replica of their trophy. Later, they announced they wanted a future new stadium to be named after the pontiff.",
      "This week, San Lorenzo President Marcelo Moretti confirmed on a radio show that plans for a new stadium with the pope's name are coming along, and he revealed that Francis got emotional when the team formally asked him years ago whether it could name its future new home after him.",
      "\"He said yes with emotion,\" Moretti told Blu Radio. \"The truth is he was very happy about it. In fact, we took him a piece of the old San Lorenzo stadium and where the new one will be built ... he got very emotional. It was very exciting for us and for him, too; he told me in subsequent letters.\"",
      "At a Mass held this week in his hometown, many were wearing the navy-and-red San Lorenzo jerseys.",

      "Francis\u2019 love of the game even inspired a fictional, but well-liked scene in Netflix\u2019s hit film \u201cThe Two Popes.\u201d In the movie, Pope Benedict and then-Cardinal Jorge Bergoglio watch the 2014 World Cup final between their two countries, Germany and Argentina."

      "Cuba says it will continue receiving deportation flights from the U.S. based on a previous accord between the two countries, even though the State Department says it has no plans to hold migration talks with the island\u2019s government.",
      "But the suspension of migration talks comes as President Donald Trump continues to crack down on immigrants and carry out what he calls the largest mass deportation operation in U.S. history. It's not clear how the Trump administration plans larger scale repatriations of Cubans without legal immigration status.",
      "A State Department spokesperson said in an emailed statement to NBC News that \u201cthe Trump Administration will no longer engage the Cuban regime for the sole sake of engagement and endless dialogue.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe have nothing to preview at this time,\u201d the statement said.",
      "When asked about the Trump administration\u2019s comments, the Cuban government told NBC News it will continue to abide by 2017 migration accords it negotiated with\u00a0then-President Barack Obama. At the time, the Cuban government agreed to accept deportations on a case-by-case basis.",
      "But the monthly flights usually have less than 100 people, far below the mass deportations Trump has vowed to carry out. Deportations on a larger scale would have to be negotiated between the two countries.",
      "\u201cBilateral migration talks are not part of the agreements, and they can be carried out even without talks. In fact, they have been a convenient vehicle to aid their implementation, and both governments have determined for most of the past few years that they are useful for mutually defined objectives,\u201d Cuban Vice Foreign Minister Carlos Fern\u00e1ndez de Cossio told NBC News in an emailed response to questions.",
      "\u201cIt is known that, despite the persistent unilateral hostility of the United States, Cuba is willing to meet to ensure the objectives that both countries have defined regarding migration,\" de Cossio said.",
      "Migration meetings between the two counties have taken place since the 1990s, though they were suspended under the George W. Bush administration and under the first Trump administration. The countries resumed migration talks in 2022 under the Biden administration amid a historic wave of Cuban migrants entering the U.S.",
      "Cubans were among the largest groups of migrants in recent years. U.S. Customs and Border Protection registered over 600,000 encounters with Cubans from fiscal years 2022 to 2024. That number has now dropped dramatically.",
      "As part of the 2017 accords, Obama agreed to end the \u201cwet foot, dry foot\u201d policy that allowed Cubans who arrived on United States soil without visas to remain in the country legally and gain residency. The Obama administration also eliminated the Cuban Medical Parole program under which Cuban medical professionals on missions overseas could defect and get fast-tracked visas to the United States.",
      "The Trump administration ended a Biden-era parole program that gave temporary legal status to hundreds of thousands of applicants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela, though it's been temporarily blocked by a judge.",
      "Trump terminated the Biden-era CBP One app that allowed migrants to remain in the U.S. for two years, and this month told them to leave the country immediately. Over 900,000 people were allowed in the country using the app from January 2023 until Trump closed it down on his first day in office. It\u2019s not clear how many were Cuban.",
      "Cuba has long said the U.S. incentivizes migration from the island by devastating its economy through heavy economic sanctions while making it easier for Cubans, in comparison to other groups, to gain residency and then citizenship.",
      "De Cossio stressed that Cuba is \u201ccommitted\u201d to complying with the 2017 agreements.",
      "But he added that \u201cthe strict implementation of the economic blockade remains in place,\" referring to the decades-old U.S. embargo against Cuba, \u201cwhich is recognized as an important factor in encouraging Cuban emigration, both regular and irregular, and explains the large presence of our nationals in the United States.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt applies a policy of economic warfare that depresses Cubans\u2019 standard of living and drives them to emigrate,\u201d de Cossio said.",
      "He said the U.S. has used migration \u201cfor destabilization purposes against Cuba.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat is why we say it is neither fair nor realistic to propose a mass deportation of Cubans in the United States, who have been pushed by U.S. policy and also admitted and protected by U.S. policies. Most have made a life there, have jobs, properties, and family members, and it is not fair to deport them for a change of heart,\u201d de Cossio said.",
      "Official exchanges between the United States and Cuba under the Trump administration have been limited to contact between the two embassies as well as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Cuba and the State Department to discuss specific issues, according to de Cossio.",
      "He said Cuba had summoned the charg\u00e9 d\u2019Affaires in Cuba, Mike Hammer, \u201cto warn him about his conduct that is not what is expected of a diplomat.\u201d",
      "In the last months, Hammer has engaged with prominent political dissidents on the communist island, an issue that also came up during Trump\u2019s first presidency as well.",
      "\u201cOn the part of Cuba, there is a willingness to develop respectful and constructive relations with the United States, regardless of who is president, as long as the standards that should prevail in bilateral ties between sovereign countries are respected,\u201d said de Cossio. \u201cToday, that willingness does not appear to exist in Washington. The narrow and hostile priorities of anti-Cuban sectors incapable of accepting Cuba\u2019s right to full sovereignty and self-determination prevail.\u201d",
      "De Cossio said he didn't see a reason why it's impossible to move toward a \"civilized\" relationship between the two countries and end what he categorized as \"a long-standing, unjust, and highly asymmetrical conflict.\""

      "Almost nine years after Kim Kardashian was robbed at gunpoint in Paris, the suspects accused of stealing $9 million of jewelry will head to court Monday for the start of a high-profile trial that will feature testimony from the reality star.",
      "A total of 10 people, nicknamed the \u201cgrandpa robbers\u201d by French media because of their ages, face charges in connection with the\u00a0break-in at the reality star\u2019s luxury suite\u00a0at the H\u00f4tel de Pourtal\u00e8s, an anonymous-looking building known as \u201cNo Address\u201d frequented by A-list celebrities. The suspects allegedly wore ski masks and clothes with police markings, tied Kardashian up in the bedroom of the luxury suite and robbed her. They are accused of armed robbery, kidnapping or other criminal charges.",
      "All eyes will be on Kardashian when she takes the stand May 13 in the trial which is expected to last a month.",
      "Michael Rhodes, Kardashian\u2019s attorney, said that his client has \u201ctremendous appreciation and admiration for the French judicial system\u201d and that she \u201chas been treated with great respect by the French authorities.\u201d",
      "Kardashian wants the trial to proceed \u201cwith respect for all parties to the case,\u201d he said, and is \u201creserving her testimony for the court and jury.\u201dMonths after the robbery made headlines, Kardashian talked about the incident in an emotional conversation with her sisters, Khloe Kardashian and Kourtney Kardashian, that aired in March 2017 during a season 13 episode of E!\u2019s \u201cKeeping Up With the Kardashians.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy door was open like this, and then I saw two guys holding another guy down in police uniforms, but right outside of my bedroom, 5 feet away,\u201d an emotional Kardashian said in the scene, a clip of which has been viewed 3.8 million times on E!\u2019s YouTube channel. \u201cSo I slid off my bed and picked up my phone and I\u2019m like I don\u2019t know how to call 911 in a different country, so I call Pascal \u2026 and then the guy came and grabbed the phone from me, threw me on the bed, and I was like, \u2018this is it.\u2019\u201d",
      "She said she saw the two men holding down the concierge, who was handcuffed and had a key to her room. \u201cWhat I\u2019ve heard from talking to him afterward is, they said, you know, \u2018Where\u2019s the rapper\u2019s wife? Let us up to her room!\u2019 in French,\u201d she said, referring to her then-husband, the artist Ye, formerly Kanye West.",
      "Most of the defendants were arrested three months after the incident occurred as part of a huge police operation that involved piecing together security camera footage and DNA evidence.",
      "But the legal process has been beset by years of delays, with many of the aging defendants now suffering from illnesses such as cancer and heart problems. One of them has since died and another is too unwell to stand trial.",
      "The defendants include: Aomar Ait Khedache, 69, known as \u201cOld Omar,\u201d accused of being the plot\u2019s mastermind; his son and alleged getaway driver, Harminy, 37; Didier \u201cBlue Eyes\u201d Dubreucq, 69; and the brother of Kardashian\u2019s driver in Paris, Gary Madar, 35, accused of providing the alleged gang members with information about her whereabouts. One of the accused is a woman, 78-year-old Christiane Glotin, who is accused of being an accomplice in planning the heist.",
      "Under France\u2019s judicial system, defendants in criminal cases do not enter formal pleas. They can admit or deny their guilt, but the trial proceeds regardless. Most cases in France are decided by judges, but as the maximum sentence of this trial is more than 20 years, it will be heard by a jury. There are no television cameras in French courts, so the proceedings will be documented by journalists and sketch artists recounting what happens in the room.",
      "At least one defendant has admitted to his part in the robbery. Yunice Abbas, now 72, wrote the 2021 book \u201cI Kidnapped Kim Kardashian,\u201d in which he detailed his life story and provided an account of the robbery itself. In the text, he describes being recruited months beforehand for a team to rob an unnamed \u201cwife of an American rapper\u201d \u2014 whose identity he only learned after committing the crime against her.",
      "\u201cA robbery! In the heart of Paris. Just like in the old days. Excitement prickles down my spine,\u201d he wrote of the moment he was hired for the job. However, he said he did not know the target was Kardashian until after the stickup took place.",
      "He described how he and his fellow thieves traveled to her apartments by foot and bicycle \u2014 his own ride suffering a flat tire, he wrote. Their police uniforms meant gaining entry was \u201clike a breeze,\u201d allowed in by the concierge who they then \u201cgently restrained\u201d and used to find Kardashian\u2019s room. He said he stayed on the ground floor while his accomplices robbed Kardashian \u201cwithout violence \u2014 a crucial aspect of the contract.\u201d",
      "But Kardashian has shared a different recollection of the incident, telling comedian David Letterman in a 2021 interview that one of her assailants \u201cgrabbed\u201d her that night.",
      "\u201cI was wearing a robe, and I wasn\u2019t wearing anything under it,\u201d she said on an episode of Netflix\u2019s \u201cMy Next Guest Needs No Introduction with David Letterman.\u201d \u201cI was like, \u2018OK, this is the time I\u2019m going to get raped. Just deal, it\u2019s going to happen. Just prepare yourself.\u2019\u201d",
      "In the years since the robbery, Kardashian has remained in the public eye and has continued to bolster her brand. With 357 million Instagram followers, she is among the most-followed people online. Skims, the shapewear brand she launched in 2023, is valued at $4 billion, according to Forbes. Kardashian, who in 2019 said she was studying to obtain her law degree, has also been a vocal advocate for justice reform.",
      "She and West, who separated in 2021 and settled their divorce in 2022, share four children together.",
      "The star has returned to Paris since the robbery. However, she has said that the 2016 experience rattled her.",
      "\u201cWhat\u2019s crazy is, meeting with my attorneys and knowing the information that I know now, [the robbers] had been following me for two years,\u201d she told Ellen DeGeneres on \u201cThe Ellen Show\u201d in April 2017. \u201cThey had been hearing interviews that I did getting excited about this jewelry or this jewelry \u2026 and it\u2019s not to say that I\u2019ll never wear jewelry again or anything like that. I truly don\u2019t know if I\u2019d ever feel comfortable, I truly don\u2019t know if I\u2019d ever wear real jewelry again.\u201d",
      "\u201cMy whole life has changed in terms of how I travel,\u201d she added. \u201cI never thought I needed security staying outside my door, even though I had a lot of jewelry and if you think about it, yeah, I should have had a security guard outside my door 24/7 when I\u2019m traveling \u2014 and I didn\u2019t. Now I have several just for me to be able to sleep at night.\u201d"

      "\u201cWe saw these amazing appointments,\u201d Elizabeth Lev, a Rome-based art historian, said. \u201cReally startling appointments.\u201d",
      "Lev said Francis\u2019 moves reflect shifts in the wider society. \u201cIn many ways, what Pope Francis has done is simply taken these women \u2014 these religious sisters or lay women who have worked behind the scenes carrying an incredible burden on their shoulders \u2014 and given them the title,\u201d Lev said.",
      "\u201cFinally gave them the spotlight they deserve,\u201d Lev said. \u201cAnd that is wonderful. And he chose women who are competent, women who are joyous.\u201d",
      "\u201cPope Francis\u2019 legacy on the place of women in the church ... is complex,\u201d Anna Rowlands, a professor at Durham University in the U.K. and occasional Vatican adviser, told Reuters.",
      "\u201cHe did more than any other pontiff to ensure that women are included in greater numbers and higher positions of authority,\u201d Rowlands said. \u201cYet, most of that change was precisely within existing parameters, flexing the system (only) a little.\u201d",
      "Still, there are many limits to women\u2019s role in the Catholic Church. Francis repeatedly reaffirmed that priestly ordination is \u201creserved for men\u201d \u2014 and when the 135 male cardinals gather to elect the next pope during next month\u2019s conclave, it will remain clear where the church\u2019s powers lie."

      "The Kremlin accused Ukraine of orchestrating the carbomb that killed a senior Russian military figure in a town near the city of Moscow Friday.",
      "Russian authorities had launched a criminal inquiry into the death of Lt. Gen. Yaroslav Moskalik, spokesperson Svetlana Petrenko said in a statement Friday on behalf of the committee, which is Russia's main federal criminal investigations authority.",
      "Moskalik was killed in the explosion of a Volkswagen Golf in the city of Balashikha following the \u201cdetonation of a homemade explosive device filled with shrapnel,\u201d Petrenko added.",
      "In an exchange with a reporter for Russian state media, Dmitry Peskov, spokesperson for the Kremlin, responded to a question about Ukraine's involvement in the blast.",
      "\u201cThe Kyiv regime once again shows its nature,\u201d Peskov said, accusing Ukraine of \u201cterrorist activity,\u201d though Moscow has not otherwise officially accused Ukraine of being behind the blast, and there is no other indication so far of this possibility.",
      "Moskalik is the latest in a long line of senior Russian military figures to be killed in bombings since Moscow invaded Ukraine three years ago.",
      "Speaking to the media the same day, Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova called the blast a \"terrorist attack.\" Authorities in Moscow have used similar language following previous bombing attacks on army personnel that were alleged to have been carried out by or on behalf of Ukraine.",
      "Since the start of the war, a number of pro-war Russian figures, including journalist Darya Dugina and former-submarine commander Stanislav Rzhitsk, have been assassinated in operations that Moscow has blamed on Kyiv.",
      "\u201cThe main question is how to stop the war in the center of Europe, the world. We see so many victims every day,\" Zakharova said, adding: \"Even today, a Russian military was killed in a terrorist attack in Moscow.\u201d",
      "In video published by the investigative committee, a burned-out vehicle could be seen on a road, with its hood flung open as investigators took in the scene. Official statements did not state whether Moskalik was inside or near the vehicle when it exploded.",
      "Petrenko said the task force assigned to the case would include investigators, forensic experts and other law enforcement professionals.",
      "It follows Russia's continuing bombardment of Ukraine's major cities. One of the largest such attacks in recent months came overnight Thursday and killed at least 12 people.",
      "President Donald Trump has expressed his frustrations with both Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, calling on Putin in a post on his Truth Social platform to \"stop\" following the sweeping attacks. \u201cI am not happy with the Russian strikes on KYIV. Not necessary, and very bad timing,\u201d Trump said.",
      "He told reporters Thursday that he believed Putin would listen to his call for a halt to strikes on Ukraine. He added that while there was \u201ca lot of hatred\u201d between Russia and Ukraine, they both wanted peace.",
      "Trump had also reacted angrily earlier Wednesday to Zelenskyy's refusal to consider ceding territory in exchange for a ceasefire. But Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko contradicted Zelenskyy on Friday, saying that Ukraine may have to relinquish territory.",
      "Those comments \u2014 a major departure from senior Ukrainian figures' previous remarks \u2014 came as Russian state media released video showing U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff meeting with Putin for their latest round of talks.",
      "An adviser in Zelenskyy\u2019s office, Serhiy Leshchenko, told the BBC Klitschko\u2019s remarks were \u201ccounterproductive.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "HONG KONG \u2014 President Donald Trump has a new nickname in China: \u201cThe Lord of Eternal Tariffs.\u201d",
      "Jokes and memes about the tariffs Trump has imposed on Beijing and other U.S. trading partners have been proliferating online in China, embraced by state media seeking to rally the public as well as ordinary internet users bemused by Trump\u2019s policy decisions.",
      "\u201cThe Lord of Eternal Tariffs,\u201d which can also be translated as \u201c10,000 Tariff Grandpa,\u201d appeared last week in a report by CCTV, China\u2019s state-run broadcaster, which said Americans were \u201crising up in arms\u201d against the tariffs amid fears they could harm the U.S. economy.",
      "As the world\u2019s two largest economies appear at an impasse over tariff levels that amount to a mutual embargo \u2014 a 145% U.S. levy on Chinese goods, and a 125% Chinese levy on goods from the U.S. \u2014Beijing has been allowing such rhetoric to promote the perception that it has the upper hand over Trump.",
      "China has taken a hard line on the trade dispute, with its Commerce Ministry saying Thursday that the U.S. should revoke all unilateral tariffs against China if it \u201ctruly wants to solve the problem.\u201d",
      "Even as the potential impact on their populations begins to sink in, the two countries are far from reaching the kind of trade deal Trump says the tariffs are designed to extract. They can\u2019t even agree on whether talks have started.",
      "Trump said Thursday that U.S. and Chinese officials had met that morning, without specifying who the officials were.",
      "Asked about Trump\u2019s remarks on Friday, the Chinese Foreign Ministry again disputed that any talks were taking place.",
      "\u201cThere have been no consultations or negotiations between China and the U.S. on tariff issues,\u201d spokesperson Guo Jiakun said. \u201cThe U.S. should not mislead the public.\u201d",
      "Commenters on China\u2019s heavily censored social media have been quick to seize on any suggestion that Trump might blink. Earlier this week, after Trump said the U.S. was \u201cgoing to be very nice\u201d to China and that final tariffs would \u201cnot be anywhere near\u201d 145%, one of the top trending hashtags on the Chinese social media platform Weibo was #TrumpWimpsOut.",
      "Chinese social media users have also satirized what they see as Trump\u2019s strongman aspirations. On RedNote, a Chinese platform similar to Instagram, AI-generated images show Trump dressed like a Chinese emperor.",
      "Others have made fun of the idea of the United States reverting to a nation focused mainly on manufacturing, with one AI-generated video depicting Trump, Elon Musk, Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio working on a production line in blue jumpsuits.",
      "Content creators on platforms not accessible in China have also joined in the online mockery. A parody account on YouTube produced a video called \u201cThe Song of MAGA,\u201d in which Trump, Musk, Vance and Rubio march together in front of a banner that says \u201cServe the people,\u201d a political slogan often used by the Chinese government.",
      "\u201cThe Lord of Eternal Tariffs\u201d joins other Chinese nicknames for Trump that have been around since his first term, such as \u201cKing Know-It-All.\u201d One popular transliteration of Trump\u2019s name is \u201cTrump Builds the Nation\u201d \u2014  the nation being China, which some say could become more influential in the world as the Trump administration withdraws from it.",
      "Joking aside, there are indications that both China and the U.S. are looking for ways to minimize the impact of the tariffs on their economies and people. Last week, for example, the Trump administration said that smartphones and other consumer electronics, which are among the biggest Chinese exports to the U.S., would receive tariff exemptions.",
      "Asked Friday about reports that China was considering exempting some U.S. imports from the 125% tariff, Guo, the Foreign Ministry spokesperson, said he was \u201cnot aware\u201d of the situation.",
      "But Beijing is openly pushing a campaign to help companies whose exports could be blocked sell them to the domestic market instead.",
      "Six Chinese online retailers, including JD.com and PDD, now have designated sections to help exporters sell their goods to Chinese consumers, the Ministry of Commerce said Thursday.",
      "Walmart\u2019s China unit has rolled out a similar channel in response to Beijing\u2019s call for the \u201cintegrated development of domestic and foreign trade,\u201d it said Thursday.",
      "At Joy City mall in Beijing, there are new signs that say \u201cExports turned domestic\u201d and \u201cSupport Chinese-made products.\u201d The section sells a wide range of products, including clothes, shoes, suitcases, canned food and even fine porcelain.",
      "Experts say the campaign may not gain much traction given that the Chinese government has struggled for years to boost domestic consumption.",
      "It\u2019s \u201cnaive\u201d for Chinese exporters to make up for their losses by selling in other markets since there are many products that only Americans will buy, such as Christmas decorations, said Andy Xie, an independent economist in Shanghai.",
      "\u201cPeople need to accept the reality that a lot of businesses will eventually all shut down,\u201d he said."
