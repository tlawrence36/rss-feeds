      "The organization that bestows the Academy Awards has apologized to \u201cNo Other Land\u201d co-director Hamdan Ballal after mounting criticism following its response to the violent attack on the Oscar winner",
      "NEW YORK -- After mounting criticism following its initial response to the violent attack on Oscar-winning \u201cNo Other Land\u201d co-director Hamdan Ballal, the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences apologized Friday for not acknowledging Ballal by name.",
      "In a letter to academy members, academy CEO Bill Kramer and its president, Janet Yang, said they regretted not issuing a direct statement on Ballal. The director on Monday, witnesses said, was beaten by Israeli settlers in the West Bank and then detained by the Israeli military.",
      "The attack, just weeks after Ballal and his fellow directors won best documentary at the Academy Awards, was widely condemned by numerous film organizations, among others. The academy on Wednesday released a statement condemning \u201charming or suppressing artists for their work or their viewpoints.\"",
      "Yuval Abraham, a journalist and co-director of \u201cNo Other Land,\u201d was highly critical of that response, comparing it to \u201csilence on Hamdan's assault.\"",
      "On Friday, more than 600 of the academy's 11,000 members issued an open letter saying the academy's statement \"fell far short of the sentiments this moment calls for.\u201d Among the signatories were Joaquin Phoenix, Olivia Colman, Riz Ahmed, Emma Thompson, Javier Bardem, Pen\u00e9lope Cruz and \u201cThe Zone of Interest\u201d filmmaker Jonathan Glazer.",
      "After a meeting Friday by the academy's board of governors, Kramer and Yang responded with a new statement.",
      "\u201cWe sincerely apologize to Mr. Ballal and all artists who felt unsupported by our previous statement and want to make it clear that the academy condemns violence of this kind anywhere in the world,\u201d they wrote to members. \"We abhor the suppression of free speech under any circumstances.\u201d",
      "After being detained for more than 20 hours, Ballal was released by Israeli soldiers. Ballal and two other Palestinians were accused of throwing stones at a settler, allegations they deny. After being released, Ballal told The Associated Press a settler kicked his head \u201clike a football\u201d during an attack on his village.",
      "\u201cI realized they were attacking me specifically,\u201d Ballal said at a West Bank hospital after his release Tuesday. \u201cWhen they say \u2018Oscar\u2019, you understand. When they say your name, you understand.\u201d",
      "\u201cNo Other Land,\u201d a joint Israeli-Palestinian production, chronicles the situation in Masafer Yatta, which the Israeli military designated as a live-fire training zone in the 1980s and ordered the expulsion of the residents, mostly Arab Bedouin. Around 1,000 residents have largely remained in place, but soldiers regularly come in to demolish homes, tents, water tanks and olive orchards.",
      "After not finding a U.S. distributor despite wide acclaim, \u201cNo Other Land\u201d was self-released in theaters. It still managed to surpass $2 million in North American theaters.",

      "At Hong Kong\u2019s Art Basel, painter Chow Chun-fai\u2019s new works transport viewers back to the night in 1997 when the former British colony returned to Chinese rule, displayed in the very exhibition center where one era ended and another began",
      "HONG KONG -- At Hong Kong\u2019s Art Basel, painter Chow Chun-fai\u2019s new works transport viewers back to the night in 1997 when the former British colony returned to Chinese rule, displayed in the very exhibition center where one era ended and another began.",
      "That transformation in the city's post-colonial era has taken a drastic turn since 2020, when China imposed a national security law that virtually wiped out dissent. The law drove many middle-class families and young professionals, including artists, to emigrate to democracies like Britain, Canada, Taiwan and the U.S. from what was once a haven for free expression in Asia.",
      "But others, like Chow, chose to stay and continue to document their home city despite unclear red lines. His works at Art Basel, which opens to the public on Friday, revisit Hong Kongers\u2019 collective memories of the late 1990s and early 2000s, a time many were proud of the Chinese financial hub\u2019s vibrancy and openness.",
      "\u201cWhile studying art, we\u2019ve learned many artists faced momentous times. Since we are living through such a momentous time ourselves now, I will continue to learn from it,\" he said in an interview ahead of the exhibition.",
      "Chow is perhaps best known to those outside art circles for his witty recreations of classic movie scenes with bilingual subtitles that lead audiences to reflect on Hong Kong's history and identity. He was also in the news when he ran against pro-establishment candidates in the 2012 legislative election and the 2016 election committee race, though he ultimately lost both contests.",
      "At Art Basel, Chow's paintings revisit significant news events, from the 1997 handover and overseas trips made by former top Chinese leaders to the celebration of China becoming the host of the 2008 Olympic Games.",
      "His works center on some of the biggest news stories covered by Sharon Cheung, a former journalist and now local gallery director.",
      "In 2000, late former Chinese President Jiang Zemin berated Cheung for asking what he called \u201ctoo simple, sometimes naive\u201d questions. She'd asked Jiang if his support for then-Hong Kong leader Tung Chee-hwa gave the impression of an imperial-style appointment. One of Chow\u2019s paintings illustrates that scene.",
      "Another set of Chow's paintings that will be shown, titled \u201cPanda,\u201d captures Jiang\u2019s personality from another side, documenting his light-hearted response to a question about pandas during a 2002 U.S. trip. He replied in English with a laugh: \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I am an electrical power engineer.\" Zhang said he was not a panda expert and quoted a Confucian saying about the virtue of acknowledging what one doesn\u2019t know.",
      "Chow said he included the work in the exhibition because pandas have become a trending topic in Hong Kong, where twins born last year sparked a bear craze. Jiang's response shows the characteristics of Chinese leaders back then, he said.",
      "Some 20 years later, Chinese leaders no longer have such open exchanges with Hong Kong journalists. Last year, China\u2019s government even eliminated an annual news conference by the premier, one of the rare times a top Chinese leader took questions from journalists.",
      "In Hong Kong, Beijing has doubled down on its control following 2019 anti-government protests. Many leading pro-democracy activists were prosecuted and jailed under the security law. Apple Daily and Stand News, news outlets known for their critical reports of the government, were shut down in 2021 after their top editors were arrested.",
      "The cultural sector has felt the chilling effect.",
      "In 2021, the government introduced amendments to its film censorship law on national security grounds. Some filmmakers have stopped screening their work in the city. Cultural works that diverge from government positions have lost funding. Booksellers practice self-censorship at the city's book fair, and local libraries in 2023 pulled titles related to the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown in Beijing and some political figures.",
      "Cheung, director of SC Gallery, said people have become more cautious about expressing their thoughts, but that she and Chow will not let fear stop them. Art\u2019s sense of distance allows room for interpretation, Cheung said.",
      "\u201cWe're not trying to tell people something. It's more about what people take away when they look at these images,\u201d she said.",
      "Chow said he never planned to leave Hong Kong despite the city's drastic changes, noting that artists who lived through major changes in the past produced great work.",
      "\u201cToday, finding ourselves in this moment of transformation, how could I, as a creative professional, not be here to witness it personally?\u201d he said.",

      "The Sex Pistols will tour North America for the first time since 2003 this fall",
      "NEW YORK -- It wasn't the night punk broke, but it was close. Nearly 50 years ago, the Sex Pistols \u2014 then made up of vocalist Johnny Rotten, guitarist Steve Jones, drummer Paul Cook and bassist Glen Matlock \u2014 performed at the 100 Club Punk Special in London, a 140-capacity club, alongside Subway Sect, Siouxsie and the Banshees and The Clash.",
      "The event marked a shift for the subcultural movement; the bands here would soon bring their underground culture to reach mainstream heights.",
      "Now, the 2025 iteration of the Pistols \u2014 Jones, Cooke and Matlock joined by frontman Frank Carter (of Gallows, Pure Love and Frank Carter and the Rattlesnakes) \u2014 sit in the same venue to discuss their forthcoming North American tour. \u201cThis is where it all kicked off, really, all the punk,\u201d says Cook.",
      "This fall, the legendary punk band will embark on their first tour of North America since 2003, when they were joined by John Lydon (formerly Rotten.) The 2025 run with Carter begins Sept. 16 at the Longhorn Ballroom in Dallas, Texas \u2014 the site of a particularly hostile show for the band when it first toured the U.S. in 1978.",
      "Jones recalls having \u201cpigs' hooves and bottles and what not slung at us by cowboys.\u201d",
      "It is one of a few dates featured in three \u201cLive in the U.S.A.\u201d albums, documenting the band's '78 run: Atlanta, Dallas and San Francisco. The latter will release April 25 and captures the show where the band originally called it quits.",
      "\"We were thinking of breaking up in San Francisco again,\" Jones jokes.",
      "The 2025 tour is currently scheduled to conclude Oct. 16 at the Hollywood Palladium in Los Angeles. The band will hit Washington; Philadelphia; Brooklyn, New York; Montreal; Toronto; Cleveland; Detroit; Minneapolis; Denver; Seattle and San Francisco. Additional tour dates will be announced later.",
      "Pre-sale opens April 2 and 3. Tickets go on sale April 4 at 10 a.m. local time.",
      "They will perform the band's sole album, 1977\u2019s \u201cNever Mind the Bollocks, Here\u2019s the Sex Pistols Album\u201d live in its entirety as well as other material.",
      "So, why tour the U.S. and Canada now?",
      "\u201cWhy not?\u201d says Jones.",
      "\u201cI think everybody needs this band right now. I think the world needs this band right now,\u201d says Carter. \u201cAnd I think definitely America is screaming out for a band like the Sex Pistols.\u201d",
      "\u201cAt the end of the day, we\u2019re living in a really, really difficult time. So not only do people want to come and just be entertained, they want to enjoy themselves,\u201d he continued. \u201cPunk is an energetic music. It\u2019s one where you can go and vent and let your hair down, hopefully in a safe manner. Fingers crossed, no bottles or pigs' hooves.\u201d",
      "Carter fronted the Sex Pistols last year for a few U.K. dates. The band says they did not reach out to Lydon to see if he wanted to participate in this reunion tour.",
      "\u201cThe last thing he wants to do is have anything to do with us right now,\u201d says Jones, referring to a previous lawsuit between the singer and the band over music use in their TV series \u201cPistol.\u201d The judge ruled against Lydon's opposition.",
      "\u201cWe wish him the best,\" Jones said.",
      "\u201cGood luck to him,\u201d adds Matlock. \u201cI wish he thinks, maybe, \u2018good luck\u2019 to us. Probably doesn't. But over the years, John (has had) all our phone numbers, and I can't see many missed calls from him.\u201d",
      "As for the 2025 tour: Fans shouldn't expect the violence of their 1978 run, but they should anticipate a tighter performance.",
      "\u201cWe're a bit older but we play just as well, if not better,\u201d says Matlock. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s something that\u2019s got a great deal of aplomb that we\u2019re going to bring to the public over there.\u201d",
      "Does this mean there could be new Sex Pistols music in the future? \u201cIt's early days,\u201d says Jones. \u201cLet's see what happens.\u201d",

      "\u201cASCO: Without Permission\u201d is director Travis Guti\u00e9rrez Senger's latest documentary and executive produced by Gael Garcia Bernal and Diego Luna",
      "LOS ANGELES -- When filmmaker Travis Guti\u00e9rrez Senger reflects on ASCO\u2019s legacy, he quickly notes they were more than an art group; they created a movement, one with remarkable influence on Chicano art history.",
      "\u201cThat movement continues today, and it\u2019s very expansive,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of books, films and things that will be written about ASCO over a period of time. And this was our contribution in some ways.\u201d",
      "He's referring to \u201cASCO: Without Permission,\u201d a documentary that chronicles the story of the 1970s art group founded by multidisciplinary artist Patssi Valdez, muralist Willie Herr\u00f3n III, painter and performance artist Gronk and writer and photographer Harry Gamboa Jr. They met as teens, formed as young adults, and called their group \u201casco\u201d \u2014 \u201cnausea\u201d or \u201cdisgust\u201d in Spanish \u2014 after one of their early DIY exhibits. Their conceptual work and performance art spoke to the exclusion of Chicanos from the mainstream art world and the systemic police brutality endured by the Mexican American community in East Los Angeles.",
      "All four founding members of ASCO became some of the most notable Chicano artists, later exhibiting works in revered museums around the United States. But in their early days, the group was denied access to the notable galleries and museums. They created their own avenues in the form of public performances, murals and more to exhibit their work, their way.",
      "\u201cTo behave badly is the most ethical thing you can do,\u201d said executive producer Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal at the film\u2019s South by Southwest film festival premiere earlier this month. \u201cYou\u2019re building identity and questioning and unmasking the facade and the farce that exists.\u201d",
      "Bernal and Diego Luna executive produced the film under their production company El Corriente del Golfo. The film has yet to find distribution.",
      "Speaking with The Associated Press, Gamboa and Valdez praised Guti\u00e9rrez Senger\u2019s approach to their history. Both members, who appear in the documentary, saw the film for the first time with a crowd of fans and a group of young Chicano artists whose art was inspired by ASCO\u2019s early rebellion.",
      "\u201cI felt the film really kind of captured the essence of all of us working together,\u201d said Gamboa.",
      "Valdez says it was a special moment for her, as the only woman in the founding group, to be given equal time and understanding.",
      "\u201cFor the first time, I was given an equal voice in the group that hadn\u2019t happened before,\u201d she said, citing how previous stories of the group only highlighted her male collaborators.",
      "ASCO emerged at the height of the Chicano civil rights movement in the 1960s and 1970s. It was a time of heightened political and racial tension amid the East LA walkouts, protesting education inequality, and the Chicano Moratorium, an anti-Vietnam War movement during which many Mexican Americans were victims of police brutality.",
      "Muralists and collectives popped up as Latino artists sought to process the systemic injustice taking place in their communities.",
      "\u201cThe response to such violence was to create art,\u201d said Gamboa Jr. He wanted to alter the mainstream perception of Chicanos and present the possibilities and avenues someone can create despite societal constraints.",
      "For Valdez, being the only woman meant she was no stranger to a double dose of both racism in society and the sexism weaved within conservative Latino households, where young women were expected to keep quiet.",
      "\u201cI couldn\u2019t stand it. So, I was able to act out these forms of censorship through the performance work in ASCO,\u201d said Valdez who once taped herself to a public wall in a piece titled \u201cInstant Mural,\u201d a metaphor on feeling captive.",
      "One of ASCO's most known works is \u201cSpray Paint LACMA.\u201d Gamboa, Gronk and Herr\u00f3n spray painted their names on the side of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art after Gamboa says he was told by a curator, \u201cChicanos are in gangs, they don\u2019t make art.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere was another era when people said, \u2018Latinx art, you know, doesn\u2019t exist. It\u2019s not a thing. It doesn\u2019t belong. It\u2019s not part of American art,\u2019\u201d said Pilar Tompkins-Rivas, the chief curator and deputy director of the Lucas Museum of Narrative Art.",
      "ASCO\u2019s neighborhood performance art would often draw stares, and even crowds. In \u201cStation of the Cross,\u201d the group carried a large cross to the local military recruiting office to protest the Vietnam War.",
      "In 1974, Gamboa took a photo of Gronk posed as the victim of gang violence to bring attention to the media\u2019s sensationalist coverage of crime in East Los Angeles. In the documentary, Gamboa claims that a local news station ran the piece as an actual story.",
      "ASCO\u2019s work as a group remained in obscurity from the mainstream. It was not until 2011 when LACMA mounted \u201cASCO: Elite of the Obscure, A Retrospective, 1972-1887,\u201d the first retrospective to present the group\u2019s performance and conceptual art. On display was an image of Valdez, taken by Gamboa, standing above the graffiti art. Life had presented ASCO with its full-circle moment.",
      "\u201cLatino history has always been erased,\u201d said Guti\u00e9rrez Senger. \u201c\u2018ASCO: Without Permission\u2019 is a story of winning a battle, not a war.\u201d",
      "A 1974 photograph of Valdez shows the artist glammed up in a gold top, holding a golden statue of a cobra. She had won best actress at the Aztlan No Movie Awards \u2014 a fictional award show ASCO created as commentary on the lack of Latino representation in Hollywood.",
      "The group was inspired by Hollywood cinema and popular culture, but knew the likelihood of starring in studio films was limited, unless they wanted to play a maid, cartel leader or gang member.",
      "\u201cHollywood movies, rock \u2019n\u2019 roll. That\u2019s what I was about,\u201d said Valdez. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why I responded in the way I did with my artmaking.\u201d",
      "Gamboa photographed Herr\u00f3n, Gronk and Valdez using cinema stock to capture the essence of their favorite films. The series was called \u201cNo Movies\u201d and later inspired their satirical award show.",
      "Guti\u00e9rrez Senger was drawn to it and pays homage throughout the documentary by featuring a group of young Chicano artists \u2014 including local Los Angeles artists like Fabi Reyna and San Cha \u2014 in short films inspired by ASCO\u2019s signature DIY style.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s a necessary obligation as a Latino if you\u2019re making films to fight very, very hard to put brown people on screen and behind the camera and to try to create films about our history,\u201d said Guti\u00e9rrez Senger. \u201cWe have rich stories, and we have a rich history.\u201d",
      "\u201cASCO: Without Permission\u201d includes testimonials from respected Latino artists, including actor Michael Pe\u00f1a and comedian Arturo Castro, who have broken into the mainstream but know the importance of preserving history.",
      "\u201cOur history as Latinos is not in the history books. The movements that we've had are not in the history books,\u201d Pe\u00f1a says in the documentary.",
      "Although it often feels like progression is slow, Valdez says artists need to continue to voice their opinions and \u201cmisbehave and not ask for permission.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou do not need permission to be yourself. You do not need permission to be creative. You do not need permission to be intellectual,\u201d said Gamboa. \u201cAnd the thing is, you cannot allow yourself to be repressed or silenced and or visually curtailed from presenting works.\u201d",

      "A woman accusing French actor G\u00e9rard Depardieu of sexual assault has told a landmark trial in Paris that he groped her buttocks and her breasts several times in three separate incidents on a film set",
      "PARIS -- A woman accusing French actor G\u00e9rard Depardieu of sexual assault told a landmark trial in Paris on Wednesday that he groped her buttocks and her breasts several times in three separate incidents on a film set.",
      "Depardieu, 76, is accused of groping a 54-year-old set dresser and a 34-year-old assistant during filming in 2021 of \u201cLes Volets Verts\u201d (\u201cThe Green Shutters\u201d). He denies any sexual assault.",
      "Day 3 of the Paris trial focused on the testimony of the younger plaintiff, who said Depardieu first groped her bottom when she was alone with him for a brief moment between the backstage area and the film set.",
      "\u201cOut of the blue, he put his hand on my butt,\u201d she said, adding she was \u201cunder shock,\u201d \u201cpetrified,\u201d and said nothing.",
      "In a second incident, she said Depardieu suddenly put both his hands on her breasts: \u201cI said no, I was scared.\"",
      "She also described telling Depardieu \u201cno\u201d during a third similar incident.",
      "The plaintiff said she reported the issue to her direct manager, who then alerted others in charge of the film production, prompting anger from the actor.",
      "Depardieu repeatedly denied the allegations Wednesday in court, saying : \u201cI\u2019m not like that.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think that maybe, I don\u2019t know, she was wary because of my reputation of being vulgar, crude, rude,\" Depardieu said. \"But I\u2019m not only that. I still respect people.\u201d",
      "The actor also told the court that he is almost always accompanied by aides on the film set, including his body guard, and suggested that he would rarely find himself alone with a film worker.",
      "On Tuesday, Depardieu acknowledged that he had used vulgar and sexualized language with the set dresser who accused him of sexual assault. He said he grabbed her hips during an argument, but denied that his behavior was sexual.",
      "The Associated Press doesn\u2019t identify by name people who say they were sexually assaulted unless they consent to. Neither women has done so in this case.",
      "The four-day trial was to continue Thursday, with the verdict expected at a later date.",
      "The actor faces up to five years in prison and a fine of 75,000 euros ($81,000) if convicted.",

      "HOUSTON -- The woman convicted of killing Tejano music legend Selena Quintanilla-P\u00e9rez has been denied parole and will continue serving a life sentence for fatally shooting the rising young singer at a Texas motel in 1995, the state\u2019s parole board announced Thursday.",
      "Yolanda Sald\u00edvar, 64, was up for parole for the first time since the killing of the singer, known to fans as simply Selena.",
      "One of the first Mexican American artists to break into the mainstream music scene, Selena shattered barriers for women in Latin music. She was 23 years old and on the verge of crossing over into English-language pop superstardom when she was killed.",
      "The singer's family and Chris P\u00e9rez, her widower, expressed gratitude to the Texas Board of Pardon and Paroles.",
      "\u201cWhile nothing can bring Selena back, this decision reaffirms that justice continues to stand for the beautiful life that was taken from us and from millions of fans around the world far too soon,\u201d they said in a statement posted on social media.",
      "In explaining the decision to deny parole, the board said in a statement that the panel found that Sald\u00edvar continues to pose a threat to public safety. It also said the nature of the crime indicated \u201ca conscious disregard for the lives, safety, or property of others.\u201d",
      "Sald\u00edvar, who is serving her sentence in a Gatesville prison, will be eligible to be reviewed again for parole in 2030.",
      "Sald\u00edvar founded Selena\u2019s fan club and was the manager of the singer\u2019s clothing boutiques, Selena Etc., until she was fired in early March 1995 after money was discovered missing.",
      "Selena, a Corpus Christi native, was shot in the back with a .38-caliber revolver at a Days Inn motel in Corpus Christi on March 31, 1995. She was able to run to the motel lobby, where she collapsed, and she was pronounced dead at a hospital an hour later.",
      "Motel employees testified that Selena named \u201cYolanda\u201d in \u201croom 158\u201d as her attacker.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to do it. I didn\u2019t mean to kill anybody,\u201d a sobbing Sald\u00edvar said during a nine-hour standoff with police. She told officers she had bought the .38-caliber revolver to kill herself.",
      "More than 50,000 people lined up to view Selena\u2019s body the day before she was laid to rest in Seaside Memorial Park on April 3, 1995, just 13 days before her 24th birthday.",
      "Sald\u00edvar\u2019s trial was moved to Houston because of the publicity surrounding the case. Sald\u00edvar testified that she had intended to kill herself during the confrontation with Selena but the gun misfired.",
      "On Oct. 23, 1995, a jury convicted Sald\u00edvar of first-degree murder. She was sentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole after 30 years.",
      "While in prison, Sald\u00edvar, a former nurse, obtained her paralegal and associate degree in criminal justice. She has filed several civil rights complaints alleging mistreatment by the state\u2019s prison system, according to court records, and she also helped other inmates file petitions.",
      "In court documents from 2016, Sald\u00edvar said she was being held in protective custody \u2014 meaning she was segregated from other inmates \u2014 because prison officials were concerned for her safety due to the \u201chigh profile\u201d nature of her case. She filed several appeals of her conviction, but all were rejected.",
      "Known as \u201cthe Queen of Tejano,\u201d Selena rose to stardom and won a Grammy during a Tejano music boom in the early 1990s. Her hits included \u201cBidi Bidi Bom Bom,\u201d \u201cComo la Flor,\u201d \u201cAmor Prohibido,\u201d \u201cNo Me Queda Mas\u201d and \u201cTu Solo Tu.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump on Thursday revealed his intention to force changes at the Smithsonian Institution with an executive order that targets funding for programs that advance \u201cdivisive narratives\u201d and \u201cimproper ideology,\" the latest step in a broadside against culture he deems too liberal.",
      "Trump claimed there has been a \u201cconcerted and widespread\u201d effort over the past decade to rewrite American history by replacing \u201cobjective facts\u201d with a \u201cdistorted narrative driven by ideology rather than truth,\" adding that it casts the \u201cfounding principles\u201d of the United States in a \u201cnegative light.\u201d",
      "The order he signed behind closed doors puts Vice President JD Vance, who serves on the Smithsonian Institution's Board of Regents, in charge of overseeing efforts to \u201cremove improper ideology\u201d from all areas of the institution, including its museums, education and research centers, and the National Zoo.",
      "It marks the Republican president's latest salvo against cultural pillars of society, such as universities and art, that he considers out of step with conservative sensibilities. Trump recently had himself installed as chairman of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts with the aim of overhauling programming, including the annual Kennedy Center Honors awards show. The administration also recently forced Columbia University to make a series of policy changes by threatening the Ivy League school with the loss of several hundred million dollars in federal funding.",
      "The executive order also hints at the return of statues and monuments of Confederate figures, many of which were taken down or replaced around the country after the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis in 2020 and the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement, which is detested by Trump and other conservatives.",
      "The order also calls for improvements to Independence Hall in Philadelphia by July 4, 2026, in time for the 250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence.",
      "Trump singled out the National Museum of African American History and Culture, which opened in 2016 near the White House, the Women's History Museum, which is in development, and the American Art Museum for criticism.",
      "\u201cMuseums in our Nation's capital should be places where individuals go to learn \u2014 not to be subjected to ideological indoctrination or divisive narratives that distort our shared history,\u201d he said.",
      "Linda St. Thomas, the Smithsonian Institution\u2019s chief spokesperson, said in an email late Thursday, \u201cWe have no comment for now.\u201d",
      "Under Trump\u2019s order, Vance will also work with the White House budget office to make sure future funding for the Smithsonian Institution isn\u2019t spent on programs that \u201cdegrade shared American values, divide Americans based on race, or promote programs or ideologies inconsistent with federal law and policy.\u201d Trump also wants to ensure that the women\u2019s history museum celebrates women and not \u201crecognize men as women in any respect.\u201d",
      "It also requires the interior secretary to reinstate monuments, memorials, statues and similar properties that have been removed or changed since Jan. 1, 2020, to \u201cperpetuate a false reconstruction of American history, inappropriately minimize the value of certain historical events or figures, or include any other improper partisan ideology.\u201d",

      "Now 64, Sald\u00edvar has a petition for parole under review, according to Texas Department of Criminal Justice online records. On Sunday, she is up for parole for the very first time.",
      "According to a spokeswoman for the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles, her case will be voted on or around then, but there's no exact date for the decision to be released.",
      "Here's everything you need to know about Selena, Sald\u00edvar and the parole process in Texas:",
      "Born in 1971, Quintanilla-P\u00e9rez demonstrated an incredible vocal gift in childhood, fronting Selena y Los Dinos with her siblings A.B. and Suzette Quintanilla.",
      "Her superstardom arrived in the early 1990s, with her unique blend of Tejano, pop, cumbia and other musical styles manifesting in huge hits like \u201cBidi Bidi Bom Bom,\u201d \u201cComo la Flor,\u201d \u201cAmor Prohibido,\u201d \u201cNo Me Queda Mas\u201d and \u201cTu Solo Tu.\u201d",

She opened the floodgates for a new generation of contemporary artists of Latin descent who would go on to enjoy huge popularity with mainstream American audiences. She often sang in Spanish and spoke in English, reflecting a cross-cultural identity that resonated with listeners.",
      "She won her first Grammy in 1994 for best Mexican/Mexican-American album for \u201cLive,\u201d becoming the first female Tejano artist to win the category. She was just 23 when she was killed the following year. But her legacy endures for Mexican Americans, Mexicans, Texans, Latinos and beyond.",
      "Her posthumous English-language crossover album released a few months after her death, \u201cDreaming of You,\u201d topped the Billboard 200, featuring hits like \u201cI Could Fall in Love\u201d and \u201cDreaming of You.\" In 1997, a biographical film about her life, \u201cSelena,\" would quickly become a classic, further launching the career of lead Jennifer Lopez.",
      "In 2017, she received a posthumous star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. At the time, according to a Hollywood Chamber of Commerce spokesperson, the crowd was the largest-ever for a Walk of Fame ceremony, breaking a 1998 record set by onlookers at the unveiling of the star for Mexican singer Vicente Fern\u00e1ndez.",
      "In 2021, she received a posthumous lifetime achievement award from the Grammys. There was no tribute.",
      "Yolanda Sald\u00edvar, a former nurse, was the founder and president of Selena's fan club. She was also a manager of Selena\u2019s clothing boutiques, Selena Etc., but was fired in early 1995 after money was discovered missing.",
      "On March 31, 1995, Selena went to Sald\u00edvar's room at the Days Inn motel in Corpus Christi, Texas, to pick up business records she needed for a tax filing, according to court testimony. A confrontation followed.",
      "Selena was shot in the back with a .38-caliber revolver in the motel room, ran outside and collapsed in the lobby. She was rushed to a nearby hospital and pronounced dead about an hour later.",
      "Motel employees testified Selena named \u201cYolanda\u201d in \u201croom 158\u201d as her attacker.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to do it. I didn\u2019t mean to kill anybody,\u201d a sobbing Sald\u00edvar said during a 9-hour standoff with police, during which she held a gun to her head. She told police she had bought the .38-caliber revolver to kill herself.",
      "The trial was moved to Houston because of heavy publicity.",
      "Prosecutors contended that Sald\u00edvar shot the 23-year-old after the singer\u2019s family suspected her of embezzling $30,000. The defense argued the gun went off accidentally.",
      "On October 23, 1995, the jury convicted Sald\u00edvar of first-degree murder. She was sentenced to life in prison, with the possibility of parole after 30 years \u2014 beginning in 2025.",
      "Sald\u00edvar did not face the death penalty because the crime contained none of the aggravating circumstances required under Texas law, such as a multiple murder or a murder committed during a robbery.",
      "In 1999, the Court of Criminal Appeals in Austin turned down Sald\u00edvar\u2019s first plea for a new trial. In 2000, her lawyer Bill Berchelmann asked the state to revisit the trial. He argued that prosecutors wrongly dismissed potential jurors because of race, did not disclose the criminal record of a witness and made improper comments in court. He said police also violated Sald\u00edvar's rights by interrogating her after she asked for an attorney.",
      "In 2009, Sald\u00edvar lost an appeal because it was filed in the wrong county. She had asked the court to order an appeal filed nine years earlier in Nueces County to move forward, but the state\u2019s highest criminal appeals court said it should have been filed in Harris County, where she was tried and convicted.",
      "She's incarcerated at the Patrick L. O\u2019Daniel prison unit in Gatesville, Texas, about 90 minutes north of Austin.",
      "In Texas, the parole division of the state\u2019s Department of Criminal Justice identifies inmates six months before the date of their initial parole eligibility and pulls their case file for review. Notice of an inmate\u2019s eligibility for parole is sent to officials involved in the trial, any victims and victims' family members.",
      "An institutional parole officer with the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles interviews an inmate and prepares a summary for the board. The victim or the victim\u2019s family members can provide a written statement and can appear in person before board members.",
      "The inmate\u2019s file is then sent to the parole board and voted on by a three-person panel. The panel will vote on a case just prior to the inmate\u2019s parole eligibility date and a majority of two votes is needed for a final decision.",
      "In Texas, the board does not conduct public parole hearings. Parole release decisions are made independently by each panel member.",
      "Representatives for members of Quintanilla-P\u00e9rez\u2019s family did not immediately respond to The Associated Press' request for comment this week.",
      "A denial by the panel will include the date of the next time an inmate will be eligible for parole.",
      "Sald\u00edvar was convicted of first-degree murder, one of the crimes where state law dictates that the next review after a denial can be done anywhere from one to five years from the date of the denial.",
      "An approval by the panel could include special conditions the inmate will have to follow while on parole. Processing time for a release differs from case to case. Once a release certificate with an approved residence plan is issued, it will be audited by the Texas Department of Criminal Justice\u2019s Classification and Records Department and a release date is calculated. Typically, these processes can take two to six weeks to complete.",
      "The governor cannot veto a parole decision by the pardons board. The governor, upon recommendation by a majority of the pardons board, can grant clemency. That includes pardons, commutations and reprieves.",

      "The redacted footage shows deputies talking with the two workers who called authorities to report seeing someone lying on the floor inside the home. With no signs of forced entry or other evidence of suspicious circumstances, the deputies asked about the possibility of a gas leak or carbon monoxide poisoning, and the workers said they didn\u2019t see how that could have been the case.",

      "The Santa Fe County Sheriff\u2019s Office released only some of the footage from the investigation.",
      "A New Mexico court last week granted a temporary restraining order against the release of any photographs and video showing Hackman and his wife the inside of their home. Hackman\u2019s estate had filed the petition to withhold images, citing the need to protect the family\u2019s constitutional right to privacy in grief under the 14th Amendment.",
      "Workers who had maintained the property talked to investigators about respecting Hackman and Arawaka\u2019s privacy. One worker described Arawaka as a private person.",
      "The body camera footage also shows brief sightings of one of the couple\u2019s dogs running in the wooded hills on their property on the edge of Santa Fe. A man who identified himself to officers as a dog trainer who cared for the couple\u2019s pet dogs said the couple were \u201cnuts\u201d about their dogs.",

      "The Walt Disney Co.\u2019s live-action, controversy-bedeviled \u201cSnow White\u201d opened in theaters with a sleepy $43 million in ticket sales, according to studio estimates Sunday",
      "NEW YORK -- The Walt Disney Co.\u2019s live-action, controversy-bedeviled \u201cSnow White\u201d opened in theaters with a sleepy $43 million in ticket sales, according to studio estimates Sunday.",
      "With a budget above $250 million, \u201cSnow White\u201d had set out with higher ambitions, particularly since it returns Disney to its very origins. The 1937 original \u201cSnow White and the Seven Dwarfs\u201d was the company\u2019s first animated feature, and paid for its Burbank studio lot.",
      "But this \u201cSnow White\u201d struggled to find anything like a fairy tale ending. The runup to release was plagued by controversies over the film\u2019s handling of the dwarfs, who are rendered in CGI, and backlashes over comments by its star, Rachel Zegler. The PR headaches prompted Disney to pull back on its premiere.",
      "Also working against the film, directed by Marc Webb: poor reviews. Critics were largely not impressed with Disney\u2019s latest live-action remake, with reviews coming in just 43% \u201cfresh\u201d on Rotten Tomatoes.",
      "There\u2019s been a wide variance between the box-office performance of other \u201clive-action\u201d Disney remakes, but \u201cSnow White\u201d might mark a new nadir. Jon Favreau\u2019s photorealistic \u201cThe Lion King\u201d (2019) didn\u2019t have great reviews, either, but grossed more than $1.6 billion worldwide. \u201cSnow White\u201d opened worse than \u201cDumbo\u201d (a $46 million opening in 2019) and well shy of \u201cCinderella\u201d territory ($67.9 million in 2015).",
      "Overseas, \u201cSnow White\u201d added $44.3 million for a global launch of $87.3 million. But going into the weekend, \u201cSnow White\u201d had been eyeing a worldwide total closer to $100 million \u2013 and a few weeks back, expectations were significantly higher.",
      "The result will surely add to questions over Disney\u2019s long-term strategy of mining its vault for live-action remakes. In the pipeline are upcoming new versions of \u201cMoana\" and \u201cTangled.\" A live-action \u201cLilo & Stitch\u201d launches in May.",
      "Efforts to modernize \u201cSnow White,\" though, quickly ran afoul. In 2022, actor Peter Dinklage criticized the remake plans as \u201cbackward.\u201d Disney ultimately opted to drop \u201cand the Seven Dwarfs\u201d from the original's title, and animate the dwarfs. Some right-wing commentators targeted \u201cSnow White\u201d and Zegler's casting as an overly \u201cwoke\u201d production. Delays and reshoots also ran up costs.",
      "Disney, though, has recently steered a handful of films from modest starts to enviable final hauls. The Barry Jenkins-directed \u201cMufasa: The Lion King\u201d opened with $35.4 million domestically, but ultimately surpassed $717 million worldwide. \u201cSnow White\u201d will face little direct competition in the coming weeks. Audiences gave it a \u201cB+\u201d CinemaScore.",
      "Warner Bros.\u2019 \u201cAlto Knights,\u201d a period gangster film starring Robert De Niro in both lead roles, was a total misfire. The Barry Levinson-directed film, which cost about $45 million to make, opened with just $3.2 million from 2,651 theaters. The flop of \u201cAlto Knights\u201d followed another misfire for Warner Bros. with Bong Joon Ho\u2019s big-budget sci-fi \u201cMickey 17.\u201d In three weeks, it\u2019s tallied $40.2 million domestically against a $118 million budget.",
      "\u201cMagazine Dreams,\u201d starring Jonathan Majors as a disturbed aspiring bodybuilder, opened with $700,000 for Briarcliff Entertainment in 815 locations. The film was dropped by Searchlight Pictures after Majors was convicted of two misdemeanor counts of assault and harassment against Grace Jabbari, his ex-girlfriend. Majors avoided jail time but was given a year of probation.",
      "The disappointment-filled weekend added to a rough 2025 so far for Hollywood. The box office is down 6.9% from last year, according to data firm Comscore, and 38.6% from 2019.",
      "With final domestic figures releasing Monday, this list factors in the estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore.",

      "With his hulking frame, crooked nose, and volcanic charisma, G\u00e9rard Depardieu reigned over cinema for half a century",
      "PARIS -- PARIS (AP) \u2014 G\u00e9rard Depardieu once seemed larger than France itself. With his hulking frame, crooked nose, and volcanic charisma, he reigned over cinema for half a century \u2014 a national icon as familiar as the baguette.",
      "But this week, the actor who starred in more than 230 films \u2014 and who inspired writer John Updike to lament, \u201cI think that I shall never view a French film without Depardieu\u201d \u2014 sat slumped on a special orthopedic stool in a Paris courtroom.",
      "He faces two counts of sexual assault. If convicted, he could face up to five years in prison and a fine of 75,000 euros ($81,000).",
      "But more than Depardieu is on trial.",
      "For many in France, this case marks the country\u2019s ultimate litmus test \u2014 a question not just of guilt or innocence, but of readiness. Can a nation famed for its culture of seduction \u2014 and long criticized for shielding its male artists \u2014 finally hold one of them accountable?",
      "Depardieu, 76, is accused of groping two women \u2014 a set dresser and an assistant \u2014 during the 2021 filming of \u201cLes Volets Verts\u201d (\"The Green Shutters\"). According to complaints and witness statements, he trapped one woman with his legs, grabbed her breasts and waist, and shouted: \u201cI can\u2019t even get it up because of this heat!\u201d before crudely inviting her to touch his \u201cbig parasol.\u201d",
      "He denies all allegations. \u201cNever, but never, have I abused a woman,\u201d he wrote in Le Figaro. \u201cI have only ever been guilty of being too loving, too generous, or having a temperament that is too strong.\u201d",
      "But this is the first time one of the more than 20 accusations against him has reached court.",
      "Once a symbol of France\u2019s creative power, Depardieu\u2019s career now shadows the nation\u2019s delayed reckoning with #MeToo. The courtroom has become the stage for something deeper: a country finally confronting the myths it has long told itself about art, power, and male genius.",
      "Born in 1948 to a working-class family in Ch\u00e2teauroux, Depardieu\u2019s rise was the stuff of legend. A stuttering teen with no formal education, he drifted into acting and exploded onto the French stage with \u201cLes Valseuses\u201d (\"Going Places\"), a 1974 film so provocative it remains banned in some countries.",
      "From there came a blur of hits: \u201cJean de Florette,\u201d \u201cCyrano de Bergerac,\u201d \u201cGreen Card,\u201d \u201cThe Last Metro,\u201d and \u201cDanton.\u201d He won a Golden Globe, an Oscar nomination, and the adoration of millions. He played Columbus, Jean Valjean, and even Ob\u00e9lix in the \u201cAsterix\u201d films. He was prolific, omnipresent \u2014 messy, magnetic, and untouchable.",
      "But the excess was real off-screen too. He crashed his motorcycle while drunk, accepted a Russian passport from Vladimir Putin during a tax dispute, and once urinated in a plane aisle. He boasted of his appetites. France seemed to cheer them on.",
      "That myth \u2014 of the lovable brute \u2014 is now unraveling.",
      "In Hollywood, #MeToo toppled titans. In France, the movement was met with a wary eye. When #BalanceTonPorc (\u201cExpose Your Pig\u201d) emerged in 2017, it rattled the country\u2019s self-image \u2014 particularly in the arts, where seduction and transgression had long been celebrated.",
      "Some warned that #MeToo was killing romance. In 2018, screen legend Catherine Deneuve and 99 other prominent French women published an open letter in Le Monde, scolding the movement for going, in their words, \u201ctoo far.\u201d They championed la libert\u00e9 d\u2019importuner \u2014 \u201cthe freedom to bother\u201d \u2014 as a pillar of French life, defending the right of men to pursue women without fear of consequence. To many, it sounded less like a defense of flirtation than a permission slip for harassment, cloaked in perfume and nostalgia.",
      "Even President Emmanuel Macron echoed the sentiment. In Dec. 2023 \u2014 shortly after a documentary aired footage of Depardieu making sexually suggestive comments about a young girl in North Korea \u2014 Macron defended the actor on national television, condemning the backlash as a \u201cmanhunt.\u201d \u201cG\u00e9rard Depardieu makes France proud,\u201d he said.",
      "The remark sparked national outrage \u2014 not just for its timing, but for what it revealed: the instinct to protect cultural giants, no matter the cost.",
      "France\u2019s reluctance to confront sexual misconduct among its stars has long set it apart.",
      "Roman Polanski, convicted of statutory rape in the U.S. and accused by several other women, continues to work and live freely in France. In 2020, his C\u00e9sar Award win prompted walkouts \u2014 but also a standing ovation. There was little institutional pushback.",
      "In 2022, Johnny Depp was dropped from Disney's \u201cPirates of the Caribbean\u201d franchise after domestic abuse allegations by ex-wife Amber Heard ( he was largely vindicated ).",
      "Yet, in France, he was embraced.",
      "In 2023, he played Louis XV in \u201cJeanne du Barry\u201d, the opening film at the French Cannes Film Festival. French fashion house Dior not only kept him on as the face of its Sauvage fragrance \u2014 it reportedly signed him to a multiyear, seven-figure deal in 2022.",
      "Depardieu\u2019s trial isn\u2019t the only case shaking French cinema. In recent months, a string of high-profile convictions have suggested that the shield of fame may finally be cracking.",
      "In February, director Christophe Ruggia was convicted of sexually abusing actress Adele Haenel when she was a child.",
      "Actor-director Nicolas Bedos was sentenced in 2024 for sexual assault.",
      "The same year, actor-director Judith Godr\u00e8che testified before a parliamentary commission, accusing two renowned directors of exploiting her as a teenager. \u201cThis is not about desire,\u201d she told lawmakers. \u201cIt\u2019s about power. About silence. About a system that protects itself.\u201d",
      "That same commission has since summoned major actors \u2014 including Jean Dujardin of \u201cThe Artist\u201d fame. Some reportedly asked to testify behind closed doors.",
      "Anouk Grinberg, who appeared in \u201cLes Volets Verts,\u201d has publicly supported the two women accusing Depardieu. \u201cWhat I saw on set was not seduction,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was shameful.\u201d",
      "The case has become a national mirror \u2014 reflecting everything France has tolerated, denied, and excused.",
      "On the Parisian sidewalks, opinions still diverge. \u201cWe\u2019re losing our culture of flirtation,\u201d said Alain Morel, 62, sipping an espresso at a caf\u00e9 near the Arc de Triomphe. \u201cFlirting isn\u2019t a crime \u2014 it\u2019s part of who we are.\u201d",
      "But across the street, 28-year-old student Yasmine Bensalem shook her head. \u201cWe called it charm,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it was always about power.\u201d",
      "The trial continues. Depardieu, who has diabetes and heart disease, attends with medical accommodations. His lawyer claims the case is a political vendetta \u2014 a plot to \u201cmake Depardieu fall.\u201d",
      "But whether he is convicted or not, the deeper judgment is already underway.",
      "For decades, France\u2019s artists were seen as untouchable \u2014 their genius a shield. That shield is cracking. The myth is dying. And in its place, a question rises:",
      "Can France finally hold its most powerful men to account?",
      "This is not just the trial of Depardieu. This is the trial of a country \u2014 and whether its unfinished revolution will finish at last.",

      "WASHINGTON -- On a night when half a dozen people made jokes about this being the last-ever Mark Twain Prize, Conan O'Brien made sure the ceremony at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts ended on a high note.",
      "O\u2019Brien accepted the award for lifetime achievement in comedy Sunday night while acknowledging the backstage turmoil that hangs over the future of the cultural center in Washington.",
      "O\u2019Brien, 61, was named the 26th recipient of the Mark Twain Prize in mid-January, about three weeks before President Donald Trump upended the Kennedy Center by ousting longtime president Deborah Rutter and board chairman David Rubenstein. Trump dismissed the board of trustees and replaced them with loyalists, who then elected him as chairman.",
      "On Sunday, O'Brien specifically thanked Rubenstein and Rutter \u2014 drawing an extended round of applause \u2014 and also Kennedy Center staffers who, he said, were \u201cworried about what the future might bring.\u201d",
      "He said the example of Mark Twain's own life and career was particularly resonant at this moment in American history.",
      "\u201cTwain hated bullies. ... He punched up, not down, and he deeply empathized with the weak,\u201d O'Brien said. \u201cTwain loved America, but he knew it was deeply flawed.\u201d",
      "A Mark Twain impersonator then emerged from the audience. After a back-and-forth debate with O'Brien, he joined him on stage and the pair slow danced for a while. They were then joined by a dozen more Twain impersonators and previous Twain Prize recipient Adam Sandler for a raucous rendition of Neil Young\u2019s \u201cRockin in the Free World.\u201d",
      "That musical ending capped off a night when the uncertain fate of the Kennedy Center itself was woven through the multiple tributes and testimonials to O\u2019Brien.",
      "\u201cI think it would be insane not to address the elephant in the room,\u201d comic Nikki Glaser said on the red carpet before the ceremony. \u201cIt\u2019s in the air tonight. This night is about Conan, but it can be both.\u201d",
      "Once the festivities began, Stephen Colbert joked that the Kennedy Center had announced two new board members: Bashar Assad, the ousted president of Syria, and Skeletor, a fictional supervillain.",
      "John Mulaney quipped that the entire building would soon be renamed \u201cthe Roy Cohn Pavilion\u201d after one of Trump\u2019s mentors. And Sarah Silverman made multiple Trump jokes that were too vulgar to print.",
      "Trump, in announcing the Kennedy Center changes, posted on social media that those who were dismissed \"do not share our Vision for a Golden Age in Arts and Culture.\u201d",
      "How that vision takes shape remains to be seen, but Trump has spoken about wanting to book more Broadway shows there and floated the idea of granting Kennedy Center Honors status to actor Sylvester Stallone and singer-songwriter Paul Anka.",
      "Into this maelstrom stepped O'Brien, whose comedic persona has never been particularly political. The comic has always tended more toward goofiness and self-deprecation. But he has also leaned into sensitive societal issues at times. In 2011, O'Brien officiated a gay wedding live on his show, overseeing the marriage of his longtime costume designer Scott Cronick and his partner David Gorshein.",
      "O\u2019Brien vaulted into the spotlight from near-total obscurity in 1993 when he was chosen to replace David Letterman as host of \u201cLate Night\u201d despite no significant on-camera experience. The former Harvard Lampoon editor had spent the previous years as a writer for \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d and \u201cThe Simpsons,\u201d appearing on camera only as an occasional background extra in \u201cSNL\u201d skits.",
      "He went on to host \u201cLate Night\u201d for 16 years, longer than any other host. O'Brien was later tapped to replace Jay Leno as host of \u201cThe Tonight Show,\u201d but that experiment ended in public failure. After seven months of declining ratings, NBC executives brought Leno back for a new show that would bump \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d back. O\u2019Brien refused to accept the move, leading to a public spat that ended with a multimillion-dollar payout for O\u2019Brien and his staff to exit the network in early 2010.",
      "O'Brien went on to host another talk show on the cable station TBS, while launching successful podcasts and travel shows. He is currently on a late-career elder statesman hot streak. His travel series, \u201cConan O\u2019Brien Must Go,\u201d drew popular and critical acclaim, with a second season coming. His recent gig hosting the Academy Awards was so well received that the producers announced they are bringing him back next year.",
      "In the wake of Trump's takeover of the Kennedy Center, several artists, including the producers of \u201cHamilton\u201d and actress and writer Issa Rae, announced they were canceling appearances at the venue.",
      "Others have chosen to perform while making their sentiments known from the stage. Leftist comic W. Kamau Bell directly addressed the controversy in his performance just days after the shake-up. Earlier this month, cellist Erin Murphy Snedecor ended her set with a performance of the Woody Guthrie protest anthem \u201cAll You Fascists Bound to Lose.\u201d",
      "Other comedians receiving the lifetime achievement award include both Letterman and Leno, along with George Carlin, Whoopi Goldberg, Bob Newhart, Carol Burnett, Bill Murray and Dave Chappelle.",

      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- June Carter, Kenny Chesney and Tony Brown have been invited to join the Country Music Hall of Fame.",
      "The Country Music Association announced the new 2025 inductees on Tuesday in Nashville, Tennessee.",
      "Carter, the Grammy-winning member of one of country music\u2019s pioneering families and the wife of country giant Johnny Cash, joins as this year's veteran era artist. Chesney, who has won the CMA Awards entertainer of the year four times, joins as the modern era artist. And Brown, a Nashville producer who has supervised a wide array of best-selling hits by Vince Gill, Reba McEntire, George Strait and many others, will join the non-performer category.",
      "The three will be formally inducted during a ceremony in the fall.",
      "Tuesday's celebratory ceremony focused on their contributions to country music over the decades, highlighting their influence, even when they were overlooked at times.",
      "\u201cJohnny once said that his wife was one of the most neglected artists in country music,\u201d said country singer Vince Gill, who introduced the inductees. He said Cash worried that his wife's contributions would \u201cunder-recognized simply because she's my wife.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat changes as she takes her rightful place among family, friends and legends in the Country Music Hall of Fame,\u201d Gill said.",
      "Some of Carter's accomplishments include writing more than 100 songs, including co-writing \u201cRing of Fire,\u201d a top hit for Cash. The two married in 1968 and recorded several Grammy-award winning hits like \u201cJackson\u201d and \u201cIf I Were a Carpenter.\u201d",
      "But Carter had been singing since she was 10, long before marrying Cash. Her mother, Maybelle Carter, was in the Carter Family music act with her cousin Sara Carter and Sara\u2019s husband, A.P. Carter. The family act broke up, but mother and daughters June, Helen and Anita continued on as Mother Maybelle & the Carter Sisters, with little June playing autoharp.",
      "The Carters went on to become staples of the Grand Ole Opry country music show in Nashville.",
      "Carlene Carter described her mother as a \u201cforce of nature\u201d who was \u201canchored in love.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnything that\u2019s good about me is because of that mom,\u201d said Carlene Carter, who continued in the family business as a country singer and songwriter.",
      "Chesney, who grew up in eastern Tennessee, told the crowd on Tuesday that if someone had said he would one day be inducted into the same Hall of Fame class as June Carter Cash, he would have called it \u201cunbelievable.\u201d",
      "Chesney's career includes 16 platinum albums and more than 50 Top Ten country hits. After receiving a standing ovation, he said he was just hoping to spread love and positivity through his music.",
      "\u201dI had a really big dream and I\u2019m still pushing that dream as far as I can,\u201d Chesney said. \u201cI just wanted to record and write songs that reflected the lives of a lot of people that came to our shows.\"",
      "For Brown, getting the call about his induction into the Hall of Fame almost knocked him over. He called it one of the biggest accomplishments of his career.",
      "Every year, the Country Music Hall of Fame chooses just three inductees, one of which rotates between songwriters, recording/touring musicians and non-performers.",
      "Brown backed Elvis Presley until his death in 1977, then played with Emmylou Harris & The Hot Band, as well as Rodney Crowell & The Cherry Bombs. But he's being honored more for his production work, as president of MCA Nashville, with RCA Records and eventually as co-founder of Universal South Records.",
      "\u201cYou make records and you make some money, but this is better than money,\u201d Brown said. \u201cThis is about making an impact.\u201d",

      "The head of the U.N. AIDS agency says the sudden loss of American money has been \u201cdevastating\u201d for efforts to stop HIV and will cost many lives of the world\u2019s most vulnerable people",
      "GENEVA -- GENEVA (AP) \u2014",
      "The head of the U.N. AIDS agency said Monday that the sudden loss of American money has been \u201cdevastating\u201d for efforts to stop HIV and will cost many lives of the world\u2019s most vulnerable people. But she also proposed an \u201camazing deal\u201d for U.S. President Donald Trump that she said could result in \u201cthe end of AIDS.\u201d",
      "At a news briefing in Geneva, UNAIDS Executive Director Winnie Byanyima said that the deal would involve Trump enabling the U.S. company Gilead to produce and license its \u201cmagical\u201d prevention drug lenacapavir across the world to the millions of people who need it.",
      "Lenacapavir, sold as Sunlenca, has been shown through twice-yearly injections to completely prevent HIV infection in women and which works nearly as well in men.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump likes deals,\u201d Byanyimasaid, acknowledging that it was President George W. Bush who first started paying for the widespread roll-out of HIV drugs more than two decades ago.",
      "\u201cIt could be President Trump, another Republican president, who leads the prevention revolution towards the end of AIDS,\u201d Byanyima said.",
      "She added that the deal would result not only in profits for Gilead and create jobs for Americans, but save millions of lives in poorer countries.",
      "Byanyima said that American money made up about 35% of UNAIDS\u2019 core budget last year but it was unclear whether that might be restored for next year. She said the agency was in talks with the U.S. government but was also preparing for a worst-case scenario, in which there was no funding available from the U.S.",
      "Byanyima said it was unlikely any other donors would be able to fill that vacuum, adding that European donors have told the agency they would be cutting back on their support in order to redirect their funds to defense and other priorities.",
      "Byanyima said that unless support to HIV efforts is restored, there could be more than 6.3 million additional deaths in the next four years and an additional 2,000 people per day becoming infected.",
      "She acknowledged that there has been some valid criticism regarding how HIV aid has been delivered, calling it \u201can opportunity to rethink and develop more efficient ways of delivering life-saving support.\u201d",
      "Byanyima also said African countries were trying to become more self-sufficient and that even some of the poorest nations were now \u201ctrying to stretch very weak, fragile health systems to absorb people living with HIV.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was rocked by five high-level departures on Tuesday in the latest turmoil for the nation's top public health agency.",
      "The departures were announced at a meeting of agency senior leaders. The Atlanta-based CDC has two dozen centers and offices. The heads of five of them are stepping down, and that follows three other departures in recent weeks. This means close to a third of the agency\u2019s top management is leaving or left recently.",
      "The departures \u2014 described as retirements \u2014 were not announced publicly. The Associated Press confirmed the news with two CDC officials who were not authorized to discuss it and spoke on condition of anonymity.",
      "The announcements come a day after the White House announced it is nominating Susan Monarez to be CDC director. But it\u2019s not clear how much, if any, influence that had on the leaders\u2019 decision to leave. The Trump administration earlier this month withdrew its nomination of former Florida congressman Dr. David Weldon just before a Senate hearing.",
      "The latest departures include:",
      "\u2014 Leslie Ann Dauphin, who oversees the Public Health Infrastructure Center and its more than 500 employees. That center coordinates CDC funding, strategy, and technical assistance to state, local and territorial health departments.",
      "\u2014 Dr. Karen Remley, who heads the National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities. At the beginning of the year, the center had more than 220 full-time employees.",
      "\u2014 Sam Posner, who heads the Office of Science. More than 100 CDC employees work on research and science policy, and publish the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.",
      "\u2014 Debra Lubar, who runs the 65-person Office of Policy, Performance and Evaluation.",
      "\u2014 Leandris Liburd, head of the Office of Health Equity, with about 40 employees. Liburd took the role in 2020, as part of an effort to address the COVID-19 pandemic\u2019s disproportionate death toll on Black, Hispanic and Native Americans.",
      "Adding to that: Kevin Griffis, head of CDC communications, left last week. Robin Bailey, the agency\u2019s chief operating officer, left late last month. So did Dr. Nirav Shah, a former CDC principal deputy director who last year was the agency\u2019s primary voice about an evolving bird flu epidemic in animals that has also sickened at least 70 people in the U.S.",

      "As they spend their first Ramadan in their country in years, many Syrians who\u2019ve recently returned from abroad to a homeland they were forced to flee have been celebrating the end of the Assad family\u2019s rule",
      "DARAYA, Syria -- When Mariam Aabour learned of the ouster of Syrian leader Bashar Assad, she shed tears of joy. But as the time came to return to her homeland from Lebanon \u2013 where she fled years earlier \u2013 Aabour felt torn.",
      "She was happy about the homecoming, but sad to leave behind a son and a stepson who remained in Lebanon to work and pay off family debts. Months before her return, Aabour\u2019s father died in Syria without her seeing him. Her Syrian home has been destroyed and there\u2019s no money to rebuild, she said.",
      "Thus it\u2019s been bittersweet experiencing her first Ramadan \u2013 the Muslim holy month \u2013 since her return.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve all lost dear ones,\u201d she said. \u201cEven after our return, we still cry over the tragedies that we\u2019ve lived through.\u201d",
      "As they spend their first Ramadan in years in their homeland, many Syrians who\u2019ve recently trickled back in from abroad have been celebrating the end of the Assad family\u2019s rule in December after a fast-paced rebel offensive. They are relishing some new freedoms and savoring some old traces of the lives they once knew.",
      "They enjoy family reunions but many also face challenges as they adjust to a country ravaged by a prolonged civil war and now grappling with a complex transition. As they do, they grieve personal and communal losses: Killed and missing loved ones, their absence amplified during Ramadan. Destroyed or damaged homes. And family gatherings shattered by the exodus of millions.",
      "A time for daily fasting and heightened worship, Ramadan also often sees joyous get-togethers with relatives over food and juices.",
      "Aabour \u2013 one of the more than 370,000 Syrians the United Nations' refugee agency, UNHCR, says have returned to the country since Assad\u2019s ouster \u2013 delights in hearing the call to prayer from mosques signaling the end of the daily fast. In her Lebanon neighborhood, she said, there were no nearby mosques and she relied on phones to know when to break the fast.",
      "The hardest part, she added, is sitting for the fast-breaking meal known as \u201ciftar\u201d without some loved ones, including her father and a son, who she said was killed before the family fled Syria.",
      "She bitterly recalled how her child, who she said was about 10 when killed, liked a rice and peas dish for iftar and would energetically help her, carrying dishes from the kitchen.",
      "\u201cI used to tell him, \u2018You\u2019re too young,\u2019 but he would say, \u2018No, I want to help you,\u2019\u201d she said, sitting on the floor in her in-laws\u2019 house which her family now shares with relatives.",
      "Faraj al-Mashash, her husband, said he\u2019s not currently working, accumulating more debt and caring for an ill father.",
      "The family borrowed money to fix his father\u2019s home in Daraya. It was damaged and looted, but still standing.",
      "Many Daraya homes aren\u2019t.",
      "Part of Rural Damascus and known for its grapes and its furniture workshops, Daraya was one of the centers of the uprising against Assad. The conflict devolved into armed insurgency and civil war after Assad crushed what started as largely peaceful protests; this Ramadan, Syrians marked the 14th anniversary of the civil war\u2019s start.",
      "Daraya suffered killings and saw massive damage during fighting. It endured years of government besiegement and aerial campaigns before a deal was struck between the government and rebels in 2016 that resulted in the evacuation of fighters and civilians and control ceded to the government.",
      "Today, in parts of Daraya, children and others walk past walls with gaping holes in crumbling buildings. In some areas, a clothesline or bright-colored water tank provides glimpses of lives unfolding among ruins or charred walls.",
      "Despite it all, al-Mashash said, it\u2019s home.",
      "\u201cIsn\u2019t Daraya destroyed? But I feel like I am in heaven.\u201d",
      "Still, \u201cthere\u2019s sadness,\u201d he added. \u201cA place is only beautiful with its people in it. Buildings can be rebuilt, but when a person is gone, they don\u2019t come back.\u201d",
      "In Lebanon, al-Mashash struggled financially and was homesick for Daraya, for the familiar faces that used to greet him on its streets. Shortly after Assad\u2019s ouster, he returned.",
      "This Ramadan, he\u2019s re-lived some traditions, inviting people for iftar and getting invited, and praying at a mosque where he has cherished memories.",
      "Some of those who had left Daraya, and now returned to Syria, say their homes have been obliterated or are in no condition for them to stay there. Some of them are living elsewhere in an apartment complex that had previously housed Assad-era military officers and is now sheltering some families, mostly ones who've returned from internal displacement.",
      "The majority of those who've returned to Syria since Assad's removal came from countries in the region, including Lebanon, Jordan and Turkey, said Celine Schmitt, UNHCR\u2019s spokesperson in Syria.",
      "A main security fear for returnees is unexploded mines, Schmitt said, adding UNHCR provides \u201cmine awareness sessions\u201d in its community centers. It also offers legal awareness for those needing IDs, birth certificates or property documents and has provided free transportation for some who came from Jordan and Turkey, she said.",
      "The needs of returnees, so far a fraction of those who\u2019ve left, are varied and big \u2013 from work and basic services to house repairs or construction. Many, Schmitt said, hope for financial help to start a small business or rebuild, adding that more funding is needed.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re calling on all of our donors,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s an opportunity now to solve one of the biggest displacement crises in the world, because people want to go back.\u201d",
      "Many of those who haven't returned cite economic challenges and \u201cthe huge challenges they see in Syria\u201d as some of the reasons, she said.",
      "In January, U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi said living conditions in the country must improve for the return of Syrians to be sustainable.",
      "Umaya Moussa, also from Daraya, said she fled Syria to Lebanon in 2013, returning recently as a mother of four, two of whom had never seen Syria before.",
      "Moussa, 38, recalls, at one point, fleeing an area while pregnant and terrified, carrying her daughter and clutching her husband\u2019s hand. The horrors have haunted her.",
      "\u201cI\u2019d remember so many events that would leave me unable to sleep,\u201d she said. \u201cWhenever I closed my eyes, I would scream and cry and have nightmares.\u201d",
      "In Lebanon, she lived for a while in a camp, where she shared the kitchen and bathroom with others. \u201cWe were humiliated ..., but it was still better than the fear we\u2019ve lived through.\u201d",
      "She\u2019d yearned for the usual Ramadan family gatherings.",
      "For the first iftar this year, she broke her fast with her family, including brothers who, she said, as fighters against the Assad government, had previously moved to then rebel-controlled Idlib province.",
      "Missing from the Ramadan meal was her father who died while Moussa was away.",
      "Like Moussa, Saeed Kamel is intimately familiar with the pain of a joy incomplete. This Ramadan, he visited the grave of his mother who had died when he was in Lebanon.",
      "\u201cI told her that we\u2019ve returned but we didn\u2019t find her,\u201d he said, wiping away tears.",
      "And it wasn\u2019t just her. Kamel had been hopeful that with Assad gone, they would find a missing brother in his prisons; they didn\u2019t.",
      "Kamel had vowed never to return to a Syria ruled by Assad, saying he felt like a stranger in his country. His home, he said, was damaged and looted.",
      "But despite any difficulties, he held out hope. At least, he said, \u201cthe next generation will live with dignity, God willing.\u201d",
      "Kamel fondly recalled how \u2013 before their worlds changed \u2013 his family would exchange visits with others for most of Ramadan and neighbors would send each other iftar dishes.",
      "\u201cRamadan is not nice without the family gatherings,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, one can barely manage.\u201d",
      "He can\u2019t feel the same Ramadan spirit as before.",
      "\u201cThe good thing,\u201d he said, \u201cis that Ramadan came while we\u2019re liberated.\u201d",

      "Suspected U.S. airstrikes have pounded Yemen overnight",
      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Suspected U.S. airstrikes pounded Yemen overnight into Saturday, reportedly killing at least one person as the American military acknowledged earlier bombing a major military site in the heart of Sanaa controlled by the Houthi rebels.",
      "The full extent of the damage and possible casualties wasn\u2019t immediately clear. The attacks followed a night of airstrikes early Friday that appeared particularly intense compared to other days in the campaign that began March 15.",
      "An Associated Press review has found the new American operation under President Donald Trump appears more extensive than those under former President Joe Biden, as the U.S. moves from solely targeting launch sites to firing at ranking personnel as well as dropping bombs in cities.",
      "Meanwhile, satellite photos analyzed by the AP show a mysterious airstrip just off Yemen in a key maritime chokepoint now appears ready to accept flights and B-2 bombers within striking distance of the country Saturday.",
      "The strikes into Saturday targeted multiple areas in Yemen under the control of the Iranian-backed Houthis, including the capital, Sanaa, and in the governorates of al-Jawf and Saada, rebel-controlled media reported. The strikes in Saada killed one person and wounded four others, the Houthi-run SABA news agency said.",
      "SABA identified the person killed as a civilian. Houthi fighters and their allies often aren\u2019t in uniform. However, analysts believe the rebels may be undercounting the fatalities given the strikes have been targeting military and intelligence sites run by the rebels. Many of the strikes haven't been fully acknowledged by the Houthis \u2014 or the U.S. military \u2014 while the rebels also tightly control access on the ground.",
      "One strike early Friday, however, has been confirmed by the U.S. military's Central Command, which oversees its Mideast operations. It posted a black-and-white video early Saturday showing an airstrike targeting a site in Yemen. While it didn't identify the location, an AP analysis of the footage's details corresponds to a known strike Friday in Sanaa. The footage shows the bomb striking the military's general command headquarters held by the Houthis, something the rebels have not reported.",
      "The Houthi-controlled Telecommunications and Information Technology Ministry in Sanaa separately said U.S. strikes Friday destroyed \u201cbroadcasting stations, communication towers and the messaging network\u201d in Amran and Saada governorates. The strikes in Amran around the Jebel Aswad, or \u201cBlack Mountain,\u201d had appeared particularly intense.",
      "The new campaign of airstrikes, which the Houthis now say have killed at least 58 people, started after the rebels threatened to begin targeting \u201cIsraeli\u201d ships again over Israel blocking aid entering the Gaza Strip. The rebels in the past have had a loose definition of what constitutes an Israeli ship, meaning other vessels could be targeted as well.",
      "The Houthis had targeted over 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones, sinking two vessels and killing four sailors during their campaign targeting ships from November 2023 until January of this year. They also launched attacks targeting American warships, though none have been hit so far.",
      "The attacks greatly raised the Houthis\u2019 profile as they faced economic problems and launched a crackdown targeting any dissent and aid workers at home amid Yemen\u2019s decadelong stalemated war that has torn apart the Arab world\u2019s poorest nation.",
      "The Houthis have begun threatening both Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, two American allies in the region, over the U.S. strikes. That's even as the nations, which have sought a separate peace with the Houthis, have stayed out of the new U.S. airstrike campaign.",
      "An AP analysis of satellite photos from Saturday shows the American military has moved at least four long-range stealth B-2 bombers to Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean \u2014 a base far outside of the range of the rebels that avoids using allies\u2019 Mideast bases. Three had been earlier seen there this week.",
      "That means a fourth of all the nuclear-capable B-2s that America has in its arsenal are now deployed to the base. The Biden administration used the B-2 with conventional bombs against Houthi targets last year.",
      "The aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman has launched attacks from the Red Sea and the American military plans to bring the carrier USS Carl Vinson from Asia as well.",
      "Meanwhile, France said its sole aircraft carrier, the Charles de Gaulle, was in Djibouti, an East African nation on the Bab el-Mandeb Strait, which links the Red Sea to the Gulf of Aden. The French have shot down Houthi drones in the past, but they are not part of the American campaign there.",
      "Satellite images Friday from Planet Labs PBC show an airstrip now appears ready on Mayun Island, a volcanic outcropping in the center of the Bab el-Mandeb. The images showed the airstrip had been painted with the designation markings \u201c09\u201d and \u201c27\u201d to the airstrip\u2019s east and west respectively.",
      "A Saudi-led coalition battling the Houthis had acknowledged having \u201cequipment\u201d on Mayun, also known as Perim. However, air and sea traffic to Mayun has linked the construction to the UAE, which backs a secessionist force in Yemen known as the Southern Transitional Council.",
      "World powers have recognized the island\u2019s strategic location for hundreds of years, especially with the opening of the Suez Canal linking the Mediterranean and Red Seas.",
      "The work on Mayun follows the completion of a similar airstrip likely constructed by the UAE on Abd al-Kuri Island, which rises out of the Indian Ocean near the mouth of the Gulf of Aden.",

      "BEIJING -- France's foreign affairs minister said Friday that France and China are making progress toward resolving a trade dispute over cognac imports.",
      "Jean-Noel Barrot said the conclusions of a Chinese investigation that could potentially lead to the permanent implementation of provisional customs duties on European cognac imports have been delayed by three months, until June.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ll be really pleased when the problem is behind us. And it\u2019s clear that, step by step, we\u2019re moving towards a resolution,\" Barrot said.",
      "China announced last year provisional tariffs of 30.6% to 39% on Remy Martin and other European brandies after a majority of European Union countries approved duties on electric vehicles made in China.",
      "The brandy tariffs are provisional and require importers to make a deposit with the Chinese customs agency for the amount of the tariff. The move followed a preliminary finding by China\u2019s Commerce Ministry that European brandy was being dumped in China, threatening \u201csubstantial damage\u201d to domestic producers.",
      "\u201cThe risk faced by the industry until yesterday was that definitive application would be made at the end of the investigation period,\" Barrot said. \"Following this visit, I received confirmation that the investigation has been postponed by three months, which rules out the scenario of a sudden application of definitive duties on this sector.\u201d",
      "According to the sector, China is the largest consumer market for cognac by value. Experts said the imposition of definitive duties would affect 70,000 direct and indirect jobs, 270 cognac houses, and 4,400 winegrowers.",
      "China has opened a series of anti-dumping investigations into European brandy, pork and dairy products. The brandy probe was the first and targeted mainly French makers of cognac and similar spirits such as Armagnac.",
      "Barrot said the investigation will be closed after three months, and that the Chinese authorities will make decisions based on the results.",
      "\u201cEveryone will continue to work together to put this dispute behind us so that we can move forward on a sound basis,\u201d he said.",

      "The remote Queensland town of Julia Creek, population 500, is offering about double the salary a family physician would earn in the state\u2019s capital, Brisbane. The catch is that Brisbane is a 17-hour drive away. The closest major city, Townsville, is a seven-hour drive.",
      "Prospective applicants must embrace searing heat and tropical insects, too.",
      "But the town's outgoing medic, Dr. Adam Louws, says his replacement will also find a quieter pace of life and the chance to learn skills they\u2019ve never used before.",
      "Louws was recruited from Brisbane in 2022, when Julia Creek drew national headlines for offering a salary of AU$500,000.",
      "\u201cMy mother-in-law sent me a link to this news article saying, \u2018the half a million dollar job that no one wants,\u2019\u201d Louws said. \u201cMy first thought when I saw it and I looked at it was, where\u2019s Julia Creek?\u201d",
      "Julia Creek is a sweeping, romantic slice of the Australian Outback with wide-open spaces and orange sunsets. Kids play sports and ride horses. But it\u2019s remote \u2014 high school means boarding school in the city and the nearest hospital is nearly three hours\u2019 drive away.",
      "Before Louws arrived in 2022, the town hadn't had a permanent doctor for 15 years, with a roster of visiting physicians dropping in for short stays. It\u2019s a problem that has vexed rural towns in Australia and around the world for decades.",
      "Australia has a shortfall of general practitioners of 2,500 doctors across the country, according to a 2024 government report, with the shortage worst in rural areas and expected to grow. Attracting doctors to rural Australia is made harder by the eye-watering distances between the most remote settlements; the vast country is one of the world\u2019s least densely populated.",

In the United States, 65% of rural areas had a shortage of primary care physicians in 2023, official figures showed.",
      "For Janene Fegan, the mayor of McKinlay Shire \u2014 which includes Julia Creek \u2014 that meant the town needed a good sales pitch. Fegan was involved in the local health service\u2019s campaign that recruited Louws and offered to promote the town again when the job was advertised in March.",
      "\u201cWe actually have a very, very good lifestyle and a very safe lifestyle,\u201d she said. \u201cYes, there is distance to travel at times, but how many people do you hear now wanting to escape from that and go off-grid?\u201d",
      "The town was not, she added, literally off the grid: Julia Creek has electricity and broadband internet.",
      "\u201cYou don\u2019t have to stay forever,\u201d Fegan said. \u201cJust give it a shot.\u201d",
      "When the job was advertised in 2022, some health care analysts said the bolstered salary still wasn\u2019t enough to compensate for a solo doctor\u2019s workload.",
      "But Louws, the departing doctor, said working solo prompted him to learn medical skills that he would have sent patients \u201ctwo minutes down the road\u201d for another practitioner to perform when he lived in the city. He also fulfilled a childhood dream of learning to milk dairy cows.",
      "\u201cThe money is plenty. It is,\u201d Louws said. \u201cOne of the things that I think people don\u2019t necessarily consider enough about this job is the other things that this town has to offer.\u201d",
      "Louws applied for the job three days after first hearing about Julia Creek, following study on Wikipedia. Soon, he and his wife and four children were packing to move.",
      "When he\u2019d been in the job six months, Louws said, he knew \u201cnine out of 10\u201d people in the town by name. \u201cIt feels kind of like stepping back in time about 60-odd years,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone knows everyone.\u201d",
      "At the end of his two year contract in Julia Creek, however, the distance from his extended family had taken a toll and he plans to return to his practice in the city. Louws departs in May; applications for his post close Sunday.",
      "He's sorry to be leaving the \u201cincredible\u201d town.",
      "\u201cIt feels a lot closer,\" the doctor said. \"You get to really make a difference.\u201d",

      "\u201cIt was very disappointing for the family, because \u2014 well, a slap on the wrist for someone that\u2019s killed our mother,\u201d the son said. \u201cIt\u2019s very, very hard to process that.\u201d",

      "Hegseth spoke during a meeting with President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. in the Philippines, his first stop in his first trip to Asia to reaffirm Washington\u2019s \u201cironclad\u201d commitment to the region under Trump. Ahead of the visit, China called the United States a \u201cpredator\u201d and an unreliable ally.",
      "Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d foreign policy thrust has triggered concerns in Asia about the scale and depth of U.S. commitment to the region.",
      "Hegseth's decision to make the Philippines his first stop in Asia, followed by Japan \u2014 both U.S. treaty allies facing territorial disputes with China \u2014 was the strongest assurance yet by the U.S. under Trump to maintain a security presence in the region.",
      "\u201cDeterrence is necessary around the world but specifically in this region, in your country, considering the threats from the communist Chinese,\u201d Hegseth told Marcos. \u201cFriends need to stand shoulder to shoulder to deter conflict, to ensure that there is free navigation whether you call it the South China Sea or the West Philippine Sea.\u201d",
      "\"Peace through strength is a very real thing,\u201d Hegseth said. He praised the Philippines for standing \u201cvery firm\u201d to defend its interests in the contested waters.",
      "China claims virtually the entire South China Sea, a major security and global trade route. The Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Taiwan also have overlapping claims to the resource-rich and busy waters, but confrontations have spiked between Chinese and Philippine coast guard and naval forces in the last two years.",
      "Chinese forces have used powerful water cannons and dangerous maneuvers in the high seas to block what Beijing said were encroachments by Philippine ships into China's waters. Chinese military aircraft have also approached Philippine patrol planes at alarmingly close distance to drive them away from the Scarborough Shoal, a hotly disputed fishing atoll in the disputed waterway.",
      "Under the previous Biden administration, the U.S. has repeatedly warned that it is obligated to help defend the Philippines if Filipino forces, ships and aircraft come under an armed attack in the Pacific, including in the South China Sea.",
      "Hegseth echoed that pledge by expressing \u201cthe ironclad commitment\u201d of Trump and him \u201cto the Mutual Defense Treaty and to the partnership.\"",
      "Marcos told the U.S. defense chief that by visiting the Philippines first in Asia he \u201csends a very strong message of the commitment of both our countries to continue to work together to maintain the peace in the Indo-Pacific region, within the South China Sea.\"",
      "\"We have always understood the principle that the greatest force for peace in this part of the world would be the United States,\u201d Marcos said.",
      "Ahead of Hegseth\u2019s visit, Chinese Defense Ministry spokesperson Wu Qian said China opposes \u201cinterference from outside countries\u201d in the South China Sea.",
      "\"U.S.-Philippines military cooperation must not harm the security interests of other countries or undermine regional peace and stability,\u201d he said Thursday in a monthly news conference.",

      "Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun separately warned the Philippines in a news conference on Tuesday \u201cthat nothing good could come out of opening the door to a predator. Those who willingly serve as chess pieces will be deserted in the end.\"",
      "Hegseth\u2019s visit to the Philippines comes a month before the longtime treaty allies hold the \u201cBalikatan,\u201d Tagalog for shoulder to shoulder, their largest annual combat exercises that include live-fire drills.

      "U.S. Vice President JD Vance and his wife will be visiting an American military base in Greenland",
      "NUUK, Greenland -- U.S. Vice President JD Vance and his wife are due to visit an American military base in Greenland on Friday in a trip that was scaled back after an uproar among Greenlanders and Danes who were irked that the original itinerary was planned without consulting them.",
      "The couple's revised trip to the semi-autonomous Danish territory comes as relations between the U.S. and the Nordic country have soured after U.S. President Donald Trump repeatedly suggested that the United States should in some form control the mineral-rich territory of Denmark \u2014 a traditional U.S. ally and NATO member.",
      "Friday's one-day visit to the U.S. Space Force outpost at Pituffik, on the northwest coast of Greenland, has removed the risk of potentially violating diplomatic custom by sending a delegation to another country without an official invitation. It will also reduce the likelihood that Vance and his wife will cross paths with residents angered by Trump\u2019s annexation announcements.",
      "Ahead of the visit, four of the five parties elected to Greenland's parliament earlier this month agreed to form a new, broad-based coalition government, banding together to resist Trump's designs on the territory.",
      "Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said on Tuesday that the visit, which was originally set for three days, created \u201cunacceptable pressure.\" On Thursday she was cited by Danish public broadcaster DR as saying: \u201cWe really want to work with the Americans on defense and security in the kingdom. But Greenland belongs to the Greenlanders.\u201d",
      "Initially, Usha Vance had announced a solo trip to the Avannaata Qimussersu dogsled race in Sisimiut. Her husband then subsequently said he would join her on that trip, only to change that itinerary again \u2014 after protests from Greenland and Denmark \u2014 to a one-day visit of the couple to the military post only.",
      "Nonetheless, in an interview on Wednesday, Trump repeated his desire for U.S. control of Greenland. Asked if the people there were \u201ceager\u201d to become U.S. citizens, Trump said he didn\u2019t know \u201cbut I think we have to do it, and we have to convince them.\u201d",
      "Inhabitants of Greenland's capital, Nuuk \u2014 which is about 1,500 kilometers (930 miles) south of Pituffik \u2014 voiced concern about Vance's visit and the U.S. interest in their island.",
      "Cora H\u00f8y, 22, said Vance was \u201cwelcome if he wants to see it but of course Greenland is not for sale.\u201d She added that \u201cit\u2019s not normal around here\u201d with all the attention Greenland is getting. \"I feel now every day is about (Trump) and I just want to get away from it.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s all a bit crazy. Of course the population here is a bit shook up,\u201d said 30-year-old Inuk Kristensen. \"My opinion is the same as everyone\u2019s: Of course you don\u2019t do things this way. You don\u2019t just come here and say that you want to buy the place.\u201d",
      "As the nautical gateway to the Arctic and North Atlantic approaches to North America, Greenland has broader strategic value as both China and Russia seek access to its waterways and natural resources.",
      "During his first term, Trump floated the idea of purchasing the world\u2019s largest island, even as Denmark insisted it wasn\u2019t for sale. The people of Greenland also have firmly rejected Trump\u2019s plans.",
      "Vance has several times criticized long-standing European allies for relying on military support from the United States, openly antagonizing partners in ways that have generated concerns about the reliability of the U.S.",
      "Opponents of Trump's plans to control Greenland announced a rally in front of the American embassy in the Danish capital for Saturday, DR reported Thursday.",

      "PARIS -- The monthslong trial of former French President Nicolas Sarkozy over the alleged illegal financing of his 2007 presidential campaign is shedding light on France's back-channel talks with the government of then-Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi.",
      "Family members of terrorist attacks sponsored by Gadhafi's regime have told the court they suspect that Sarkozy was willing to sacrifice the memories of their loved ones in order to normalize ties with Libya almost two decades ago.",
      "French prosecutors on Thursday requested a seven-year prison sentence for the 70-year-old former leader. Sarkozy, who was president from 2007 to 2012, has denied all wrongdoing.",
      "The trial, which started in January, is to continue until April 8, with Sarkozy's lawyers to plead on the last day. The verdict is expected at a later date.",
      "Some key moments in the trial have focused on talks between France and Libya in the 2000s, when Gadhafi was seeking to restore diplomatic ties with the West. Before that, Libya was considered a pariah state for having sponsored attacks.",
      "French families of victims of a 1989 plane bombing told the court about their shock and sense of betrayal as the trial questioned whether promises possibly made to Gadhafi\u2019s government were part of the alleged corruption deal.",
      "In 1988, a bomb planted aboard a Pam Am flight exploded while the plane was over the Scottish town of Lockerbie, killing 270 people from 21 countries, including 190 Americans.",
      "The following year, on Sept. 19, 1989, the bombing of UTA flight 772 over Niger killed 170 people, including 54 French nationals on board, after an in-flight explosion caused by a suitcase bomb.",
      "Both French and U.S. investigations have tied both bombings to Libya, whose government had engaged in long-running hostilities with the U.S. and other Western governments.",
      "Now, families of victims are wondering whether French government officials close to Sarkozy promised to forget about the bombings in exchange for business opportunities with the oil-rich nation and possibly, an alleged corruption deal.",
      "\u201cWhat did they do with our dead?\u201d Nicoletta Diasio, the daughter of a man who died in the bombing, has told the court, saying she wondered if the memories of the victims \u201ccould have been used for bartering\u201d in talks between France and Libya.",
      "During the trial, Sarkozy has said he has \u201cnever ever betrayed\u201d families of victims. \u201cI have never traded their fate for any compromise, nor pact of realpolitik,\u201d he said.",
      "Libya was long a pariah state for its involvement in the 1980s bombings.",
      "In 2003, it took responsibility for both the 1988 and 1989 plane bombings and agreed to pay billions in compensation to the victims\u2019 families.",
      "Gadhafi also announced he was dismantling his nuclear weapons program, which led to the lifting of international sanctions against the country.",
      "Britain, France and other Western countries sought to restore a relationship with Libya for security, diplomatic and business purposes.",
      "In 2007, Sarkozy welcomed Gadhafi to Paris with honors for a five-day official visit, allowing him to set up a bedouin tent near the Elysee presidential palace. Many French people still remember that gesture, feeling Sarkozy went too far to please a dictator.",
      "Sarkozy said during the trial he would have preferred to \u201cdo without\u201d Gadhafi\u2019s visit at the time but it came as a diplomatic gesture after Libya\u2019s release of Bulgarian nurses who were imprisoned and facing death sentences for a crime they said they did not commit.",
      "On July 24, 2007, under an accord partially brokered by first lady Cecilia Sarkozy and EU officials, Libya released the five Bulgarian nurses and a Palestinian doctor.",
      "The medics, who had spent over eight years in prison, faced death sentence on charges they deliberately infected hundreds of children with the AIDS virus in the late 1990s \u2014 an allegation they denied.",
      "The release of the medics removed the last major obstacle to Libya\u2019s rejoining the international community.",
      "Sarkozy travelled to the capital, Tripoli, for talks with Gadhafi the day after the medics were returned to Bulgaria on a French presidential plane.",
      "In court has spoken of his \u201cpride to have saved those six persons.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf you did not discuss with Gadhafi, you\u2019d not get the release of the nurses,\u201d he said.",

      "An international arrest warrant was issued for him and five other suspects.",
      "Financial prosecutors have accused Sarkozy of having promised to lift the arrest warrant targeting al-Senoussi in exchange for alleged campaign financing.",
      "In 2005, people close to Sarkozy, who was at the time the interior minister, including his chief of staff Claude Gu\u00e9ant and junior minister Brice Hortefeux, travelled to Tripoli, where they met with al-Senoussi.",

      "Seif al-Islam sent RFI radio a two-page statement on his version of events. It was the first time he talked to the media about the case since 2011.",
      "He said Sarkozy initially \u201creceived $2.5 million from Libya to finance his electoral campaign\u201d during the 2007 presidential election, in return for which Sarkozy would \u201cconclude agreements and carry out projects in favour of Libya.\u201d",
      "He said a second payment of $2.5 million in cash was handed over without specifying when it was given.",
      "According to him, Libyan authorities expected that in return, Sarkozy would end a legal case about the 1989 UTA Flight 771 attack \u2014 including removing his name from an international warrant notice.",
      "Sarkozy strongly denied those allegations.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ll never find one Libyan euro, one Libyan cent in my campaign,\" he said at the opening of the trial in January. \u201cThere\u2019s no corruption money because there was no corruption.\"",
      "The Libyan civil war started in February 2011, with army units and militiamen loyal to Gadhafi opposing rebels.",
      "Sarkozy was the first Western leader to take a public stance to support the rebellion.",

      "Officials say the most destructive wildfires ever to hit South Korea are almost contained",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- SEOUL, South Korea (AP) \u2014 The most destructive wildfires ever to hit South Korea were almost contained, authorities announced Friday, after rain and cooler temperatures helped fire crew put out the blazes that have killed 28 people and razed vast swaths of land since last week.",
      "In a televised briefing, Korea Forest Service chief Lim Sang-seop said that all main fires at four of the hardest-hit areas in the southeast have been fully contained.",
      "The forest service\u2019s website shows efforts to extinguish the wildfires remain at only one place as of Friday afternoon. The government\u2019s disaster response team earlier said that wildfires at other sites have been put out.",
      "\u201cAs we've completed works to contain main fires, we're turning into a system to deal with small fires,\u201d Lim said. \u201cThere are still dangers of breakouts of another wildfires so we won't loosen our vigilance and will make all-out efforts to prevent them.\u201d",
      "The raging inferno, fueled by windy and dry conditions, has destroyed thousands of houses, factories, vehicles and other structures since last Friday, while mountains and hills were stripped to a carpet of smoldering ashes. But light rain that began Thursday night and subsequent cooler weather have helped fire-fighting efforts.",
      "\u201cHazes have been diminished because of the rain last night, so that\u2019s favorable for securing visibility. Also temperatures are now lower than the last few days, so things are very favorable to put out the wildfires,\u201d Lim said in an earlier briefing Friday.",
      "Authorities mobilized about 9,000 people, 125 helicopters and hundreds of other vehicles Friday to battle the wildfires.",
      "Firefighters \u2014 many in their 60s, a reflection of one of the world\u2019s fastest-aging populations \u2014 navigated forests in yellow helmets and red protective suits, spraying suppressants at flames that flickered near their feet. Helicopters dropped buckets of water over hills that glowed red in the night.",
      "Residents hunkered down in temporary shelters in places like schools and gyms, but the fire crept dangerously close to some of them too. A video shared by one evacuee shows blazes approaching a school soccer field under a sky choked with smoke.",
      "\u201cI just kept crying this morning,\u201d said 79-year-old Seo Jae Tak, an evacuee at a gym in Andong city, on Thursday. \u201cWhen I went back yesterday, the entire mountain had turned to ashes. It\u2019s just unbelievable, I can\u2019t even put it into words. All I can do is cry.\u201d",
      "The wildfires have burned 47,860 hectares (118,265 acres) of land, forced more than 30,000 people to flee their homes and injured 37 others since last Friday. Officials said Friday that 8,000 residents remained at temporary shelters.",
      "While it's hard to link any one event to climate change, officials and experts say that it is making wildfires more likely and more severe. Scientists have already warned the warming atmosphere around the world is driving ever more extreme weather events, including deadly wildfires, flooding, droughts, hurricanes and heat waves that are causing billions of dollars in damage every year.",
      "\u201cWe must completely overhaul our wildfire response strategy in the face of extreme climate conditions,\u201d said Lee Cheol-woo, governor of North Gyeongsang Province.",
      "Lee noted that the past week has shown how wildfires can quickly overwhelm the country's resources. He said he would request that the government establish better evacuation guidelines, adopt more powerful firefighting tools including aircraft equipped with water cannons, and adopt other approaches to improve firefighting efforts during nighttime hours.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t have the equipment for firefighting at night,\u201d Lee said. \u201cIn the night, firefighting is done solely with manual efforts, but with the increased density of our forests compared to the past, it\u2019s difficult to manage with just that.\u201d",
      "The people killed were mostly in their 60s or older. They include a pilot whose helicopter crashed during efforts to contain a fire Wednesday and four firefighters and other workers who died earlier after being trapped by fast-moving flames. Officials say older people found it difficult to evacuate quickly but have not provided details of the civilian dead.",
      "In Uiseong, the fires damaged about 20 of the 30 structures at the Gounsa temple complex, said to have been originally built in the 7th century. Among them were two state-designated \u201ctreasures\u201d: a pavilion overlooking a stream that dates to 1668, and a Joseon dynasty structure built in 1904 to mark the longevity of a king.",

      "While much of the violence has been unleashed by gangs who formed a coalition last year known as \u201c Viv Ansamn,\u201d a growing number of people are being killed by self-defense groups and mobs, including at least 77 suspected gang members slain in November after gunmen tried to attack a community in the Port-au-Prince capital, the report stated.",

A second officer, identified by Haiti\u2019s government as Benedict Kabiru, is considered dead after he went missing when gangs attacked his group on Monday as they tried to rescue Haitian police stuck in a ditch that officials believe was dug on purpose by gunmen.",

      "LONDON -- British Steel said Thursday that it is planning to close its two blast furnaces and steelmaking operations in the northern England town of Scunthorpe, after its Chinese owner Jingye failed to agree a rescue package with the U.K. government.",
      "Unions called on the government to help secure the future of the company, which Jingye said is suffering daily losses of around 700,000 pounds ($900,000) despite the Chinese firm investing more than 1.2 billion to maintain operations since its takeover of British Steel in 2020.",
      "The company, Britain's second-biggest steelmaker, blamed \u201chighly challenging market conditions, the imposition of tariffs, and higher environmental costs relating to the production of high-carbon steel.\u201d",
      "British Steel said it is consulting with unions over the the decision to close the blast furnaces and steelmaking operations and reduce rolling mill capacity, potentially as early as June. Between 2,000 to 2,700 jobs are potentially at risk.",
      "The company had sought support from the government for a major capital investment in two new electric arc furnaces, which would emit far less carbon into the atmosphere, but no agreement was reached after months of negotiations.",
      "Unions published a report last month setting out how to decarbonize steelmaking at British Steel, which would involve the continued operation of Scunthorpe\u2019s two existing blast furnaces while two new electric ones constructed on site. The plan would require an additional 200 million pounds of government support to mitigate carbon costs in the interim period.",
      "\u201cThis is a dark day for our steel industry and for our country,\" said Roy Rickhuss, the general secretary of the Community union. \u201cThe closures at Scunthorpe would represent a hammer blow to communities which were built on steel, and where the industry still supports thousands of jobs directly and thousands more through extensive supply chains.\"",
      "Rickhuss urged Jingye and the government to get back to the negotiating table and said the Chinese company \u201chave not ruled out\" retaining the blast furnaces during a transition if they can win government backing.",

      "At its height in the postwar period, British steelmaking was a global leader, employing more than 300,000 people, before cheaper offerings from China and other countries hit production. It now employs about 40,000 directly, with the industry accounting for just 0.1% of the British economy.",

      "French President Emmanuel Macron is hosting the leaders of nearly 30 countries plus NATO and European Union chiefs. The summit comes at a crucial juncture in the more than three-year war, with intensifying diplomatic efforts to broker ceasefires, driven by pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to end the fighting.",
      "But the conflict is raging on. Russian drone attacks overnight before the leaders met in the luxury of the French presidential palace injured more than 20 people, Ukrainian officials said.",
      "U.S.-brokered agreements this week to safeguard shipping in the Black Sea and halt long-range strikes on energy infrastructure were greeted as a first step toward peace.

      "Building a force big enough to act as a credible deterrent \u2014 British officials have talked about possibly 10,000 to 30,000 troops \u2014 would also be a considerable effort for nations that shrank their militaries after the Cold War but are now rearming. There would also be questions to resolve about who would command the force and how it might respond to a major violation by Russia of any peace agreement.",
      "The office of U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who's driving the European initiative together with Macron, said military planners from Europe and beyond have been drilling down into details of how such a force might be put together, examining \u201cthe full range of European military capabilities including aircraft, tanks, troops, intelligence and logistics.\u201d",
      "In the face of enduring pressure from Trump on European nations to increase military spending and rely less on U.S. forces, dating back to his first presidency, the proposed contingent is also seen as a test of Europe\u2019s ability to defend itself and its interests.",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy posted a picture from inside the summit of him and other leaders standing together with the caption: \u201cEurope knows how to defend itself. We must prove it.\u201d",
      "Macron said Wednesday that the proposed European force could deploy to \u201cimportant towns, strategic bases\u201d in Ukraine and that it could \u201crespond\u201d to a Russian attack if Moscow launched one.",
      "Macron didn\u2019t specify what sort of response he envisaged. But he suggested that a Russian attack might not go unanswered, even though the European troops wouldn't be deployed to the frontlines.",
      "\u201cIf there was again a generalized aggression against Ukrainian soil, these armies would, in fact, be under attack and then it\u2019s our usual framework of engagement,\u201d Macron said. \u201cOur soldiers, when they are engaged and deployed, are there to react and respond to the decisions of the commander in chief and, if they are in a conflict situation, to respond to it.",
      "\u201cSo we are not on the frontlines, we don\u2019t go to fight, but we are there to guarantee a lasting peace. It\u2019s a pacifist approach,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only ones who would, at that moment, trigger a conflict, a bellicose situation, would be the Russians if they decided again to launch an aggression.\u201d",
      "As ceasefire efforts gather steam, Ukraine's allies in Europe are working to strengthen Kyiv's hand militarily. Their aim is to enable it to keep fighting until any broad peace takes hold and also to turn the Ukrainian army into the first line of defense against any future Russian aggression.",
      "Macron announced a new package of defense aid for Ukraine that he said was worth 2 billion euros ($2.15 billion) and will include light tanks, air defense and anti-tank missiles and other weaponry and support.",
      "Russian drone attacks overnight injured at least 18 people in the Kharkiv region and three people in Dnipro, officials said. Shelling in a frontline community in the Zaporizhzhia region knocked out electricity and phone coverage, regional head Ivan Fedorov said on Telegram.",
      "Zelenskyy said the attacks were further evidence that the U.S. and Europe should not ease sanctions on Moscow.",

      "The 30-year-old hotel was shut following inspections conducted after the Grand Kartal Hotel fire in nearby Bolu province in January, Halk TV and other outlets reported.",

      "Bozbey said the fire began in the cafeteria. The fire in Bolu also started in the hotel dining area. The state-run Anadolu news agency on Wednesday reported fresh arrests relating to the Bolu fire, taking the number of people in detention awaiting trial to 28.",

    "story": [
      "If you know or suspect you can\u2019t pay the taxes you owe this tax season, you should still file a return with that information, or file for an extension",
      "NEW YORK -- If you know or suspect you can't pay the taxes you owe this tax season, you should still file a return with that information or file for an extension. That's the top piece of advice that tax professionals want you to know.",
      "\u201cThe IRS wants to work with you,\u201d said Tom O\u2019Saben, director of tax content and government relations at the National Association of Tax Professionals. \u201cBut if you're asking the IRS for some help, they have to know something about you. So the first thing is to have that return filed. The number one takeaway is that owing money is not a reason not to file.\u201d",
      "If you don't file a return or ask for an extension, then interest and penalties begin to accrue immediately. Those costs are largely avoidable if you share the information about your circumstances with the IRS in a timely way. Filing a return without paying taxes owed in full is preferable to not filing.",
      "To be clear, if you don't pay all the taxes you owe by the April 15 filing deadline, interest will accrue even if you've been granted an extension to October, but that interest will be more manageable than fees that add up when you pay no taxes at all.",
      "\u201cThe worst case scenario is that you don\u2019t file and end up being liable for penalties later on,\u201d said Emily DiVito, senior advisor for economic policy at the nonprofit Groundwork Collaborative and former U.S. Treasury advisor. \u201cThat\u2019s not good for anyone. But there are opportunities to ask for extensions and to go on payment plans.\u201d",
      "Here's what to know:",
      "In addition to tacking on interest and penalties, the IRS can eventually garnish your wages, place a lien on your property, or even place a hold on your passport. But if you file for an extension, or if you file your return with your financial information, you can avoid these consequences. Even if you don't have the money to pay what you owe in full by April 15, paying just a small part when you file.",
      "Yes. Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) sites across the country are staffed with volunteers who will help you file a return or arrange for an extension for free. These volunteers can help you set up an installment payment plan of as many as 72 months to pay off any owed taxes. The IRS Direct File program is also free to use.",
      "\u201cWhile the question mark when you go to click the button to pay can be intimidating, we want to make sure that taxpayers get the money you\u2019re owed, too,\u201d said DiVito. \u201cMost taxpayers \u2014 certainly most working taxpayers \u2014 get money back. But the way that a lot of the tax credits function, you only get that refund if you file your taxes in the first place.\u201d",
      "If you've experienced unusual hardship, and you share that with the IRS, the IRS can sometimes put your account in \u201ccurrently-not-collectible\u201d status. To do that, you share information about your income and living expenses, and the IRS determines if you qualify.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s say you\u2019ve been ill, and you lost your job from illness, and you have serious medical bills. You\u2019ve had all the bad luck, and things happened outside of your control, and you need some relief,\u201d said O\u2019Saben. \u201cThen the IRS can place you in uncollectable status. But all of this requires conversation and communication. No one wants to admit they\u2019re having economic problems, but the IRS will work with you if you do.\u201d",
      "There are also rare circumstances in which the IRS will settle your tax debt for less than the amount owed, called an \u201coffer in compromise.\u201d VITA tax professionals can also help you see if you're eligible, or you can use a free IRS tool online.",
      "That's OK. Start now.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been doing taxes for more than 35 years,\u201d said O'Saben. \u201cThe number one reason people don't file is that they have a feeling they may owe \u2014 which could be wrong \u2014 and they don\u2019t want to face it. But it's not a problem that's going to go away. So tell the IRS the truth of the situation. And they will work with you.\u201d",
      "Miklos Ringbauer, a CPA and tax professional in California, echoed this.",
      "\u201cIt's perfectly okay,\u201d he said. \u201cThe IRS deals with every single taxpayer. They have dealt with this before. There's nothing they haven't seen.\u201d",

      "Months after a lightning insurgency ended over half a century of the Assad dynasty\u2019s rule in Syria, the Islamist interim government has been struggling to fix battered infrastructure after a 14-year conflict decimated much of the country. Severe electricity shortages continue to plague the war-torn country.",
      "The United Nations estimates that 90% of Syrians live in poverty and the Syrian government has only been able to provide about two hours of electricity every day. Millions of Syrians, like Al-Ahmad and her family, can\u2019t afford to pay hefty fees for private generator services or install solar panels.",
      "Syria's new authorities under interim leader Ahmad Al-Sharaa have tried to ease the country's electricity crisis, but have been unable to stop the outages with patchwork solutions.",
      "Even with a recent gas deal with Qatar and an agreement with Kurdish-led authorities that will give them access to Syria's oil fields, the country spends most of its days with virtually no power. Reports of oil shipments coming from Russia, a key military and political ally of Assad, shows the desperation.",
      "At Al-Ahmad\u2019s home, she and her husband were only able to get a small battery that could power some lights.",
      "\u201cThe battery we have is small and its charge runs out quickly,\u201d said Al-Ahmad, 37. It\u2019s just enough that her children can huddle in the living room to finish their homework after school.",
      "And the family is not alone. Everywhere in Syria, from Damascus to Daraa in the south, neighborhoods turn pitch black once the sun sets, lit only from street lamps, mosque minarets and car headlights.",
      "The downfall of Assad in December brought rare hope to Syrians. But the new interim authorities have scrambled to establish control across the country and convince Western nations to lift economic sanctions to make its economy viable again.",
      "The United States in January eased some restrictions for six months, authorizing some energy-related transactions. But it doesn\u2019t appear to have made a significant difference on the ground just yet.",
      "Washington and other Western governments face a delicate balance with Syria\u2019s new authorities, and appear to be keen on lifting restrictions only if the war-torn country\u2019s political transition is democratic and inclusive of Syrian civil society, women and non-Sunni Muslim communities.",
      "Some minority groups have been concerned about the new authorities, especially incidents of revenge attacks targeting the Alawite community during a counter-offensive against an insurgency of Assad loyalists.",
      "Fixing Syria\u2019s damaged power plants and oil fields takes time, so Damascus is racing to get as much fuel as it can to produce more energy.",
      "Damascus is now looking towards the northeastern provinces, where its oil fields under Kurdish-led authorities are to boost its capacity, especially after reaching a landmark ceasefire deal with them.",
      "Political economist Karam Shaar said 85% of the country\u2019s oil production is based in those areas, and Syria once exported crude oil in exchange for refined oil to boost local production, though the fields are battered and bruised from years of conflict.",
      "These crucial oil fields fell into the hands of the extremist Islamic State group, which carved out a so-called caliphate across large swaths of Syria and Iraq from 2014 to 2017.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s during that period where much of the damage to the (oil) sector happened,\u201d said Shaar, highlighting intense airstrikes and fighting against the group by a U.S.-led international coalition.",
      "After IS fell, the U.S.-backed Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces took control of key fields, leaving them away from the central government in Damascus. The new authorities hope to resolve this in a landmark deal with the SDF signed earlier this month.",
      "Kamran Omar, who oversees oil production in the Rmeilan oil fields in the northeastern city of Hassakeh, says shortages in equipment and supplies and clashes that persisted with Turkey and Turkish-backed forces have slowed down production, but told the AP that some of that production will eventually go to households and factories in other parts of Syria.",
      "The fields only produce a fraction of what they once did. The Rmeilan field sends just 15,000 of the approximately 100,000 barrels they produce to other parts of Syria to ease some of the burden on the state.",
      "The authorities in Damascus also hope that a recent deal with Qatar that would supply them with gas through Jordan to a major plant south of the capital will be the first of more agreements.",
      "Syria's authorities have not acknowledged reports of Russia sending oil shipments to the country. Moscow once aided Assad in the conflict against armed Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham that toppled the former president, but this shows that they are willing to stock up on fuel from whoever is offering.",
      "Interim Electricity Minister Omar Shaqrouq admitted in a news conference that bringing back electricity to Syrian homes 24 hours a day is not on the horizon.",
      "\u201cIt will soon be four hours, but maybe some more in the coming days.\u201d",
      "Increasing that supply will be critical for the battered country, which hopes to ease the economic woes of millions and bring about calm and stability. Shaar, who has visited and met with Syria\u2019s new authorities, says that the focus on trying to bring fuel in the absence of funding for major infrastructural overhauls is the best Damascus can do given how critical the situation is.",
      "\u201cElectricity is the cornerstone of economic recovery,\u201d said Shaar. \u201cWithout electricity you can\u2019t have a productive sector, (or any) meaningful industries.\u201d",

      "BEIJING -- In an address to major global business leaders, Chinese President Xi Jinping urged foreign investors to have faith in China\u2019s business prospects, the latest move to revive the world\u2019s second-largest economy that has been dragged down by a property bust and a loss of momentum.",
      "\u201cChina has always been and will certainly be an ideal, safe and promising investment destination for foreign investors,\u201d Xi told executives, including Akio Toyoda, chairman of Toyota, Lee Jae-yong, chairman of Samsung Electronics and Stephen Allen Schwarzman, CEO of investment firm Blackstone.",
      "China remains a major exporter of products to countries around the world and boasts a domestic market of 1.4 billion people. However, massive overbuilding in the property sector has tied up trillions of dollars in capital, sapping business and consumer confidence and depriving the economy of its past vitality, while a tariff war unleashed by the U.S. is compounding those problems.",
      "Private businesses, which provide a large share of growth and jobs in the country\u2019s state-dominated economy, have borne much of the burden after years of regulatory crackdowns have shaken the confidence of entrepreneurs and other investors.",
      "China's unprecedentedly tough response to the COVID-19 outbreak also shut down business for much of three years and some sectors of the economy have yet to recover, particularly where global supply chains are involved.",
      "Yet, Xi, considered something a sceptic when it comes to inviting in overseas businesses, said foreign investors could have confidence that \u201cthe door of opening up will only open wider and wider. The policy of utilizing foreign investment has not changed and will not change,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cChina contains huge investment and consumption potential,\u201d he added.",
      "China has set an economic growth target of about 5% for this year, the same as last year and a level that analysts said would be difficult to achieve.",
      "The government has said it would attempt to stimulate the roughly $20 trillion economy by borrowing more money for a slew of initiatives, such as giving 300 billion yuan ($41.3 billion) in rebates to consumers who trade in old cars and appliances for new ones. But much of the borrowing will go to supporting the housing market and local governments weighed down by debt.",
      "What is clear is that a trade war with the United States has left the outlook for the coming months uncertain. Trump has raised tariffs on imports from China twice since taking office in January, leaving them at 20% across-the-board. China has shown no sign of backing down, retaliating with tariffs on U.S. goods.",
      "Xi did not mention the tariffs directly, but appeared to be referring to the importance of stable trade terms by saying: \u201cBlowing out other people\u2019s lights will not make your own lights brighter. Blocking other people\u2019s paths will eventually block your own paths.\u201d",
      "For now, however, China is seeking to portray itself as \u201can ideal, safe and promising investment destination for foreign investors,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cGoing with China is going with opportunities. Believing in China is believing in tomorrow. Investing in China is investing in the future,\u201d the president, who has made himself leader for life and also heads the ruling Communist Party, said.",

      "Family members of terrorist attacks sponsored by Gadhafi's regime have told the court they suspect that Sarkozy was willing to sacrifice the memories of their loved ones in order to normalize ties with Libya almost two decades ago.",
      "French prosecutors on Thursday requested a seven-year prison sentence for the 70-year-old former leader. Sarkozy, who was president from 2007 to 2012, has denied all wrongdoing.",
      "The trial, which started in January, is to continue until April 8, with Sarkozy's lawyers to plead on the last day. The verdict is expected at a later date.",
      "Some key moments in the trial have focused on talks between France and Libya in the 2000s, when Gadhafi was seeking to restore diplomatic ties with the West. Before that, Libya was considered a pariah state for having sponsored attacks.",
      "French families of victims of a 1989 plane bombing told the court about their shock and sense of betrayal as the trial questioned whether promises possibly made to Gadhafi\u2019s government were part of the alleged corruption deal.",

      "The following year, on Sept. 19, 1989, the bombing of UTA flight 772 over Niger killed 170 people, including 54 French nationals on board, after an in-flight explosion caused by a suitcase bomb.",
      "Both French and U.S. investigations have tied both bombings to Libya, whose government had engaged in long-running hostilities with the U.S. and other Western governments.",
      "Now, families of victims are wondering whether French government officials close to Sarkozy promised to forget about the bombings in exchange for business opportunities with the oil-rich nation and possibly, an alleged corruption deal.",

      "During the trial, Sarkozy has said he has \u201cnever ever betrayed\u201d families of victims. \u201cI have never traded their fate for any compromise, nor pact of realpolitik,\u201d he said.",
      "Libya was long a pariah state for its involvement in the 1980s bombings.",
      "In 2003, it took responsibility for both the 1988 and 1989 plane bombings and agreed to pay billions in compensation to the victims\u2019 families.",

      "Britain, France and other Western countries sought to restore a relationship with Libya for security, diplomatic and business purposes.",
      "In 2007, Sarkozy welcomed Gadhafi to Paris with honors for a five-day official visit, allowing him to set up a bedouin tent near the Elysee presidential palace. Many French people still remember that gesture, feeling Sarkozy went too far to please a dictator.",
      "Sarkozy said during the trial he would have preferred to \u201cdo without\u201d Gadhafi\u2019s visit at the time but it came as a diplomatic gesture after Libya\u2019s release of Bulgarian nurses who were imprisoned and facing death sentences for a crime they said they did not commit.",
      "On July 24, 2007, under an accord partially brokered by first lady Cecilia Sarkozy and EU officials, Libya released the five Bulgarian nurses and a Palestinian doctor.",

      "He said his father was a civic-minded architect who would often use a quote by 20th century American-German architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe \u2014 \u201cGod is in the details.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe cared deeply about those details and making something beautiful,\u201d Nicholas Childs said. \u201cBut he also wanted to make sure, I think as any great architect, that it was a balance of form and function, that it worked for people.\u201d",
      "The 1,776-foot-tall (540-meter-tall) One World Trade Center, once known as the Freedom Tower, is the centerpiece of the redevelopment of ground zero, along with the memorial pools placed where the Twin Towers stood. Opened in 2014, it sports a steel and glass structure that rises into the sky with a tapered, eight-triangle body, topped by a 408-foot-tall (124-meter-tall) needle.",
      "The final design was produced after contentious negotiations between Childs and Daniel Libeskind, who designed the overall plan for the site, and arguments between government officials over what should be built at ground zero and objections by some relatives of 9/11 victims to the design of the Trade Center memorial.",
      "Libeskind had drawn the first plans for building, a twisting glass skyscraper with an off-center spire meant to invoke the Statue of Liberty.",
      "Childs produced a sleeker version of Libeskind\u2019s design, then reworked it after police expressed concerns that the building was not sturdy enough to withstand a truck bomb.",
      "In announcing the new design plans, Childs said the One World Trade Center tower is \u201ciconic, simple and pure in its form, a memorable form that will reclaim the resilience and the spirit of our democracy.\u201d",
      "He also called it \u201cthe safest building in the world,\u201d with features including wider staircases, a separate stairway and elevator for firefighters, \u201cblast-resistant glazing\u201d and more public stairways with direct access to the street.",
      "Childs was born in Princeton, New Jersey, in 1941 and grew up in his early childhood years in Washington, D.C., before moving to Mount Kisco, New York. He attended the private Deerfield Academy in Deerfield, Massachusetts, before going to Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, where he earned a bachelor's degree and a master's degree in architecture.",
      "He was hired by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill in 1971 for its Washington, D.C., office, where he worked on projects including a new master plan for the National Mall, the Constitution Gardens park along the mall and the Four Seasons Hotel.",
      "He transferred to the firm's New York City office in 1984 and had a hand in significant projects in the city, including 1 Worldwide Plaza in the Hell's Kitchen section of Manhattan and the Deutsche Bank Center, formerly called the Time Warner Center, with its twin skyscraper towers at Columbus Circle.",
      "Childs also worked on the U.S. embassy in Ottawa, Canada, the Canary Wharf development in London and King Abdulaziz International Airport in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.",
      "In 2004, he was honored with a Rome Prize for architecture, awarded by the American Academy in Rome for innovative work in the arts and humanities.",
      "Childs is survived by his wife, Annie; three children, Nicholas, Joshua and Jocelyn; and several grandchildren.",
      "The family is planning a small, private memorial in the coming weeks, followed by a larger service around May, Nicholas Childs said.",

      "LONDON -- A badly damaged cargo ship which collided with a U.S. tanker in the North Sea earlier this month arrived in the Scottish port of Aberdeen Friday, following a fire that lasted for nearly a week.",
      "Following a tug-assisted journey that lasted a few days, the Portugal-flagged Solong docked in Aberdeen for \u201csafe berthing\u201d and damage assessment.",
      "The damage to the ship following its collision on March 10 with an anchored tanker, the MV Stena Immaculate, and the ensuing fire, was clearly visible from the shore. The tanker was transporting jet fuel for the U.S. military in the North Sea.",
      "\u201cSalvage of the Solong has progressed to enable its relocation to the Port of Aberdeen for safe berthing,\" said chief coastguard Paddy O\u2019Callaghan. \u201cThe Stena Immaculate remains in a stable condition with salvage ongoing.\u201d",

      "U.K. authorities have said there is nothing to indicate the collision was connected to national security, but investigations are ongoing.",
      "Fortunately, the environmental damage from the collision was far less than first thought, though thousands of pellets used in plastics production, known as nurdles, from the ruptured containers on the Solong have begun washing up on beaches in the east of England.",
      "According to conservationists, the nurdles are not toxic but can harm animals if ingested.",

      "The Metals Company in Vancouver, Canada said late Thursday that it is seeking permission from the U.S. government to start deep-sea mining in international waters, potentially bypassing the International Seabed Authority, which has the power to authorize exploitation permits but has yet to do so.",
      "\u201cIt would be a major breach of international law\u2026if the U.S. were to grant it,\u201d said Duncan Currie, an international and environmental lawyer and legal adviser to the Deep Sea Conservation Coalition, a Netherlands-based alliance of environmental groups.",

      "U.S. states are positioning themselves to compete for newer, cheaper nuclear reactors being developed as communities and tech giants compete in a race for electricity",
      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- With the promise of newer, cheaper nuclear power on the horizon, U.S. states are vying to position themselves to build and supply the industry's next generation as policymakers consider expanding subsidies and paving over regulatory obstacles.",
      "Advanced reactor designs from competing firms are filling up the federal government's regulatory pipeline as the industry touts them as a reliable, climate-friendly way to meet electricity demands from tech giants desperate to power their fast-growing artificial intelligence platforms.",
      "The reactors could be operational as early as 2030, giving states a short runway to roll out the red carpet, and they face lingering public skepticism about safety and growing competition from renewables like wind and solar. Still, the reactors have high-level federal support, and utilities across the U.S. are working to incorporate the energy source into their portfolios.",
      "Last year, 25 states passed legislation to support advanced nuclear energy and this year lawmakers have introduced over 200 bills supportive of nuclear energy, said Marc Nichol of the Nuclear Energy Institute, a trade association whose members include power plant owners, universities and labor unions.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve seen states taking action at ever-increasing levels for the past few years now,\u201d Nichol said in an interview.",
      "Smaller reactors are, in theory, faster to build and easier to site than conventional reactors. They could be factory-built from standard parts and are touted as flexible enough to plunk down for a single customer, like a data center or an industrial complex.",
      "Advanced reactors, called small modular reactors and microreactors, produce a fraction of the energy produced by the conventional nuclear reactors built around the world for the last 50 years. Where conventional reactors produce 800 to 1,000 megawatts, or enough to power about half a million homes, modular reactors produce 300 megawatts or less and microreactors produce no more than 20 megawatts.",
      "Tech giants Amazon and Google are investing in nuclear reactors to get the power they need, as states compete with Big Tech, and each other, in a race for electricity.",
      "For some state officials, nuclear is a carbon-free source of electricity that helps them meet greenhouse gas-reduction goals. Others see it as an always-on power source to replace an accelerating wave of retiring coal-fired power plants.",
      "Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee last month proposed more than $90 million to help subsidize a Tennessee Valley Authority project to install several small reactors, boost research and attract nuclear tech firms.",
      "Long a proponent of the TVA's nuclear project, Lee also launched Tennessee's Nuclear Energy Fund in 2023, designed to attract a supply chain, including a multibillion-dollar uranium enrichment plant billed as the state's biggest-ever industrial investment.",
      "In Utah, where Gov. Spencer Cox announced \u201cOperation Gigawatt\u201d to double the state's electricity generation in a decade, the Republican wants to spend $20 million to prepare sites for nuclear. State Senate President J. Stuart Adams told colleagues when he opened the chamber's 2025 session that Utah needs to be the \u201cnation\u2019s nuclear hub.\"",
      "Texas Gov. Greg Abbott declared his state is \u201cready to be No. 1 in advanced nuclear power\" as Texas lawmakers consider billions in nuclear power incentives.",
      "Michigan lawmakers are considering millions of dollars in incentives to develop and use the reactors, as well as train a nuclear industry workforce.",
      "One state over, Indiana lawmakers this month passed legislation to let utilities more quickly seek reimbursement for the cost to build a modular reactor, undoing a decades-old prohibition designed to protect ratepayers from bloated, inefficient or, worse, aborted power projects.",
      "In Arizona, lawmakers are considering a utility-backed bill to relax environmental regulations if a utility builds a reactor at the site of a large industrial power user or a retired coal-fired power plant.",
      "Still, the devices face an uncertain future.",
      "No modular reactors are operating in the U.S. and a project to build the first, this one in Idaho, was terminated in 2023, despite getting federal aid.",
      "The U.S. Department of Energy last year, under then-President Joe Biden, estimated the U.S. will need an additional 200 gigawatts of new nuclear capacity to keep pace with future power demands and reach net-zero emissions of planet-warming greenhouse gases by 2050 to avoid the worst effects of climate change.",
      "The U.S. currently has just under 100 gigawatts of nuclear power operating. More than 30 advanced nuclear projects are under consideration or planned to be in operation by the early 2030s, Nichol of the NEI said, but those would supply just a fraction of the 200 gigawatt goal.",
      "Work to produce a modular reactor has drawn billions of dollars in federal subsidies, loan guarantees and more recently tax credits signed into law by Biden.",
      "Those have been critical to the nuclear industry, which expects them to survive under President Donald Trump, whose administration it sees as a supporter.",
      "The U.S. remains without a long-term solution for storing radioactive waste, safety regulators are under pressure from Congress to approve designs and there are serious questions about industry claims that the smaller reactors are efficient, safe and reliable, said Edwin Lyman, director of nuclear power safety at the Union of Concerned Scientists.",
      "Plus, Lyman said, \u201cthe likelihood that those are going to be deployable and instantly 100% reliable right out of the gate is just not consistent with the history of nuclear power development. And so it\u2019s a much riskier bet.\u201d",
      "Nuclear also has competition from renewable energies.",
      "Brendan Kochunas, an assistant professor of nuclear engineering at the University of Michigan, said advanced reactors may have a short window to succeed, given the regulatory scrutiny they undergo and the advances in energy storage technologies to make wind and solar power more reliable.",
      "Those storage technologies could develop faster, bring down renewables' cost and, ultimately, make more economic sense than nuclear, Kochunas said.",
      "The supply chain for building reactors is another question.",
      "The U.S. lacks high-quality concrete- and steel-fabrication design skills necessary to manufacture a nuclear power plant, Kochunas said.",
      "That introduces the prospect of higher costs and longer timelines, he said. While foreign suppliers could help, there also is the fuel to consider.",

      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Charlie Javice, the charismatic founder of a startup company that claimed to be revolutionizing the way college students apply for financial aid, was convicted on Friday of defrauding one of the largest U.S. banks, JPMorgan Chase, out of $175 million by exaggerating her customer base by 10 times.",
      "A jury in New York City returned its verdict after a five-week trial. Javice, 32, faces the possibility of a lengthy prison term.",
      "Javice was in her mid-20s when she founded Frank, a company with software that promised to simplify the process of filling out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, a complex government form used by students to apply for aid for college or graduate school.",
      "The company promoted itself as a way for financially needy students to obtain more aid faster, in return for a few hundred dollars in fees. Javice appeared regularly on cable news programs to boost Frank\u2019s profile, once appearing on Forbes\u2019 \u201c30 Under 30\u201d list before JPMorgan bought the startup in 2021.",
      "JPMorgan executives testified that she told them she had over four million clients and would have about 10 million by year\u2019s end, but it turned out there were only about 300,000 customers.",
      "Javice\u2019s lawyer, Jose Baez, told the jury that JPMorgan knew what it was getting in the deal, and made up the fraud allegations due to buyer\u2019s remorse after government regulatory changes made the data it received in the deal useless to its hopes of gaining new young customers.",

      "NEW YORK -- The Voice of America can\u2019t be silenced just yet.",
      "A federal judge on Friday halted the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to dismantle the eight-decade-old U.S. government-funded international news service, calling the move a \u201cclassic case of arbitrary and capricious decision making.\u201d",
      "Judge James Paul Oetken blocked the U.S. Agency for Global Media, which runs Voice of America, from firing more than 1,200 journalists, engineers and other staff that it sidelined two weeks ago in the wake of President Donald Trump ordered its funding slashed.",
      "Oetken issued a temporary restraining order barring the agency from \u201cany further attempt to terminate, reduce-in-force, place on leave, or furlough\u201d employees or contractors, and from closing any offices or requiring overseas employees to return to the U.S.",
      "The order also bars the Agency for Global Media from terminating grant funding for its other broadcast outlets, including Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Radio Free Asia and Radio Free Afghanistan. The agency said Thursday it was restoring Radio Free Europe\u2019s funding after a judge in Washington, D.C. ordered it to do so.",

      "At a hearing Friday in Manhattan, Oetken faulted the Trump administration for \u201ctaking a sledgehammer to an agency that has been statutorily authorized and funded by Congress.\u201d",
      "The judge criticized the agency\u2019s leadership, including special adviser Kari Lake, for pulling the plug \u201cseemingly overnight\u201d on the U.S. government\u2019s global, soft-power megaphone with \u201cno consideration of the effects.\u201d",
      "Oetken ruled after a coalition of Voice of America journalists, labor unions and the nonprofit journalism advocacy group Reporters Without Borders sued the Trump administration last week to block the cuts. Ultimately, they seek to have VOA return to the air.",
      "The plaintiffs argued the shutdown violated a court\u2019s finding during Trump\u2019s first term that VOA journalists have a free-speech firewall protecting them from White House interference. Their absence from the airwaves has left a vacuum that\u2019s being filled by \u201cpropagandists whose messages will monopolize global airwaves,\u201d the plaintiffs said.",
      "Trump and other Republicans have accused Voice of America of a \u201cleftist bias\u201d and failing to project \u201cpro-American\u201d values to its worldwide audience, even though it is mandated by congress to serve as a non-partisan news organization.",
      "Voice of America went off the air soon after Trump issued an executive order on March 14 that pared funding to the Agency for Global Media and six other unrelated federal entities \u2014 part of his campaign to shrink government and align its with his political agenda.",
      "The White House called the service \u201cThe Voice of Radical America\u201d and said Trump\u2019s order would \u201censure that taxpayers are no longer on the hook for radical propaganda.\u201d It cited coverage it said was \u201ctoo favorable\u201d to former President Joe Biden, as well as stories about white privilege, racial profiling and transgender migrants seeking asylum.",

      "Three federal lawsuits in Washington, D.C. are challenging other aspects of the cuts, including one brought by Voice of America\u2019s director and three journalists. Oetken said he\u2019ll rule at a later date on the government\u2019s request to move his case there.",
      "Voice of America has operated since World War II, beaming news into authoritarian countries that don\u2019t have a free press. It began as a counterpoint to Nazi propaganda and played a prominent role in the U.S. government\u2019s Cold War efforts to curb the spread of communism.",
      "According to the lawsuit, Voice of America employees were told to finish their live broadcasts on March 15, then vacate the building. Soon after, the lawsuit said, they lost access to agency computer systems, including email. Voice of America\u2019s news website hasn\u2019t been updated since.",

      "Biosolids, or sewage sludge, are the solid byproducts of the wastewater treatment process. Rich in nutrients, they can be used as fertilizer on agricultural fields or compost on lawns.",
      "But the process for producing these materials can vary greatly, and some unwanted things can end up in those biosolids. A recent study released by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency suggested that human health risks associated with toxic per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) were elevated in some places where sludge was applied to farm fields.",
      "The amount of these \u201cforever chemicals\u201d that could end up in biosolids depends on how much were in the water coming into the plant.",
      "\u201cThey are very widespread,\u201d said Carsten Prasse, an assistant professor at Johns Hopkins University who studies biosolids. But they're not in all biosolids and sometimes it's only in small amounts, he added.",
      "Here's how they're made:",
      "At most treatment plants, wastewater is pumped in through large pipes and large debris removal begins immediately. At a facility just outside Columbus, Ohio, a machine screens out large debris such as toilet paper and trash. That debris is collected, compacted and taken to a landfill for disposal.",
      "After large debris is removed, the wastewater flows into a sedimentation tank, a large, open-air and cone-shaped tank where gravity pulls heavier solids to the bottom. A long mechanical arm corrals floating solids into a drain on the top of the tank. A similar arm at the bottom of the tank gathers up the solids there.",
      "The liquid is moved from the sedimentation tanks to an aeration tank where air encourages the growth of microbes that further break down organic particles. The wastewater then gets moved back to another sedimentation tank where more solids are removed.",
      "The solids that are removed at each step of the process are put through thickening centrifuges, then go into these tanks for anaerobic digestion, where microbes continue breaking down organic matter. The tanks are heated to a prescribed temperature for a certain number of days to kill off most pathogens.",
      "After another thickening step, the solids are ready to apply to farm fields based on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's regulations for land-applied biosolids.",
      "\u201cThere are values in using biosolids in agriculture because of their high nutrient concentrations,\u201d including nitrogen and phosphorus, Prasse said. They can also help strengthen soil and help with irrigation, he added.",
      "Some treatment facilities further dry out sludge, turning it into a dirt-like material that can emit steam as microbes do their work in decomposition.",
      "The waste that make up biosolids can vary widely depending on what\u2019s in the water. In addition to human waste, biosolids might contain all kinds of everyday household chemicals like beauty products and pharmaceuticals, some of which may contain forever chemicals, Prasse added. At the Columbus facility, the majority of their waste comes from households and businesses.",
      "The Columbus facility tests the final product for metals and nutrients such as phosphorus and nitrogen every month even when they are being stored before land application.",
      "In Columbus, the city takes half of these dirt-like biosolids to a composting facility nearby, where they are mixed with other organic material like trees and leaves and turned into compost after an additional round of heating and aeration to further kill off pathogens. These biosolids are less regulated and can be used on land such as parks or a residential yard.",
      "The Columbus facility, like most such operations, doesn't test the incoming material for PFAS, an expensive proposition. Dixon said any future testing or treatment of wastewater for PFAS at his facility would depend on future federal regulations.",

      "BEIRUT -- Lebanon appointed asset manager Karim Souaid to the post of central bank governor Thursday as the government tries to reform the economy after months of war and decades of mismanagement and corruption.",
      "The country's economy has been in crisis for five years and desperately needs reforms to unlock international aid, and on top of that, Israel\u2019s 14-month war with Hezbollah caused what the World Bank estimates was $11 billion in damages and economic losses.",
      "The appointment was announced by Prime Minister Nawaf Salam, the International Court of Justice jurist who was named Lebanon\u2019s premier in January following the election of President Joseph Aoun earlier that month.",
      "Salam said that Souaid was chosen by more than two-thirds of the 24 members of Lebanon's reformist Cabinet, though the prime minister said he himself did not support the decision. \u201cThe Lebanese have asked us for reforms and we insist on reforms,\u201d Salam told reporters after the government meeting.",
      "Souaid, an asset manager who previously was a senior executive at HSBC bank, is seen by critics as being sympathetic to the stance on economic reform taken by the country's banks, and fear he might sell what\u2019s left of Lebanon\u2019s state assets to bail them out.",
      "An unproductive economy and decades of corruption by Lebanon\u2019s political and financial leaders that drained state resources eventually led to a run on the banks in 2019. Covid-19, the massive Beirut Port blast in August 2020 and the monthlong Israel-Hezbollah war furthered compounded the country\u2019s economic woes.",
      "Lebanon has been running on a cash economy, with most of its electricity coming from private suppliers, leading to inflation and pulling almost half the population into poverty, according to the World Bank.",
      "The country has struggled to reach an International Monetary Fund-approved deal to unlock aid to make the economy viable again, with the international financial institution asking Lebanon to end waste, crack down on corruption and financial crimes, and restructure its banking sector.",
      "Lebanon\u2019s commercial banks have been hesitant to implement some of these reforms, as it would burden them with the country\u2019s tens of billions of dollars in economic losses, experts and activists say. The banks believe the state should carry most of that burden, blaming them for defaulting on paying back the state\u2019s massive debt in 2020 and for its wasteful spending.",
      "Souaid had the backing of President Aoun, while Salam and a handful of ministers have remained skeptical of him.",
      "\u201cKarim Souaid was not my candidate and I abstained with some ministers because of my concerns regarding the rights of depositors,\u201d Salam told reporters after the Cabinet meeting, referring to concerns that large amounts of bank deposits might not be given back to depositors. \u201cHe will have to abide by the financial policy of our reformist Cabinet.\u201d",
      "Souaid succeeds Riad Salameh, the embattled former governor of 30 years whose term ended with several international corruption cases lodged against him and for embezzlement and other financial crimes. Salameh was appointed in 1993, when Lebanon was scrambling to bounce back after a 15-year civil war.",
      "Salameh, who is currently in detention, was heralded as a financial genius for preventing hyperinflation and keeping the Lebanese currency stable through years of political tensions and conflict, and then left his post widely perceived as a key architect of the country\u2019s financial downfall.",

      "The anti-abortion groups are taking aim at abortion providers under an initiative called Defund Planned Parenthood, which targets federal Medicaid funding for the reproductive health care provider.",
      "\u201cThis event begins an intensive round of outreach to the GOP, calling on them to take advantage of this unique moment to defund the abortion industry,\u201d Students for Life, the national anti-abortion group organizing the event, said in a statement.",
      "The Hyde Amendment already restricts government funding for most abortions, and less than 5% of the services Planned Parenthood provides are abortions, according to the organization\u2019s 2023 report. Planned Parenthood also provides other forms of reproductive health care, including contraception, treatment for sexually transmitted infections and cancer screenings, often for low-income patients.",

      "\u201cWe should be expanding health care to low-income people rather than trying to kick off these people who rely on us for health care,\u201d Ringer said.",
      "Rachel Rebouche, dean of Temple University's Beasley School of Law in Philadelphia, said the Defund Planned Parenthood movement has been building for 10 years but has gained momentum as the anti-abortion movement has been emboldened by Trump\u2019s presidential victory and by his fellow Republicans winning control of Congress in November.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re seeing more enthusiasm in states like South Carolina and others to close down Planned Parenthood under the banner of stopping abortions, which their laws already do,\" she said.",
      "The Supreme Court announced it would hear a case involving South Carolina's attempt to strip Medicaid funding for Planned Parenthood. Experts say the lawsuit could prompt similar efforts in conservative states across the country to chip away at the organization's funding.",
      "Almost 100 conservative members of Congress signed an amicus brief urging the Supreme Court to side with South Carolina. The state already bans abortion after six weeks of pregnancy, before many people know they're pregnant.",
      "In February, a panel of judges in the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals reversed a lower court ruling that attempted to force Planned Parenthood to repay millions of dollars of Medicaid funding in Texas and Louisiana.",
      "If the Supreme Court sides with South Carolina, Rebouche said, there may be a wider impact on health care by \"giving states broad power to exclude health care that is unpopular or politically disfavored,\u201d such as contraception. Targeting Planned Parenthood might also have a negative effect on maternal and infant mortality rates and could cost more money in the long run by cutting off low-income patients from vital preventive reproductive health care, she said.",
      "During a 2015 push to strip Planned Parenthood funding, the Congressional Budget Office estimated that doing so would cost the government $130 million over 10 years.",
      "Meanwhile, lawmakers in at least three states \u2014 Missouri, Ohio and South Carolina \u2014 have introduced bills this year aiming to create tax breaks for anti-abortion centers.",
      "The strategies come during a time when abortion rights advocates are warning that Trump and his Cabinet hold significant power to restrict medication abortion access nationwide.",
      "Rather than immediately heeding calls from anti-abortion allies to restrict Medicaid funding for clinics that provide abortions, Trump has made quieter moves after waffling on the issue on the campaign trail.",
      "Trump reinstated a policy that requires foreign nongovernmental agencies to certify that they don\u2019t provide or promote abortion if they receive U.S. aid for family planning assistance. He also pardoned several anti-abortion activists convicted of blockading abortion clinics and used wording related to fetal personhood in an executive order rolling back protections for transgender people.",
      "The Republican president has appointed abortion opponents in some key Cabinet positions that could affect the availability of medication abortion and contraception, Medicaid coverage for family planning services, collection of abortion-related data and abortion access for troops and veterans.",
      "Advocates on either side of the abortion debate are waiting to see if Trump's Department of Justice will revive the Comstock Act, a 19th-century obscenity law, to restrict the mailing of medication abortion or other materials used for abortions. Attorney General Pam Bondi has a history of defending abortion restrictions, and her confirmation was celebrated by abortion opponents.",

      "Both Homendy and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said earlier this month when NTSB first disclosed the shocking statistics that they were angry that the FAA didn't recognize the dangers before this crash after 85 near misses in the past three years when aircraft flew within a few hundred feet (meters) of each other.",
      "The FAA promptly launched a review of all its data after the NTSB briefing to try to identify any similar safety threats, particularly in eight cities with heavy helicopter traffic. The FAA said Wednesday that analysis continues.",
      "That review \u2014 aided by artificial intelligence and machine learning \u2014 is focused on airports in Boston, New York, Baltimore-Washington, Detroit, Chicago, Dallas, Houston and Los Angeles and the heavy helicopter traffic off the Gulf Coast. The FAA hasn't said whether it has found anything yet, but the agency promised it \u201cwill have corrective action plans for any risks that are identified.\u201d",
      "In the meantime, the FAA quickly adopted the NTSB's recommendation to permanently close off a particular helicopter route near Reagan anytime planes are taking off or landing on the airport's runway 33 that the jetliner was approaching in January when the collision happened. If a helicopter does need to use that route for an urgent reason, no planes will be allowed to take off or land. That should ensure that planes and helicopters are no longer sharing the same airspace near the airport, officials said.",
      "\u201cThe FAA will continue to closely support the NTSB-led investigation and take action as necessary to ensure public safety,\u201d the agency said in a statement.",
      "Homendy declined Wednesday to address President Donald Trump's comments right after the crash suggesting that diversity and inclusion policies at the FAA may have contributed to it because the NTSB investigation isn't complete. A final report identifying the cause isn't expected for more than year. Trump also faulted the helicopter for flying too high and later suggested that an \u201cobsolete\u201d air traffic control system was the problem.",
      "New Jersey Democrat Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman said it is important to refute those diversity comments now because nothing has been found so far to support them, and she doesn't want the public to get the idea that diversity is the problem.",
      "\u201cOn the contrary, loyalty and sycophants seems to be the order of the day, and it\u2019s definitely negatively impacting this federal government doing its job,\u201d Watson Coleman said during the hearing.",
      "Federal officials have been raising concerns about an overtaxed and understaffed air traffic control system for years, especially after a series of close calls at airports.",
      "The NTSB previously said the helicopter may have had inaccurate altitude readings in the moments before the crash, and the crew may not have heard key instructions from air traffic controllers. The helicopter was at 278 feet (85 meters) at the time of the collision, which would put it above its 200-foot (61-meter) limit for that location.",
      "The collision was the deadliest plane crash in the U.S. since 2001, when a jet slammed into a New York City neighborhood just after takeoff, killing all 260 people on board and five more on the ground.",

      "TOKYO -- Brazilian President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva swiped Thursday at U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to raise U.S. tariffs on a wide range of products, saying Trump should consider the potential harm to the American and global economies.",
      "Lula made the comments while wrapping up a 4-day visit to Japan, where Trump's decision Wednesday to order 25% tariffs on all car imports came as a severe blow given the country's status as a major auto exporter and American ally. The U.S. is the biggest destination for Japanese car exports.",
      "\u201cI am very concerned about the behavior of the American government,\u201d Lula said. \u201cI am concerned because free trade is being harmed and I am concerned because multilateralism is weakened,\u201d Lula said through an interpreter.",
      "Lula said he foresees no positive outcome from Trump's policy of raising tariffs given that they will raise prices for American consumers, adding to inflation and leading to higher interest rates that might stifle economic growth.",
      "He added that Trump is president only of the United States, not the world, and that \u201cthis protectionism does not help any country in the world.\u201d",
      "Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba reiterated he wants Japan to be exempt from such tariffs.",
      "\u201cWe must consider appropriate responses, and naturally we will consider all options\u201d including possibly taking countermeasures, Ishiba told a parliamentary session Thursday. \u201cThe bottom line is, we must consider what will best serve Japan's national interest.\u201d",
      "He and Lula on Wednesday agreed to step up partnerships between Japan and Brazil in the areas of the economy, trade and security.",
      "As Trump\u2019s tariff threats have triggered tensions and vows of retaliation from Canada, Mexico, China and Europe, Japan has been working to firm up ties with other countries.",
      "Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said Trump's decision on auto tariffs was \u201cextremely regrettable.\u201d Japan strongly has urged it be exempt.",
      "Brazil is the top steel exporter to the United States. Lula said it was considering filing complaints to the World Trade Organization and might impose reciprocal tariffs.",
      "But Brazil is not near the top of Trump's list for trade retaliation since the U.S., its second-largest trading partner, exports more than it imports from there.",
      "The U.S. trade surplus with Brazil was $7.4 billion in 2024, nearly a 32% increase over a year earlier. Brazil's top exports to the U.S. were petroleum and iron and steel. Its biggest imports from the U.S. were crude and refined oil, gas turbines, aircraft, chemical and machinery.",

      "The new 25% import tax announced by President Donald Trump on Wednesday \u201cwill hurt global automakers and US manufacturing at the same time,\" the European Automobile Manufacturers' association said in a statement.",

      "Europe's carmakers already face a shrunken domestic market and new competition from cheaper Chinese electric vehicles. Any trouble in the auto industry would weigh on European economy that did not grow at all in the last quarter of 2024 and just 0.9% for the entire year.",
      "The most exposed are German and Italian carmakers since 24% of German and 30% of Italian non-EU exports go to the U.S.. Germany is home to major automakers such as Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz and BMW.",
      "\u201cThis would deliver a substantial blow to a sector that not only sustains millions of jobs but also contributes to a large proportion of the bloc's GDP,\u201d wrote analyst Clarissa Hahn at Oxford Economics. She estimated a decline in German exports of 7.1% and a fall of 6.6% for Italian ones.",
      "U.S. carmakers are less exposed to possible retaliation because they export only 2% of their production to the EU. Still, shares of Detroit's Ford and General Motors tumbled sharply before the opening bell in the U.S. Thursday because the U.S. industry relies heavily on cross-board trade by suppliers.",
      "\u201cThe EU and the US must engage in dialogue to find an immediate resolution to avert tariffs and the damaging consequences of a trade war,\u201d the European manufacturers' association said.",
      "German auto association head M\u00fcller called for immediate negotiations between the EU and U.S. on a bilateral agreement that would offer \u201ca forum to discuss the various tariff and non-tariff barriers for automobile products and could lead to a more balanced approach.\u201d",

      "Betts couldn't keep any food down when he was feeling his worst and initially not knowing what was wrong added to his stress.",

      "\u201cThe pressure was kind of off,\u201d Betts said. \u201cWe were going to get another at-bat with Freddie (Freeman) there and we all know what Freddie does in those type of situations. It was just kind of relax, if you do, cool, if you don\u2019t that\u2019s OK.\u201d",

      "SAN DIEGO -- Fernando Tatis Jr. hit a leadoff homer and Jake Cronenworth hit a go-ahead shot leading off the eighth inning to give the San Diego Padres a 4-3 win against the Atlanta Braves on Friday night.",
      "Cronenworth drove the second pitch from Dylan Lee (0-1) several rows into the right field seats.",
      "Tatis, who has batted leadoff in the first two games, homered to left-center on Reynaldo L\u00f3pez's first pitch. It was Tatis\u2019 12th career leadoff homer, extending his club record.",
      "Jarred Kelenic homered for the Braves in this rematch of last season\u2019s wild-card playoff series won by the Padres in a two-game sweep.",
      "The Padres went ahead twice and the Braves tied it each time.",

      "With Marcell Ozuna on third base and two outs in the sixth, Baldwin hit a comebacker that appeared to hit Padres reliever Adrian Morejon on the backside. The right-hander recovered, fielded the ball and threw to first to keep the game tied at 3. He smiled as he walked to the dugout.",

      "Freshman Tahaad Pettiford and senior Denver Jones turned in dazzling performances when it mattered most, rallying top-seeded Auburn to a 78-65 victory over Michigan in the Sweet 16 of the NCAA Tournament",
      "ATLANTA -- With Auburn's season on the brink, Tahaad Pettiford and Denver Jones suddenly became unstoppable.",
      "On to the Elite Eight for the top overall seed in the NCAA Tournament.",
      "Pettitford and Jones scored 20 points apiece to lead a second-half barrage that rallied the Tigers to a 78-65 victory over Michigan in the Sweet 16 on Friday night.",
      "The Tigers (31-5) wiped out a nine-point deficit, outscoring No. 5 seed Michigan 39-17 over the final 12 1/2 minutes to advance to the Elite Eight for only the third time in school history. They also became the fourth Southeastern Conference team to reach a regional final, with the SEC joining the Atlantic Coast Conference (2016) and Big East (2009) as the only leagues to do that.",
      "\u201cJust the kids\u2019 will to win,\u201d Auburn coach Bruce Pearl said. \u201cDenver got heated up. Tahaad got heated up. We went to them, and they delivered.\u201d",
      "Auburn will face Michigan State in the South Region final on Sunday, with a trip to the Final Four on the line. The Spartans held off Mississippi 73-70 in the first game of the night in Atlanta.",
      "Johni Broome scored 22 points to go along with 16 rebounds, but it was Pettiford, a freshman, and Jones, a senior, who took control when Auburn needed them most.",
      "The Wolverines (27-10) built their biggest lead, 49-38, and seemed headed for their most improbable performance yet in a remarkable comeback season under first-year coach Dusty May.",
      "But Pettiford sparked the comeback with a step-back jumper from beyond the 3-point stripe, Jones knocked down two straight from long range before scoring on a drive to the hoop, and Pettiford finished off Michigan with two stunning shots: a trey after briefly losing the ball but getting it back, followed by a three-point play when he knocked one down before landing flat on his back after being fouled.",
      "\u201cI saw one go in, and I just saw the basket get bigger and bigger,\" Jones said. \u201cSo I just kept shooting.\u201d",
      "Danny Wolf led No. Michigan with 20 points, but no one else on the Wolverines managed more than 10.",
      "Still, the Wolverines had plenty of reasons to be proud after bouncing back from an 8-24 debacle a year ago that set a school record for losses in a season and led to the firing of former Fab Five star Juwan Howard.",
      "\u201cThey left a legacy,\" May said. \u201dThey established an identity. They should be very, very proud of their body of work.\"",
      "The first half was played at a frantic but sloppy pace, with both teams plagued by turnovers and struggling to hit shots.",
      "One sequence epitomized the opening 20 minutes. Tre Donaldson threw the ball away with a lazy pass, but Auburn gave it right back when Chad Baker-Mazara\u2019s unnecessary behind-the-back effort was picked off by Roddy Gayle Jr. The Wolverines took off the other way, only to have Donaldson turn it over again with an errant lob that sailed way out of bounds. In just nine seconds, the teams combined for three turnovers.",
      "Auburn led 30-29 at halftime despite hitting just 12 of 37 shots (32.4%) from the field, including a 3-of-16 showing from beyond the 3-point arc, to go along with 10 turnovers. The Tigers gave themselves plenty of second and third chances, and even a fourth on one possession. They finished with 48-33 edge on the boards, including 19 rebounds at the offensive end.",
      "Broome and the rest of Auburn's frontcourt held up just fine against Michigan's two 7-footers, Wolf and Vladislav Goldin.",
      "\u201cWe took the game personal,\u201d Broome said. \u201cThat's a great front line, but we wanted to challenge ourselves to make it tough on them.\u201d",
      "It felt a bit like an Auburn home game with the Tigers playing only 110 miles from their campus just across the state line in eastern Alabama.",
      "The crowd, largely clad in orange and blue, broke into a \u201cLet\u2019s go Auburn!\u201d chant shortly after the tipoff at State Farm Arena. They really erupted when the Tigers rallied in the second half.",
      "\u201cIt obviously helped to elevate their play,\" Pearl said. \u201cIf you're the overall No. 1 seed, you should be able to play close enough to home so the fans can see it.\u201d",
      "It definitely felt like a road game to the Wolverines, who were cheered on by a much smaller contingent.",
      "\u201cObviously in the second half, they hit a few shots and the crowd erupted,\u201d Wolf said. \u201cThat was a huge momentum swing.\u201d",
      "Auburn: The Tigers lost in their first trip to the Elite Eight in 1986. They reached their lone Final Four in 2019, when a setback to eventual champion Virginia ended their season. ... Pearl did not like one line in particular on the stat sheet \u2014 15 turnovers. \u201cIf Michigan can turn us over 15 times, Michigan State could turn us over 25 times,\u201d the coach said. \u201cThat's a concern.\u201d",
      "Michigan: Goldin was held to 10 points on 2-of-9 shooting. He also led the Wolverines with nine rebounds. ... Nimari Burnett scored 10 points as well. ... Michigan shot just 35.6% from the field (21 of 59), including 5 of 17 from outside the stripe. ... The Wolverines had only six assists, compared to 15 for Auburn.",

      "Earthquakes typically occur along edges of tectonic plates. But their impacts may be felt in a broader region.",
      "Earthquakes that occur in the ocean don't always attract attention, but those that occur close to where people live can cause deaths and injuries, most often from collapsed buildings.",
      "Scientists have a good idea of where earthquakes are likely to occur, \"but we can't predict when they'll occur,\u201d USGS seismologist Will Yeck said.",
      "However, after the initial big earthquake, researchers are able to project that other smaller earthquakes nearby, called aftershocks, are likely.",
      "Aftershocks are triggered \u201cbecause of changes to stress in the Earth from the main shock,\u201d Yeck said.",
      "Given the magnitude of the quake in Myanmar, \u201cyou will probably see aftershocks for the next several months,\u201d Steckler said.",
      "In regions of the world with known active fault lines, including California and Japan, building codes are often designed to withstand earthquakes. But that's not true everywhere.",
      "\u201cIf you feel shaking, the guidance depends on where you are in the world,\u201d Yeck said.",
      "In many countries, including the United States, if you're inside when an earthquake occurs, it's advisable to drop to the ground, cover your head \u2014 for example, by crawling under a desk or other sturdy structure \u2014 and hold onto that structure, he said. Try to avoid areas near glass windows and don't use building elevators.",
      "If you're outside, try to remain in an area away from buildings or trees that could fall.",
      "Depending on the location, there may be secondary hazards triggered by earthquakes, such as landslides, fires or tsunamis, he said.",

    "story": [
      "Businesses and lawmakers are trying to address the U.S. affordable housing crisis by turning to alternative ways to build homes",
      "DENVER -- As Americans struggle under backbreaking rental prices, builders are turning to innovative ways to churn out more housing, from 3D printing to assembling homes in an indoor factory to using hemp \u2014 yes, the marijuana cousin \u2014 to make building blocks for walls.",
      "It's a response to the country's shortfall of millions of homes that has led to skyrocketing prices, plunging millions into poverty.",
      "\"There\u2019s not enough homes to purchase and there\u2019s not enough places to rent. Period,\" said Adrianne Todman, the acting secretary of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development under former President Joe Biden.",
      "One way to quickly build more is embrace these types of innovations, Todman said. \u201cI can only imagine what our housing situation would be like now if we could have made a decision to be more aggressive in adopting this type of housing.\"",
      "So what are these new ways of building homes? And can they help reduce the cost of new housing, leading to lower rents?",
      "In a cavernous, metal hall, Eric Schaefer stood in front of a long row of modular homes that moved through the plant, similar to a car on an assembly line.",
      "At a series of stations, workers lay flooring, erected framing, added roofs and screwed on drywall. Everything from electrical wiring to plumbing to kitchen countertops were in place before the homes were shrink-wrapped and ready to be shipped.",
      "The business in the Colorado Rocky Mountains, Fading West, has pumped out more than 500 homes in its just over three years of operation, each taking just five to seven days to build, even in the coldest winter months, Schaefer said.",
      "Once assembled in the plant, the narrow townhouse-style homes with white trim, balconies and front porches, are about 90% done. At their final destination they are move-in ready within six weeks, Schaefer said.",
      "The company works with towns, counties and housing nonprofits to help address the shortage of affordable homes, mostly for workers who've been squeezed out by sky-high prices in ritzy mountain towns.",
      "That includes Eagle, Colorado, not far from the Vail ski resort, where Fading West worked with Habitat for Humanity to install modular homes at affordable rents for teachers and other school district employees. The homes tend to be on the smaller side, but can be multifamily or single family.",
      "\u201cYou can build faster. The faster you build \u2014 even at a high quality \u2014 means the lower the price,\u201d Schaefer said. \u201cWe see this as one of the pieces to the puzzle in helping solve the affordable housing crisis.\"",
      "There's a hefty upfront cost to build the factory, and part of the challenge is a lack of state and federal investment, he said. A patchwork of building codes governing how a structure can be built also makes it difficult, requiring changes to the construction depending on the town or county it is being sent to.",
      "Manufactured housing is similar to modular housing, but the units are constructed on a chassis \u2014 like a trailer \u2014 and they aren't subject to the same local building codes. That's part of the reason they are used more broadly across the U.S.",
      "Roughly 100,000 manufactured homes were shipped to states in 2024, up from some 60,000 a decade earlier, according to Census Bureau data. Estimates of modular homes built annually often put them below 20,000.",
      "Yes, there's technology to 3D print homes.",
      "A computer-controlled robotic arm equipped with a hose and nozzle moves back and forth, oozing lines of concrete, one on top of the other, as it builds up the wall of a home. It can go relatively quickly and form curved walls unlike concrete blocks.",
      "Grant Hamel, CEO and co-founder of VeroTouch, stood inside one of the homes his company built, the wall behind him made out of rolling layers of concrete, distinct to a 3D printer. The technology could eventually reduce labor costs and the time it takes to build an abode, but is farther off than manufactured or modular methods from making a dent in the housing crisis.",
      "It's \u201ca long game, to start chipping away at those prices at every step of the construction process,\u201d Hamel said.",
      "The 3D printers are expensive, and so are the engineers and other skilled employees needed to run them, said Ali Memari, director of the Pennsylvania Housing Research Center, whose work has partly focused on 3D printing. It's also not recognized by international building codes, which puts up more red tape.",
      "The technology is also generally restricted to single-story structures, unless traditional building methods are used as well, Memari said",
      "It's \u201ca technology at its beginning, it has room to grow, especially when it is recognized in code,\u201d Memari said. \u201cThe challenges that I mentioned exist, and they have to be addressed by the research community.\u201d",
      "Hemp \u2014 the plant related to marijuana \u2014 is being used more and more in the construction of walls.",
      "The hemp is mixed with other materials, most importantly the mineral lime, forming \"hempcrete,\" a natural insulation that's mold- and fire-resistant and can act as outer wall, insulation and inner wall.",
      "Hempcrete still requires wood studs to frame the walls, but it replaces three wall-building components with just one, said Memari, also a professor at Penn State University's Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering. Memari is now helping oversee research into making hempcrete that doesn't need the wood studs.",
      "As much as a million hemp plants to be used for hempcrete can grow on one acre in a matter of months as opposed to trees, which can take years or decades to grow.",
      "The plant is part of the cannabis family but has far less of the psychoactive component, THC, found in marijuana. In 2018, Congress legalized the production of certain types of hemp. Last year, the International Code Council, which develops international building codes used by all 50 states, adopted hempcrete as an insulation.",
      "Confusion over the legality of growing hemp and the price tag of the machine required to process the plant, called a decorticator, are barriers to hempcrete becoming more widespread in housing construction, Memari said.",
      "Still, he said, \u201chempcrete has a bright future.\"",

The immediate approval under President Donald Trump serves as a far-different starting point for his government's relations with Qatar \u2014 particularly after he initially backed a four-nation boycott of Doha during his first term.",

      "Qatar's government did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday. Qatar is the second-largest purchaser of U.S. military equipment after Saudi Arabia, spending over $26 billion for F-15 fighter jets, Apache attack helicopters, missile defense systems and other gear.",
      "The proposed sale now goes to the U.S. Congress. Lawmakers typically weigh in on such sales and, in some cases, can block them.",
      "Under terms of the sale, Qatar would purchase eight of the drones, as well as hundreds of bombs and missiles to arm the pilotless aircraft with and the equipment necessary to fly them by satellite.",
      "General Atomics Reapers, which cost around $30 million apiece, can fly at altitudes over 40,000 feet (12,100 meters) and have an endurance of more than 30 hours before needing to land. The aircraft have been flown by both the U.S. military and the CIA over the Middle East for years, in Afghanistan, Iraq and now over Yemen during the American bombing campaign there. The drone has a land and sea version.",
      "The initial approval for Qatar, however, comes after the nearby United Arab Emirates has been waiting since 2020 to purchase up to 18 MQ-9 drones as part of a $23 billion deal also including advanced F-35 fighter jets. Trump has a particularly close relationship with the UAE, which reached a diplomatic recognition deal with Israel under his administration in 2020.",

Two initial xenotransplants in the U.S. \u2014 two pig hearts and two pig kidneys \u2013 were short-lived. But two additional pig kidney recipients so far are thriving \u2013 an Alabama woman transplanted in November and a New Hampshire man transplanted in January. A U.S. clinical trial is about to begin.",
      "Nearly three weeks after the kidney surgery the Chinese patient \"is very well\u201d and the pig kidney likewise is functioning very well, Dr. Lin Wang of Xijing Hospital of the Fourth Military Medical University in Xi\u2019an told reporters in a briefing this week.",
      "Wang, part of the hospital's xenotransplant team, said the kidney recipient remains in the hospital for testing. Chinese media have reported she is a 69-year-old woman diagnosed with kidney failure eight years ago.",
      "But Wang pointed to a potential next step in xenotransplantation \u2014 learning to transplant pig livers. His team reported Wednesday in the journal Nature that a pig liver transplanted into a brain-dead person survived for 10 days, with no early signs of rejection. He said the pig liver produced bile and albumin \u2014 important for basic organ function \u2014 although not as much as human livers do.",

      "Scientists have studied auroras on Saturn and Jupiter for decades, but Neptune, the farthest planet from the sun, has been harder to see up close.",
      "\u201cNeptune has always been elusive,\" said University of Reading planetary scientist James O'Donoghue, co-author of the new study. Its auroras \"had only been seen by Voyager, and we\u2019ve been trying to see it again ever since.\u201d",

      "The researchers also revealed that Neptune's atmosphere has cooled significantly since the 1980s, which may have somewhat dimmed the light of the auroras.",

      "NEW YORK -- A Florida woman deployed a \u201cbrazen fraud\u201d to sell her student aid startup to JPMorgan Chase & Co. for $175 million after dramatically exaggerating its customer base, a prosecutor told jurors Wednesday in a criminal trial's closing argument.",
      "Assistant U.S. Attorney Nicholas Chiuchiolo urged a Manhattan federal court jury to convict Charlie Javice and another former top executive at her company, which operated under the name Frank, of conspiracy and fraud charges.",

      "The governing body of figure skating has embarked on an ambitious plan called \u201cVision 2030,\u201d and the idea is simple: Make the sport cool again",
      "BOSTON -- Ashley Wagner and Ben Agosto know what it's like to step off the ice at the figure skating world championships and feel as though they've conquered the sport. And what it feels like when the notoriously fickle sport bites back.",
      "So when the International Skating Union put in motion its ambitious \u201cVision 2030\u201d plan, which is designed to grow and expand the sport through improved fan engagement, it made sense that they would call Wagner, a three-time U.S. champion and former world silver medalist, and Agosto, who won an Olympic silver medal with ice dance partner Tanith Belbin.",
      "If anyone was going to interview athletes at this week's world championships at such an emotionally raw moment, the minute after their programs have concluded, it ought to be someone who has been through it themselves.",
      "\u201cI would have loved this when I was an athlete, to have the post-skate interviews right in the kiss-and-cry, when the emotions are so fresh,\u201d Wagner said. \u201cThat's something being brought into this production. We've never seen anything like it.\u201d",
      "Look closely, and you might notice a lot of things never seen before at this week's worlds: cutting-edge LED dasher boards surrounding the rink, grand entrances for the athletes, and more energetic music \u2014 like the rocked-out version of \u201cI'm Shipping Up to Boston\u201d by the Celtic punk band Dropkick Murphys that keeps blaring inside TD Garden.",
      "The idea is simple: The ISU wants to make figure skating feel cool again.",
      "Or at least, cool to more people.",
      "Those who love the intricate, nuanced sport \u2014 the spins and jumps, the brilliant landings and bitter falls \u2014 tend to follow it year-round. But there are just as many fans that tune in once every four years, during the Winter Olympics, when like a shooting star the athletes spring onto the public consciousness and then fizzle as soon as it ends.",
      "\"Skaters are the reason why this sport exits,\" explained ISU president Jae Youl Kim, who granted The Associated Press a behind-the-scenes tour of the world championship setup Thursday, shortly before the start of the men's short program.",
      "\u201cWe are so proud of our athletes and we want to make sure we shine a brighter, stronger spotlight on our skaters.\u201d",
      "That is why those brilliant LED dasher boards are showcasing each athlete's social media tag, and why each is being introduced individually for the first time, something track and field and other Olympic sports have embraced over the years.",
      "The ISU wants to create a spectacle for the 14,000-plus fans in the arena, along with the millions watching around the world.",
      "\u201cThere's much more to come. I mean, we can brainstorm here a lot about potential marketing and sponsorship activations as well,\u201d said Wieland L\u00fcders, who manages the world championships for the ISU. \u201cEach skater has their own partners, potentially, so there are many more thoughts. But for now, we are just at the beginning. This is the basic concept.\u201d",
      "In the future, the Vision 2030 plan hopes to improve the TV presentation, simplify the sport\u2019s complex rules, increase sponsorship and expand revenue streams. It will also promote skating through grassroots initiatives, reimagine the season-long calendar, and explore new technology that could help to usher the sport into the modern era.",
      "The athletes aren't just benefiting from increased exposure, and the potential boon for their pocketbooks, but also from back-of-the-house upgrades that are a part of Vision 2030. In Boston, an expansive lounge is off limits to everyone but competitors, and back at their hotel, there is a calming room complete with a rotating cast of therapy dogs.",
      "Kim visited it this week. Nobody paid any attention to the ISU president because everybody wanted to see Penny, the dog.",
      "If the calming room is meant to destress, the new hot seat in the arena will probably do the exact opposite.",
      "Much like the time trial in Olympic cycling, where the leader sits uncomfortably on a throne until someone else takes the lead, the ISU has created the same thing at the world championships. But rather than some roped-off backstage area, where leaders have waited for decades, the hot seat is right next to the kiss-and-cry area in the heart of the arena.",
      "The athletes who are coming off the ice after their performance can't help but stare down whomever is in the lead.",
      "\u201cWe want the fans to see how that person is reacting when he or she climbs over to take the throne, or how they are reacting when they cannot make it,\u201d L\u00fcders said. \u201cThey could have interactions with each other, some hugging or high-fives, something like this. So we hope we get more engagement between the two skaters.\u201d",
      "Ultimately, more engagement with the fans, too.",

      "LOS ANGELES -- Fans of Studio Ghibli, the famed Japanese animation studio behind \u201cSpirited Away\u201d and other beloved movies, were delighted this week when a new version of ChatGPT let them transform popular internet memes or personal photos into the distinct style of Ghibli founder Hayao Miyazaki.",
      "But the trend also highlighted ethical concerns about artificial intelligence tools trained on copyrighted creative works and what that means for the future livelihoods of human artists. Miyazaki, 84, known for his hand-drawn approach and whimsical storytelling, has expressed skepticism about AI's role in animation.",
      "Janu Lingeswaran wasn't thinking much about that when he uploaded a photo of his 3-year-old ragdoll cat, Mali, into ChatGPT's new image generator tool on Wednesday. He then asked ChatGPT to convert it to the Ghibli style, instantly making an anime image that looked like Mali but also one of the painstakingly drawn feline characters that populate Miyazaki movies such as \u201cMy Neighbor Totoro\u201d or \u201cKiki's Delivery Service.\u201d",
      "\u201cI really fell in love with the result,\u201d said Lingeswaran, an entrepreneur who lives near Aachen, Germany. \u201cWe're thinking of printing it out and hanging it on the wall.\u201d",
      "Similar results gave the Ghibli style to iconic images, such as the casual look of Turkish pistol shooter Yusuf Dikec in a T-shirt and one hand in his pocket on his way to winning a silver medal at the 2024 Olympics. Or the famed \u201cDisaster Girl\u201d meme of a 4-year-old turning to the camera with a slight smile as a house fire rages in the background.",
      "ChatGPT maker OpenAI, which is fighting copyright lawsuits over its flagship chatbot, has largely encouraged the \u201cGhiblification\u201d experiments and its CEO Sam Altman changed his profile on social media platform X into a Ghibli-style portrait. In a technical paper posted Tuesday, the company had said the new tool would be taking a \u201cconservative approach\u201d in the way it mimics the aesthetics of individual artists.",
      "\u201cWe added a refusal which triggers when a user attempts to generate an image in the style of a living artist,\u201d it said. But the company added in a statement that it \u201cpermits broader studio styles \u2014 which people have used to generate and share some truly delightful and inspired original fan creations.\u201d",
      "Studio Ghibli in Japan declined to comment Friday.",
      "As users posted their Ghibli-style images on social media, Miyazaki\u2019s previous comments on AI animation also began to resurface. When Miyazaki was shown an AI demo in 2016, he said he was \u201cutterly disgusted\u201d by the display, according to documentary footage of the interaction. The person demonstrating the animation, which showed a writhing body dragging itself by its head, explained that AI could \u201cpresent us grotesque movements that we humans can\u2019t imagine.\u201d It could be used for zombie movements, the person said.",
      "That prompted Miyazaki to tell a story.",
      "\u201cEvery morning, not in recent days, I see my friend who has a disability,\u201d Miyazaki said. \u201cIt\u2019s so hard for him just to do a high five; his arm with stiff muscle can\u2019t reach out to my hand. Now, thinking of him, I can\u2019t watch this stuff and find it interesting. Whoever creates this stuff has no idea what pain is.\u201d",
      "He said he would \u201cnever wish to incorporate this technology into my work at all.\u201d",
      "\u201cI strongly feel that this is an insult to life itself,\u201d he added.",
      "Josh Weigensberg, a partner at the law firm Pryor Cashman, said that one question the Ghibli-style AI art raises is whether the AI model was trained on Miyazaki or Studio Ghibli\u2019s work. That in turn \u201craises the question of, \u2018Well, do they have a license or permission to do that training or not?\u2019\u201d he said.",
      "OpenAI didn\u2019t respond to a question Thursday about whether it had a license.",
      "Weigensberg added that if a work was licensed for training, it might make sense for a company to permit this type of use. But if this type of use is happening without consent and compensation, he said, it could be \u201cproblematic.\u201d",
      "Weigensberg said that there is a general principle \u201cat the 30,000-foot view\u201d that \u201cstyle\u201d is not copyrightable. But sometimes, he said, what people are actually thinking of when they say \u201cstyle\u201d could be \"more specific, discernible, discrete elements of a work of art,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cA \u2018Howl\u2019s Moving Castle' or \u2018Spirited Away,\u2019 you could freeze a frame in any of those films and point to specific things, and then look at the output of generative AI and see identical elements or substantially similar elements in that output,\u201d he said. \u201cJust stopping at, \u2018Oh, well, style isn\u2019t protectable under copyright law.\u2019 That's not necessarily the end of the inquiry.\u201d",
      "Artist Karla Ortiz, who grew up watching Miyazaki\u2019s movies and is suing other AI image generators for copyright infringement in a case that\u2019s still pending, called it \u201canother clear example of how companies like OpenAI just do not care about the work of artists and the livelihoods of artists.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s using Ghibli\u2019s branding, their name, their work, their reputation, to promote (OpenAI) products,\u201d Ortiz said. \u201cIt\u2019s an insult. It\u2019s exploitation.\u201d",
      "Ortiz was further enraged when President Donald Trump\u2019s administration jumped into the meme trend Thursday, using the White House\u2019s official X account to post a Ghibli-style image of a weeping woman from the Dominican Republic recently arrested by U.S. immigration agents. The White House and OpenAI didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment on how the image was made.",
      "\u201cTo see something so brilliant, as wonderful as Miyazaki\u2019s work be butchered to generate something so foul,\u201d Ortiz wrote on social media, adding that she hoped Studio Ghibli sues \u201cthe hell out of\u201d OpenAI for this.",

      "BEIJING -- It's highly technical work in what looks more like a lab than a museum: A fragment of a glazed roof tile from Beijing\u2019s Forbidden City is analyzed in a state-of-the-art X-ray diffraction machine that produces images, which are then projected onto computer screens.",
      "The fragment being examined has a dark area on its surface that restorers want to understand. Their objective is to better preserve the artifacts at the sprawling imperial palace, the former home of China\u2019s emperors and its seat of power for hundreds of years.",
      "\u201cWe want to learn what the black material is,\" said Kang Baoqiang, one of the restorers at the complex, today a museum that attracts tourists from all over the world. \u201cWhether it\u2019s atmospheric sediment or the result of substantial change from within.\u201d",
      "About 150 workers on the team fuse scientific analysis and traditional techniques to clean, patch up and otherwise revive the more than 1.8 million relics in the museum's collection.",
      "They include scroll paintings, calligraphy, bronzes, ceramics \u2014 and, somewhat unexpectedly, ornate antique clocks that were gifted to emperors by early European visitors.",
      "Down the hall from the X-ray room, two other restorers patch up holes on a panel of patterned green silk with the Chinese character for \u201clongevity\u201d sewn into it, carefully adding color in a process called \u201cinpainting.\u201d",
      "The piece is believed to have been a birthday gift to Empress Dowager Cixi, the power behind the throne in the late 19th and early 20th century.",
      "Much of the work is laborious and monotonous \u2014 and takes months to complete.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t have the big dreams of protecting traditional cultural heritage that people talk about,\" said Wang Nan, one of the restorers. \"I simply enjoy the sense of achievement when an antique piece is fixed.\u201d",
      "Now a major tourist site in the heart of Beijing, the Forbidden City is the name that was given to the sprawling compound by foreigners in imperial times because entry was forbidden to most outsiders. It's formally known as the Palace Museum.",
      "Many of its treasures were hurriedly taken away during World War II to keep them from falling into the hands of the invading Japanese army. During a civil war that brought the Communist Party to power in 1949, the defeated Nationalists took many of the most prized pieces to Taiwan, where they are now housed in the National Palace Museum.",
      "Beijing's Palace Museum has since rebuilt its collection.",
      "Restoration techniques have also evolved, said Qu Feng, head of the museum\u2019s Conservation Department, though the old ways remain the foundation of the work.",
      "When we preserve an antique piece, we \u201cprotect the cultural values it carries,\u201d Qu said. \"And that is our ultimate goal.\u201d",

    "summary": "Denmark is open to discussions with the U.S. on how to \"fix\" the status quo in Greenland, the country's foreign minister said, after Vice President JD Vance's visit.",
    "story": [
      "Vice President JD Vance said Denmark had failed to ensure Greenland's security.",
      "LONDON -- Denmark is open to discussions with the U.S. on how to \"fix\" the status quo in Greenland, the country's foreign minister said, after Vice President JD Vance accused Copenhagen of failing to adequately protect the Arctic island during a controversial visit on Friday.",
      "In a post to X addressed to Denmark's \"dear American friends\" late Friday, Danish Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said his nation agrees that the \"status quo\" in the Arctic \"is not an option.\"",
      "\"So let's talk about how we can fix it -- together,\" Rasmussen wrote.",
      "In a video statement, Rasmussen acknowledged the \"many accusations and many allegations\" about Greenland. \"Of course, we are open to criticism, but let me be completely honest -- we do not appreciate the tone in which it's being delivered.\"",
      "\"This is not how you speak to your close allies,\" Rasmussen continued, \"and I still consider Denmark and the United States to be close allies.\"",
      "Danish and Greenlandic leaders have pushed back on Trump's desire to gain control of Greenland. They have simultaneously criticized his perceived overreach while seeking to ease tensions by proposing deeper military and economic cooperation on the Arctic landmass.",
      "\"We respect that the United States needs a greater military presence in Greenland, as Vice President Vance mentioned this evening. We -- Denmark and Greenland -- are very much open to discussing this with you,\" Rasmussen said in his statement.",
      "The existing bilateral defense agreement -- signed in 1951 -- \"offers ample opportunity for the United States to have a much stronger military presence in Greenland,\" Rasmussen said. \"If that is what you wish, then let us discuss it.\"",
      "President Donald Trump has repeatedly -- both in his first term and since returning to office for his second -- expressed his ambition to take control of the island. Rasmussen's appeal for dialogue came shortly after Vance completed his visit to Greenland, which is an autonomous territory within the Kingdom of Denmark.",
      "Speaking to American service members at the U.S. Pituffik Space Base on the northwestern coast of Greenland, Vance said, \"Well, the president said we have to have Greenland. And I think that we do have to be more serious about the security of Greenland.\"",
      "\"We can't just ignore this place,\" he continued. \"We can't just ignore the president's desires.\"",
      "Vance said Trump's administration \"respects the self-determination of the people of Greenland,\" but suggested the island would be safer under the U.S. security umbrella.",
      "Greenland is already covered by the Article 5 collective defense clause that underpins NATO, of which both Denmark and the U.S. are members.",
      "\"Yes, the people of Greenland are going to have self-determination,\" Vance said. \"We hope that they choose to partner with the United States because we're the only nation on Earth that will respect their sovereignty and respect their security -- because their security is very much our security.\"",
      "Vance accused Denmark of failing to provide adequate security against \"very aggressive incursions from Russia, from China and from other nations.\"",
      "\"Our message to Denmark is very simple: You have not done a good job by the people of Greenland. You have underinvested in the people of Greenland, and you have underinvested in the security architecture of this incredible, beautiful landmass filled with incredible people. That has to change,\" he said.",
      "Rasmussen said that both Denmark and the U.S. had done too little in the Arctic since the end of the Cold War. \"We all acted on the assumption that the Arctic was and should be a low tension area, but that time is over,\" he said. \"Status quo is not am option.\"",
      "Trump has repeatedly expressed his ambition to acquire Greenland, despite fierce criticism from leaders in Greenland, Denmark and Europe. There appears little support among Greenlanders for his proposal. A January poll by Verian, commissioned by the Danish paper Berlingske, showed that only 6% of Greenlanders are in favor of becoming part of the U.S., with 9% undecided.",
      "The island sits in a strategic position facing the northern coast of Russia across the Arctic Ocean and close to two shipping routes -- the Northeast and Northwest passages. Greenland is also thought to be home to a large amount of valuable mineral deposits. Both the shipping routes and minerals are expected to become more accessible as the warming climate causes sea ice to recede further.",
      "\"We have to have Greenland. It's not a question of: Do you think we can do without it? We can't,\" Trump said in the Oval Office on Friday. \"If you look at Greenland right now, if you look at the waterways, you have Chinese and Russian ships all over the place, and we're not going to be able to do that.\"",
      "\"We're not relying on Denmark or anybody else to take care of that situation,\" he added. \"And we're not talking about peace for the United States.\"",
      "\"Greenland's very important for the peace of the world -- not us, the peace of the entire world,\" the president said. \"And I think Denmark understands it. I think the European Union understands it. And if they don't, we're going to have to explain it to them.\"",

Authorities failed to turn the flights around, saying they were already in international waters.",
      "An official with the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement subsequently acknowledged in a sworn declaration that \"many\" of the alleged gang members did not have criminal records in the United States -- but said that \"the lack of specific information about each individual actually highlights the risk they pose\" and \"demonstrates that they are terrorists with regard to whom we lack a complete profile.\"",

      "\"It's not overstating things to say that your agenda is at stake in this election, and this district can't let you down. Your agenda is on the ballot on April 1,\" he said.",
      "During the earlier telephone rally supporting the Republican candidate in the 1st Congressional District, Florida Chief Financial Officer Jimmy Patronis, Trump praised Patronis' work in Florida and framed the special election as important for his own agenda.",
      "That special election, which will determine who takes the seat vacated by now-former Rep. Matt Gaetz, has gotten less concern from Republicans.",
      "\"The 1st Congressional District is special, and I won it by a lot, and Jimmy is going to win it by a lot. And remember, you're five days away from this all important special election taking place in your district on Tuesday, April 1, so April Fool's Day. So it's going to be the fool for the Democrat candidate, who happens to be terrible,\" Trump said of Patronis' Democratic opponent Gay Valimont, a gun violence prevention activist.",
      "Praising Patronis, Trump said, \"Jimmy's done an outstanding job as the chief financial officer of the state of Florida, helping to guide your state to tremendous economic success. And now he wants to keep on fighting for Florida in Congress.\"",
      "Patronis, speaking after Trump, told listeners, \"Look, if you're not fired up to hearing the president right now, then you need to get your pulse checked with President Trump and the White House.

      "The administration has slashed about 50% of the department's workforce.",
      "Dozens of emotional Department of Education employees took part in a final \"clap-out\" in Washington, D.C., after losing jobs amid the Trump administration's agency restructuring.",
      "The administration slashed about 50% of the department's workforce as part of President Donald Trump and Education Secretary Linda McMahon's strategy to abolish the department and send education decisions to the states.",
      "The departing civil servants, who have either been terminated, retired or voluntarily bought out, have each been given about 30 minutes to retrieve their belongings this week -- before exiting the building to clapping colleagues who were screaming \"thank you!\" outside the offices in Washington, D.C.",
      "The last education chief, former Education Secretary Miguel Cardona, visited his old office to celebrate employees affected by the workforce shakeup.",
      "Clapping, shaking hands and cheering them along, Cardona told the civil servants, \"Thank you for your service.\"",
      "\"These public servants that are walking out right now deserve a thank you. They deserve respect. They've worked hard -- not just during the time that I served as secretary but before that,\" Cardona, wearing plain clothes, told reporters in a brief statement outside agency headquarters.",
      "\"I'm here, for the staff here, to say thank you,\" he added.",
      "DeNeen Ripley shook Cardona's hand and told him her entire transportation division was eliminated. Ripley has worked at the department over 30 years and said she is taking an early retirement now.",
      "\"It feels like a death,\" Ripley told ABC News. \"It feels like a bad divorce of sorts, it just feels heartbreaking.\"",
      "Despite the massive overhaul and almost 2,000 employees lost, McMahon has stressed the Department of Education will continue to administer its statutory functions that students from disadvantaged backgrounds rely on, including grants, formula funding and loans.",
      "\"The president made clear today that none of the funding will stop for these [programs],\" McMahon told ABC News Senior Political Correspondent Rachel Scott after Trump's executive order signing last week, which directed McMahon to use all necessary steps permitted under the law to abolish the agency she's been tapped to lead.",
      "\"I think it is his hope that even more funding could go to the states. There will be more opportunity for it. And, you know, he means what he says. And so there's not going to be any defunding or reduction in funding,\" she added.",
      "A dream job \"snatched\"",
      "Washington, D.C., native Leondra Richardson and a crowd of emotional colleagues across the department left the near-defunct agency's headquarters for the final time Friday.",
      "\"It was a dream job,\" Richardson told ABC News. \"And that dream was snatched from me by the new administration.\"",
      "Richardson said her entire office, the Office of the Chief Data Officer, was folded earlier this month by the \"reduction in force\" implemented on March 11.",
      "Sydney Leiher, a midlevel career public servant, said she felt forced out and doesn't know what's next for her. After leaving with her belongings, including a beach volleyball and Trader Joe's sack, Leiher stressed the reforms are not only unjustified but also unpopular.",
      "\"It's definitely emotional,\" Leiher said, holding back tears. \"I feel bad for all of the people in the Chief Information Office who have to, like, gather all of our laptops and equipment -- like, they don't want to be doing this either.",
      "\"It's just a really sad day. But seeing the support out here from all of other Department of ED staff and then also, like, other federal agencies and then the public just makes it shows to me that, like, people do not want this, and like, this is not popular, and this shouldn't be happening,\" Leiher added.",
      "Richardson and Leiher both worked in the same division, the OCDO, that was shuttered. Without the office, Richardson said there will hardly be anyone left at the federal level to collect data to show student improvements or delays.",
      "The Trump administration has claimed it is making cuts to rid the government of bureaucratic bloat, but Richardson told ABC News her IT job was not policy based or bureaucratic. Leiher, an analyst who worked on artificial intelligence machine learning, told ABC News that she took this job after returning from the Peace Corps. She added that civil service work shouldn't be about politics.",
      "\"I believe in public service,\" Leiher said. \"I believe in a nonpartisan civil service. We're important, we matter.\"",
      "Meanwhile, departing civil servants such as Dr. Jason Cottrell, a data coordinator in the Office of Postsecondary Education, the largest grant-making division in the department, said he believes students are being put in jeopardy as the Department of Education is diminished.",
      "\"Our nation's students are going to suffer,\" Cottrell said. \"I think of the doctoral students that are, you know, trying to do research on cancer or, you know, learning or whatever it may be, and without the funds to support them, they are going to -- it's going to be hard for them to succeed without those funds, and we're not going to gain that knowledge that we need.\"",
      "The farewell ceremony at the department comes as \"clap-outs\" are set to continue across the country next week at regional offices in places such as Cleveland, Dallas and San Francisco. But these moments hit especially close to home for Richardson, who detailed how she overcame a teenage pregnancy while growing up east of the river in the Southeast quadrant of the city.",
      "She said it's so close yet so \"far away\" from the federal government.",
      "\"I hate that I can't be a voice or inspiration to the young girls growing up in Southeast D.C. that I wanted to inspire,\" Richardson said, adding that she \"wanted to give a chance to, you know, show that there's another way and you can make it forward.\"",
      "\"You can make a big impact and a big difference in the country coming from where we from,\" she said.",

    "story": [
      "Judge Benjamin Settle became the second federal judge to block the policy.",
      "If allowed to go into effect, the Trump administration's new policy on transgender soldiers would be a \"de facto blanket prohibition\" that seeks \"to eradicate transgender service,\" a federal judge wrote Thursday in issuing a preliminary injunction against the policy.",
      "In a 65-page opinion issued late Thursday, U.S. District Judge Benjamin Settle became the second federal judge to block the policy, which he described as discriminatory and disconnected from the goals of \"military readiness, unit cohesion, lethality, or any of the other touchstone phrases long used to exclude various groups from service.\"",
      "The Justice Department filed notice Friday that it would appeal the judge's decision.",
      "While the Trump administration had argued that the judiciary should defer to military leadership, Judge Settle -- who was nominated to the bench by President George W. Bush near the height of the War on Terror -- said he is unable to condone a \"unsupported, dramatic and facially unfair exclusionary policy.\"",
      "\"The government falls well short of its burden to show that banning transgender service is substantially related to achieving unit cohesion, good order, or discipline. Although the Court gives deference to military decision making, it would be an abdication to ignore the government's flat failure to address plaintiffs' uncontroverted evidence that years of open transgender service promoted these objectives,\" he wrote.",
      "The group of seven active-duty service members who brought the lawsuit argued that the policy \"purposefully discriminates\" against soldiers based on their gender identity -- an argument that Justice Department lawyers attempted to rebut by reframing the question as a medical issue, impacting only people who suffer gender dysphoria. Judge Settle was unconvinced, writing that the policy \"uses gender dysphoria as a proxy to ban all transgender service members.\"",
      "\"The government's arguments are not persuasive, and it is not an especially close question on this record,\" he wrote, finding that each of the plaintiffs would be irreparably harmed by the policy, which would curtail their military service.",
      "Judge Settle also called out the Trump administration for seemingly disregarding the service history of the transgender soldiers who brought the case, such as the Commander Emily Shilling, a naval aviator with 19 years of service who flew 60 combat missions before becoming a Navy test pilot.",
      "\"There is no claim and no evidence that she is now, or ever was, a detriment to her unit's cohesion, or to the military's lethality or readiness, or that she is mentally or physically unable to continue her service,\" Settle wrote.",
      "\"There is no claim and no evidence that Shilling herself is dishonest or selfish, or that she lacks humility or integrity. Yet absent an injunction, she will be promptly discharged solely because she is transgender,\" wrote the judge.",

    "story": [
      "Rebecca Slaughter and Alvaro Bedoya are seeking back pay and reinstatement.",
      "Two former Federal Trade Commissioners are suing the Trump administration for moving to fire them last week, arguing it violates federal law.",
      "Rebecca Kelly Slaughter and Alvaro M. Bedoya have filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia aiming to reverse President Donald Trump's decision to fire them without cause, they said.",
      "\"We are trying to vindicate the law that Congress passed, that has been in place for over a century to protect accountability and transparency at the FTC,\" Slaughter told ABC News. \"To make sure that commissioners and the work of the commission is done without fear or favor, and more specifically, that we can take on the biggest companies in America without fear of getting fired for failure to do a favor to the President's friends or donors or corporate allies.\"",
      "The FTC, which regulates major tech companies, such as Facebook and Amazon, has also recently cracked down on junk fees, including those for concert tickets and hotel resort fees and simplified the process for unsubscribing from hard-to-cancel services like gym memberships. The board usually consists of five members: three from the president's party and two from the opposition.",
      "In the termination letters last week, an official from the Trump administration informed Slaughter and Bedoya, the Democratic members, that their service at the FTC was \"inconsistent\" with the administration's policies but did not provide any further details.",
      "Slaughter and Bedoya point to a 1935 Supreme Court precedent that prohibits the president from removing FTC commissioners except for \"inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.\"",
      "\"This is a very obvious violation of the law, and we hope will be reinstated in short order,\" Bedoya said.",
      "The lawsuit demands back pay and reinstatement to their positions.",
      "In addition to Elon Musk, Trump has sought close ties with other tech CEOs, including Meta's Mark Zuckerberg and Amazon's Jeff Bezos, who were invited to Trump's inauguration.",
      "The former FTC commissioners said they don't know if Trump's relationships with the heads of tech companies had anything to do with their dismissal.",
      "\"It certainly raises the specter of that kind of interference and corruption,\" Slaughter said. \"We won't know without the presence of minority commissioners at the FTC why it's taking the actions it's taking and whether they're in line with the law.\"",
      "Bedoya added, \"Some of the recent, I would say, chaotic moves from the White House are a real concern, not just for consumers, but also for the market. If you want small businesses and startups to succeed, you want a stable, predictable market where big companies can't just snuff you out, not by issuing a better product, but just throwing their weight around to stop you. That is the kind of work FTC does, and that's what I fear will go away.\"",

      "In a Fox News interview Thursday evening, her first since Trump's announcement, Stefanik said she's \"proud to be a team player\" given the slim Republican majority in the House.",
      "\"This is about stepping up as a team, and I am doing that as a leader, to ensure that we can take hold of this mandate and deliver these historic results,\" she said.",

It's unclear what role, if any, Stefanik would hold in House Republican leadership as the top roles are currently filled. Leadership could create a new position for her, but nothing had been formally decided.",
      "In the Fox News interview, Stefanik dodged answering a question regarding a possible return to a House leadership position, saying instead she is now able to \"speak out\" more since she is no longer pending a confirmation vote.",
      "\"The American people will be hearing a lot more from me,\" she said.",
      "Stefanik, a New York Republican, began her career in Congress as a moderate, but in recent years has become one of Trump's staunchest supporters.",
      "She played a key role in the congressional response to antisemitism on college campuses amid the Israel-Hamas war. She's also accused the United Nations of antisemitism.",

Therefore, Elise will stay in Congress, rejoin the House Leadership Team, and continue to fight for our amazing American People.\"",
      "House Republicans currently hold a narrow majority in the House with 218 Republicans to 213 Democrats. Johnson has a two-vote cushion for his majority.",
      "The president appeared to leave the door open to Stefanik joining his administration at another time.",
      "\"I look forward to the day when Elise is able to join my Administration in the future,\" he wrote. \"She is absolutely FANTASTIC.\"",
      "Trump did not say who he planned to nominate next to serve as U.N. ambassador. The position requires Senate confirmation.",

    "story": [
      "Georgia lawmakers are giving up on creating a statewide database to collect information on students who might commit violence",
      "ATLANTA -- Georgia lawmakers are giving up on creating a statewide database to collect information on students who might commit violence, even as they push forward other parts of a school safety bill aimed at preventing a school shooting like the one in September at Apalachee High School.",
      "House and Senate lawmakers unveiled a compromise version of House Bill 268 on Thursday, which then passed the Senate Judiciary committee unanimously. That sets it up for final passage in the closing days of Georgia's 2025 legislative session.",
      "The push to share information was driven by the belief among many that the Barrow County school system didn\u2019t have a full picture of the warning signs displayed by the 14-year-old accused in the fatal shootings of two students and two teachers. But there was loud opposition from both Democratic and Republican constituencies that the database would create a permanent blacklist with no due process that could treat racial and religious minorities unfairly.",
      "\u201cThe reason it wasn\u2019t going to fly was pushback from all points of the political spectrum that worried about their child being stigmatized just for an accusation or an uncorroborated complaint,\u201d said Sen. Bill Cowsert, an Athens Republican representing parts of Barrow County.",
      "The compromise version also removed a requirement that all school systems set up formal threat management teams to evaluate whether students may commit violence. That approach is strongly recommended by many national experts, and the Georgia Emergency Management and Homeland Security Agency already offers training. House Education Committee Chairman Chris Erwin, a Republican from Homer, said he was hopeful schools would voluntarily adopt the model.",
      "\u201cI think there is a knowledge out there of the importance of planning and preparing already in schools,\u201d Erwin said. \u201cSo having a full model structure for the state isn\u2019t as important as maybe we once thought it was.\u201d",
      "The measure would still require police agencies to report to schools when officers learn that a child has threatened death or injury to someone at a school. But those reports aren't mandated to become part of a student's educational record and wouldn't travel with a student if they transfer to another district.",
      "That raises questions about whether the bill addresses one of the key criticisms that followed the Apalachee shooting. School officials never became aware that a sheriff's deputy in Jackson County had interviewed Colt Gray in May 2023 after the FBI passed along a tip that Gray might have posted a shooting threat online. That report would have been forwarded to middle school officials in Jackson County under the bill, but wouldn't have followed Gray when he enrolled as a freshman in nearby Barrow County after skipping eighth grade entirely.",
      "The bill also mandates quicker transfers of records when a student enters a new school, creates at least one new position to help coordinate mental health treatment for students in each of Georgia\u2019s 180 school districts and sets up an anonymous reporting system statewide.",
      "Lawmakers on Thursday added in features of separate Senate bills that had passed. They would mandate that all Georgia public schools provide wearable panic buttons to employees. Public schools would also be required to submit electronic maps of their campuses to local, state and federal agencies once a year.",
      "The amended bill would also make adult prosecution the default when children aged 13 to 16 are charged with terroristic acts at school, any aggravated assault with a gun, or attempted murder. The Senate had originally proposed a broader range of crimes when adult prosecution would be the default. House leaders had said they didn't want to submit any more juveniles to adult prosecution.",

    "story": [
      "The available options would have serious consequences to the world order.",
      "The Trump administration remains steadfast in acquiring Greenland, despite the island's leaders refusing to give it up as Vice President JD Vance and second lady Usha Vance travel to the country on Friday.",
      "\"We need Greenland for national security and international security. So, we'll, I think, we'll go as far as we have to go,\" President Donald Trump told reporters on Wednesday.",
      "Vance has touted Greenland\u2019s \"incredible natural resources\" in speeches that call for the territory's acquisition for its riches in gold, copper and rare earth materials.",
      "Trump's ambitions aren't far-fetched, according to an international relations expert who told ABC News that there are some avenues in which the U.S. could realistically acquire the autonomous Danish territory.",
      "However, international policy, laws and decades-long economic and political partnerships make Trump's wishes extremely improbable, according to Phillip Lipscy, professor of political science at the University of Toronto.",
      "\"This kind of rhetoric hasn't been part of U.S. foreign policymaking since World War II,\" he told ABC News. \"If the United States moves forward with this, this would be a game changer.\"",
      "Lipscy noted that while acquiring Greenland would bolster the U.S.'s security in the Arctic Circle, such a move is not needed because of NATO nations' strong military and naval presence.",
      "Annexation is not new in U.S. history, going back to the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, when the U.S acquired a major portion of what is now the central part of the country was acquired in a deal with France.",
      "The last time that the U.S. was given land that became territories was when it acquired three Pacific Ocean island groups as part of the post-World War II agreement with the United Nations in 1947 known as the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands.",
      "That deal took years of negotiating and an agreement from several nations who worked out the geopolitical landscape of post-war Oceania.",
      "Only one of those island groups, the Marianas Islands, remains a U.S. territory.",
      "Lipscy said such deals between sovereign nations have dwindled over the decades in exchange for agreements such as limited military partnerships, trade deals and other treaties, which take far less time and help keep the sovereignty of nations.",
      "Trump and the U.S. would have to negotiate with Denmark's government for a sale or an annexation of Greenland if he were to take over the land without violating international law or using the military to take the country by force.",
      "Greenland's politics are already making any such negotiation difficult, according to Lipscy.",
      "Greenland is a self-sovereign territory of Denmark with its own elected government, with Denmark's parliament handling international matters.",
      "There has been a movement within the island to be independent from Denmark that will be a key factor in any future plans of a U.S. acquisition, according to Lipscy.",
      "\"Certainly, there may be a diplomatic solution that starts with an independent Greenland\u2026but it's difficult to see that situation,\" he said.",
      "In elections earlier this month, pro-independence parties won the most seats in parliament but neither want to be part of the U.S. Greenland is now forming a coalition government in the wake of the election.",
      "Greenland's government and its residents have loudly protested Trump since he began talking about acquiring it in December. He floated the idea earlier in his first term in 2019 but didn't pursue it.",
      "\"Greenland belongs to the Greenlanders. We are not Americans, we are not Danes because we are Greenlanders. This is what the Americans and their leaders need to understand. We cannot be bought and we cannot be ignored,\" Greenland\u2019s Prime Minister Mute Bourup Egede said in a Facebook post earlier this month.",
      "Egede also called Friday's visit by the Vances and other U.S. officials, including national security adviser Mike Waltz and Energy Secretary Chris Wright, part of a \"very aggressive American pressure against the Greenlandic community\" and called for the international community to rebuke it.",
      "The Danish government has also pushed back hard on Trump's calls to acquire Greenland and has encouraged its residents to speak out against it.",
      "\"They know well that Greenland isn't for sale. They know well that Greenland doesn't want to be a part of the United States,\" Danish Prime Mette Frederiksen said in a statement Wednesday.",
      "\"The attention is overwhelming and the pressure is great. But it's in times like these that you show what fabric you're made of. You haven't let yourselves be cowed. You have stood up for who you are - and you have shown what you stand for. It has my deepest respect,\" she added.",
      "Frederiksen said that other European nations are also on Denmark's side in this back-and-forth with Trump, already hampering the ties between the U.S. and its allies since Trump regained office.",
      "Lipscy said that such a purchase would take a long time and would likely stretch long beyond Trump's term, especially if the Greenland and Danish leadership and their people continue to reject Trump's calls.",
      "If Trump continued to ignore the wishes of Greenland and Denmark, it would also strain those relationships and affect economic, national security and political alliances that have been in place since the end of World War II, Lipscy said.",
      "\"It would signal the U.S. can no longer be trusted to be a reliable partner and hold international norms,\" he said. \"No one would want to do any type of deal, partnership or negotiation.\"",
      "Trump has refused to rule out military action to take over Greenland, but Lipscy said that a full-on military acquisition would also not sit well in the domestic and international political field and, most importantly, among the American people.",
      "A poll released by the Wall Street Journal days before Trump returned to the White House found that 68% of Americans opposed the idea.",
      "\"The idea of territorial expansion is coming predominantly from the president himself and there isn't any widespread agreement on acquiring from the public or the Republican Party,\" Lipscy said.",
      "He predicted that while Trump may be \"banging the table\" more to make his goal a reality, it won\u2019t move the needle beyond his base because the general public knows that such a move would be costly and ultimately not help national security.",
      "\"I think even if the ultimate goal of the U.S. government is to secure closer ties with Greenland, the way the administration is going about with its policymaking is deeply counterproductive and unlikely to get the result they are seeking,\" he said.",

      "Betar spokesman Daniel Levy said that some people on its list were identified using the facial-recognition tool called NesherAI created by Hawila's company, Stellar Technologies, which was launched from his Brooklyn apartment.

      "\u201cTechnology, when used in good ways, makes the world a better place,\u201d he said.",
      "As a candidate, Trump campaigned on a promise to crack down on campus antisemitism and threatened to deport activists with student visas that he called violent radicals.",

      "Students protesting Israel's conduct in Gaza have been unsure what to make of Betar, which the Anti-Defamation League recently added to its list of extremist groups. The ADL has also voiced support for revoking the visas of foreign student activists.",
      "At the University of Pittsburgh, leaders of Students for Justice in Palestine said they spoke with police in November after an online message from Betar that said it would be visiting the school to \u201cgive you beepers\u201d \u2014 an apparent reference to Israel\u2019s detonation of thousands of electronic pagers last fall to kill and wound members of Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah militia.",

      "The efforts to target protesters have fueled anxiety among international students involved in campus activism.",
      "\u201cThey\u2019ve abducted someone on our campus, and that is a key source of our fear,\u201d said the Columbia student from South Asia.",
      "She recounted cancelling spring break plans to travel to Canada, where her husband lives, for fear she would not be allowed to reenter the U.S. She has also shut down her social media accounts to avoid drawing attention to pro-Palestinian posts.",

      "Leaders of Students for Justice in Palestine chapters at George Washington University and Pittsburgh said some international students have asked to have their email addresses and names removed from membership lists to avoid scrutiny.",
      "A Columbia graduate student from the United Kingdom said that when he joined a pro-Palestinian encampment last year, he never considered whether it might affect his immigration status.",
      "Now he\u2019s rethinking an incident in October, when someone scattered fliers in a campus lounge celebrating the 2023 Hamas attack on Israel that sparked the war. A classmate who supports Israel accused him and others in the room of being responsible for the fliers and snapped their photos, according to the student, who said he had nothing to do with the material distributed.",

      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth\u2019s decision to review military standards on combat and physical fitness and appearance opens a Pandora\u2019s box of the widely different rules among the services",
      "WASHINGTON -- The defense secretary's decision to review military standards on combat and physical fitness and appearance opens a Pandora\u2019s box of widely differing rules among the services. And it will raise a crucial question: Should there be a cookie-cutter approach, or should service differences, evolving social norms and recruiting realities play a role in policy decisions?",
      "Pete Hegseth has been very public about his opposition to women in combat jobs and his belief that standards were lowered to accommodate women, and he warned there would be reviews to address the issues. He is a staunch proponent of making all standards the same, regardless of gender, and military officials are braced for changes as reviews continue.",
      "In a memo March 12, Hegseth said the undersecretary for personnel must gather information on military standards \u201cpertaining to physical fitness, body composition, and grooming, which includes but is not limited to beards.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe must remain vigilant in maintaining the standards that enable the men and women of our military to protect the American people and our homeland as the world\u2019s most lethal and effective fighting force,\u201d he wrote.",
      "The effort is seen as a broadside against women serving on the frontlines \u2014 which they have been doing successfully for years. Hegseth's memo calls for a review of how standards have changed and the impact of those shifts since Jan. 1, 2015 \u2014 the year the Defense Department opened all combat jobs to women.",
      "And it raises questions about whether he wants to make all fitness tests the same for the services and make them all gender- and age-neutral or whether he will set minimum standards and allow the services to require more stringent requirements as desired.",
      "Eliminating the current policy of scoring annual fitness tests based on age and gender could hurt retention and recruitment if troops are suddenly told to meet a new, dramatically harder requirement. Such changes are generally phased in over time.",
      "Here's a look at the current standards.",
      "The military has long had what is largely a two-part system for physical fitness standards:",
      "\u2014 Routine annual fitness tests with different requirements based on gender and age.",
      "\u2014 More grueling standards for specific combat, special operations, infantry, armor, parajumpers and other jobs that are the same for everyone in that occupation, and are not adjusted for age or gender.",
      "Right now, the fitness tests are a hodgepodge.",
      "Each service has basic tests that all service members must pass once or twice a year. For every service, the tests vary. Scoring is adjusted for gender and age. For example: A 20-year-old man must complete a run in a faster time than a woman or a 30-year-old man in order to receive the maximum score.",
      "Fitness tests used to be simpler: a run, push-ups and sit-ups. They evolved over time and now can include options. For example, Air Force service members can do either a 1 1/2-mile run or a sprint. Other services will at times allow biking or rowing as a cardio substitute for the run; planks are now more widely used than sit-ups.",
      "The Army and Marines have more extensive fitness tests..",
      "The Army, in a major overhaul several years ago, expanded its fitness test to six events, including a dead lift, run, planks, push-ups, standing power throw and a combination sprint/drag/carry. The events were meant to mimic real-world military circumstances. An early plan to make that test gender and age neutral was scrapped after studies showed problems.",
      "The Marine Corps has two tests a year. In the first half, Marines take a physical fitness test that includes a three-mile run, pull-ups and planks. In the second half of the year, they take a combat fitness test that includes an 880-meter run in combat boots, an ammo-can lift and an exercise that mimics troops\u2019 maneuver under fire.",
      "The maneuver portion includes an obstacle course with a low crawl, high crawl and sprint, as well as dragging a person and using the fireman\u2019s carry.",
      "Specific military jobs like special operations, infantry, armor and parajumping require different, higher-level physical \u2014 and often mental and psychological \u2014 tests, requirements and qualification courses.",
      "Those standards require everyone to meet the same gender- and age-neutral requirements. For example, an Army soldier who wants to be a Green Beret or a sailor who wants to be a SEAL must pass those grueling months-long qualification courses.",
      "Also, after the Pentagon allowed women to be in all combat jobs, the Army set specific fitness standards for each military occupation that are the same regardless of sex or age. Recruits who want to serve in an infantry or armor job must pass a specific physical assessment that has higher, more significant demands, in order to sign a contract for that specialty.",
      "Over the years, a wide array of standards and requirements have been adjusted for reasons ranging from religious tolerance to recruiting and evolving societal trends.",
      "In large part, they are driven by recruiting struggles and the need to woo those from a changing universe of American young people, including those with less academic schooling or people from states where marijuana is legal.",
      "The Navy, for example, began in 2022 to enlist more recruits who score very low on the Armed Services Qualification Test. That was to help meet recruiting goals. A year later it began to bring in people who didn\u2019t graduate from high school or get a GED. Both were shifts that the other services have largely avoided. The Navy argued that it needed those lower-scoring recruits to fill jobs that involve intense manual labor.",
      "Hegseth has said little about that type of standard and has focused on physical rather than mental fitness.",
      "In addition, several services have changed policies on hair and beards. They now allow different buns and ponytails for women, and beards in certain circumstances for either medical or religious reasons. And most of the services have relaxed policies on marijuana in recent years.",
      "Similarly, they have all loosened restrictions on the size and placement of tattoos, opening the door to full-sleeve tattoos. Most now allow small ones on the neck or finger.",

      "\u201cIt seems like we\u2019re headed in the direction where there\u2019s even an attempt to deny that the institution of slavery even existed, or that Jim Crow laws and segregation and racial violence against Black communities, Black families, Black individuals even occurred,\u201d said historian Clarissa Myrick-Harris, a professor at Morehouse College, the historically Black campus in Atlanta.",
      "The Thursday executive order cites the National Museum of African American History and Culture by name and argues that the Smithsonian as a whole is engaging in a \u201cconcerted and widespread effort to rewrite our Nation\u2019s history.\u201d",
      "Instead of celebrating an \u201cunparalleled legacy of advancing liberty, individual rights, and human happiness,\u201d the order argues that a \u201ccorrosive \u2026 divisive, race-centered ideology\u201d has \u201creconstructed\u201d the nation \u201cas inherently racist, sexist, oppressive, or otherwise irredeemably flawed.\u201d",
      "It empowers Vice President JD Vance to review all properties, programs and presentations to prohibit programs that \u201cdegrade shared American values\u201d or \u201cdivide Americans based on race.\u201d",
      "Trump also ordered Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to determine if any monuments since January 2020 \u201chave been removed or changed to perpetuate a false reconstruction of American history\u201d or \u201cinappropriately minimize the value of certain historical events or figures.\u201d Trump has long criticized the removal of Confederate monuments, a movement that gained steam after the May 2020 murder of George Floyd.",
      "Critics argued the order is the latest move by the Trump administration to quash recognition of Black Americans\u2019 contributions to the nation and to gloss over the legal, political, social and economic obstacles they have faced.",
      "Trump\u2019s approach is \u201ca literal attack on Black America itself,\u201d Ibram X. Kendi, the race historian and bestselling author, said. \u201cThe Black Smithsonian, as it is affectionately called, is indeed one of the heartbeats of Black America,\u201d Kendi argued, and \u201calso one of the heartbeats\u201d of the nation at large.",
      "Congressional Black Caucus Chair Yvette Clarke, D-N.Y., suggested that Trump wants to distort the national narrative to racist ends.",
      "\u201cWe do not run from or erase our history simply because we don\u2019t like it,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cWe embrace the history of our country \u2013 the good, the bad, and the ugly.\u201d",
      "The African American museum, one of 21 distinct Smithsonian entities, opened along the National Mall in 2016, the last year that President Barack Obama held office as the nation\u2019s first Black chief executive. The museum chronicles chattel slavery, Jim Crow segregation and its lingering effects, but also highlights the determination, successes and contributions of individual Black Americans and Black institutions throughout U.S. history.",
      "Former NAACP President Ben Jealous, who now leads the Sierra Club, said museums that focus on specific minority or marginalized groups \u2014 enslaved persons and their descendants, women, Native Americans \u2014 are necessary because historical narratives from previous generations misrepresented those individuals or overlooked them altogether.",
      "\u201cAttempts to tell the general history of the country always omit too much ... and the place that we\u2019ve come to by having these museums is so we can, in total, do a better job of telling the complete story of this country,\u201d he said.",
      "And, indeed, Trump sounded more like Jealous when he visited the African American museum in 2017, at the outset of his first term, and declared it a national gem.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m deeply proud that we now have a museum that honors the millions of African American men and women who built our national heritage, especially when it comes to faith, culture and the unbreakable American spirit,\u201d Trump said following a tour that included Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina and then-Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson, both of whom are Black.",
      "\u201cI know President Obama was here for the museum\u2019s opening last fall,\u201d Trump continued. \u201cI\u2019m honored to be the second sitting president to visit this great museum.\u201d",
      "Trump won his comeback White House bid with a notable uptick in support from non-white voters, especially among younger Black and Hispanic men.",
      "He ratcheted up attacks during his campaign on what he labeled \u201cwoke\u201d culture and diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, not just in government but the private sector. He also used racist and sexist tropes to attack Democratic nominee and Vice President Kamala Harris, the first Black woman and person of South Asian descent to hold national office, and regularly accused her and other liberals of \u201chating our country.\u201d",
      "Since his Jan. 20 inauguration, Trump has banned diversity initiatives across the federal government. The administration has launched investigations of colleges \u2014 public and private \u2014 that it accuses of discriminating against white and Asian students with race-conscious admissions programs intended to address historic inequities in access for Black students.",
      "The Defense Department, at one point, temporarily removed training videos recognizing the Tuskegee Airmen and an online biography of Jackie Robinson. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth fired Joint Chiefs Gen. C.Q. Brown, a champion of racial diversity in the military who spoke about his experiences as a Black man after the murder of George Floyd.",
      "The administration has fired diversity officers across government, curtailed some agencies' celebrations of Black History Month, and terminated grants and contracts for projects ranging from planting trees in disadvantaged communities to studying achievement gaps in American schools.",
      "Civil rights advocates and historians expressed concern about a chilling effect across other institutions that study Black history.",
      "Kendi noted that many museums and educational centers across the country \u2014 such as San Francisco\u2019s Museum of the African Diaspora, The Legacy Museum: From Enslavement to Mass Incarceration in Montgomery, Alabama, and the International African American Museum in Charleston, South Carolina \u2014 exist with little to no federal or other governmental funding sources. Some already are struggling to keep their doors open.",
      "\u201cTo me, that\u2019s part of the plan, to starve these institutions that are already starving of resources so that the only institutions that are telling America\u2019s history are actually only telling political propaganda,\u201d Kendi said.",

      "An Associated Press analysis has found that South Dakota taxpayers subsidized Gov. Kristi Noem\u2019s cross-country campaigning to the tune of hundreds of thousands of dollars",
      "SIOUX FALLS, S.D. -- As then-Gov. Kristi Noem crisscrossed the country \u2014 stumping for President Donald Trump and boosting her political profile beyond her home state \u2014 she refused to reveal what her extensive travel was costing taxpayers.",
      "In the weeks since Noem became Trump\u2019s Homeland Security secretary, that mystery has been solved: South Dakota repeatedly picked up the tab for expenses related to her jet-setting campaigning.",
      "An Associated Press analysis of recently released travel records found more than $150,000 in expenses tied to Noem\u2019s political and personal activity and not South Dakota business. That included numerous trips to Palm Beach, Florida, where Trump resided before retaking office.",
      "Most of those costs covered the state-provided security that accompanied Noem, irrespective of the reason for her travel. Over her six years as governor, AP\u2019s analysis shows, South Dakota covered more than $640,000 in travel-related costs incurred by the governor\u2019s office.",
      "The expenditures include $7,555 in airfare for a six-day trip to Paris, where she gave a speech at a right-wing gathering, costs associated with a bear hunt in Canada with her niece and a book tour that included a stop in New York. An additional $2,200 stemmed from a controversial trip last year to Houston for dental work she showcased on Instagram.",
      "The expenses, released last month following a lawsuit by The Dakota Scout, have incensed Republicans in the deep-red state, with several GOP lawmakers accusing Noem of tapping state funds to fuel her own political ascendancy.",
      "The uproar comes as the Trump administration seeks to eliminate waste, fraud and abuse in government and as Noem has taken over DHS, the third-largest federal agency, with a budget and workforce many times the size of South Dakota's.",
      "The spending \u201coffends a lot of people,\u201d said Dennis Daugaard, a former Republican South Dakota governor, who added that costs generated by Noem\u2019s ambition for higher office could\u2019ve been paid with campaign funds.",
      "Taffy Howard, a GOP state senator who clashed with Noem over her refusal to disclose her travel expenses, expressed shock at the price tag. \u201cIt seems like an incredible amount of money,\u201d Howard told AP.",
      "A spokesman for Noem, Tim Murtaugh, declined to answer detailed questions about the expenses but did not dispute that some of the travel lacked an apparent connection to state business. There\u2019s no indication the former governor broke any laws having the state foot the bill for security expenses \u2014 even on trips that critics said benefited her more than South Dakota taxpayers.",
      "\u201cUnfortunately, bad guys tend to make threats against high-profile public officials,\" Murtaugh said. \u201cWhen it was a political or personal trip, she paid for her own travel out of her political or personal funds.\u201d",
      "Josie Harms, a spokesperson for Noem\u2019s gubernatorial successor, said security requirements were \u201ca matter of state business no matter where the governor may be.\"",
      "\u201cThe scope of that security is not up to the governor,\u201d Harms added.",
      "During her years in office, Noem frequently said that releasing the travel expenses would jeopardize her safety.",
      "South Dakota has relatively lax disclosure requirements for such travel expenses. Governors from both parties have used state funds to finance the travel expenses of their security details and staffers.",
      "Critics called on Washington\u2019s Jay Inslee, a Democrat, to reimburse the state for similar costs resulting from his unsuccessful 2019 presidential run. And Ron DeSantis, Florida's GOP governor, also came under fire for racking up hefty travel tabs for his security detail during his bid for higher office.",
      "Murtaugh, a spokesman for Noem in her personal capacity, questioned why Democratic governors were not being scrutinized for their travel on behalf of former Vice President Kamala Harris, their party's 2024 presidential nominee.",
      "\u201cThey maintained aggressive political schedules on behalf of Kamala Harris but somehow escape media attention for costs associated with that, while Kristi Noem is being held to a different standard?\u201d Murtaugh wrote in an email.",
      "The more than 3,000 pages of records released to the Scout by Noem's successor included hotel receipts, restaurant bills and credit card statements.",
      "The AP obtained the same records, as well as dozens of additional documents that show state officials acknowledged that \u201ccampaigning for Trump is not an official duty\u201d of the governor in denying one of several requests to release her travel expenses.",
      "The receipts are heavily redacted, so it\u2019s not always clear who incurred the expense. Only 30 items totaling $2,056.72 were charged on the governor\u2019s state-issued Mastercard, according to her attorney.",
      "Some expenses seemingly had no link to state business, such as $21 hotel-room movie purchases. It\u2019s also unclear who attended meals that included unnamed \u201cfederal officials.\u201d",
      "The state auditor questioned some of the charges, including the governor\u2019s office\u2019s use of a luxury airline travel agency for a flight to Paris and a $2,000 change fee.",
      "The state also ran up more than $3,300 in late fees and interest. The record doesn\u2019t indicate how much was paid in overtime for staff and security accompanying Noem on her political excursions.",
      "\u201cSpending for security detail, as well as where and when they are deemed necessary, falls under the discretion of the governor,\u201d Jenna Latham, a supervisor in the state auditor's office, wrote to AP in an email.",
      "Most of the expenses were incurred as Noem became a rising star in Trump\u2019s \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d universe and a contender to be his 2024 running mate. Her fortunes appeared to have suffered a blow after she revealed in a memoir that she shot and killed her farm dog, Cricket, after it scared away some game during a pheasant hunt.",
      "This is not the first time Noem\u2019s travel has come under the microscope. A state government accountability board in 2022 had requested an investigation into her use of the state plane to attend political events, but a prosecutor found no grounds for charges.",
      "The records raise questions about the necessity of the travel and the secrecy surrounding the expenses.",
      "Noem\u2019s office refused to release records related to a 2020 speaking engagement at AmpFest, a gathering of Trump supporters near Miami, telling a public-records requester the trip was \u201cnot for the purpose of the governor\u2019s official duties\u201d and no receipts existed.",
      "But the newly released records include several transactions in South Florida on those days, including a rental car and a stay at the posh Trump National Doral Miami. Days later, South Dakota picked up the tab for gasoline and hotel rooms for Noem's security so she could speak at a Republican fundraiser in New Hampshire.",
      "\u201cNoem\u2019s travel doesn\u2019t pass the smell test,\u201d said Viki Harrison, program director for Common Cause, a nonpartisan group that seeks to limit big money in politics. \u201cThere should be a huge firewall between campaigning and official business.\u201d",
      "Noem\u2019s predecessors traveled less frequently in a low-tax state that values frugality, both on the farm and from elected officials. Daugaard, whose official statue features him pinching a penny, said he reimbursed staff for purchases like ice cream.",
      "Former Gov. Mike Rounds, now South Dakota\u2019s junior U.S. senator, said he tried to keep partisan activity at \u201carm\u2019s length\u201d from state resources and was careful about what he put on the government\u2019s dime.",
      "Such thriftiness was required, he said, because his state is \u201cso tight on everything to begin with, just in terms of having enough money to pay the bills.\u201d",

      "PORTLAND, Ore. -- An Oregon judge issued a preliminary injunction Friday blocking the city at the heart of a U.S. Supreme Court ruling on homeless encampments from enforcing its camping rules unless it meets certain conditions, as part of a lawsuit filed by advocates.",
      "Under the decision by Josephine County Circuit Court Judge Sarah McGlaughlin, Grants Pass must increase capacity at city-approved sites for camping and ensure they are physically accessible to people with disabilities.",
      "Unless those conditions are met, the order bars the city from citing, arresting or fining people for camping on public property; from forcing people to leave campsites; from removing campsites that are not clearly abandoned; or from prohibiting camping in most city parks.",
      "The order still lets the city enforce rules banning sleeping on sidewalks and streets or in alleys and doorways.",
      "Mayor Clint Scherf told The Associated Press he was \u201cdisheartened\u201d by the decision, and Grants Pass information coordinator Mike Zacchino said via email that the city was \u201creviewing all aspects to ensure we make the best decision for our community.\u201d",
      "The lawsuit was filed by Disability Rights Oregon, which accused the city of discriminating against people with disabilities and violating a state law requiring cities' camping regulations to be \u201cobjectively reasonable.\u201d Plaintiffs also included five homeless people in Grants Pass.",
      "Grants Pass, a small city of about 40,000 along the Rogue River in the mountains of southern Oregon, has struggled for years to address the homelessness crisis and become emblematic of the national debate over how to deal with it.",
      "Its parks in particular became a flashpoint, with many of them becoming the site of encampments blighted by drug use and litter.",
      "Last June, in a case brought by the city, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that communities can ban sleeping outside and fine people for doing so, even when there are not enough shelter beds.",
      "That overturned a California-based appeals court decision that held that camping bans when shelter space is lacking amounted to cruel and unusual punishment under the U.S. Constitution\u2019s Eighth Amendment.",
      "Officials from across the political spectrum filed briefs in that case saying they were hamstrung in their ability to deal with encampments.",

      "Upon taking office in January, the new mayor and new council members moved to close the larger of the two sites, which housed roughly 120 tents, according to the complaint. Meanwhile the smaller one saw its hours of operation reduced to between 5 p.m. and 7 a.m., meaning people had to pack up their belongings every morning.",

      "About 30 members of the Kansas City-area Satanic Grotto, led by its president, Michael Stewart, rallied outside the Statehouse for the separation of church and state. The group also protested what members called the state's favoritism toward Christians in allowing events inside. Gov. Laura Kelly temporarily banned protests inside, just for Friday, weeks after Stewart's group scheduled its indoor ceremony.",

About 100 Christians stood against yellow police tape marking the Satanic Grotto's area. The two groups yelled at each other while the Christians also sang and called on Grotto members to accept Jesus. Several hundred more Christians rallied on the other side of the Grotto's area, but further away.",
      "Kelly issued her order earlier this month after Roman Catholic groups pushed her to ban any Satanic Grotto event.

      "Amy Dorsey, a friend of Stewart's, said she rallied with the Satanic Grotto to support free speech rights and religious freedoms guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution\u2019s First Amendment, in part because Christian groups are allowed to meet regularly inside the Statehouse for prayer or worship meetings.",
      "Before his arrest, Stewart said his group scheduled its Black Mass for Friday because it thought the Kansas Legislature would be in session, though lawmakers adjourned late Thursday night for their annual spring break. Stewart said the group might come back next year.",
      "\u201cMaybe un-baptisms, right here in the Capitol,\u201d he said.",
      "Video shot by KSNT-TV showed that when Stewart tried to conduct his group's ceremony in the first-floor rotunda, a young man tried to snatch Stewart's script from his hands, and Stewart punched him. Several Kansas Highway Patrol troopers wrestled Stewart to the ground and handcuffed him. They led him through hallways on the ground floor below and into a room as he yelled, \u201cHail, Satan!\u201d",
      "Stewart\u2019s wife, Maenad Bee, told reporters, \u201cHe\u2019s only exercising his First Amendment rights.\u201d",
      "Online records showed that Stewart, 42, was jailed briefly Friday afternoon on suspicion of disorderly conduct and having an unlawful assembly, then released on $1,000 bond.",
      "The Kansas Highway Patrol, which provides security at the Statehouse, said two others who entered the building with Stewart also were arrested for unlawful assembly, Jocelyn Frazee, 32, and Sean Anderson, 50. Frazee had no bond set; information for Anderson was not available online.",
      "Witnesses and friends identified the young man trying to snatch away the Black Mass script as Marcus Schroeder, who came to counterprotest with fellow members of a Kansas City-area church. Online records show Schroeder, 21, was arrested on suspicion of disorderly conduct, with his bond also set at $1,000.",
      "A friend of Schroeder's, Jonathan Storms, said he was trying to help a woman who also sought to snatch away Stewart's script and \u201cdidn't throw any punches.\u201d",
      "The woman, Karla Delgado, said she came to the Statehouse with her three youngest children to deliver a petition protesting the Black Mass to Kelly's office. Delgado said she approached Stewart because he was violating the governor's order and Highway Patrol troopers weren't immediately arresting him. She said in the ensuing confusion, her 4-year-old daughter was knocked to the ground.",

      "Billionaire Elon Musk\u2019s unprecedented efforts to bolster the conservative candidate in next week\u2019s hotly contested Wisconsin Supreme Court race have run into legal hot water amid accusations that he had broken state election law",
      "MADISON, Wis. -- Billionaire Elon Musk's unprecedented efforts to bolster the conservative candidate in next week's hotly contested Wisconsin Supreme Court race ran into legal hot water Friday amid accusations that he had broken state election law.",
      "Musk announced late Thursday that he planned to hold a Sunday rally in Wisconsin, where he said he would \u201cpersonally hand over\u201d $1 million checks to two voters who had already cast their ballots \u201cin appreciation for you taking the time to vote.\u201d",
      "Wisconsin state law expressly prohibits giving anything of value in exchange for voting \u2014 drawing a slew of complaints, including from Wisconsin\u2019s Democratic attorney, who sued Friday afternoon to block Musk from handing out the checks.",
      "Amid the backlash, Musk deleted the post and later posted a revised offer.",
      "\u201cTo clarify a previous post, entrance is limited to those who have signed the petition in opposition to activist judges. I will also hand over checks for a million dollars to 2 people to be spokesmen for the petition,\u201d he wrote.",
      "Andrew Romeo, a spokesperson for Musk\u2019s political action committee, declined to comment on what had prompted the change.",
      "Musk's initial post drew a flurry of accusations just days before Tuesday's election, which will determine the ideological makeup of the highest court in the perennial presidential battleground.",
      "Attorney General Josh Kaul on Friday asked the circuit court to issue an emergency injunction to stop Musk from making the payments, calling them a \u201cblatant attempt to violate\u201d Wisconsin's anti-bribery statute.",
      "They also took issue with Musk\u2019s political action committee, America First, offering to pay $100 to any registered Wisconsin voter who signed a petition voicing opposition to \u201cactivist judges\u201d \u2014 or forwarded it to someone who did. Earlier this week, the group announced that it had awarded $1 million to a Green Bay man to serve as a \u201cspokesperson for signing our Petition In Opposition To Activist Judges.\u201d",
      "The recipient, Scott Ainsworth, has donated to Republicans and made social media posts supporting President Donald Trump and his agenda.",
      "A bipartisan coalition of government watchdog groups and former officeholders, along with a liberal Madison law firm, asked the Wisconsin attorney general and the Milwaukee County district attorney to investigate the $1 million payment and $100 signing payments.",
      "Wisconsin law makes it a felony to offer, give, lend or promise to lend or give anything of value to induce a voter to cast a ballot or not vote.",
      "Numerous legal experts argued Friday that Musk's first post promising payments to voters for voting appeared to be in clear violation of the bribery statute.",
      "\u201cYou cannot pay people to vote or not to vote,\u201d said Richard Painter, a law professor at the University of Minnesota and former White House ethics chief in the Bush administration. \u201cHis running these lotteries based on whether people vote or not, it\u2019s illegal. And he\u2019s got to cut that out.\u201d",
      "Musk\u2019s revised X post, Painter said, \u201cat least purports to comply with Wisconsin law.\u201d",
      "\u201cI guess that technically complies,\u201d he said.",
      "Others weren't so sure.",
      "Bryna Godar, staff attorney with the State Democracy Research Initiative at the University of Wisconsin Law School, said Musk changing the terms of his offer \u201cputs the payments and attendance at the rally back into a gray area under Wisconsin law.\u201d",
      "\"The question is whether the offers are 'in order to induce' people to vote or go to the polls, and there can be arguments made on either side of that question,\u201d she said in an email.",
      "She also said it is possible that Musk violated the election bribery law simply by offering the payments, even if no money is ever paid.",
      "\"Given that he already made the offer and that it was up while early voting was actively underway, there is a question of whether the initial post already violated state law, even though he has later walked it back,\" she wrote. \u201cDeleting his post and changing the terms might mitigate the circumstances, but it does not necessarily resolve the legal issue.\u201d",
      "Democratic Party of Wisconsin Chair Ben Wikler was more blunt.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s be very clear: Elon Musk committed a crime the moment he offered million-dollar checks 'in appreciation for\u2019 voting, and deleting evidence of that crime changes nothing,\" he said in a statement. \u201cUnder Wisconsin law, merely the offer of something of value \u2014 in this case, the chance to receive one million dollars \u2014 is plainly illegal.\u201d",
      "A challenge to Musk\u2019s payments could end up before the Wisconsin Supreme Court.",
      "Musk\u2019s political action committee used nearly identical tactics to the ones he is using in Wisconsin ahead of the presidential election last year, when he spent hundreds of millions of dollars helping President Donald Trump win a second term.",
      "That included offering to pay $1 million a day to voters in Wisconsin and six other battleground states who signed a petition supporting the First and Second Amendments.",
      "Philadelphia\u2019s district attorney sued in an attempt to stop the payments under Pennsylvania law. But a judge said prosecutors failed to show the effort was an illegal lottery and allowed it to continue through Election Day.",
      "Rick Hasen, a prominent election law expert at the UCLA School of Law, noted that the legal issues raised this week echoed concerns about Musk\u2019s tactics ahead of last year\u2019s presidential election.",
      "\u201cDuring the 2024 elections, there was a question whether Elon Musk was breaking federal law in offering various incentives only to registered voters, including what was essentially a lottery open only to registered voters,\u201d he wrote. \u201cHe\u2019s up to similar gimmicks in the upcoming, very expensive Wisconsin Supreme Court race.\u201d",
      "According to a tally by the Brennan Center for Justice, America PAC and Building for America\u2019s Future, two groups that Musk funds, have spent more than $20 million trying to help elect conservative Waukesha County Judge Brad Schimel, whom Trump endorsed last week.",
      "Schimel is facing Democratic-backed Dane County Circuit Judge Susan Crawford in the race that will determine the ideological makeup of the state\u2019s highest court. Liberals currently have a 4-3 majority.",
      "Musk also has given the Wisconsin Republican Party $3 million, which can be passed along to Schimel's campaign.",
      "That outside cash has made the race the most expensive judicial election in U.S. history, by far. More than $81 million has been spent to date, obliterating the $51 million record set just two years ago, when another seat on the same court was up for grabs.",
      "The election will determine control of the court, but has also become a referendum on Trump\u2019s first weeks in office \u2014 as well as one on Musk himself.",
      "During a telephone town hall for Schimel Thursday night, Trump implored his voters to turn out in the off-year election.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a very important race,\u201d he said. \u201cI know you feel it\u2019s local, but it\u2019s not. It\u2019s really much more than local. The whole country is watching.\u201d",
      "Musk got involved in the race just days after his electric car company, Tesla, filed a lawsuit against Wisconsin in an effort to open dealerships in the state, which could eventually end up before the justices.",
      "The Wisconsin Supreme Court is also expected to soon rule on a number of prominent national issues, including abortion rights, congressional redistricting and voting rules, which could affect the 2026 midterms and the 2028 presidential election.",
      "Jay Heck, the executive director of Common Cause Wisconsin, a good government group, said that regardless of the outcome, Musk's efforts were \u201cunprecedented\u201d in the state.",
      "\u201cIt's obscene and unprecedented. He's already put in close to $20 million,\" he said. \u201cThis election for a Supreme Court open seat in Wisconsin is going to cost, when it's all said and done, somewhere between $80 and $100 million dollars. And this is to influence less than four million eligible voters, of which only 25-30% will turn out because this is a spring, low-turnout election.\"",

      "A federal judge has ruled that more than 109,000 square miles of Gulf Coast federal were unlawfully opened up for offshore drilling leases",
      "NEW ORLEANS -- An expanse of Gulf Coast federal waters larger than the state of Colorado was unlawfully opened up for offshore drilling leases, according to a ruling by a federal judge, who said the Department of Interior did not adequately account for the offshore drilling leases' impacts on planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions and an endangered whale species.",
      "The future of one of the most recent offshore drilling lease sales authorized under the Biden administration is in jeopardy after District Court for the District of Columbia Judge Amit Mehta\u2019s finding on Thursday that the federal agency violated bedrock environmental regulations when it allowed bidding on 109,375 square miles (283,280 square kilometers) of Gulf Coast waters.",
      "Environmental groups, the federal government and the oil and gas industry are now discussing remedies. Earth Justice Attorney George Torgun, representing the plaintiffs, said one outcome on the table is invalidating the sale of leases worth $250 million across 2,500 square miles (6,475 square kilometers) of Gulf federal waters successfully bid on by companies.",
      "The leases in the Gulf Coast were expected to produce up to 1.1 billion barrels of oil and more than 4 trillion cubic feet (113 billion cubic meters) of natural gas over 50 years, according to a government analysis.

      "\u201cIf federal officials are going to continue greenlighting offshore drilling, the least they can do is fully analyze its harms,\u201d said Hallie Templeton, legal director at Friends of the Earth, a nonprofit that is of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit. \u201cWe will keep fighting to put a full stop to this destructive industry, and in the meantime, we will keep a close watch on the government to ensure compliance with all applicable laws and mandates.\u201d",
      "The drilling would also threaten the Rice\u2019s whale, a species with less than 100 individuals estimated to remain and which lives exclusively in the Gulf Coast, according to court records filed by environmental advocacy groups.",

      "A Connecticut prosecutor says a man who told authorities he was held captive in his own home for two decades has asked why his stepmother is not behind bars after being charged with cruelty to persons and other crimes",
      "WATERBURY, Conn. -- A Connecticut man who told authorities was held captive in his own home for two decades since he was still a boy has asked why his stepmother is not behind bars after being charged with cruelty to persons and other crimes, a state prosecutor said Friday.",
      "Don Therkildsen Jr., a supervisory assistant state's attorney, made the remark during a court hearing in Waterbury for Kimberly Sullivan, who pleaded not guilty Friday to charges that also included kidnapping and felony assault. Sullivan was ordered to be placed on electronic monitoring, and Therkildsen also asked for house arrest over concerns she could flee.",
      "\u201cThis victim is afraid. This victim lives in fear,\u201d Therkildsen said in court. \u201cI introduced myself to the victim, explained who I was. His first question in this fear is, \u2018Why is she out walking around when I was locked up in a room for 20 years?\u2019\u201d",
      "Sullivan, 57, posted $300,000 bail after she was arrested March 12. She has denied allegations that she kept her stepson locked in a small room in their Waterbury home and limited his food and liquids so much that he weighed only 69 pounds (31 kilograms) when he was rescued. He is 5-feet-9-inches tall (1.75 meters tall).",
      "Sullivan's lawyer, Ioannis Kaloidis, objected to the house arrest request and said Sullivan has complied with all conditions since she posted bail. He also said threats have been made against Sullivan and confining her to house arrest at one location would put her in danger.",
      "The 32-year-old man set a fire in the house on Feb. 17 in an effort to be free, police said. He was rescued by firefighters and taken to a hospital, where staff said he was emaciated from malnutrition.",
      "He told police that he was locked in the small room with no heat or air conditioning for most of every day since he was about 11 years old, allowed out only briefly to do chores. His father, Kregg Sullivan, let him out of the room for longer periods, but he died last year, police said.",
      "He said he was hungry all the time. He was unenrolled from Waterbury\u2019s public school system in 2004 after educators contacted state child welfare officials with concerns about his well-being, police said. He apparently was going to be home-schooled.",
      "State and local authorities have been looking into how this could have happened, and some are calling for stricter oversight of home-schooling.",
      "Waterbury police have said they visited Sullivan's home twice in 2005 and there were nothing to warrant concern.",
      "A former principal at the elementary school the man attended as a child, Tom Pannone, told WVIT-TV that school officials repeatedly called Sullivan and the state Department of Children and Families, or DCF, over concerns that he was too thin and was stealing food and eating things out of the garbage.",
      "Police said DCF workers visited the home, but it's not clear what the agency did. The man told police that Sullivan made him tell authorities everything was OK under the threat of his food being reduced.",
      "DCF previously said it could not immediately find any records involving the family. On Friday the agency announced that it found some records in its archives and was reviewing them.",
      "Officials did not immediately share details of the records and said they would be providing them to police and state investigators after completing a search and review.",

      "Sgt. Joe Harris, believed to be the oldest surviving World War II paratrooper and a member of the U.S. Army\u2019s first all-Black parachute infantry battalion, has died. He was 108.",
      "Harris died March 15 in a hospital in Los Angeles surrounded by family, grandson Ashton Pittman told The Associated Press. He will be honored with a full military funeral on April 5.",
      "\u201cHe was a very loving, loving, loving man,\u201d said Pittman. \u201cThat was one of the things that he was very strict upon was loving one another.\u201d",
      "Harris was among the last surviving members of the historic 555th Parachute Infantry Battalion, nicknamed the Triple Nickles. The battalion helped protect the U.S. from deadly Japanese balloon bombs, according to Robert L. Bartlett, a retired Eastern Washington University professor who specializes in the 555th. In 1944 and 1945, the Japanese launched thousands of the balloons to be carried by the Pacific jet stream to the U.S. mainland to explode and start fires.",
      "During World War II, Black Americans were often relegated to more support-level jobs in the racially segregated military and President Franklin Roosevelt faced pressure to put them in combat units. As a result, the military recruited Harris and hundreds of other Black men, trained them and sent them into blazes on the West Coast, where they fought fires, Bartlett said.",
      "Throughout their time in the military, they faced overt racism, including being barred from going to the base commissary and officer\u2019s clubs unless they were specifically for Black people.",
      "\u201cThis unit had to fight to be recognized as human beings while training to fight an enemy overseas, fight in their own country for respect even within the military,\u201d Bartlett said.",
      "That was not lost on Pittman, who said his grandfather was brave enough to serve the U.S. \u201cduring a time when the country didn\u2019t love him, honestly, didn\u2019t care about him.\u201d",
      "Harris was born on June 19, 1916, in West Dale, Louisiana, according to Tracie Hunter, spokesperson for WWII Beyond The Call, a nonprofit organization that works to document veterans' accounts. After filling out his draft registration card, he began his military service in 1941 when he was 24.",
      "By the time he was honorably discharged in November 1945, he had completed 72 parachute jumps, according to Hunter.",
      "After the war, he worked for the U.S. Border Patrol. He also spent more than 60 years in Compton, California, where Pittman said he was the neighborhood patriarch, a man everyone on the block knew and gravitated to.",
      "\u201cHis life is to be celebrated,\u201d Pittman said. \u201cObviously people are going to morn because he\u2019s not here anymore. But ultimately what I know from conversations that I\u2019ve had with my grandfather is that he wants to be celebrated. He deserves to be celebrated.\u201d",
      "He is survived by his son, Pirate Joe Harris Sr., and two daughters, Michaun Harris and Latanya Pittman, along with five grandchildren, according to Hunter. His wife, Louise Harris, died in 1981, and a sixth grandchild has also died.",
      "Pittman said that his grandfather would sometimes ask him if he would ever jump out of a plane. In October, Pittman had the opportunity to follow in his grandfather\u2019s airborne footsteps.",
      "For a week, he did paratrooper jump training in Corsicana, Texas, through the Liberty Jump Team, an organization that works to preserve the memory of veterans.",
      "\u201cWhen I got my wings, I actually broke down and started crying because everything in that moment just resonated with me,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was like, dang I\u2019m literally doing what my grandfather did.\u201d",
      "Shortly before Harris' death, he got a landing zone, in Tuskegee, Alabama, dedicated in his name. Pittman said he plans to be the very first person to jump in the Sgt. Joe Harris Dropzone.",

      "A judge challenging the outcome of his North Carolina Supreme Court race was photographed wearing Confederate military garb and posing before a Confederate battle flag when he was a member of a college fraternity that glorified the pre-Civil War South",
      "WASHINGTON -- A judge challenging the outcome of his North Carolina Supreme Court race was photographed wearing Confederate military garb and posing before a Confederate battle flag when he was a member of a college fraternity that glorified the pre-Civil War South.",
      "The emergence of the photographs comes at a delicate time for Jefferson Griffin, a Republican appellate judge who is seeking a spot on North Carolina's highest court. Griffin, 44, is facing mounting criticism \u2013 including from some Republicans \u2013 as he seeks to invalidate over 60,000 votes cast in last November\u2019s election, a still undecided contest in which he is trailing the Democratic incumbent by over 700 votes.",
      "The photographs, which were obtained by The Associated Press, are from when Griffin was a student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill from 1999-2003 and a member of the Kappa Alpha Order, one of the oldest and largest fraternities in the U.S., with tens of thousands of alumni.",
      "Griffin said he regretted donning the Confederate uniform, which was customary during the fraternity's annual \u201cOld South\u201d ball.",
      "\u201cI attended a college fraternity event that, in hindsight, was inappropriate and does not reflect the person I am today,\u201d Griffin said in a statement. \u201cAt that time, like many college students, I did not fully grasp such participation\u2019s broader historical and social implications. Since then, I have grown, learned, and dedicated myself to values that promote unity, inclusivity, and respect for all people.\u201d",
      "One of the pictures, taken during the 2001 ball, shows Griffin and roughly two-dozen other fraternity members clad in Confederate uniforms. Another photograph from the spring of 2000 shows Griffin and other Kappa Alpha brothers in front of a large Confederate flag. He served in 2002 as his chapter\u2019s president.",
      "Kappa Alpha has proven to be a lightning rod for controversy over the decades, often due to the racist or insensitive actions of some of its members. A number of politicians have been forced to apologize for having worn Confederate costumes at the fraternity's functions or for being photographed in front of a Confederate flag.",
      "Jesse Lyons, a spokesman for the fraternity's national office in Lexington, Virginia, said use of the rebel battle flag was prohibited in 2001 and displaying other Confederate symbols had been discouraged years before. The fraternity banned the wearing of the Confederate uniforms in 2010. It's unclear if the chapter at UNC banned the uniforms before the national organization did.",
      "\u201cWe believe in cultural humility, we respect the best parts of our organization\u2019s history, and through education we challenge our members to work for a better future. These things are not mutually exclusive,\u201d Lyons said.",
      "The fraternity claims Robert E. Lee as its \u201cspiritual founder\u201d and long championed the Southern \u201cLost Cause,\" a revisionist view of history that romanticizes the Confederacy and portrays the Civil War as a valiant struggle for \u201cstates\u2019 rights\u201d unrelated to the enslavement of Black people. In decades past, some Kappa Alpha chapters referred to themselves as a \u201cklan,\u201d a term that many viewed as an unsubtle wink to the Ku Klux Klan.",
      "The photographs featuring Griffin were taken at a time when many other Kappa Alpha chapters were reevaluating their celebration of the Confederacy.",
      "During Griffin\u2019s time in the fraternity, some in his chapter questioned the appropriateness of dressing up in Confederate uniforms for the ball. Griffin opposed abandoning the tradition, according to a person familiar with the situation, who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of reprisal. The uniforms stayed.",
      "Griffin said he would \u201cnot respond to unsubstantiated comments based on memories of 20-plus years past.\u201d",
      "In high school Griffin also expressed an affinity for Robert E. Lee, the Confederate general who led southern forces during the Civil War. In a 1998 feature on high school \u201cscholars of the week\u201d in the Raleigh News & Observer newspaper, Griffin said Lee was his No. 1 choice to include on an \u201cideal guest list\u201d for a party.",
      "The Kappa Alpha Order was founded in 1865, not long after Lee surrendered to the Union Army, at a Virginia college where Lee served as president. At least one of the first members was a former rebel soldier who had served under Lee, who is revered by the fraternity as the ideal of gentlemanly Southern chivalry.",
      "For more than a century, Kappa Alpha threw \u201cOld South\u201d parties. They were formal affairs where the Confederate battle flag was flown and fraternity brothers dressed in replica Confederate gray uniforms and their dates wore antebellum-style hoop skirts. Sometimes they would ride through campus on horseback.",
      "Some Kappa Alpha chapters, particularly in the South, clung to their traditions, including the wearing of blackface, even as they drew protests and public sentiment shifted.",
      "A Kappa Alpha \u201cOld South\u201d parade at Alabama\u2019s Auburn University in 1992 drew supporters waving Confederate battle flags, as well as counter protesters who burned them. In 1995, a group of Kappa Alpha members at the University of Memphis hurled racial slurs while beating a Black student who caused a disturbance outside a frat party, the Memphis Commercial Appeal reported at the time.",
      "The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill was no exception to the turmoil. Under pressure from student group's, the school's Kappa Alpha chapter in 1985 canceled its annual \u201cSharecropper\u2019s Ball,\" which some attended in blackface. Fraternity members said blackface was worn because the event needed both Black and white attendees, but promised to discontinue the practice, according to a news story in the Daily Tar Heel student newspaper.",
      "The Kappa Alpha chapter at North Carolina\u2019s Wake Forest University stopped allowing members to wear Confederate uniform and display the Confederate flag in 1987.",
      "But other chapters held on longer. The national headquarters finally forbade confederate uniforms in 2010 after a wave of public blowback after Kappa Alpha members at the University of Alabama wore them during a parade that paused in front of the home of a black sorority.",
      "Griffin is not the first public official to draw unwanted attention for their college-age embrace of symbols drawn from the darker chapters of the South's past.",
      "Virginia's then-governor, Democrat Ralph Northam, came under intense criticism in 2019 over a racist photo that appeared on his yearbook page of his medical school. The incident led reporters to scour the college histories of other Southern leaders, forcing a number of politicians to publicly address their time as Kappa Alpha brothers.",
      "Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves, then the state\u2019s Republican lieutenant governor, dodged questions in 2019 about photos showing him wearing a Confederate uniform while he was a Kappa Alpha member at Millsaps College in the early 1990s. While Reeves was enrolled there in October 1994, other members of the fraternity were disciplined for wearing afro wigs and Confederate battle flags and shouting racial slurs at black students, the AP reported at the time.",
      "Republican South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster declined to comment after yearbooks listed him as the leader of the fraternity's chapter at the University of South Carolina in 1969, along with photos of members wearing Confederate uniforms and posing with a rebel flag.",
      "And Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee, also a Republican, expressed regret for participating in \u201cOld South\u201d parties as a student at Auburn University in the 1970s.",

      "MADISON, Wis. -- Democratic Gov. Tony Evers vetoed a Republican-authored bill Friday that would have required state education officials to score standardized student tests according to the scale they used years ago.",
      "State schools Superintendent Jill Underly, a liberal who faces conservative Brittany Kinser in Tuesday's spring election, changed student standardized testing benchmarks and scoring thresholds for school district performance report cards last year. She has said that she made the performance changes at the request of Wisconsin teachers and how they felt their students can perform.",
      "Republicans argue the changes watered down standards in an effort to artificially inflate performance grades and made it harder to compare Wisconsin students and districts to their peers around the rest of the country. Evers has said Underly made a mistake because she didn't cerate a public dialogue about the changes before she imposed them, but online legislative records indicate he vetoed the bill on Friday morning.",
      "The governor said in his veto message that while he's been critical of the process, he objects to legislators trying to undermine the state superintendent's authority and independence. Evers served as state schools superintendent before he became governor in 2019.",
      "The measure would have required education officials to apply performance levels established by the National Assessment of Educational Process when rating the Wisconsin Forward exam, a standardized English and math test.",
      "They also would have had to use terms from the 2021-22 school year to rate student performance on two other standardized tests, the PreACT and ACT with Writing in English, Reading and Mathematics. The categories would be called \u201cbelow basic,\u201d \u201cbasic,\u201d \u201cproficient\u201d or \u201cadvanced.\u201d DPI now describes student performance levels as \u201cadvanced,\u201d \u201cmeeting,\u201d \u201capproaching\u201d and \u201cdeveloping.\u201d",
      "The state Department of Public Instruction would have had to use the same scoring system for school district report cards as the agency used during the 2019-20 school year.",

    "story": [
      "The centuries-old city of St. Augustine is an enduring reminder of Spain\u2019s long history in Florida, going back generations before the United States even existed",
      "The city of St. Augustine \u2014 with its centuries-old buildings and massive stone fort \u2014 is an enduring reminder of Spain\u2019s storied history in Florida, going back generations before the United States even existed. But for two decades in the 1700s, Great Britain controlled the region, and archeologists have finally found some of their long-sought-after footprints.",
      "City archeologists identified a dry moat last fall of a British redoubt, a fortified military outpost, that had been constructed in 1781. Excavations were completed last month in the city's Lincolnville neighborhood, making way for the construction of a new single-family home.",
      "\u201cSt. Augustine had a 20-year British period,\u201d city archeologist Andrea White said. \u201cThey came, and they built seven of these redoubts, and nobody has ever found any archeologically. We have rough ideas of where they were, and they show up on historic maps. But we\u2019ve never found actual, tangible, archeological evidence for any of them until recently.\u201d",
      "The Spanish military built the Castillo de San Marcos in the late 1600s, and the fort remains on the western shore of Florida's Matanzas Bay, though as a national monument rather than a military installation.",
      "When the British took control of Florida in 1763, St. Augustine already had extensive Spanish-built defenses, but British officers were concerned about an attack from a nearby river and ordered the construction of the outposts along the city's western edge.",
      "White said Britain's relatively brief occupation of St. Augustine, which ended along with the American Revolution in 1783, has been largely forgotten by time, and the discovery of the fort is a way to reclaim a little piece of lost history.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s interesting about these British redoubts, they\u2019re the only defenses that the British built themselves,\u201d White said. \u201cEverything else that\u2019s in St. Augustine or the surrounding area that everyone\u2019s familiar with, those were already built by the Spanish. And then the British just kind of reoccupied them.\u201d",
      "The structure was discovered thanks to a unique archeological preservation ordinance adopted by St. Augustine in 1986, White said. Founded in 1565, the city is the oldest continuously occupied part of the U.S. to previously be a European settlement. To document and preserve that history, St. Augustine has its own archeology program that is part of the city's planning and permitting department.",
      "\u201cWe get a chance to come in and document what\u2019s there prior to construction,\u201d White said. \u201cWe never stop construction, that\u2019s not the goal. It\u2019s just to give us a little bit of time to come in, document what might be there, learn a little bit more about our history, and then the project gets to move forward.\u201d",
      "White knew the area under development had a long history, going back to a Native American mission in the early 1700s, followed later by an agricultural plantation and after the Civil War, the construction of the Lincolnville neighborhood.",
      "\u201cSo we knew we had multiple centuries of history that could potentially be on the property, but we\u2019re pretty excited to actually find evidence,\u201d White said. \u201cWhat we found evidence of was a large moat about 15 feet wide that would have been part of the rampart.\u201d",
      "Researchers found few artifacts at the site and are still unsure about the fort's actual size and shape, but they did recover thousands of different types of seeds. White said they\u2019re working with a paleoethnobotanist, who studies the history of how humans and plants interact, to learn how the structure was built and used. It\u2019s possible that plants like Spanish bayonet or prickly pear cactuses were used to prevent erosion or to slow down attacking soldiers.",
      "\u201cSo we\u2019re very hopeful that we might find some good information from our plant remains that we\u2019ve recovered,\u201d White said.",
      "Jason Heidgerken, the contractor working on the lot where the fort's moat was found, said the city's archeological program can certainly cause delays, but White and her team were great and communicating well, so he could adjust his timelines.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been around St. Augustine since 1980 personally, and part of the attraction is the history,\u201d Heidgerken said. \u201cSo if you want to live there and do this kind of business, it\u2019s to be expected, and you need to have the patience for it.\u201d",
      "Over the past four decades, the city's archeology program has completed more than 1,200 projects. Not only have researchers collected data from Spanish colonial times but also Native American settlements and villages going back 4,000 years.",
      "\u201cI actually think it\u2019s pretty cool what the city does. I\u2019m a history nut myself,\u201d Heidgerken said. \u201cI think it\u2019s pretty neat.\u201d",

      "\"The major takeaway I think people should know about this is no vehicle is 100% US-made,\" he said.",
      "\"The consumer is going to feel it across the board and I really don't think that any automaker is going to be spared from this, Tesla included.\"",

      "Some firms may be able to redirect work to factories in the US, Oxford Economics has suggested, but it warned that such a move was likely to lead to higher prices and \"significantly lower production in the US's main trading partners\".",

      "Ferrari, which ships its cars from Italy, immediately announced a 10% price hike, to help cover the new cost of the duty.",
      "As companies are forced to respond to the 25% tariffs, by raising prices or accepting lower profits, some may decide to pull some models out of the US entirely, leading to fewer choices for American consumers, warned Patrick Anderson, chief executive of the Anderson Economic Group.",
      "This could also lead to carmakers without a current large manufacturing presence in the US, such as Jaguar Land Rover or Porsche, reducing production in their home countries, potentially affecting jobs.",
      "All Mitsubishi cars sold in the US are imported, while Hyundai, which announced plans for a plant in the US earlier this week, ships most of its cars from South Korea.",
      "Trump, who started discussing tariffs on cars in his first term, said his latest tariff enforcement would be permanent, claiming it will boost America's manufacturing base.",

      "Over the past year, Bluesky has gained tens of millions of new users, often at the expense of X.",
      "Apart from just timing, though, BlueSky's success can be largely attributed to its novel architecture, which pairs an X-like experience with a high degree of customization.",
      "Unlike centralized systems, where social media companies have complete control over content and identities, Bluesky users can choose how their feeds are moderated, and what kind of posts the algorithm recommends to them, thanks to the hundreds of options offered by both Bluesky and the community.",
      "Don't like the broader discourse on Bluesky? Jump on the \"popular with friends\" feed to see what the people you follow specifically are talking about.",
      "It will not be simple for Bluesky to scale up to the size of X and Facebook, says Andy Tattersall, an information specialist at the University of Sheffield.",

      "\"Bluesky has created a strong foundation for shared social media infrastructure,\" says Robin Berjonone, one of Free Our Feeds' nine custodians, \"but so long as they are the primary operator of this infrastructure the risk remains that it will stop operating in the public interest\".",
      "A bigger worry for these emerging platforms, though, is the network barrier. This can be summed up with Metcalfe's Law, explains Evan Prodromou, co-author and current editor of ActivityPub, another open social media architecture, which is behind popular platforms like Meta's Threads.",
      "The law states that the value of a network goes up with the square of the number of users. That means that bigger social networks have way more resources than smaller ones. They can use those resources to get bigger and bigger and crowd out smaller social media services.",
      "Non-profits like Free Our Feeds and the Social Web Foundation, which Mr Prodromou heads, have a strategy that they hope will help them overcome that Metcalfe's Law.",
      "They hope to replace the current situation, where users of social media hop between their favourite services.",
      "Instead Social Web Foundation is developing a platform which can offer content from all of them.",
      "Threads for example supports a protocol called ActivityPub, which makes it easier to combine services with other social media firms that use that protocol - like Mastodon for instance.",
      "Using this kind of interoperability, Mr Prodromou hopes that services like Social Web Foundation will provide the same value as giant, monolithic platforms.",
      "It's not straightforward, as not all social media firms support the same protocol, for example, BlueSky uses the AT Protocol.",
      "But there are workarounds to that problem, and Free Our Feeds and Social Web Foundation are also working on ways to aggregate sites that use different tech.",

      "In the last couple of years, a cottage industry of unique, new social apps has cropped.",
      "One of those is Mozi, created by Twitter co-founder Ev Williams. Mozi doesn't want you to socialise online at all.",
      "Instead it informs you when you're going to be in the same place (city or event) as someone you know and encourages you to connect with people more often in person.",
      "\"Until Mozi, no combination of apps could tell me what city my friends are in at any given time, or even what my friends locally are up to,\" says Mozi co-founder, Molly DeWolf Swenson.",
      "Mike McCue, the CEO of Flipboard, is convinced such innovation will result in a new era of social networking, where numerous new, more interesting types of social networks will emerge and offer people more choices.",

      "\"In the end,\" says Mr McCue, \"it's unlikely one service will replace the Facebook or Twitter we once knew, but instead several services will start to take our time away from these old-style single feed experiences, our behaviours will shift with these new choices and new generations will expect more.\"",

      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves has set out her plans for the UK economy in her Spring Statement and is on track to meet her self-imposed rules on the public finances, which she has said are \"non-negotiable\".",
      "On the face of it, that sounds like a good thing. So why are people saying that she may struggle to meet them and the only way she may do so is by raising taxes?",
      "It's a complicated picture, but there are essentially five steps to get from where we are now to tax rises.",
      "Not much spare money",
      "Ahead of the Spring Statement, the chancellor had been under pressure, with speculation over how she would be able to meet her self-imposed financial rules, one of which is to not borrow to fund day-to-day spending.",
      "In October, the government's official economic forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), said that Reeves would be able to meet that rule with \u00a39.9bn to spare.",
      "An increase in government borrowing costs since then meant that that room to spare had disappeared. Now big welfare cuts and spending reductions in the Spring Statement have restored it.",
      "Almost \u00a310bn may sound like a lot, but it's a relatively small amount in an economy that spends \u00a31 trillion a year, and raises around the same in tax.",
      "In fact it is the third lowest margin a chancellor has left themselves since 2010. The average headroom over that time is three times bigger at \u00a330bn.",
      "Warning taxes could still rise despite welfare cuts",
      "Warning taxes could still rise despite welfare cuts",
      "\"It is a tiny fraction of the risks to the outlook,\" Richard Hughes from the OBR told the BBC.",

      "Predicting the future is difficult",
      "Which brings us on to the precarious nature of making economic forecasts.",
      "\"All forecasts turn out to be wrong. Weather forecasts also turn out to be wrong,\" says Mr Hughes.",
      "Predicting what will happen in the future, especially in five years' time is hard, and is subject to revisions. You could be forgiven for not predicting a war or a pandemic, for instance.",
      "The respected think tank, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), has already said there is \"a good chance that economic and fiscal forecasts will deteriorate significantly between now and an Autumn Budget\".",
      "A case in point, only hours after Reeves delivered her statement in parliament, US President Donald Trump announced new 25% tariffs on cars and car parts coming into the US.",
      "Car tariffs a sign worse could come",
      "Reeves admitted the car tariffs would be \"bad for the UK\" but insisted the government was in \"extensive\" talks to avoid them being imposed here.",
      "According to the OBR, these import taxes would have a direct impact on goods totalling around 0.2% of GDP.",
      "Before Trump's announcement, the OBR had warned of the risk of an escalating trade war, and while the proposals do not exactly match the watchdog's worst-case scenario, which would see the UK retaliate, Hughes said it had elements of it.",

      "The war in Ukraine continues, despite Trump's pledge to end it.",
      "The UK, along with Germany, has said it will increase defence spending. Trump has long called for European members of Nato to spend more on defence, and there are also fears that if the US does make a deal with Russia to end the war, that could leave Europe vulnerable.",
      "Domestically, businesses are also facing a worrying time as they brace for a rise in costs in April as employers' National Insurance contributions, the National Living wage and business rates are all set to go up.",
      "Some firms have said they have put off investment decisions as a result, and many have warned of price rises or job cuts. If these materialise, then that will knock growth.",
      "Break the rules or raise taxes",
      "Given all of the above, if the chancellor's headroom were to disappear, why would that matter?",
      "Reeves has staked her reputation on meeting her fiscal rules, pledging to bring \"iron discipline\" and provide stability and reassurance to financial markets, in contrast to former Prime Minister Liz Truss, whose unfunded tax cuts spooked the markets and raised interest rates.",
      "So if she is still to meet her rules and not borrow to fund day-to-day spending, that would mean either more spending cuts or tax rises.",
      "The government has already announced big cuts to the welfare bill as well as plans to cut the civil service and abolish several quangos including NHS England.",
      "But as Paul Dale, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, puts it: \"Non-defence spending can only be cut so far.\"",
      "By leaving herself so little wiggle room and with such a precarious economic outlook, \"we can surely now expect six or seven months of speculation about what taxes might or might not be increased in the autumn,\" says Paul Johnson from the IFS.",

      "That's vastly more than the 20 million who pay for video streaming, but the number of new subscribers is tailing off. About 1.25 million new customers took out a plan last year, said MIDiA, representing growth of 4%. In 2020, that figure was 9%.",
      "MIDiA says the slowdown will lead to higher prices. \"If you're not growing users, what do you do? You get them to pay more,\" said the company's managing director, Mark Mulligan.",
      "Spotify has already bumped up the price of its premium plan in the UK. After years of being held at \u00a39.99, it increased to \u00a310.99 in summer 2024, and \u00a311.99 last May.",

      "Outside of the UK,  MIDiA's latest report showed that the number of people subscribing to music streaming services grew by 11.6% year-on-year.",
      "Most of the growth came from emerging markets in Africa and India. China also extended its lead as the world's biggest streaming market, with 190 million subscribers.",
      "Mulligan predicted that the growth of streaming services outside Europe and America could change the way we listen to music.",
      "\"We'll see a cultural shift where these massive installed bases of streaming users in the global south will shape listening habits in the west.",
      "\"As they become bigger markets, more people [in those countries] will want to become artists, and more people will want to set up record labels.",
      "\"So more music will be made, more music will be exported, and there'll be a sort of cultural rebalancing.\"",

      "Genres like Afrobeats and Amapiano are already hugely popular and, last year, Nigerian star Burna Boy became the first African artist to headline a stadium show in the UK.",
      "South Korea is also a powerhouse - accounting for 45% of all physical albums sold in the last year - while Latin America boasts some of the world's biggest recording artists, including Bad Bunny, Karol G and Peso Pluma.",
      "As a result, the UK's historic musical dominance is waning.",
      "Last year, British musicians failed to appear in the Top 10 of the world's bestselling singles or albums, for the first time in two decades.",
      "\"In basic terms, the democratisation of music that we've seen, thanks to streaming, is wonderful - but it's a very crowded space,\" Victoria Oakley, head of the IFPI, told BBC News.",

    "story": [
      "Easter egg prices have risen by as much as 50% compared to last year, while some have shrunk in size, according to an investigation by Which?.",
      "The price of chocolate has risen by 16.5% in a year, outpacing an overall 4.4% increase in the cost of supermarket food and drink, the consumer group says.",
      "Meanwhile, several treats have been affected by \"shrinkflation\" - when products get smaller but the price does not.",
      "An 80g pouch of Terry's chocolate orange mini eggs cost 99p in Lidl in 2024, Which? said, but was now 70g and cost \u00a31.35 - a net rise of 56%.",
      "A steep fall in global cocoa production driven by unusually warm weather has driven wholesale costs to record highs.",
      "Confectionary companies insist they are trying to maintain both quality and value with the changes.",
      "The Which? investigation found that at Tesco, a Twix white chocolate Easter egg had increased from \u00a35 to \u00a36 year-on-year, while also shrinking from 316g to 258g. In terms of price per 100g, that is a rise of 47%.",
      "It also found a five-pack of mixed 200g Cadbury Creme Eggs sold at Morrisons had increased from \u00a32.62 last year to \u00a34 this year.",
      "Meanwhile, a Nestle Kit Kat Chunky milk chocolate Easter egg stayed at the same price at the supermarket, but was reduced from 129g to 110g - making it 17% more expensive per 100g.",
      "And it was not just Easter chocolate that has seen sharp price rises since last year.",
      "Sainsbury's own-brand Stamford Street Co Milk Chocolate (100g) rose from an average price of 50p to an average of \u00a31.03 - up 108% year-on-year - while Asda's Fruit & Nut Milk Chocolate (200g) went from \u00a31.33 to \u00a32.30 - an increase of 73%.",
      "At Ocado, a 110g bag of Nomo Creamy Choc Buttons rose from \u00a32.43 to \u00a33.97, a 63% increase. The online supermarket said it was doing everything it could to \"keep prices low for our customers\".",
      "The global price of cocoa has risen sharply since 2022, reaching a record high in January this year.",
      "Crops in West Africa - one of the world's main cocoa producing areas - have been particularly affected by unusually dry weather in recent years.",
      "Multiple manufacturers said they had tried to absorb price rises where possible, but that changes to size were inevitable to maintain quality.",
      "Nestle, which produces Kit Kat chocolate, said it was sometimes \"necessary\" to make such adjustments, but cautioned that \"retail pricing is always at the sole discretion of individual retailers\".",
      "A spokesperson for Mars Wrigley, which makes Twix chocolate, said the company wanted to ensure its snacks continued to \"deliver great quality and affordable value for families this Easter\".",
      "Despite increasing prices and shrinkflation, Which? money and retail editor Reena Sewraz suggested it was still possible to get good value Easter eggs.",
      "She said consumers could do so by \"looking for special offers, comparing the price per gram or if you can, hold out until Easter Sunday when many of the eggs are likely to be reduced.\"",

    "summary": "The UK's economic prospects are better than expected, but the forecasts are precarious and could easily be derailed.",
    "story": [
      "The story of this Spring Statement is that welfare has been cut back to make up for a notable rise in the cost of servicing the national debt. There is also a trim to the money being given to government departments.",
      "There is relatively little else actually happening in policy terms. There were no tax rises, no changes to Chancellor Rachel Reeves' borrowing rules and as expected, this was definitely not a Budget.",
      "The real question now is whether the chancellor can escape from a never-ending cycle of microhaggling with the government's independent forecaster the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) in this way, twice a year for the rest of the Parliament.",
      "When asked about whether new tax rises could now come in the Autumn like last year, she said emphatically: \"We'll never have to do a Budget like that again.\"",
      "But the numbers are precarious and extremely sensitive to the economic and political changes around the world.",
      "If the US imposes 20% tariffs on the UK next week, it could lead to a downgrade in UK growth and \"wipe out\" the \u00a39.9bn headroom the chancellor has to meet her borrowing rule, the OBR chairman, Richard Hughes, told me.",
      "Other uncertainties include higher interest rates and lower UK productivity, he said, adding that \"the risks are very elevated\".",
      "That is why growth, confidence, and comprehensive economic strategy is so important.",
      "By June there should be new plans for trade, industry and infrastructure. In the next few weeks, there could be an economic deal with the US, and the start of a Brexit reset with the EU.",
      "Despite the uncertainties, the OBR's judgement on the economy was better than had been expected. This year's growth was downgraded, but close to normal levels of growth are predicted to return in later years.",

      "Bob the Builder bet",
      "The OBR's acknowledgment that the government's planning reforms could significantly boost house building, was seen as a major win in Downing Street.",
      "It's a policy that doesn't involve taxes or spending yet is expected to provide a huge boost to growth.",
      "At this stage this is not about an extra brick being laid or even planning approval, but it is a \"spreadsheet win\" that eased the chancellor's fiscal pain.",
      "This comes as a result of local authority housing targets and council land being freed up.",
      "When the Planning and Infrastructure Bill passes later this year, which strips back judicial reviews, there should be a further increase in predicted growth.",
      "But the test is obviously actual spades and diggers in the ground and architects' plans being approved. This government is now all-in on Bob the Builder.",
      "There was some accountancy-driven cunning. Lists of public defence-related spending up and down the UK came from the unconstrained capital budget for buildings, which is basically exempt from the chancellor's non-negotiable financial rule to only borrow to fund day to day spending.",
      "But the cuts to welfare are very real. The 250,000 increase in people in poverty due to the cuts to health-related benefits does not include the impact of recipients getting new jobs.",
      "The Impact Assessment seems to confirm that the aim of the policy is more about saving cash than fundamental reform.",
      "In this and in other areas questions arise about whether the \"OBR tail wags the policy dog\" - i.e. is this really the way long-term policy should be formed?",
      "The big picture is that all of this becomes a lot easier if growth returns and interest costs calm.",
      "In the dreams of Number 11, while we assume the debate in autumn will be about what further tax rises are required, it is possible that by the time of October's Budget, they may not be needed."

      "As a result,  interest rates, which are used to try and control the rate of rising prices, are expected to remain higher than previously thought.",
      "Overall, however, living standards are expected to improve.",
      "This is measured by real household disposable income which is expected to rise by just over 2% between now and 2030. That means on average you are expected to be \u00a3500 a year better off by 2030. However, this is relatively small by historical standards.",
      "Remember, these are only forecasts. They may be wrong and are subject to change.",
      "There's likely to be more speculation about the future of tax-free allowances in Individual Savings Accounts (Isas). The government says it is \"looking at options for reforms\" to encourage investing money.",
      "3. Jobs and services cut or created",
      "Forecasts about the general state of the economy will also influence the decisions the chancellor chooses to make and this could directly affect you.",
      "For example, official forecasts about economic growth this year have been halved from 2% to 1%, but are higher in subsequent years owing, in part, to the government's housebuilding programme.",

      "Three ways the changes could affect you and your money",
      "There had been a question mark over whether the OBR would factor the government's planning reforms into its forecasts for economic growth.",
      "However, in her Spring Statement, Chancellor Rachel Reeves confirmed the watchdog had considered and scored changes to the National Planning Policy Framework published in December.",
      "The OBR said the reforms could boost housebuilding by 170,000 over the next five years, resulting in 1.3 million new homes across the UK by 2029/30, a 16% increase.",
      "It added that the number of new homes annually was projected to reach a 40-year high of 305,000.",
      "The watchdog estimated the boost to housebuilding as a result of the reforms would increase the size of the UK economy by 0.2% by 2029/30, worth around \u00a36.8bn in today's prices.",
      "The government said this was the biggest positive effect on growth from a  \"zero-cost policy\" the OBR had ever forecast.",
      "The boost to economic growth is driven by factors including higher productivity in the construction sector, more people paying rent and making it easier for people to move for work.",
      "The OBR said the increase in supply would lead to a small reduction in average house prices of around 0.9% by 2029/30.",
      "Experts said while the boost from planning reforms was welcome there needed to be more focus on first-time buyers who are struggling to get on the housing ladder.",
      "Felicity Barnett, from the Mortgage Advice Bureau, said many prospective homeowners were \"trapped by strict affordability criteria\" and needed more accessible options.",
      "Aynsley Lammin, an analyst at Investec, said a good economic backdrop, favourable interest rates and policies to help first-time buyers were needed to boost demand.",
      "He added that the government would also need to invest in affordable homes.",
      "Under the government's new planning framework previously developed land - known as \"brownfield\" sites - will be prioritised for new homes.",
      "But ministers have acknowledged this will not be enough to meet the government's target.",
      "Councils will also be ordered to review green belt boundaries - which were created to prevent urban sprawl - by identifying lower-quality \"grey belt\" land that can be built on.",
      "Building will be allowed on higher quality green belt land if developers provide the necessary infrastructure and guarantee affordable housing, as well as access to green spaces.",

    "story": [
      "UK inflation fell by more than expected in February, driven by a drop in clothing and shoe prices due to an unusually high number of sales.",
      "Inflation decreased to 2.8%, down from a rate of 3% in January, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).",
      "The latest figures come ahead of Chancellor Rachel Reeves' Spring Statement, where she will set out her economic plans.",
      "Grant Fitzner, chief economist at the ONS, said women's clothing \"was the biggest driver for this month's fall\".",
      "\"This was only partially offset by small increases, for example, from alcoholic drinks\", he added.",
      "Overall prices for clothing and footwear fell in the year to February for the first time since 2021, with children's clothing and accessories such as hats and scarves also having an impact.",
      "The ONS said another factor was an unseasonably high number of clothing sales. Discounting usually drops off in February as January sales end and spring ranges enter the shops, but that did not happen this year.",
      "Economists polled by Reuters had expected that inflation - which measures the rate at which prices rise  - would dip to 2.9% in February. However, despite the bigger than expected fall, the figure is still above the Bank of England's target of 2%.",
      "The rate of price rises is also expected to increase in the months ahead, with council tax and energy and water bills all set to rise in April.",
      "In addition, a recent survey from the ONS found that almost a half of businesses are considering price rises as they brace for next month's tax rises and increase in the National Living Wage.",
      "Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the Bank of England was unlikely to cut rates at its next meeting because February's fall was \"not an enormous change\" and inflation \"is still significantly above target\",",
      "\"Although policymakers won't want to keep rates too high for too long given the stagnation in the economy, they are set to stay cautious with a rate cut looking more likely to come in June and another later in the year\", she said.",
      "'Stagflation' fears",
      "Reeves will address Parliament with her Spring Statement in Parliament on Wednesday afternoon, with further cuts to welfare spending expected.",
      "She is also expected to confirm a downgrade to official economic growth predictions.",
      "Some economists have raised concerns about the possibility of 'stagflation', where prices rise faster than the central bank's target but the economy fails to grow.",
      "\"Economic growth is miniscule and risks going backwards, but should inflation continue to refuse to get back near the 2% target, it is difficult to see what the Bank of England can do with interest rates,\" said Lindsay James from wealth manager Quilter.",
      "Chief Secretary to the Treasury Darren Jones said the government's \"number one mission is kickstarting growth\" and pledged to go \"further and faster on growth through our plan for change\".",
      "Shadow chancellor Mel Stride said the Conservatives left government in July \"with inflation bang on target\" and urged Reeves take \"urgent action\" in her Spring Statement or \"working families will continue to pay the price\".",
      "The Liberal Democrats said the inflation figure \"will be of no comfort to the millions of families across the country who are struggling\"."

      "Ticketmaster \"may have misled Oasis fans\" with unclear pricing when it put their reunion tour on sale last year, the UK's competition watchdog has said.",
      "The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said the company may have breached consumer protection law by selling \"platinum\" tickets for almost 2.5 times the standard price, without explaining they came with no additional benefits.",
      "\"This risked giving consumers the misleading impression that platinum tickets were better,\" it said in an update to its investigation into Ticketmaster.",
      "The CMA has instructed Ticketmaster to change the way it labels tickets and reveals prices to fans in the future. Ticketmaster said it \"welcomed\" the advice.",
      "\"At Ticketmaster, we strive to provide the best ticketing platform through a simple, transparent and consumer-friendly experience,\" a spokesperson told the BBC, via email.",
      "\"We welcome the CMA's input in helping make the industry even better for fans.\"",
      "Dynamic pricing denied",
      "More than 900,000 tickets were sold for Oasis's long-awaited reunion tour, when they went on sale on 31 August last year",
      "But many fans were left out of pocket, when standard standing tickets advertised at \u00a3135 plus fees were re-labelled \"in demand\" and changed on Ticketmaster to \u00a3355 plus fees.",
      "Amid the fall-out, Oasis issued a statement saying they had no \"awareness that dynamic pricing was going to be used\" in the sale of tickets for the initial dates.",
      "The CMA launched its investigation in September, to examine whether Ticketmaster had engaged in \"unfair commercial practices,\" and whether fans were pressured to buy tickets within a short period of time.",
      "Ticketmaster subsequently denied using \"dynamic pricing\" to manipulate prices.",
      "\"We don't change prices in any automated or algorithmic way,\" the company's UK director, Andrew Parsons, told MPs last month.",
      "He maintained that all prices are determined by artist teams and promoters - although, in the case of Oasis, the promoter, SJM Concerts, has ties to Ticketmaster's parent company, Live Nation.",
      "Changes requested",
      "The CMA did not comment on the issue of dynamic pricing, but said that Ticketmaster made it difficult for Oasis fans to make \"informed choices\".",
      "For example, it said, customers did not know that there were \"two categories of standing tickets at different prices, with all of the cheaper standing tickets sold first\".",
      "This resulted in \"many fans waiting in a lengthy queue without understanding what they would be paying and then having to decide whether to pay a higher price than they expected,\" the CMA continued.",
      "The watchdog acknowledged that Ticketmaster had made some changes to its business practices since the Oasis sale last August.",
      "However, it said, \"the CMA does not currently consider these changes are sufficient to address its concerns\".",
      "\"We now expect Ticketmaster to work with us to address these concerns so, in future, fans can make well-informed decisions when buying tickets,\" said Hayley Fletcher, interim senior director of consumer protection.",

      "A spokesperson repeated a quote given by culture secretary Lisa Nandy earlier this year, when the government announced plans to cap the price at which tickets can be resold.",
      "\"The chance to see your favourite musicians or sports teams live is something that all of us enjoy... But for too long fans have had to endure the misery of touts hoovering up tickets for resale at vastly inflated prices.",
      "\"We've also seen cases where a lack of transparency has meant customers have been caught unawares by last minute price rises for high demand events.\"",

    "story": [
      "Pizza Hut workers are accusing a franchise of ''blatantly unlawful'' behaviour alleging it has altered timesheets, docked wages and stopped payments per delivery.",
      "Glenshire Group which runs all 22 Pizza Hut delivery outlets in Scotland has been served with a grievance by the Unite union on behalf of drivers who claim they were told of changes by text with no consultation.",
      "Delivery driver, Cian, told the BBC that Glenshire had shown ''a complete disdain for their staff and their customers'' and said it was ''quite honestly abysmal''.",
      "Glenshire said it is \"absolutely committed to robust employment practices\" and said it is \"listening to our colleagues, to understand where there are concerns\".",
      "Cian, 30, has been delivering pizzas in the west of Glasgow for more than two years. An employee of Pizza Hut franchise, Glenshire Group, he has always been paid the National Living Wage plus a fee of \u00a31.45 per delivery.",
      "But he said his terms and conditions were changed without consultation or warning.",
      "He said two weeks ago he and several other drivers were told via text message that his pay had increased to \u00a312.21 an hour but he had lost his \u00a31.45 delivery payments, or what the company calls \"discretionary driver commissions\".",
      "''The \u00a31.45 would pay for my fuel and a tiny bit of the running cost of my car but I've been living paycheque to paycheque,\" he told the BBC.",
      "\"We had multiple drivers just quit because they simply can't afford to do this job if they're having to pay for their own fuel. There's one shop that has lost every single one of their drivers.''",
      "In a letter to staff dated 10 March, seen by the BBC, Glenshire said: \"We have removed discretionary driver commissions with effect from today. This change is necessary to ensure the sustainability of our operations.\"",
      "The letter does not state that the company has any plans in place to ensure drivers' expenses will be paid by Glenshire.",
      "In a statement to the BBC, the company said that ''driver commissions have not been reduced, rather the remuneration model has changed from a 'per delivery' amount to a 'per mile' basis\".",
      "'Attempt to offload drivers'",
      "Unite's head of hospitality, Bryan Simpson has accused Glenshire of ''a cynical attempt to offload over 100 drivers'' before the rise in employers' National Insurance Contributions (NICs), the National Minimum Wage (NMW) and the National Living Wage on 1 April.",
      "Among the increases next month, the National Living Wage for people aged 21 and over will rise from \u00a311.44 to \u00a312.21.",
      "\"I have never seen something so blatantly unlawful occur, even in an industry, frankly, that is not known for decent workers rights. This is the worst that I've came across in over a decade,\" Mr Simpson said.",
      "He said the loss of drivers' commission per delivery could effectively mean that \"these workers are going to be brought below the minimum wage.",
      "\"They're going to be losing thousands of pounds a year. So, as far as we are concerned, this is fire and rehire under a different name.''",
      "'Not worth me keeping my job'",
      "Unite's grievance, seen exclusively by the BBC, also accused Glenshire of acting ''fraudulently'' by going into old staff timesheets and retroactively adding unpaid 20 minute rest breaks.",
      "In a text message seen by the BBC, Glenshire director Zibby Ghafoor told store managers ''all time sheets have been deleted for last week..can we please add breaks in.\"",
      "Unite claims Glenshire unlawfully deducted these breaks from their wages.",
      "In its statement, Glenshire said that there have been \"no changes to break policies\".",
      "A manager called Adam, not his real name, said he works for hours on his own in his store. He said it's simply not possible to take breaks.",
      "\"You do not get your 20 minutes of uninterrupted time ever...so not only do we not get breaks, we now get charged for the breaks that we don't take.''",
      "Cian says it's his ''civic duty'' to speak out even though he knows it could put him at risk of losing his job. ''I'm trying to help people who can't stand up for themselves, because the way the Glenshire group have treated everyone is abysmal. The long term ramifications of what they are doing, it's just not worth me keeping my job.''",
      "Glenshire Group employs more than 200 staff including more than 100 delivery drivers although over the last few days, the BBC understands several have quit.",
      "In the 10 March letter to staff, Glenshire said that with the increases in employer NICs and the National Living Wage rise on 1 April it was having to \"reassess our driver delivery model in order to retain business viability\".",
      "It also said drivers could choose to switch from being employed to self-employed.",
      "The letter stressed this would be a voluntary choice and would not be compulsory. Glenshire last night told the BBC there were \"no blanket changes to self-employed contracts taking place\".",
      "Call to investigate",
      "Employment lawyer Joanne Moseley of Irwin Mitchell warned that from 1 April, when the new National Living Wage is introduced, Glenshire could be in breach of minimum wage regulations.",
      "\"If Glenshire doesn't reimburse its drivers for payments they've incurred in connection with their employment - in this case their petrol expenses - they will be in breach of the NMW regulations. HMRC will investigate and has the power to impose financial penalties,\" she says.",
      "Adam called on bosses of the Pizza Hut company to investigate the Glenshire franchise.",
      "\"Please be aware of what this company are doing to your brand. Please be aware of what they're doing to the staff and all for their own benefit, all to save them money,\" he said.",
      "A spokesperson for Pizza Hut UK said: \"Pizza Hut is deeply committed to ensuring a safe and fair working environment for all employees and as such has strict policies in place that its franchise businesses must adhere to.",
      "\"Although Glenshire Group operates as an independent franchisee and is ultimately responsible for its own employment practices, we take these allegations seriously.",

      "Higher-end imported vehicles, such as Audis, BMWs and Mercedes, will increase in price, too, Prof Heitmann said, though many of those who buy from such brands might be able to absorb a heftier price tag.",
      "A 2024 study by the US International Trade Commission predicted that a 25% tariff on imports would reduce imports by almost 75%, while increasing average prices in the US by about 5%.",

      "But the tariffs are likely to impact the domestic car industry as well.",
      "US auto manufacturing has been deeply intertwined with industries in Canada and Mexico for decades. Parts criss-cross the borders several times before they are assembled, which means that even a vehicle as iconically American as a Ford pickup truck could see a sticker price increase.",

      "The US president's deadline to impose reciprocal tariffs on trading partners will come just days after he hit foreign carmakers with 25% import taxes.",
      "Vietnam could be particularly vulnerable to Trump's latest salvo of levies. It has a large trade deficit with the US and has been a beneficiary of firms moving factories out of China to avoid measures announced during his first term in office.",
      "While some countries have hit back at Washington, Vietnam's Prime Minister, Pham Minh Chinh, has suggested that he may take a more diplomatic approach.",
      "Speaking in January, he said he was willing to visit Trump's Mar-a-Lago home in Florida and \"golf all day long\" if it benefits his country, drawing laughter in the room.",
      "And that idea may not be too far-fetched. The Trump Organization is planning to invest billions of dollars in golf courses, hotels and real estate in Vietnam, according to the Reuters news agency.",
      "The first project will reportedly be a residential complex with three 18-hole golf courses, which will break ground in May.",
      "The BBC has contacted the company and its Vietnamese partner for comment.",
      "But could golf diplomacy really work?",
      "'Bamboo' economics",
      "Trump has previously said Vietnam was \"worse than China\" and \"almost the single worst abuser of anybody\".",
      "But he has not yet specifically targeted Vietnam with tariffs, even though it has the third largest trade deficit with the US, after China and Mexico.",
      "Analysts say Vietnam is doing well at engaging with Washington - but its efforts may still not be enough to avoid most of Trump's tariff plans.",
      "\"The Vietnam PM seems to be taking a page from the book of [former Japanese PM] Shinzo Abe, who built a close personal relationship with Trump over their shared love of golf,\" said Stephen Olson, a former US trade negotiator.",
      "\"I would not however expect any special treatment of Vietnam from a policy point of view. Personal relationships are important to Trump, but in this case, I believe his desire to appear tough on trade will win out.\"",
      "Vietnam has said it doesn't plan to \"restrict trade\" with the US, although it currently taxes some imports from there.",
      "The government said this week that it will allow SpaceX, which is owned by close Trump ally Elon Musk, to operate its Starlink satellite internet service in the country on a trial basis.",
      "Some analysts see this as one of the measures Vietnam has taken to avoid being hit with US tariffs.",
      "Hanoi also said it will lower tariffs on several US imports, including energy and cars, a move aimed at \"improving trade balances\".",
      "It came less than two weeks after Vietnamese and US companies signed more than $4bn (\u00a35.4bn) in deals, in areas including oil and gas exploration.",
      "Steve Norris from the consultancy Control Risks said \"Vietnam is being careful to avoid any moves which would signal any non-cooperation on trade issues\".",
      "This strategy is in line with its foreign policy approach - known as \"bamboo diplomacy\". Like shoots of plants that sway with the wind, Vietnam hopes to be adaptable to foreign pressures.",
      "\"If the US were to increase pressure on Vietnam, the government might respond with offers to facilitate investments in the hospitality and casino industries, undertake advanced machinery purchases, and \u2013 capturing the moment \u2013 consider access to Vietnam's rare earth minerals,\" Mr Norris said.",
      "What about China?",
      "One big factor working against Vietnam is concerns about China's influence.",
      "Vietnam was one of the biggest beneficiaries of US-China tensions during Trump's first term.",
      "In 2018, he hit China with tariffs, causing some businesses to rethink where they made their products. Some chose to shift manufacturing to Vietnam.",
      "This has led to an increase of exports from Vietnam to the US, with Chinese companies that have moved production there contributing to that figure.",
      "Former US trade negotiator Wendy Cutler said Vietnam has emerged as a \"destination for major Chinese investment\".",
      "While the US remains Vietnam's biggest export market, China is its largest supplier of goods, accounting for more than a third of imports, according to the latest official data.",
      "Chinese firms were also behind nearly one in every three new investments in Vietnam last year.",
      "\"These are huge red flags for Trump. My expectation is that Vietnam will at some point be hit hard by tariffs,\" Mr Olson said.",
      "However, tariffs on Vietnam could impact US businesses such as tech firms Apple and Intel, and sportswear giant Nike, which have moved production lines from China to Vietnam.",
      "A recent survey by the American Chamber of Commerce in Vietnam found that most US manufacturers there expect to lay off staff if tariffs are imposed.",
      "The US president believes the levies will boost his country's economy by encouraging more businesses to make goods in the US and bring in billions of dollars of taxes.",
      "But many economists have warned that it could force up prices for American consumers and negatively impact global trade.",
      "What comes next?",
      "Washington is also concerned about so-called \"trans-shipments\" - Chinese goods passing through Vietnam on their way to other countries.",
      "US officials have been \"quietly stressing to Vietnam that it must reduce its trade surplus over time and combat the trans-shipment of Chinese goods through the country,\" Mr Norris said.",
      "Vietnam's prime minister has said he is confident that his administration can \"handle the relationship with the US\".",
      "Now that the South East Asian nation has cut some tariffs on US goods they may be more attractive to Vietnamese consumers, increasing America's share of trade with the country.",
      "And then there is golf - playing a game with Trump had worked for the late Japanese leader Shinzo Abe.",
      "Abe and Trump established a friendship, which included many golf games over several years. The friendship arguably helped Abe secure tariff exemptions for Japan's critical car industry at the time.",

    "summary": "Shares in technology firms have both fallen and risen sharply over the past year.",
    "story": [
      "We have all heard of carmaker Ford, but what about its one-time rivals Abbot-Detroit, Acme, Adams and Aerocar?",
      "No? Well that is hardly surprising because unlike Ford they all went bust very early on. And they are just some of the failed car companies starting with the letter \"A\".",
      "We only remember the winners who went on to dominate the world's motor industry, and the current high-tech sector is much the same.",
      "A great many investors backed the wrong horseless carriages around a century ago and lost their money. Only a few picked Ford or Chrysler, which is almost exactly what is happening now, only to the tech sector.",
      "Tech shares have been hugely volatile over the past year, as has been widely reported, with share price graphs often looking like rollercoaster rides, even before President Trump's tariffs have caused wider stocks falls.",
      "Nvidia shares sink as Chinese AI app spooks markets",
      "Tesla's challenges run deeper than 'toxic' controversy around Elon Musk",
      "US tech firms feel pinch from China tariffs",
      "A principle reason for this tech sector volatility, according to Elroy Dimson, professor of finance at the University of Cambridge, is that like the once nascent car industry we don't know which tech firms will win in the long run.",
      "\"If you go back to the beginning of the last century there were an awful lot of motor companies, and it was clear that automobiles were going to make a huge difference,\" says Prof Dimson. \"But almost every company went bankrupt, you didn't know which company you should be buying.\"",
      "Then, of course, not all high-tech businesses are making money. The measure of the return on an investment in shares uses two factors, the growth in profits or dividends, and the growth in the value of the shares.",
      "Boring companies might pay reliable dividends and see their shares gradually increase in value. But many high-tech companies are not paying out much if anything in dividends. Instead, they are investing in future growth, and so their share prices fluctuate based on hopes of future profits.",
      "As Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at UK financial services firm Hargreaves Lansdown, puts it: \"Tech shares are more volatile, they have high valuations and their price-earnings ratios are very high, and growth stocks are more sensitive to interest rate movements.\"",
      "But also, investors in such shares are, as Ms Streeter puts it, gambling on \"not jam today but jam tomorrow\". They are all trying to pick the next future big winner, not the one paying out profits now, but the one that will eventually pay huge dividends sometime in the future.",
      "So, any news or even suggestion that future growth is not going to be as good as previously expected means share values can collapse.",
      "On the other hand, any good news boosts share prices even if current profits, or even losses, don't change at all, as investors pile into what they think is the future winner. The shares are more volatile because they are not underwritten by current profits or dividends.",
      "That means as Prof Dimson puts it, \"that small changes in growth expectation can lead to large changes in share value\", which can effect a large number of companies at the same time.",
      "\"You have companies that are reasonably similar, so when growth rates change it is effecting quite a few companies in a similar way,\" he says.",
      "\"This is not different from the dotcom boom at the beginning of the 2000s. There were companies with huge growth prospects. And when the growth prospects disappeared, these were the companies that disappeared.\"",
      "Also, even today there are not that many really large high-tech companies. In America they are colloquially known as the \"magnificent seven\" - Nvidia, a chipmaker, Alphabet, which owns Google, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Meta, the parent of Facebook, and Tesla.",
      "So, it does not take much to spook the market, especially since several of these firms are really quite young, and are dominant in sectors where previous leaders have crashed and burned. Anyone remember Ericsson, Boo or Compaq?",
      "Technology, unlike say steel production or food manufacturing, is changing at a very rapid rate, and there is obviously the chance that a new high-tech company will come along and destroy the business model of its most established rivals.",
      "There is simply no guarantee that today's \"magnificent seven\" will remain magnificent or even stay as the same seven firms.",
      "Take Tesla for example, its sales have recently fallen in response to two widely-reported factors. Firstly, some potential customers are opposed to Tesla owner Elon Musk's involvement in President Trump's government. And secondly, Chinese electric car firms such as BYD are increasingly strong competitors.",
      "Meanwhile, Nvidia saw its share price drop sharply at the start of this year following the release of Chinese artificial intelligence chatbot DeepSeek.  This app was reportedly created at a fraction of the cost of its rivals.",
      "The instant popularity of DeepSeek has raised questions about the future of America's AI dominance and the scale of investments US firms are planning. This concerns Nvidia because it is at the forefront of making microchips for AI processing.",
      "AI is now the biggest tech game in town, and it seems that absolutely everyone is claiming that AI is transforming their industry, their products and their profits. They can't all be right.",
      "Or as Prof Dimon puts it: \"At least in 1910 you knew what automobiles did, but today with AI companies you have to rely on the wisdom of the crowd, and for AI companies that isn't good enough.\"",
      "And not all AI firms can win, adds Robert Whaley, professor of finance at Vanderbilt University in Tennessee. \"AI is certainly contributing to tech volatility. The race is on.\"",
      "That means that AI shares are sensitive to predictions. And any sign that a particular firm is lagging in the AI race may mean that lots of investors, most of whom don't understand the subject, abandon it for another that seems to be further ahead.",
      "Then there are investors who seemingly don't seem to care which companies' shares they buy, so long as they are in the \"booming\" high-tech sector, as they are speculating and spreading their risks.",
      "In short, share prices are not always a rational measure of a firm's value, especially in the high-tech sector, or even of its prospects. Instead, they can represent the optimism of investors. And optimism does not always last.",
      "It is often short-lived, passing, and faddish. And sometimes optimism comes face to face with reality or just plain fades away. It is, in short, volatile.",

      "More importantly for bitcoin mining - it's cheap.",
      "So cheap it made business sense for Philip's Kenya-based company Gridless to drag its shipping container full of delicate bitcoin mining computers across bumpy narrow roads 14 hours from the nearest major city to set up here.",
      "Each machine makes about $5 (\u00a33.90) a day. More if the price of coins is high, less if it drops.",
      "Occasionally Philip glances down at his smart watch - the home screen showing the ever-changing squiggly line of bitcoin's dollar value.",
      "At the moment it's around $80,000 a coin, but Philip says they can make a profit even when the value of the bitcoin goes low thanks to the cheap electricity on the site and the partnership they have with the energy company.",
      "\"We recognised that in order to get better mining economics we needed to partner with the power company here and give them a revenue share. And so the reason we're willing to come out here somewhere so remote is it allows us to effectively get cheaper power,\" he says.",
      "Zengamina hydro-power plant is huge but technically it's a mini grid - a standalone island of power for the local community.",
      "It was built in the early 2000s thanks to $3m raised from charity donations.",
      "British-Zambian Daniel Rea runs the site after his missionary family led the building project, primarily to power the local hospital.",
      "Now it provides power for around 15,000 people in the local area but the project hasn't been able to make ends meet because of slow take-up from the community.",
      "Allowing the bitcoiners to set up shop here has been transformational to the business.",
      "\"Every day we were wasting over half of the energy we could generate which also meant we're not earning from that to meet our operating expenses. We needed a major user of power in the area and that's where the game-changing partnership with Gridless came in,\" Daniel says.",
      "The bitcoin mine now accounts for around 30% of the plant's revenue allowing them to keep the prices down for the local town.",
      "Bitcoin and its economics are of course far from the minds of the people in Zengamina.",
      "The town itself is a few miles from the plant and comprises not much more than a few dozen shed-like buildings peppering a cross roads.",
      "Only one shop has a fridge and a dozen kids crowd around a communal computer taking turns to choose a song to blare out, causing adults to wince as they go about their day.",
      "Although the hydro-electric plant came online in 2007, it took a few more years to connect it to the local town, and then more time to connect individual homes and businesses.",
      "So, some people like barber Damian are still enjoying the novelty of getting wired up only a year and a half ago.",
      "\"Until I got power I had nothing and couldn't do anything.  When I got power I bought everything at the same time.\"",
      "He's not joking. At night his tiny barber shop is a beacon of power with a TV playing music videos, strings of Christmas lights and the buzz of his hair clipper. Like moths, young people hang out in his barber shop like a youth hostel.",
      "\"Getting power has changed my life,\" he smiles. \"The money I'm earning now from the barbershop is helping me pay for school fees again.\"",
      "Embracing electricity is very much a business decision for Damian. At home he shares one light bulb between the two rooms that make up the small house.",
      "Elsewhere in the town sisters Tumba and Lucy Machayi sit on the crossroads watching the world go by.",
      "Like many young people, they're glued to their phones.",
      "\"Before the town got power, it was basically just the bush,\" says Lucy.",
      "The little electricity they had used to come from small solar panels, they say.",

      "Finding locations for a new plant or to tap into existing ones is the easy part though.",
      "The company still faces resistance from some authorities and companies which see bitcoin as an energy-greedy and selfish use of electricity that might otherwise be used by rural people.",
      "But the company insists that the incentive is always to sell to the highest buyer and that will always, they say, be the local community.",
      "History tells us that without incentives or rules in place, bitcoin mining at scale can put strain on public energy grids. In Kazakhstan in 2020-2021 a mining boom increased energy usage in the country by 7% before the government clamped down and clipped the wings of the burgeoning industry.",
      "In the US - bitcoin mining's new mecca - conflicts between miners, locals and residents have been common when electricity is in high demand.",
      "Authorities have created agreements with some mining giants to ensure that they power down their warehouses chock full of computers at times when the grid needs balancing.",
      "For example, Greenidge gas power plant in New York which was renovated to mine bitcoin was mandated to power down mining in January to supply electricity to the grid during a cold snap.",

    "summary": "The dispute centres on whether it is acceptable to age and bottle the spirit overseas.",
    "story": [
      "Rum is a key part of Jamaica's cultural identity, but what exactly makes a rum Jamaican?",
      "That question is at the centre of a dispute that is continuing to rumble on the Caribbean island, as some producers wish to strengthen rules on what can, and cannot, be called \"Jamaica rum\".",
      "In October of last year, Jamaica's Intellectual Property Office (JIPO) approved amendments to the geographical indication (GI) designation for Jamaica Rum that was originally set up in 2016. The biggest change is that ageing the rum overseas is now prohibited.",
      "The amendment was called for by the Spirits Pool Association (SPA), the trade organisation that seeks to speak as a single voice for Jamaica's six rum distilleries - Appleton (which is owned by J Wray and Nephew), Clarendon, Hampden Estate, Long Pond, New Yarmouth and Worthy Park Estate.",
      "The SPO's argument is that a stronger GI is needed for the appellation to be officially recognised in its two key export markets \u2013 the EU and the US.",
      "It says this would give Jamaican rum better protection against competitors, and lead to more drinkers recognising it as a premium product made to high specifications in a certain geographic location.",
      "But the amendment has caused quite a stir in Jamaica, because one of the biggest producers claims it would put it out of business.",
      "This company, National Rums of Jamaica (NRJ), owns Long Pond and 73% of Clarendon. NRJ is comprised of three shareholders \u2013 the government of Jamaica, Demerara Distillers of Guyana and the Barbados-based West Indies Rum Distillery (Wird).",
      "The key factor is that Wird has since 2017 been owned by French spirits firm Maison Ferrand. Its business model relies heavily on exporting rum in bulk and ageing overseas - something not allowed under Jamaica's new GI.",
      "It argues that rum aged outside of Jamaica is still Jamaican rum, and that the island has exported and aged rum abroad for centuries.",
      "And so, the NRJ is appealing the ruling of JIPO, with a hearing scheduled for 28 April.",
      "The Spirits Pool Association says that Wird only started to have issues with the geographical indication after its takeover by Maison Ferrard.",
      "\"What we're saying is, if you truly believe in Jamaica rum, age it in Jamaica,\" says Christopher Gentles, general manager of the SPA.",
      "Rum is typically made by fermenting and then distilling sugarcane molasses, the thick treacle-like substance leftover after refined sugar has been produced from the harvested plants.",
      "Mr Gentles says that ageing the rum before it is sold is of paramount importance, and that doing so outside of Jamaica invalidates the products authenticity and uniqueness. And so, he adds that \"we were a little bit puzzled\" by the NRJ's objection.",
      "The SPA also points out that exporting and ageing spirits overseas means Jamaica misses out on the value-added processes like refining, bottling, labelling and distributing as well as other secondary benefits to the local economy like rum tourism.",
      "Both the NRJ and Maison Ferrard declined to comment.",
      "India's spirited rum revolution",
      "From 'hellish liquor' to premium product",
      "Is rum about to become the new gin?",
      "The use of GIs makes a product distinctive, and opens up three potential sources of value, according to Dev Gangjee, professor of intellectual property law at the University of Oxford.",
      "\"The first is simply a price premium. Research shows products can charge a price that is 1.5 to 2.7 times more than standard.\"",
      "This isn't always reflected in profit as GI products are often more expensive to make, he adds.",
      "The second reason is \"they anchor production in that region\". This stops a product from becoming generic and losing its value - like cheddar cheese, which was originally from a specific part of the UK but is now a by-word for a generalised type of cheese.",

    "summary": "The former banker may not have been elected to office before, but is now seeking a mandate from Canadians.",
    "story": [
      "The former Bank of England boss, Mark Carney, became Canada's prime minister after he was sworn in this month. Now he will fight to stay in the job after calling a snap general election which will see Canadians go to the polls on 28 April.",
      "Carney was the first non-British person to take on the top banking role in the central bank's more than 300-year history. He had previously steered his home country through the 2008 financial crash as the governor of the Bank of Canada.",
      "Unlike most PM-hopefuls, Carney has never held political office. Still, he handily won the Liberal Party contest to replace outgoing Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in early March.",
      "Now he is touting his experience handling global economic crises, hoping Canadians will see him as the leader mostly likely to stand up to US President Donald Trump who has launched a trade war on his northern neighbour.",
      "Carney wins race to succeed Trudeau as PMA simple guide to Canada's federal electionHow Trump's threats have changed everything about Canada's politics",
      "Carney wins race to succeed Trudeau as PM",
      "A simple guide to Canada's federal election",
      "How Trump's threats have changed everything about Canada's politics",
      "Early life and childhood",
      "Although Carney has travelled the globe, working in places like New York, London and Tokyo, he was born in the remote northern town of Fort Smith, in the Northwest Territories.",
      "With three out of four grandparents hailing from County Mayo in Ireland, Carney holds both Irish and Canadian citizenship. He got British citizenship in 2018, but recently said he intends to relinquish his British and Irish citizenship because he thinks the prime minister should only hold Canadian citizenship.",
      "The son of a high-school principal, he went to Harvard University on scholarship where he played the most Canadian of sports, ice hockey.",
      "In 1995, he earned his PhD in economics from Oxford University, where he wrote his thesis on whether domestic competition can make an economy more nationally competitive - a subject that is sure to come up as Canada works to make internal trade easier in the face of American tariffs.",
      "\"Mark was an extraordinarily versatile student, rapidly mastering new approaches, perspectives and challenges,\" recalled his former doctoral supervisor Meg Meyer, in a press release sent by the university after Carney won the leadership race.",
      "\"These skills will undoubtedly serve him well as he leads Canada during these turbulent times.\"",
      "Previous experience",
      "In 2003, he left the private sector to join the Bank of Canada as a deputy governor, then worked for the Department of Finance as senior associate deputy minister.",
      "In 2007, he was appointed governor of the Bank of Canada, shortly before global markets crashed, sending the country into a deep recession. His leadership at the central bank is widely praised for helping the country avoid the worst of the crisis.",
      "Although central bankers are notoriously circumspect, he was open about his intentions to keep interest rates low for at least a year, after dramatically cutting them.",
      "That move would be credited for helping businesses keep investing even when the markets sank. He would go on to take a similar approach when he was lured back to London - this time as the governor of the Bank of England.",
      "He is credited with modernising the Bank, appearing much more frequently in the media than his predecessor.",
      "In 2015, the Bank reduced the number of interest rate meetings from 12 to eight a year, and started publishing minutes alongside the announcement of interest rate decisions.",
      "Interest rates were anchored at historic lows when he took over, but he introduced a policy of \"forward guidance\", where the Bank would try to further support the economy and encourage lending by pledging not to raise rates until unemployment fell below 7%.",
      "Confusion about this policy saw an MP compare him to an \"unreliable boyfriend\", a moniker that stuck around long after the original controversy died down.",
      "Unlike previous governors who generally kept a low profile, he made controversial interventions ahead of two big constitutional referendums.",
      "In 2014 he warned that an independent Scotland might have to surrender powers to the UK if it wanted to continue using the pound.",
      "Before the Brexit referendum, he warned that a vote to leave the EU could spark a recession.",
      "In the wake of the leave vote, after David Cameron resigned as prime minister and the pound plunged, he addressed the nation in a bid to reassure the country that the financial system would operate as normal.",
      "He described it as his \"toughest day\" on the job, but said the contingency plans the Bank put in place worked effectively.",
      "The Bank later cut interest rates from 0.5% to 0.25% - and restarted its quantitative easing programme to support the economy.",
      "His final week in March 2020 saw the start of the acutest phase of the Covid pandemic - the Bank cut rates by 0.5% to support the economy, and Carney told the country that the economic shock \"should be temporary\".",
      "Crossing paths with Trump",
      "Carney's time at the Bank gave him plenty of experience dealing with Donald Trump - who has not only imposed steep tariffs on Canada since returning to office in January, but has also suggested that America should annex its less powerful neighbour.",
      "From 2011-18, Carney was chair of the Financial Stability Board, which co-ordinated the work of regulatory authorities around the world, giving him a key role in the global response to the policies of the first Trump presidency.",
      "He was a regular at the G20 meetings, with a pitch-side view of Trump on the global stage.",
      "Although he kept his thoughts on the US president to himself at the time, he has been much more frank in recent days.",
      "After Trump made repeated comments about making Canada the 51st state, he was less diplomatic, comparing him to the villain in the Harry Potter books.",
      "\"When you think about what's at stake in these ridiculous, insulting comments of the president, of what we could be, I view this as the sort of Voldemort of comments,\" Carney said.",
      "\"Like I will not even repeat it, but you know what I'm talking about.\"",
      "He seems prepared to dig in his heels as the trade war continues, noting he would continue to impose counter-tariffs \"until the Americans show us respect \u2026 and [make] credible and reliable commitments to free and fair trade\".",
      "Political ambitions",
      "The Liberals have reportedly courted him for a decade, but until recently the 60-year-old had brushed off the idea.",
      "\"Why don't I become a circus clown?\" he told a reporter in 2012.",
      "Things changed, however, when Trudeau stepped down in January after his finance minister, Chrystia Freeland quit his cabinet, sparking a party squabble that, coupled with Trudeau's tanking poll numbers, led the prime minister to announce his resignation.",
      "Reports suggested Trudeau had intended to replace Freeland with Carney in the finance post.",
      "Freeland - a personal friend - even ran against him in the race to replace Trudeau. But Carney won by a landslide, pitching himself as the best equipped to take on Trump, who has imposed steep tariffs on Canadians goods.",
      "\"I know how to manage crises,\" Carney said during a leadership debate late last month. \"In a situation like this, you need experience in terms of crisis management, you need negotiating skills.\"",
      "Still, his time in the world of finance has opened him up to criticism from political rivals in Canada.",
      "The Conservatives have accused Carney of lying about his role in moving investment firm Brookfield Asset Management's head office from Toronto to New York, though Carney says the recent formal decision to relocate the firm was made after he quit the board.",
      "They have also pushed him to disclose his financial assets over conflict-of-interest concerns.",
      "Carney has placed his assets in a blind trust and has said he is in full compliance with existing conflict-of-interest rules, but has been pressed for more transparency.",
      "Where does Carney stand on issues?",
      "In addition to Carney's get-tough-on-Trump approach, he has proposed a number of policies to address at-home issues as well.",
      "He is known as an advocate for environmental sustainability. In 2019 he became a UN special envoy for climate change, and in 2021 launched the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, a grouping of banks and financial institutions working to combat climate change.",
      "One of the most contentious parts of Trudeau's platform has been the carbon tax, which saw Canadians pay a tax on carbon emissions, and receive a rebate. Conservatives repeatedly promised to end the tax, which they say does little for the environment.",
      "Shortly after being sworn in, Carney signed an order-in-council scrapping the tax from 1 April. \"This will make a difference to hard-pressed Canadians,\" he said.",
      "On immigration, Carney has advocated for a cap on current immigration targets, in order to ensure that Canada's housing and healthcare systems are not stressed. The issue had come to the fore last year, with Trudeau lowering targets amid critics saying the country's immigration system was overrun.",
      "His biggest mission, he had said, will be to keep Canada's economy growing, despite slowed trade with the US.",
      "There are early signs that Carney's rhetoric is being well received - a recent poll, conducted before Carney became PM, indicated Canadians believe Carney is better able to deal with Trump than Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre."

    "published": "Fri, 28 Mar 2025 00:00:13 GMT",
    "summary": "Why the reign of the free market is facing its biggest ever challenge",
    "story": [
      "I remember 1974 well. With inflation on the rise, the government had been locked in battle with trade unions over worker pay. The government appeared paralysed: stand up to the miners and strikes could shut down the power system, but give in and pay them more money and inflation would rocket.",
      "And then the global oil crisis came out of nowhere. It threw economies, including Britain's, into chaos. The government introduced a three-day week. Power cuts were common - we would be plunged into darkness without warning. And seemingly, the government just expected us to deal with it.",
      "This was also the year I began presenting the BBC's current affairs programme Panorama. We spent a lot of time debating these issues. People came on with all kinds of different ideas of what to do.",
      "There were even suggestions that what the country really needed to take back control from the unions was a military takeover - a coup.",
      "There was another idea out there too. It was proposed by the Conservative politician Keith Joseph and was entirely radical - so removed from the mainstream, in fact, that during filming of Panorama, Joseph turned to the production team and asked exasperatedly if they understood what he meant.",
      "That idea was the free market.",
      "This meant Britain departing from the post World War Two consensus that government should control the economy and that instead if you left the markets alone, they would deliver the country greater prosperity and security.",
      "If, in 2025, the idea sounds anything but radical, that's exactly the point.",
      "What we saw in the UK in the 1980s under Margaret Thatcher's government was just how quickly the free market transitioned from a radical idea into the new reality. Then before long it became what many assumed was the system that would last forever.",
      "US President Donald Trump is a billionaire businessman who has clearly done well financially out of capitalism. But suddenly, thanks in part to him, the free market system finds itself under assault like never before.",
      "It might yet weather the storm. However others are asking, is the free market system fatally flawed and doomed to failure?",
      "The fantasy world of Thatcher's Britain",
      "So much of what Thatcher did in the wake of her 1983 general election victory seems so obvious now. We take it for granted that private companies play a pivotal role in providing our water, electricity, gas, railways, ports and freight.",
      "But at the time few believed it possible to do what she had done - it seemed like a fantasy world, completely detached from how things had been done post war.",
      "I was six when the war ended. There was rationing \u2013 coupons that allowed you to buy meat or clothes, or of course, sweets. But out of these hard times and on the heels of victory, a new vision of society was emerging in Britain.",
      "With Clement Attlee's landslide election victory in July 1945, for the first time in Britain's political history a majority cast their votes for a party ostensibly dedicated to socialism.",
      "But more than that, a new consensus on how the country should run emerged, with those leading the Labour and Conservative parties singing from a broadly similar sheet.",
      "\"We have built our defences against want and sickness, and we're proud of it,\" was uttered not by a Labour prime minister but by Harold Macmillan, Conservative prime minister from 1957 to 1963. This had been how things were done.",
      "However not everyone bought into the consensus. Antony Fisher, who was a chicken farmer, was exasperated by what he saw as the meddling of the Egg Marketing Board. He set up the Institute of Economic Affairs think tank, inspired Keith Joseph and he in turn got Thatcher's ear.",
      "Trump's admiration of Thatcher",
      "That the current assault on the free market is coming, in part, from a Republican US president seems all the more ironic given how popular Thatcher's reforms were with the American right.",
      "Thatcher and President Ronald Reagan shared a similar world view, and Trump has spoken of his admiration for the two, albeit with the caveat that he didn't agree with some of Reagan's trade policies.",
      "Thatcher was convinced that the country would be much better off if gas and water and electricity were taken out of the hands of the state. And sold on the open market. The free market. Just like buying a loaf of bread.",
      "The Thatcher government's big idea was that they weren't just going to sell the shares in state-owned utilities to big businesses or investors. They were going to offer them to the British people.",
      "In December 1984 shares in British Telecom (BT) went on sale. The next morning, the numbers were staggering: more than two million Britons were now BT shareholders.",
      "And Thatcher began to realise that selling off these companies wasn't just about breaking the shackles of government control. It could be something bigger - turning every person in Britain into a capitalist and in doing so making capitalism popular.",
      "In Britain, by the end of the 1980s, the scale of transformation was staggering. The sum of \u00a360bn was raised by selling off state run companies. Up to 15 million Britons were now shareholders.",
      "Britain was embracing the free market. This wasn't just an economic shift. It was a cultural revolution. A redefinition of Britain's relationship with money, with government, and with itself.",
      "And if Thatcher's privatisation had given ordinary people the chance to buy shares, her reforms to Britain's financial services sector in 1986, known as the Big Bang, gave ordinary people the chance to sell them too, to get a job in the previously closed world of the City.",
      "There were many on the left for whom the principle alone of these reforms was something to object to. The assault on the free market from some on the right is not about the principles of the reforms, but the consequences.",
      "Offshore business and collapsing communities",
      "At the core of Thatcher's thinking was a belief that free market capitalism could work only if many people had a direct stake in it. And with share ownership of previously state run utilities, many people did. But before long, alarm bells were starting to be rung. And their chime has only gotten louder.",
      "James Goldsmith was a businessman who had made a fortune by buying struggling companies cheaply, reshaping them to maximise efficiency and then selling them at a profit. The 1980s reforms were like manna from heaven for him.",
      "But then he seemed to change his mind about things. In 1994 he told a committee of US senators that its premise contained a fatal flaw - that the system demanded maximum profit but to achieve maximum profit that meant severing the umbilical link with many of your own electorate.",
      "\"You get to a system whereby, to get the best corporate profits, you have to leave your own country. You have to say to your own sales force 'Goodbye, we can't use you anymore - you're too expensive'.",
      "\"You've got unions. You want holidays. You want protection. So we're going offshore.\"",
      "Goldsmith was predicting that companies would take their business wherever they would make the most money. If you are a CEO answerable to shareholders that's literally your job description. And the result, he said, would be job losses in the West, with communities collapsing.",
      "And to make things worse, he argued that Britain had ceded sovereignty to the likes of the European Union and the World Trade Organization, with Britain binding itself to an economic system run by unelected bureaucrats in Brussels, only adding to the sense of alienation felt in collapsing communities. And with global markets dictating policy. If an industry wasn't profitable, it was left to die.",
      "Today, the UK may be a global leader in science and financial services but is that of much consolation to communities where we once made things that are now made offshore?",
      "Based on what I often heard in my many years touring the country presenting Question Time, I'm not sure it is.",
      "Goldsmith would end up trying to go into politics. His Referendum Party was trounced in the 1997 general election but he had planted a seed. He had argued that the global free market path that Britain and the rest of the world was going down was dangerous. That it would spread division around the world.",
      "Fast-forward nearly 20 years to 2016 and his warning came to pass. Britain voted to leave the European Union and the verdict could not be clearer: the Leave vote was highest in those left-behind communities, seemingly fuelled by those who felt globalisation was not working for them.",
      "The dream of a nation of shareholders has soured too.",
      "In 1989 Thames Water was privatised. We were promised lower bills, better infrastructure, less red tape and investment in a system fraying at the edges. It was investment that the global capitalist system was supposedly best placed to provide.",
      "What followed was something else entirely. Debt ballooned and dividends flowed to shareholders. The company extracted profit while pipes leaked and sewage poured into rivers. And our bills now pay for interest on that debt - it feels like we've come a long way from Thatcher's nation of shareholders.",
      "Trump's tariffs 'defy easy explanation'",
      "Back in 1994, James Goldsmith had posited that the problem with the free market dream was that it didn't protect the home base.",
      "Now, there is someone else much more powerful who takes that view.",
      "President Trump's methods are so erratic that with him it's hard to tell what is going on. His readiness to slap hugely consequential tariffs on countries that are both traditional foes and supposed friends at times defies easy explanation.",
      "But what we can say is that he is trying to return to ideas that preceded the free market. He is trying to make America strong through protectionism, making it harder for anyone to simply sell anywhere.",
      "There is an argument that if you take the long view then perhaps the free market period is the outlier. Britain itself had a long, long period of protectionism before it embraced free trade.",
      "Tariffs are nothing new in world economic history and in a sense Trump is just trying to return the US to how things were, albeit in quite a chaotic way.",
      "The reign of the free market is facing its biggest ever challenge. But that challenge is coming not from supporters of socialism who ideologically back a big role for the state. Instead, the challenge is coming from Trump, a man who is broadly speaking of the right and has no qualms with capitalism allowing people to become very rich.",

      "Months earlier, John had vanished. His eldest granddaughter, Amy, had taken control of his welfare and his finances, and stopped any contact between John and the rest of his family, including Barbara, his wife of many years.",
      "With Amy's help, John had changed his will, making her the sole beneficiary, and had then been left to live by himself in a single room, confused and isolated.",
      "John's family was one of hundreds who contacted the BBC after hearing The Willpower Detectives last year.",
      "The series revealed how a partner at an Essex-based law firm was using what's known as Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA) to take over the finances of vulnerable clients.",
      "In June, Parliament will debate a private member's bill to provide extra safeguards to LPA. The bill - introduced by the MP Fabian Hamilton - has cross-party support, and is shaped in part by the BBC's investigations and the huge public response to the cases raised.",
      "The story of John Wilcox demonstrates how, in handing over responsibility for their financial assets, vulnerable people can sometimes be put at risk by members of their own family.",
      "After many years of running a successful office-furnishing business in Leeds, John and Barbara Wilcox had retired and were living comfortably in mid-Wales.",
      "Both had been married before. John had no children of his own, but he loved Barbara's son and daughter as his own, as well as her three grandchildren. To each of these, he had given enough money to buy their first homes.",
      "However, everything changed in 2020 when John was diagnosed with dementia.",
      "The condition caused a personality change, and John became delusional and paranoid. He started to accuse Barbara and his own brother Desmond of plotting against him.",
      "Following a collapse at home John was taken to hospital, where - because of Covid restrictions - nobody was allowed to visit.",
      "This isolation fed John's feelings of paranoia, and the suspicion that he had been abandoned by his family.",
      "It was during this time that John's eldest granddaughter, Amy - the one person he still seemed to trust - began to take charge of his life.",
      "At first, no-one in the family was suspicious. John had always been close to Amy.",
      "Unknown to them, John had requested and signed a form banning contact between anyone involved in his care and anyone in his family, apart from Amy.",
      "Even though his medical notes describe him as paranoid and delusional, John was declared as having \"mental capacity\" - this was significant because it meant he could legally grant someone lasting power of attorney over his finances.",
      "Barbara says her efforts to raise concerns with social services were blanked: \"They just didn't want to know. They weren't interested in the letters that we wrote.\"",
      "After three months in hospital, John was discharged into Amy's care. She suggested he could recuperate at a care home at Paignton in Devon, near where she lived, while she readied her house for him to stay there.",
      "At this stage, the other family members thought this was just a temporary arrangement in everyone's best interests. Amy said that it was what John wanted, and it would be a respite for Barbara.",
      "However, Barbara recalls: \"As soon as she got him down there, the vitriol started.\" Amy told the rest of the family they no longer had any say about John's welfare, and they were not to try to contact him.",
      "In response to their pleas, it was agreed that a niece of John's would call him once a week to check that he was alright.",

      "The family was devastated - John had disappeared.",
      "They went to the police but were told he had signed a form in hospital instructing that no information should be shared with them. They were only told that John was not living with Amy.",
      "The family discovered that John had signed an LPA document giving Amy power of attorney over all his property and finances.",
      "Meanwhile, a solicitor in Devon contacted Barbara asking about their home and joint assets. Barbara later found out about John's new will, which named Amy as the sole beneficiary.",
      "This development had immediate and stressful consequences. The solicitor asked Barbara to begin the process of selling the home she had shared with John, in order to release his share of their assets.",
      "John's brother, Desmond, took the lead in trying to find out where John now was. It took him several weeks.",
      "He says he rang 50 care homes, trying to track John down. He and Barbara also wrote to Amy asking her to at least tell them how her grandfather was, but they say they never received a reply.",
      "Eventually, Amy's aunt confronted her in person, and found out that John was in a hotel in Torquay.",
      "Desmond knew that in the past, John had lent \u00a3100,000 to a friend who owned several hotels in south-west England.",
      "It appeared that John had been put up at one of these hotels. The owner had made a deal to offset John's bill (a nightly rate of \u00a3265) against his outstanding debt.",
      "Amy's father, David, drove to the hotel. He was horrified by what he found: \"The conditions he was living in were appalling. I was absolutely astounded.\"",
      "John was renting the room only - with no cleaning services or food. There was a fridge and a microwave oven - in which he would heat ready meals supplied by Amy.",
      "For David, it was the ultimate betrayal of a vulnerable man. He says that John was dishevelled and confused: \"He was just abandoned. He hardly went out of that room and it was in a terrible state.\"",
      "Having found John, his family decided they needed to tread carefully. They say they wanted him to understand the truth about what had been done to him, and they were also worried that Amy might try to move him again.",
      "At first, John refused to see Barbara, claiming she had tried to kill him, and that she had never come to see him in hospital.",
      "And then one day, Barbara drove to John's hotel with her son David and his partner Julie. She stayed outside in the car but gave David a tin of flapjacks to take to John in his room.",

      "David then offered to bring Barbara into the hotel room and John agreed.",
      "Barbara says she was heartbroken by her husband's physical and mental deterioration. He weighed only seven-and-a-half stone, and he was so weak that she thinks he would have died if he had been left much longer.",
      "It was a \"very, very emotional\" reunion, she remembers. Before long, they were holding hands and John had agreed to come home with her.",
      "The next day, Barbara and her brother Mike came back to the hotel to pick John up. Mike says it felt like they were \"planning a heist\". He recalls that \"as we drove away and started to get out of Torquay, I said: 'Oh gosh, we got away with that.'\"",
      "Back in Wales, Barbara was able to see John's bank accounts, and discovered that Amy had taken more than \u00a35,000 - there was just 16p left in his account.",
      "But John's story had a happy ending of sorts. He managed to get the power of attorney and the new will cast aside, and lived for nine months with Barbara in Wales, before dying peacefully at home.",
      "His tale highlights the difficulties involved when it comes to deciding who has control of what's often seen as \"family money\", and who will inherit it.",
      "Issues of mental capacity have to be considered in situations like these, according to James Warner, a consultant in old-age psychiatry.",
      "\"Dementia makes people susceptible to manipulation and those involved with overseeing important changes need to be extra-vigilant,\" he says.",
      "The elderly and vulnerable can quickly find themselves in situations where they are extremely vulnerable, he says, and more needs to be done to protect them.",
      "The Office of the Public Guardian (OPG) holds power of attorney records for more than eight million people in England and Wales, but last year it investigated less than 1% of the cases brought to its attention.",
      "Labour MP Fabian Hamilton says the OPG can be \"toothless\" for vulnerable elderly people and their families.",
      "Mr Hamilton says changes are needed to provide greater safeguards, and his private member's bill on attorney powers is due for its second reading in June.",
      "The bill - which has cross-party support - would compel banks and regulators to check for issues such as cognitive decline, and greater scrutiny over whether an attorney is abusing their LPA powers.",
      "Barbara thinks that the proposed legislation could have helped in her situation.",
      "\"In cases like John's, where you have this kind of paranoia, solicitors involved with a power of attorney should be making enquiries of the family and verifying,\" she says.",
      "Meanwhile, John's family have had no contact with Amy, unable to forgive the hurt she caused them and what she put her grandfather through.",
      "They say they still do not understand why Amy acted in the way she did. She (along with John's other grandchildren) had already been given money enough to buy a house each, and she stood to inherit more eventually.",
      "In May 2024, Amy accepted a police caution for fraud - which in law is an admission of guilt - specifically because she had taken money from John's account after he had returned to Wales, and was no longer in her care.",
      "When I wrote to Amy about this, she replied that she had only accepted the caution to lift the stress from herself and her family, and didn't regard it as just.",
      "She told me that there were two sides to every story and that all of John's decisions were made by him in the company of his solicitor. She added that the decision not to tell John's family anything was at his request."

      "The OfS has said it should be possible to express any lawful view on campus - but the trans and non-binary equality policy at the heart of the Sussex row, which was in place until last year, illustrates the potential challenges ahead.",
      "One of the concerns raised by the regulator was a section in the policy which said that harassment or bullying including intrusive behaviour, name calling or derogatory jokes were serious disciplinary offences.",
      "Now, the university has replaced it with a new trans and non-binary policy - but the regulator hasn't told bosses yet whether or not that passes the free-speech test.",
      "Next free speech fine may cost millions, unis told",
      "Government to implement university free speech law",
      "And in another potential point of tension, from 1 August a new regulation comes into force requiring universities in England to go further in showing how they will promote and uphold free speech on campus.",
      "The OfS says this shouldn't include the content of courses or discussions in the lecture hall. All higher education institutions have to meet conditions to register with the OfS in order to charge tuition fees.",
      "But they will also have to show how they are acting to prevent the harassment of students - and universities are required to try to increase applications from underrepresented groups, through initiatives to make them feel more included.",
      "Lawyer Smita Jamdar, who advises universities in England on how to comply with regulations, says that to reduce harassment, universities need to be \"really clear about the behaviour you will and will not tolerate\" and that action will be taken when students \"transgress those boundaries\".",
      "While that has to be balanced against freedom of speech, Ms Jamdar said most people would expect \"the line to be drawn somewhere other than name calling and derogatory jokes\".",
      "When the BBC looked at similar trans equality policies at a number of universities it wasn't entirely clear whether they would be considered a challenge to free speech.",

    "story": [
      "There were 8,000 more secondary school pupils in special schools in England than places available for them last year, according to Department for Education (Dfe) figures - a rise of 25% in 12 months.",
      "About two-thirds of these schools were at or over capacity in 2023-2024, despite the number of special school places rising by 5,000.",
      "On Thursday, the government said the \u00a3740m of funding investment it announced in December will create 10,000 new school places for pupils with special educational needs and disabilities (Send) within mainstream schools.",
      "Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson said it will help plug \"the significant gaps in provision\".",
      "An estimated 1.7 million school-aged children have special educational needs and disabilities in England.",
      "Those with further needs can receive legal entitlement to more specific support, often in a specialist school, via an education, health and care plan (EHCP).",
      "The number of pupils with an EHCP, who need a place in specialist provision, is forecast by local authorities to rise by 44,000 in the next three years - from 229,000 in 2024-25 to 273,000 in 2028-29.",
      "This is the second year figures on special school capacity have been collected by the Dfe.",
      "It says the reason for the gap in provision is because of the number of schools at or over capacity. However, the figures may not reflect the current pupils attending special schools because of the different and changing needs for which schools cater.",
      "It found there were 92,000 secondary places across special state schools in England, but about 100,000 secondary pupils on the roll in May 2024.",
      "In a highly critical report earlier this year, the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) found a Send system \"in disarray\", \"mired in red tape, lacking funding, and failing to produce value for money\".",
      "It warned 40% of councils would be \"staring down bankruptcy\" next year, when a scheme allowing local authorities to keep those deficits off their financial books expires.",
      "The government is encouraging local authorities to help mainstream schools to set up more provision for children with Send within their own schools.",
      "Fewer than one in 10 mainstream schools have SEN units or resourced provision which provide more intensive support for pupils, according to the Dfe.",
      "It hopes to reform the system to be more inclusive so children's need can be identified and met at an earlier point in mainstream schools, and special schools can cater to those with the most complex needs.",
      "Releasing more details on the plans, Phillipson said: \"This investment is a big step towards delivering not only enough school places, but the right school places, supporting all children and particularly those with Send, and plugging the significant gaps in provision we inherited\".",
      "Elsewhere, the figures on school capacity show 16% of primary schools are over capacity, down 1% on last year, and 24% of secondary schools, up 1% on last year.",
      "There has been an increase in 24,000 school places overall, but this is falling because of the reduction in pupil numbers since 2018-19.",
      "It has been predicted the number of children in state nurseries and primary schools would fall by 4.5% over the next four years, but it varies across England.",
      "Pupil numbers in London have been in decline for a number of years and are projected to fall further because of a drop in the birth rate.",

      "\"The figures don't give an indication of whether a small number of teachers have been off for long periods, which may be easier to manage in terms of securing cover, or if an increasing number of teachers are of for small amounts of time, which can be more difficult to plan around.\"",
      "'Making meaningful progress'",
      "Last year the EIS union commissioned research looking at workload and stress. It found that on average, teachers were working more than 11 additional hours a week, unpaid, on top of their contractual hours.",
      "A spokeswoman for the EIS said that \"soaring\" levels of stress and stress-related illness were a very serious concern.",

      "\"The health and wellbeing of the over 3,000 teachers employed by the council is incredibly important to us,\" she said.",
      "She said a range of support and resources were available to help, and that teachers who have concerns about their workload or mental health are encouraged to raise this with their line manager.",

      "But the 24-year-old didn't arrive out of nowhere.",
      "He's one of the founders of the Hype House \u2013 a collaborative TikTok group who lived and worked together in the Los Angeles hills and shepherded millions of teenagers though the pandemic.",
      "You could easily to dismiss him as yet another social media influencer trying to break into the music industry. It's an accusation he's aware of, and prepared for.",
      "\"I watched a lot of people, a lot of TikTokkers, make music and there was no meaning behind it. It was just something they decided to do,\" he says.",
      "\"But I wanted to write about real things. No one else can sing my songs. I don't take other people's demos. This is all mine.\"",
      "Even a passing glance at his discography proves him right.",
      "Warren's arena pop anthems are searingly honest, almost to a fault, drawing on his challenging childhood, and fairytale romance with Kouvr.",
      "His father died when he was nine years old, after a long struggle with kidney cancer. The loss sent his mother spiralling into alcoholism, something Warren only realised when he tried to clear up one of her coffee mugs.",
      "\"It turned out to be alcohol,\" he says. \"And the next day it was alcohol, and the next day it was alcohol, and at 4am it was alcohol, and when we were driving, it was alcohol.\"",
      "When he called her out on it, the addiction turned to abuse.",
      "\"Every person struggling with addiction needs someone to blame it on, besides themselves, and I became that person,\" he says.",
      "When he was 18, she kicked him out. He was broke and homeless. Friends let him sleep in their cars \u2013 never their houses, because his mum had convinced their parents he was a trouble-maker.",
      "Around the same time, he was introduced to Instagram model Kouvr Annon by a friend on Snapchat.",
      "\"We just clicked right away,\" he says. \"I felt I could tell her everything, just after our first conversation.\"",
      "Within four months, Kouvr left her family in Hawaii, flew out to California and started living with Warren in a car.",
      "Then, as now, they're an exceptionally cute couple \u2013 tender and funny and clearly besotted with one another. When they started posting videos of their romance online, people wanted to see more. In a span of six months, Warren gained more than a million followers on YouTube.",
      "Combined with the prank videos he'd filmed with his friends, he built a big enough audience to start earning money.",
      "\"When I got my first cheque for $2,000 in a month, I was like, 'Holy cow, this is gonna change my life',\" he recalls.",
      "Some of that money went into the creation of the Hype House in 2019. Warren came up with the name, and moved into the property with Annon and a bunch of young internet stars like Addison Rae, Charlie D'Amelio, Chase Hudson and Thomas Petrou.",
      "The collective introduced themselves in December 2019 with a photoshoot that mimicked Backstreet Boys video for I Want It That Way.",
      "By the end of the day, the hashtag #hypehouse was trending, and the mansion quickly became an incubator for viral videos.",
      "The enterprise thrived during lockdown but, as individual members signed TV deals, or grew tired of the escalating demands for content, it started to fall apart. Warren and Annon left in 2022, citing a desire to \"move on to the next chapter in their lives\".",
      "Since then, rumours have swirled about behind-the-scenes drama at the house, with some members hinting at exploitation and mistreatment.",
      "\"There was falling out,\" Warren told the Zach Sang show in 2023. \"But a lot of us signed NDAs, so no-one's going to talk about it.\"",
      "He did, however, pour his frustrations into music.",
      "\"How do you sleep at night?\" he sings on the angst-ridden Burning Down, a song allegedly targeted at one of the Hype House's co-founders.",
      "\"It scars forever when someone you called your friend / Shows you the truth can be so cold.\"",
      "Warren says he never made money from the Hype House. What it did give him, however, was a built-in audience for his music.",
      "\"I think that's really rare,\" he says. \"Usually, when someone goes from social media to music, they lose that fan base.",
      "\"But I think a lot of people watched my YouTube videos because they were having a rough life and needed an escape. So when I started making music about my rough life, I think they identified with it even more.\"",
      "Warren dreamt of a music career long before he entered the Hype House. Back when TikTok was called Music.ally, he'd even created a burner account to share his songs.",
      "\"I didn't want to post on my main account, because I was terrified of failing,\" he explains.",
      "\"As a kid, people bullied me for singing and doing talent shows and dedicating songs to my fifth grade girlfriend, you know?",
      "\"So I posted on a random account I created, and I filmed myself singing on the toilet because I wanted to show I wasn't taking it seriously.",
      "\"And the next day, I woke up and had 10 million views.\"",
      "His first release was 2021's One More I Love You, a song he started when he was 13 years old and coming to terms with his father's death.",
      "\"I watched my sister go to a daddy-daughter dance without her dad, and that's when I realised, 'Oh, wait, my life is different',\" he recalls.",
      "\"I started mourning for the first time, and I didn't know how to process it, so I just went to the piano and played some chords. And that's kind of where I started learning how to write.\"",
      "Warren's outpouring of grief is powerful in its simplicity, but it has touched people in ways he couldn't have anticipated.",
      "\"The other day, a woman wanted me to sign a Heinz Beans t-shirt,\" he says. \"I giggled because I thought that was funny, then she turned it over, and it was the same t-shirt her son wore right before he died from cancer.",
      "\"One More I Love You was the song that she played at that funeral and the song she listened to help her get over it.\"",
      "\"I think that's the most powerful thing in the world.\"",
      "The musician, who was raised a Catholic, believes that healing moments like those are part of God's plan for him.",
      "\"Without all the loss, all the trauma, all the things in my life, I wouldn't have these songs. I wouldn't have the means to help the 5,000 people coming to the show tonight, I wouldn't be able to provide for my future family with my wife.",
      "\"And I think those are all things that are meant to happen, or can happen if I make the  right choices.",
      "\"You know, I could have chosen to get into drugs and be a bad person but I chose this path.",

      "\"We have an urgent matter to discuss in person,\" the receptionist said. \"Could you come down?\"",
      "I arrived to find three plain-clothes policemen waiting for me. They asked me for my passport and led me away, trying to prevent my colleagues from filming.",
      "I had been in Istanbul for three days by then, covering the anti-government protests sparked by the arrest of the city's mayor, Ekrem Imamoglu.",
      "I was taken first to the police headquarters and held for seven hours. Two colleagues were allowed to be present and lawyers could come in to talk. The atmosphere was generally cordial. Some of the police officers told me they didn't agree with what they said was a state decision. One hugged me and said he hoped for my freedom.",
      "At 9.30pm, I was moved to the foreigners' custody unit of the Istanbul police. There, the atmosphere hardened from a succession of chain-smoking officers, with whom I had to negotiate in my broken Turkish. I was fingerprinted and denied access to lawyers or any contact with the outside world.",
      "In the early hours of Thursday, I was presented with papers to say I was being deported for being \"a threat to public order\". When I asked for an explanation, they said it was a government decision.",
      "One police officer suggested he film me saying that I was leaving Turkey of my own accord, which could help me to return in the future and which he could show his bosses. I politely refused, suspecting it would be given to the government-controlled media to push their version of events.",

Between police officers entering to brush their teeth, planes taking off and the morning call to prayer, no sleep came.",
      "Seventeen hours after my initial detention, I was driven to a waiting plane to board a one-way flight to London. That night, after the case was made public, sparking significant media coverage around the world, the Turkish government press office released a statement saying I had lacked the correct accreditation. At no point had they mentioned this during my detention and it seemed clear that it was an afterthought on their part to attempt to justify my case.",
      "I was never mistreated at any point during the ordeal. And I knew throughout that BBC management and the British Consulate in Istanbul were working hard to secure my release.",
      "So many others who have fallen foul of the Turkish authorities do not have such a safety net. When I lived there as the BBC Istanbul correspondent between 2014 and 2019, Turkey was the world's biggest jailer of journalists. The watchdog Reporters Without Borders ranks Turkey 158th of 180 countries in the Press Freedom Index. Since these latest protests began, eleven journalists are among the two thousand or so people who have been detained.",
      "The latest unrest was sparked by the arrest of Ekrem Imamoglu, Recep Tayyip Erdogan's main political rival, whom opinion polls suggest could unseat the President in an election.",
      "But they have grown into something much wider: a clamour for democracy in a country sliding further into authoritarianism. The clampdown on the media is central to that trajectory, as the government has progressively crushed criticism or debate. I caught a glimpse of that first hand. It ended for me with sadness and sleeplessness. For others, it's been so much worse.",
      "Meanwhile, President Erdogan is digging in, dismissing the protests as \"street terrorism\". He's emboldened by the current international climate of having an ally in the White House and of Turkey's importance to everything from Ukraine to Syria.",
      "The question now is whether the country's biggest demonstrations in over a decade can sustain momentum or whether Turkey's long-time leader can simply brush this off. Those out on the street may be chanting \"enough\" \u2013 but they also know never to write off Recep Tayyip Erdogan.",

    "story": [
      "Author LJ Smith, whose best-selling Vampire Diaries novels were turned into a hit TV show, has died at the age of 66.",
      "Lisa Jane Smith published the original four-book series, about a love triangle involving two vampire brothers and an orphaned young woman, in 1991 and 92, before releasing another Vampire Diaries trilogy in 2009-11.",
      "However, she was dropped from her own book series and replaced by new authors by publishers, but Smith continued releasing new instalments unofficially as fan fiction.",
      "The official books were adapted for TV in 2009 and the show became a teen favourite over its eight years.",
      "Described by the Guardian as a \"deliciously pulpy supernatural soap opera\", the TV version was part of a craze for vampire stories that also included Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Twilight and True Blood.",
      "The show won a total of 30 Teen Choice Awards including six consecutive prizes for best fantasy/sci-fi actress for Nina Dobrev, who played Elena for the first six seasons.",
      "Dobrev starred alongside Paul Wesley and Ian Somerhalder as brothers Stefan and Damon Salvatore.",
      "Fan fiction comeback",
      "Smith had originally been hired to write the novel series by a book packager - who sold them to a publisher - under a deal where they, not she, owned the rights.",
      "She said the packager dropped her in 2011 and handed over her unpublished eighth instalment to an anonymous ghostwriter, who went on to publish two further Vampire Diaries books.",
      "The series was then handed on to an author using the pen name Aubrey Clark for three more. However, Smith's remained the most prominent name on the book covers as the series creator.",
      "The author said the situation left her feeling \"trashed\" and \"mutilated\".",
      "However, she went some way to reclaiming her creation when the Vampire Diaries was added to an Amazon Kindle scheme granting official permission for anyone to publish fan fiction linked to existing books.",
      "Smith launched a new unofficial Vampire Diaries trilogy through that scheme, which picked up where her last official book left off.",
      "She was also known for the Night World novels, which also feature vampires as well as witches, werewolves and shapeshifters, who secretly live among the human race.",
      "Nine Night World volumes were published between 1996 and 98, before Smith took a decade-long break from writing. She said it was a result of writer's block while two family members dealt with cancer.",
      "Smith's The Secret Circle trilogy, published in 1992, was also turned into a TV drama in 2011. She also wrote the Dark Visions and The Forbidden Game trilogies.",
      "A statement on her website said: \"Lisa was a kind and gentle soul, whose brilliance, creativity, resilience and empathy, illuminated the lives of her family, friends and fans alike.",
      "\"She will be remembered for her imaginative spirit, her pioneering role in supernatural fiction, and her generosity, warmth and heart, both on and off the page.\"",

      "Dua Lipa has won the dismissal of a lawsuit that accused her of copying her hit single Levitating from two other songs.",
      "The star was sued in 2022 by songwriters L Russell Brown and Sandy Linzer, who accused her of plagiarising their 1979 disco track Wiggle and Giggle All Night and 1980's Don Diablo.",
      "On Thursday, US Judge Katherine Polk Failla ruled that the songs only had generic similarities, including non-copyrightable musical elements that had also previously been used by Mozart, Gilbert and Sullivan, and the Bee Gees in their song Stayin' Alive.",
      "It is the second time that Lipa has won a plagiarism case over Levitating, which was a global hit in 2020.",
      "She was previously sued by Florida reggae band Artikal Sound System, who claimed Lipa ripped off the chorus for her song from their 2015 track Live Your Life.",
      "Their case was dropped in 2023 after a judge ruled there was no evidence that Lipa and her co-writers had \"access\" to the earlier song - a key requirement in any copyright lawsuit.",
      "However, she is still facing a third legal challenge over the song, from musician Bosko Kante - a featured artist on Levitating, who sang vocals through a talk box.",
      "He sued in 2023, saying his contribution had been used on remixes of the song without permission.",
      "Kante is seeking damages of at least $2m (\u00a31.5m) plus interest, as well as profits from the remixes, which he estimated as being at least $20m (\u00a315m).",
      "Brown and Linzer's case alleged that Lipa stole the opening melody of Levitating, where she sings: \"If you wanna run away with me, I know a galaxy and I can take you for a ride.\"",
      "They called the melody and phrasing a \"duplicate\" of their own songs.",
      "But Judge Failla wrote that the elements were too common to be protected by law.",
      "\"The court finds that a musical style, defined by plaintiffs as 'pop with a disco feel,' and a musical function, defined by plaintiffs to include 'entertainment and dancing,' cannot possibly be protectable,\" the judge wrote.",
      "\"To hold otherwise would be to completely foreclose the further development of music in that genre or for that purpose.\"",
      "By coincidence, the ruling came on the fifth anniversary of Levitating's release, initially as an album track on Lipa's award-winning album Future Nostalgia.",
      "In a statement to music industry publication Billboard, lawyers for Brown and Linzer said they \"respectfully disagreed\" with the decision and would file an appeal.",
      "The BBC has contacted Dua Lipa for a response."

      "In Gram Yatra, Husain used vibrant, earthy tones to bring 13 frames to life, with women in everyday scenes such as cooking, caring for children and riding a cart.",
      "In one of the frames, a farmer extends his arm as if holding the land in the adjoining frame - a nod to the farming roots of Indian society.",
      "\"If you're looking for a single artwork that defines modern South Asian art, this is it,\" said Nishad Avari, head of South Asian Modern and Contemporary Art at Christie's.",
      "The painting, he added, also showed how Husain was influenced by his foreign travels, notably his 1952 trip to China which introduced him to the calligraphic brushwork of artists like Xu Beihong, traces of which can be seen in the painting's expressive strokes.",
      "In the years following India's independence, he sought inspiration not in Paris or New York, but in India's villages, mirroring Mahatma Gandhi's belief that the heart of the nation lay in its rural roots.",
      "According to Husain's biographer Akhilesh (who uses only one name), the painter's deep engagement with India's cultural fabric helped shape how the country saw itself - \"how people live, what they like and what they think\".",
      "The painting also shows the early signs of Husain's modified cubist style - where geometric shapes and bold lines stood out in his works.",
      "The painting's journey from Delhi to Oslo adds to its mystique.",
      "It was purchased in 1954 for just $295 by Ukrainian doctor Leon Elias Volodarsky, who was in India on a World Health Organization (WHO) mission.",
      "After he took it to Norway, the piece adorned the walls of Oslo University Hospital for nearly half a century, largely unnoticed by the art world.",
      "It stayed that way for several decades until auction house Christie's was alerted about it in 2013 - two years after Husain's death - leading to its global exhibitions before this record-smashing sale.",
      "Ashish Anand of Delhi Art Gallery believes this will elevate the value of Husain's entire body of work and \"lead to Indian art being viewed beyond just its aesthetic value to a tangible and serious financial asset\".",

      "They married in 2022 and are raising five children - Zach, Leighton, Rex, Rose and Belle - aged between 17 and two, alongside two dogs and four ducks.",
      "\"When I met Joe, my older children [Zach and Leighton] were four and seven,\" says Stacey, \"so they were little.\"",
      "When people say it is nice to see a blended family, she says she forgets that is what they are. \"To be honest, we're just a family.\"",
      "Joe says he struggles sometimes with the words - blended family, stepdad and stepsons.",
      "\"I love [Zach and Leighton] as much as I love all my other kids,\" he says. \"There's no distinction.\"",
      "When it comes to childcare, the couple do not have a nanny or au pair, but they do have a very supportive family.",
      "\"We've got Dave - my dad - and my sister,\" says Stacey. \"And I always say this, we live like a Kibbutz. We basically all chip in with each other.\"",
      "As well as juggling family and work, viewers will get to see all aspects of Stacey and Joe's lives, which, like any relationship, can include the odd disagreement.",
      "\"We want to show that we love each other, but sometimes we kill each other,\" says Joe. \"It's all part of it, and other couples do the same, so they'll relate to that.\"",
      "Stacey says she found being able to watch back and reflect on a situation quite helpful as she could see it from an outsider's point of view, which she believes is healthy for a relationship.",
      "Viewers will also get to see the love and support Stacey and Joe give each other. Joe describes Stacey as extremely loyal, like a \"mother lion\".",
      "\"Don't go near her cubs, she'll have you,\" he says.",
      "\"She's just the most wonderful person,\" he says. \"She's kind, she's loving. I mean there's nothing about Stacey I would change. People love her in the streets and, imagine me, I'm so lucky, I get to spend the rest of my life with her.\"",
      "Joe has the ability to give everyone a bit of himself, says Stacey, which is \"so magic\" and he has the most incredible amount of empathy, she says.",
      "Their parenting styles, on the other hand, are \"polar opposite\" she says.",
      "\"I'm aware that Stacey takes a lot of the brunt because I let [the children] do something and she's the one that has to say, 'No, you can't do that',\" says Joe. \"So she has to play bad cop quite a lot of the time, which I am aware of, but I just don't know any other way.\"",
      "Stacey believes this stems from the fact that Joe lost his father when he was very young.",
      "\"I think that when that happens to you in your life, obviously you just want to be\u2026 fun, happy. You don't want to create any negative memories,\" she says.",
      "For their family, having young children and teenagers growing up together has created something really magical.",
      "Stacey says the teenage boys can revert to being younger again which is important because they grow up so quickly in the modern world. They have the chance to still play, with the excuse being \"oh, I'm only doing it because it's with my little brother or little sister\", she says.",
      "It also gives the older boys a massive sense of responsibility, she adds.",
      "Raising five children requires military-style organisation, says Stacey, something she learnt after having her first son at the age of 17.",
      "\"I, quite frankly, was probably the most scatty teenager you've ever known,\" says Stacey. \"When I had Zachary, I had this one whole life that I was responsible for, and so many things that I had to do that I'd never had to consider.\"",
      "She says she would get a giro - a welfare cheque - to cash in at a certain time on a Thursday at the Post Office, and she realised she could not be late as she needed the money for groceries.",
      "Stacey relied on Zach and \"asked a lot of him\", she says, needing him to help her.",
      "\"I haven't done that with the younger ones, because I've had Joe,\" she says, \"and that's just the reality of my situation. It's been different through the years.\"",
      "But Zach, now 17 himself, is \"probably one of the most empathetic, caring, emotionally intelligent young teenagers that I know,\" says Stacey.",
      "\"I feel like that has a lot to do with how we grew up together, and how life was for us in the beginning.\"",
      "Having more children is not currently on Stacey's radar, she says, as her body is still recovering from having three children in five years.",
      "\"My pelvic floor is dying,\" she laughs. Although Joe would love to have more.",
      "Stacey still has plans to increase their brood - but this time it is their animals.",
      "\"I literally walked into a conversation the other day and I heard 'cow',\" says Joe, \"and I was like, 'No way, we can't have a cow'.\"",
      "\"We were just throwing a few ideas around,\" says Stacey. \"I would love to have animals and make our own milk and collect our own eggs and grow our own vegetables.",
      "\"That's a dream of mine - but in the future. At the moment, we're still rearing children.\"",
      "Stacey & Joe starts on Tuesday 1 April at 20:00 BST on BBC One and BBC iPlayer."

    "published": "Wed, 26 Mar 2025 12:33:21 GMT",
    "summary": "NewJeans talk to the BBC in their first interview since a court blocked their attempt to leave their record label.",
    "story": [
      "\"It took a huge amount of courage to speak out,\" NewJeans have told the BBC in their first interview since a court blocked their attempt to leave their record label, in a case that has rocked the K-pop industry.",
      "\"This fight is necessary. Although it will be extremely difficult and arduous, we will keep doing what we have done so far and speak up,\" said Haerin, one of the members of the five-piece.",
      "\"We thought it was important to tell the world about what we've been through. All the choices we've made so far have been the best choices we could have made.\"",
      "NewJeans looked invincible in the charts when they launched what was an unusual rebellion in the high-pressure, tightly-controlled world of K-pop. Hanni, Hyein, Haerin, Danielle and Minji stunned South Korea and fans everywhere with their decision in November to split from Ador, the label that launched them.",
      "They alleged mistreatment, workplace harassment and an attempt to \"undermine their careers\", which Ador denies. It sued to enforce their seven-year contract, which is set to expire in 2029, and sought an injunction against any commercial activities by the group.",
      "On Friday, a South Korean court granted it, ordering NewJeans to stop all \"independent\" activities, including song releases and advertising deals, while the case was still under way. NewJeans has since challenged the injunction in court.",
      "Friday's ruling was a \"shock\", the group told the BBC.",
      "\"Some people think that we're famous enough to do whatever we want and say whatever we please. But the truth is, it's not like that at all,\" Hyein said. \"We held it in for a long time, and only now have we finally spoken up about what we think, what we feel and the unfairness we've experienced.\"",
      "The K-pop industry has repeatedly come under fire for the pressure it puts on its stars not only to perform and succeed, but to appear perfect. But rarely do conflicts spill into the public, exposing stars' grievances and rifts with their labels.",
      "NewJeans' dramatic announcement last year followed a long and public spat with Ador and its parent company, Hybe - South Korea's biggest music label, whose client list includes K-pop royalty such as BTS and Seventeen.",
      "Ador told the BBC in a statement that the contract with NewJeans still stands, adding that \"most of their claims have risen from misunderstandings\". The court said that NewJeans did not \"sufficiently prove\" that Ador had violated the contract, adding that the label had upheld \"most of its duties, including payment\".",
      "The girls were rehearsing for a performance in Hong Kong, when news of the ruling dropped. They found out when Minji got a worried message from her mother: \"She asked me, 'are you okay?' And I was like 'what happened?'\"",
      "\"I was stunned,\" Minji says. So were the others when she told them. \"At first I thought I didn't hear her properly,\" Danielle says. \"We were all kind of in shock.\"",
      "This was their second of two interviews with the BBC in as many weeks. In the first interview, which happened before the ruling, the group had been excited to release their new single, Pit Stop - their first since they announced their break from Ador and renamed themselves NJZ.",
      "They spoke about how they coped with a difficult period, including finding comfort in cooking. \"I'm not really good at it but it's kind of healing,\" Minji had said, before promising to cook an \"amazing dinner\" for the group.",
      "In the second interview, which was 24 hours after the ruling, they seemed disheartened and unsettled, less sure of what was to come. \"If we knew we were gonna go through this, maybe we would have chosen\u2026\" Hanni trailed off as she teared up.",
      "Seconds later, she continued: \"Even if we do everything we can and it doesn't work out the way we hope it does, then we'll just have to leave it to time. I'm sure time would figure it out for us.\"",
      "The following night, they took to the stage in Hong Kong and, despite the court order, performed Pit Stop under their new name. But the evening, which they had pitched to fans as a fresh start, ended in tears as they told the crowd they were going on a hiatus.",
      "\"It wasn't any easy decision to make,\" Hyein said on stage, as each of them took turns to address their fans. \"But at the moment for us, it's about protecting ourselves, so that we can come back stronger.\"",
      "Just three years into their debut, the future of the young stars - they are aged between 16 and 20 - is now in question.",
      "But they tell the BBC that this is not the end of the road for them as they \"find more ways\" forward. With the legal battle expected to last for months, if not years, Minji says that gives them time to plan what they want to do next.",
      "Ever since they debuted in July 2022, NewJeans have delivered remarkable success with each new release - OMG, Ditto, Super Shy, Attention. A year on, they were the eighth biggest-selling act in the world.",
      "Critics called them a \"game-changer\" as their uniquely playful blend of 1990s R&B and sugar-coated pop melodies broke through a K-pop market dominated by electronic beats. And their breezy dance moves stood out among super-synchronised videos.",
      "They were still on the rise when Min Hee-jin - Ador's former boss and their long-time mentor, who launched them - began trading accusations publicly with Hybe. The music label had created Ador, granting Min a minority shareholding and further stock options, before she was removed from her role last August.",
      "Hybe was now accusing her of plotting Ador's takeover and Min, in an emotional press conference, accused them of undermining NewJeans by launching another girl group with a similar style. The fight got uglier and Min left the company, alleging she was forced out.",
      "That's when NewJeans broke their silence - they demanded Min's return in two weeks in a livestream.",
      "They were not able to contact her for a while, Danielle told the BBC in the first interview: \"We didn't know what was happening and we didn't have a way to support her. That itself was a hard thing because she was always there for us and\u2026 in a way a person to look up to.\"",
      "Ador had said Min could not return as CEO, but could continue as an internal director and NewJeans' producer. When Min didn't return, NewJeans announced that they were leaving Ador and accused the label of not meeting other demands: an apology for alleged bullying and actions against what they claimed were controversial internal reports.",
      "Ador, which denies all these allegations, appears to blame Min for their dispute with NewJeans. \"The core of this issue lies in the label's ex-management providing distorted explanations to their artists, leading to misunderstandings. They can be fully addressed and resolved upon the members' return to the label,\" Ador told the BBC in a statement.",
      "In the months since, Hanni, a Vietnamese-Australian, testified in tears to South Korean lawmakers in an inquiry into workplace harassment. \"I came to the realisation that this wasn't just a feeling. I was honestly convinced that the company hated us,\" she told them, after describing several incidents where she said the group felt undermined and bullied.",
      "NewJeans' case was dismissed because the labour ministry said K-pop stars did not qualify as workers and were not entitled to the same rights.",
      "Then in December, NewJeans took another rare step by supporting fans who were calling for the impeachment of South Korea's disgraced president, Yoon Suk Yeol who had briefly imposed martial law - the group provided free food and drinks to fans who showed up at the huge protest rallies.",
      "With each round of publicity, there was also criticism, much of it involving their age. Some said they had \"crossed the line\", while others called them \"stupid and reckless,\" and even \"ungrateful\" for picking a fight with Ador. Others questioned if they were making their own decisions.",
      "Being young doesn't mean they should be taken less seriously, the group says. \"That's an easy way to devalue the fact that we are actually trying to do something,\" Hanni says. \"The decisions we've made in the past year have been decided through a very, very large amount of discussion between us.\"",
      "As the dispute has dragged on, the critics have got louder, dubbing the girls as troublemakers rather than game-changers. Following the ruling, which their critics welcomed, NewJeans say they have been \"very aware of the intense scrutiny and judgment\" ever since they held that press conference last year.",
      "\"There hasn't been a single moment when we've expressed our opinions without worry or tension,\"  Minji says. \"We've thought more than anyone else about how much responsibility each of our actions carries, and we're currently bearing that responsibility ourselves.\"",
      "It's not clear how long their hiatus will last. Ador says it hopes to meet the group soon to discuss the future, but NewJeans insist they don't feel protected enough to go back.",
      "Their lawsuit with Ador will return to the headlines next week when the hearings begin - and so will all five of them.",
      "The one thing that seems constant is their determination to get through this together.",
      "Two weeks ago, Hanni had said: \"We've always said to each other, if one person doesn't want to do it, then we're not going to do it. It has to be all all five of us that agrees to do it. That's how we've gotten here and that's how we are going to get to the end.\"",

      "There are two elements - a daily living component and a mobility component. Claimants may be eligible for one or both.",
      "Under the government's proposals, assessments for the daily living part will be tightened, which the official forecaster - the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) - says will affect around 800,000 people.",
      "Pip assessments involve questions about tasks like preparing and eating food, washing and getting dressed. Each is scored on a scale from zero - for no difficulty - to 12 - for the most severe - by a health professional.",
      "From November 2026, the government says people will need to score at least four points for one activity, instead of qualifying for support with a score that could describe less severe difficulties (ones and twos) across a broad range of tasks.",
      "For example, needing help to wash your hair, or your body below the waist, would be awarded two points, but needing help to wash between the shoulders and waist would equate to four points.",

      "At present, the payment is made for a fixed period of time between one and 10 years, after which it is reviewed. You may be reassessed sooner if your circumstances change.",

      "At present, more than three million recipients have no requirement to find work due to their health, a number that has risen sharply.",
      "The basic level of universal credit is worth \u00a3393.45 a month to a single person who is 25 or over.",
      "But if you have limited capacity to work because of a disability or long term condition, this payment more than doubles, because of an extra top up worth \u00a3416.19.",
      "Under the government's proposals, claimants will not be eligible to get this incapacity top-up until they are aged 22 or over.",
      "New claimants will also see this top-up fall from \u00a397 extra per week in 2025-26 to \u00a350 a week by 2026-27, before being frozen until the end of 2029-30.",
      "The higher rate for existing health-related claimants will also be frozen for the same period.",
      "At the same time, the basic payment level for universal credit will rise. When the government first set out its plans, it said it would rise to \u00a3107 a week by 2029-30, but the Spring Statement confirmed it would go up to \u00a3106.",

      "730,000 future UC recipients who will lose an average of \u00a33,000 per year.",
      "However, these calculations don't take into account the effects of the extra \u00a31bn the government it says it will spend to help those with disabilities and long-term health conditions find work.",
      "It expects this support will mitigate some of the predicted financial losses.",
      "In addition, the DWP says 3.8 million families will gain an average of \u00a3420 a year as a result of the increase in the standard UC allowance and changes to the assessment process.",
      "What is being done to get more people into work?",
      "The government says it wants to help those who can work back into employment, while doing more to protect those with severe conditions who are unable to do so.",
      "As part of this it will invest \u00a31bn in what it calls \"high-quality, tailored and personalised support\" to help people find jobs.",
      "A number of changes have been announced which the government hopes will break the link between trying to get into work and losing benefits.",
      "The work capability assessment, which checks eligibility for the health related top-up to universal credit, will be scrapped by 2028.",
      "Instead, claimants will have to go through the Pip system to claim for a health benefit. The government says they will be assessed on how their disability affects their daily life, rather than on their capacity to work.",
      "While you can receive universal credit or Pip while in employment, universal credit is means-tested and tapers off as earnings increase, while Pip is not affected by how much someone works or their level of savings.",
      "A new \"right to try\" system will mean people will not be financially penalised if they take a job which doesn't work out.",
      "The government will also consult on merging employment and support allowance and jobseeker's allowance into a single time-limited benefit that is not means-tested. This would be more generous but available for a shorter period.",
      "\"If you have paid into the system, you'll get stronger income protection while we help you get back on track,\" Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall said.",
      "Why does the government want to cut welfare spending?",
      "Overall, the government currently spends \u00a365bn a year on health and disability-related benefits. Before the government announced the Pip and UC changes, this was projected to increase to \u00a3100bn by 2029.",
      "Pip is the second-largest element of the working-age welfare bill, with spending due to almost double to \u00a334bn by 2029-30.",
      "When Pip was introduced in 2013, the aim was to save \u00a31.4bn a year by reducing the number of people eligible for payments. However, initial savings were modest and the number of claimants has risen.",
      "About 1.3m people now claim disability benefits primarily for mental health or behavioural conditions.",
      "That is 44% of all working age claimants, according to the independent economic think-tank, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS).",
      "The OBR now predicts welfare spending on working-age adults will be \u00a372.3bn by 2029-2030. Spending on pensioners and children is expected to be \u00a325.4bn.",

      "He has just had an ultrasound scan at an NHS centre which sits between familiar High Street names. It is easy-to-reach healthcare - as convenient as popping out to the shops.",
      "This is part of the government's vision for the future of the NHS, soon to be set out in a 10-year plan. In England, ministers have already promised three big changes: shifting more services from hospitals into the community, focusing on preventing ill-health and making more use of new technology.",
      "BBC Panorama spent months in South Yorkshire meeting people already changing how they work, to see what it will take to fix a health service which is buckling under increasing demand.",
      "The NHS also has to cut waiting times, money is tight and the organisation which currently runs it, NHS England, is being scrapped to reduce bureaucracy.",
      "There is another deep-rooted problem - a care system, supporting older and disabled people in the community, that is understaffed, underfunded and in crisis.",
      "Government critics say you cannot reform the NHS unless you reform social care, because it helps get people out of hospital more quickly and prevents some being admitted in the first place.",
      "An independent commission will begin looking at social care reform next month. There will be an interim report, but the final report is not due until 2028.",
      "Challenged on whether you can reform the NHS without changing social care, Health and Social Care Secretary, Wes Streeting tells Panorama that he doesn't need to wait for a review and plans to divert more NHS money into social care.",
      "\"I want to spend more of our resources through social care, because it delivers better outcomes for patients and better value for taxpayers,\" he says.",
      "Streeting would not be drawn on how much money would be involved, but said details about spending on social care would be in the 10-year NHS plan.",
      "Most care is paid for by councils, or by the people who need it. It can end up costing some families tens of thousands of pounds. Only those with the very highest needs get help from the NHS.",
      "Future of the NHS",
      "At Barnsley Hospital it used to take about six weeks to get a non-urgent scan, but at the town's NHS centre next to the shops most people are seen in two weeks.",
      "The centre's new scanners and X-ray machines have increased the number of patients staff can see and freed up the hospital so it can concentrate on emergencies and inpatients.",
      "Phil had skin cancer removed four weeks ago from his chin and the consultant wanted to check a couple of pea-sized lumps in his stomach. The scan results will be sent to his GP.",
      "\"It's about peace of mind. You're not waiting for appointments,\" he says.",
      "Liz Elfleet, medical imaging manager at Barnsley Hospital NHS Foundation Trust who helped set up the unit, describes this as the future of the NHS.",
      "\"We've seen around a 50% reduction in patients not attending for appointments,\" and the number of women accepting an invitation to have a routine breast screening appointment has risen \"from 43% to just under 80% over the three years,\" she says.",
      "The centre, which offers a range of health checks and scans, was opened in 2022 under the last Conservative government. The current Labour government says many more services will now move out of hospital into the community.",
      "In Barnsley, that is already happening. Part of another shopping centre is being converted into a second, large health hub. The project will be funded by the local council, regional mayor and a government grant.",
      "The leader of Labour-run Barnsley Council, Sir Steve Houghton, says the scanning centre has shown NHS facilities can boost town centres, and they estimate people spend about \u00a317 on average in local businesses when they visit.",
      "Preventing ill-health",
      "The second big shift the NHS is being asked to make is to focus more on preventing ill-health. In Sheffield, a GP practice has already begun to do this, to help them manage a workload which they say had become overwhelming.",
      "Five years ago, Steel City General Practice analysed the data for 10,000 of their patients who needed the most help. \"So we then said, let's actually proactively bring them in. They haven't contacted us - we've contacted them,\" says Dr Krishna Kasaraneni.",
      "GP appointments usually take about 10 minutes, but the Steel City practice gave these patients longer appointments to try to pick up problems earlier. They also took a risk and didn't chase a national target to see all patients within two weeks.",
      "Dr Kasaraneni says it has paid off. \"The numbers of strokes have dropped over that five-year period. Coronary heart disease numbers have dropped,\" he says. It has helped the doctors manage their workload better.",
      "The improved health of the patients has freed up some appointments, and on average people don't wait longer to see someone, but the growing older population means they are still very busy.",
      "While GPs will be crucial to the government's 10-year plan, there are not enough of them. Taking into account those working part-time, the equivalent number of fully qualified, full-time GPs is lower now than it was a decade ago - despite a rising population.",
      "Better use of technology",
      "The third of the big NHS changes is better use of new technology. At Sheffield's Royal Hallamshire Hospital, they are using AI to speed up the comparison of heart scans.",
      "Before, a radiographer would take about half an hour to manually plot different points around a 3D image of the heart and identify any changes from a scan carried out six months earlier. Now AI tackles it in just a couple of minutes.",
      "Prof Andy Swift, who developed the AI tool with colleagues from the hospital and Sheffield University, says it has been used on 10,000 cases in the past few years. He says it is saving about 30 minutes each time.",
      "\"In the time that we've saved, we've managed to scan more patients and also do more reports for patients,\" he says.",
      "Despite these innovations, change on the scale the government promises is difficult in an NHS struggling to cope with growing demand.",
      "Solving the problems of the NHS also requires tackling the difficulties of social care, which supports around a million older and disabled people in the community.",
      "In February, NHS England figures showed around 14,000 people could not leave hospital, partly because of a lack of home and residential care. More social care can also reduce falls and illnesses.",
      "'We keep pressure off NHS'",
      "The family of Martin - who is 41 and is autistic, with cerebral palsy and epilepsy - say Sheffield care worker Darren Leigh has become like a brother to him over 20 years. Darren knows when Martin is unwell and can quickly get the right help.",
      "\"We keep pressure off the NHS a lot of the time,\" he says. \"There are [also] people in hospital that need to come out but can't because they can't get the care they need.\"",
      "The care system has struggled with underfunding, staff shortages and increasing demand for years. Like many care firms, the not-for-profit company Darren works for says it is \"on a bit of a knife-edge\" as the government is also increasing the costs of employing people. Employer's National Insurance and the National Minimum Wage will go up in April.",
      "The government says it will give councils in England nearly \u00a3900m more for adult and children's social care over the next year. Across the UK, there will be increased support for family carers and a fair pay agreement for staff is being introduced.",
      "Speaking to Panorama, Streeting says social care has a \"big part to play in terms of shifting care out of hospital into the community\". He adds: \"I'm convinced that we can spend NHS resources more effectively through social care.\"",
      "The main opposition parties in England agree social care needs to be reformed.",
      "But the Conservatives say the government has no real plan.",
      "The Liberal Democrats say the NHS cannot be fixed without fixing social care. Reform UK wants to simplify social care through a single funding stream.",
      "And the Green Party is calling for free social care.",
      "There are also questions over whether the NHS has the money to make all the changes the government is promising.",
      "It had a budget of \u00a3171bn in the financial year 2023-2024. It was also given an additional \u00a321bn over two years. NHS Providers, representing trusts across England, says most of that money has been eaten up by everyday pressures including wage rises, inflation and drug price increases.",
      "It warns these competing pressures make the change needed more difficult.",
      "The health and social care secretary agrees that it will not be easy, but says he cannot \"keep on pouring ever-increasing amounts of taxpayers' money into a system that is not set up to deliver best use of that money and best care for patients\"."

    "published": "Mon, 24 Mar 2025 02:46:42 GMT",
    "summary": "An inquest into the death of Ida Lock has shone light on repeat mistakes - and wider failures in certain hospitals across England",
    "story": [
      "Listen to Michael read this article",
      "By the entrance to Furness General Hospital in Barrow-in-Furness sits a sculpture of a moon with 11 stars. It is a memorial to the mother and babies who died unnecessarily due to poor care at the hospital between 2004 and 2013.",
      "Inscribed underneath is a short verse: \"Forever in our hearts; Forever held in the love that brought you here; Our star in the night sky, spring blossom, summer rose, falling leaf, winter frost; Forever in our hearts.\"",
      "When the memorial was unveiled in 2019, Aaron Cummins who is chief executive at University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Trust, which runs the hospital, said: \"We will never forget what happened.  We owe it to those who died to continually improve in everything that we do.\"",
      "Barely a month later, Sarah Robinson stepped into a birthing pool at the Royal Lancaster Infirmary, a hospital run by the same NHS trust. She was about to give birth to her second child.",
      "Within an hour, Ida Lock was born; within a week, she was dead.",
      "What her parents were put through on that day \u2013 and in the years since \u2013 goes a long way to explaining why maternity services in England have failed so many families.",
      "The inquest into Ida Lock's death, which concluded last week, exposed over five weeks why maternity services across England have long struggled to improve - and this one case holds a mirror to issues that appear to be prevalent across a number of trusts.",
      "'I thought I'd done something wrong'",
      "The memorial the trust erected at Furness General Hospital followed a damning inquiry into the trust's maternity services.",
      "That investigation, carried out by Dr Bill Kirkup and published in March 2015, found there had been a dysfunctional culture at Furness General, substandard clinical skills, poor risk assessments and a grossly deficient response to adverse incidents with a repeated failure to properly investigate cases and learn lessons.",
      "Morecambe Bay became a byword for poor maternity care and the trust promised to enact all 18 recommendations from the Kirkup review. And yet that never happened.",
      "\"We wouldn't be in this situation now if they'd followed those recommendations,\" says Ms Robinson.",
      "Ida Lock's inquest began last month, more than five years after she died - the delay was down to several reasons, including its particular complexity.",
      "What emerged was just how profoundly many of those lessons had not been learned. Particularly egregious, says Ms Robinson, was a suggestion from a midwife \u2013 shortly after the birth - that Ida's poor condition was linked to her smoking, something Sarah had never done in her life.",
      "\"The amount of days I cried because I thought I'd done something wrong... every Christmas, every holiday, you always have this heavy weight that you shouldn't be having fun. And all along, some people knew.\"",
      "Meanwhile, the staff who had delivered Ida were told in an email that \"they had demonstrated excellent teamwork, and had all worked in the best interests of mum and baby\".",
      "As the coroner found on Friday, Ida's death was wholly avoidable, caused by a failure to recognise that she was in distress prior to her birth, and then a botched resuscitation attempt after she was born.",
      "By the time she was transferred to a higher dependency unit, at the Royal Preston hospital, she had suffered a brain injury from which she could not recover.",
      "Having failed to deliver their daughter safely, Ida's parents would have expected that the trust would properly and openly investigate her death. Instead, they pursued an investigation that Carey Galbraith, the midwife who completed it, would later describe as \"not worth the paper it was written on\".",
      "They didn't take responsibility for their failings despite having an independent report from the Healthcare Safety Investigation Branch (HSIB) \u2013 a body that examined questionable maternity care \u2013 clearly stating their shortcomings.",
      "\"Our efforts to get any answers have been met with a complete block,\" said Ida's father, Ryan Lock. \"Particular people have told us to our face something that wasn't the case, that Ida was poorly before she was born, and that's the reason why that this happened.\"",
      "Clearly, the Morecambe Bay report was not, as was hoped, a line in the sand for maternity services across England, or a rallying cry for widespread improvements. As the inquest has shown, it did not even lead to sustained improvement at Morecambe Bay.",
      "Tabetha Darmon, chief nursing officer at the trust, said in a statement last week that it has made improvements since.",
      "\"We take the conclusions from the coroner very seriously and have made a number of the improvements identified during the inquest. We are carefully reviewing the learning identified to ensure that we do everything we can to prevent this from happening to another family.\"",
      "'A woeful picture' nationwide",
      "Elsewhere around the country, other trusts have also been forced to face their failures, often by grieving families.",
      "In March 2022, an investigation into services at the Shrewsbury and Telford NHS trust found that more than 200 mothers and babies could have survived with better care. Then, in October that year, a review into maternity services at East Kent Hospitals University NHS trust found that at least 45 babies might have survived if they had been given proper treatment.",
      "And an ongoing review into the maternity care provided by Nottingham University Hospitals NHS trust, due to be completed next year, is set to be the biggest yet, with around 2,500 cases being examined.",
      "Even that does not tell the full story. Families in several areas, including Sussex, Leeds and Oxford, want local investigations into their maternity services. And an annual review of units by inspectors the Care Quality Commission (CQC) paints a woeful picture.",
      "In the commission's latest report, published in September, not a single one of the 131 units inspected received the top rating, Outstanding, for providing safe care.",
      "About a third (35%) were rated as Good for safety, around half (47%) were rated as Requires Improvement while almost a fifth (18%) were deemed Inadequate, the lowest grading.",
      "\"While we identified pockets of excellent practice,\" wrote the CQC, \"we are concerned that too many women and babies are not receiving the high-quality maternity care they deserve.\"",
      "Professor James Walker, who used to be the clinical director for HSIB, said that from his visits around England, the problem was that maternity units \"didn't have the skills, the finances, or the drive to actually make the changes that are required.\"",
      "Ida Lock's inquest was a case in point. What emerged over the inquiry was that the midwife delivering Ida was not compliant with crucial training in heart-rate monitoring, that staff did not know how to investigate incidents or realise they should inform external regulators of an unexpected death.",
      "\"It's deeply distressing,\" says Dr Kirkup. \"It's bad enough that other trusts didn't listen, but for it to happen again in this same trust is unforgivable.\"",
      "From poor culture to lack of teamwork",
      "Listening to his exasperation brought me back to the autumn of 2022. On that bright morning, Dr Kirkup was speaking at the publication of his inquiry into maternity care in East Kent.",
      "Many of the failures he'd found there \u2013 poor culture, lack of teamworking, not listening to families, a failure to investigate incidents or learn from them \u2013 were a repetition of what he'd uncovered at Morecambe Bay seven years earlier.",
      "He struggled to hide his frustration that here he was again, forced once more to explain to families why they had been failed by a trust that did not know how to do the right thing.",
      "Like Morecambe Bay, East Kent deteriorated even after his 2022 inquiry. Within months of the publication, inspectors became so concerned about its services that they considered closing maternity care at one of its hospitals, the William Harvey in Ashford.",
      "The CQC found that staff were not carrying out basic tasks such as washing their hands in between patients, or wearing gloves and aprons when delivering care, and that they were leaving urine and bloodstains in toilets.",
      "The inspection highlighted how little the East Kent review had changed things where it mattered, front-line in the wards.",
      "As the report had said, \"there are deep-seated and longstanding problems of organisational culture\" in the trust's maternity units, including \"disgraceful behaviour and flawed teamworking that were previously left to fester\".",
      "In October 2024, the board of East Kent Hospitals Trust said that it apologised unreservedly for the pain and loss, and for the failures of the board.",
      "It said: \"We are on a journey to fundamentally transform the way we work. Changing the culture of a large and complex organisation takes time and there is much work still to do, but we are determined to succeed so that we are providing the right standard of care and compassion.\"",
      "Derek Richford, whose grandson Harry had died in avoidable circumstances in 2017 at East Kent, is now working with the trust to improve maternity care and argues that it is an uphill struggle. \"It's been a devil of a job,\" he claims, \"to get people in the trust to simply read the report, even the summary.\"",
      "Should medics be punished?",
      "The question asked by some families is why heads haven't rolled. There is a widespread recognition in healthcare that punishing medics for individual clinical errors does not necessarily lead to safer outcomes.",
      "It can in some cases promote a defensive culture, where people do not own up to their mistakes and lead to individuals being blamed rather than supported to improve.",
      "The day after the Shrewsbury maternity report was published, the then-Health Secretary Sajid Javid said his department would \"go after the people responsible.",
      "\"I want to make sure that we leave no stone unturned in finding the people that were responsible for this and making sure that they are held to account,\" he added.",
      "Three years later, there is no evidence of anybody being held to account.",
      "The Department of Health says it is \"unable to comment on individual staffing responsibility while an active police investigation is taking place\".",
      "\u00a31.15bn of maternity-related payouts",
      "Even when major reviews into maternity care have led to families getting individual feedback and told they had been failed, any subsequent legal action leads to NHS Resolution, the health service's insurance arm, requiring that the case is examined afresh. This can add further delays and costs to the process.",
      "NHS Resolution said that inquiries \"do not look at cases from a legal liability perspective. Failings by a clinician might amount to errors of judgement, but that is not necessarily sufficient to constitute negligence under the law\".",
      "Rise of vaccine distrust - why more of us are questioning jabs",
      "The NHS is spending a fortune giving people a death they don't want",
      "Labour's plan for benefits throws up a bigger dilemma",
      "In 2023-24, NHS Resolution paid out \u00a31.15bn for maternity-related deaths and injuries, 41% of its total payments, despite maternity care forming a much smaller proportion of a trust's daily activities.",
      "\"NHS resolution is this anonymous body,\" says Derek Richford, \"that you can't get a name of the person you want to speak to. You can't get any accountability. And those people are the puppeteers for the people below who have to run around doing their will. It's wrong.\"",
      "'The time for inquiries is over'",
      "There are now calls for the government to establish a national maternity inquiry, rather than relying on individual ones at different hospitals and trusts. More than 36,000 people have signed up to one such petition, led by two sets of bereaved parents; while campaign group Maternity Safety Alliance is making a similar call. So far, the Department of Health hasn't committed to a national inquiry.",
      "Both Dr Kirkup and Prof Walker argue that the time for inquiries is over.",
      "\"Another inquiry will find exactly the same things that we find at the moment,\" said Prof Walker, \"we know what the problems are.\"",
      "What is needed is a national plan to improve maternity care, argues Dr Kirkup. He says he has been working with the Department of Health on drawing up plans to improve teamworking and providing compassionate care.",
      "Streeting has said he will \"fix our maternity services\", including supporting trusts to make rapid improvements and training more midwives, but has not detailed how he intends to go about this. \"I just wish that the Secretary of State would announce his intentions,\" says Dr Kirkup.",
      "Prof Walker also believes that a national programme of improvement and oversight should be launched, taking the learning from individual investigations and ensuring it is embedded across the system. For it to be truly effective, he argues, it will require a specific type of leadership.",
      "\"The NHS traditionally doesn't appoint leaders,\" he says, \"it appoints managers, people who come in and take the status quo that's there, and just make sure that it gets more efficient. That doesn't make it better, or innovate or improve.",
      "\"One of my frustrations over the years, working in various places, is I kept being told 'we don't do that'. And I kept on saying, 'why don't we do that?' The simple questions are always the best ones, because they challenge the status quo.\"",
      "Prof Walker highlights that there has been some progress in recent years, however. The latest figures on Maternity and Newborn Safety Investigations (the successor body to HSIB) show that the number of incidents of both potential and severe brain injuries have decreased.",
      "Back in East Kent, Mr Richford has observed some changes too. \"We have a new board of directors that appear to be doing the right thing \u2013 they're certainly saying the right thing,\" he says.",
      "\"[But] even now, seven years on [from Harry's death], it's still not as it should be. We are still trying to make sure that the trust is being as transparent as they say they are.\"",
      "As for Ida Lock's parents, the road on which their daughter would have grown up leads directly to Morecambe Bay, and a small patch of sand. This is where they scattered some of her ashes. Now they refer to it as Ida's beach. When they pass by, with their two other children, they regularly blow her a kiss across the sand.",
      "Their fervent hope is that other couples do not experience a similar fate. But they know that long before them, other families also suffered - and they aren't confident that more won't in the future.",
      "\"Those families went through what we're going through now,\" says Sarah. \"But nothing came of it. You can't trust that [improvements] are ever going to happen.",
      "\"I hope something does change.\"",

      "Downing Street also announced local leaders would be given more than \u00a31bn to boost regional transport, such as West Yorkshire's mass transit system.",
      "The additional money is also expected to help fund a new railway station in Liverpool's Baltic Triangle area and the redevelopment of Bury Interchange.",
      "Speaking to staff at a fabric manufacturing site, Sir Keir praised Huddersfield Station and the beautiful countryside on the train route between Huddersfield and Leeds.",
      "But he added: \"The downside was, if you can believe it, the train was late.",
      "\"That is, I'm sure for you, a pretty frequent experience.\"",
      "\"The North is home to a wealth of talent and ingenuity. But for too long, it has been held to ransom by a Victorian-era transport system which has stifled its potential.\"",
      "The prime minister said the Transpennine upgrade was a project that could \"massively improve\" people's lives.",
      "\"The impact is a human one - because there's not just the getting to work late and the irritation of that, but there's also the important NHS appointments, the family engagements and the funerals that people are trying to get to.",
      "\"All these things are hugely impactful on a human level that you can't get in the statistics.\"",
      "Improving rail connections would ensure \"people can get around, businesses can thrive and people can enjoy their lives, in a way they can't if public transport isn't working properly\", he added.",
      "Later, speaking to the BBC's James Vincent, Sir Keir reiterated the \u00a3415m was new money, to be invested in addition to the cash already pledged to the upgrade.",
      "He said: \"Obviously it's a big project - up to \u00a310bn. But this is a material, and important, step forward.\"",
      "Work to electrify railway lines running across the Pennines was given the go-ahead in 2022, more than 10 years after the scheme was first mooted by the then-chancellor, George Osborne.",
      "It's part of a major package of investment to improve transport across the North, with the government now saying it is to spend more than double the money per head on local transport in the North than the South, including London.",
      "However, the project, which will ultimately speed up journey times for passengers, is not expected to be completed until the mid-2030s.",
      "West Yorkshire mayor Tracy Brabin welcomed the PM's backing for a mass transit system for the region as a \"game-changer\" that would \"see trams back on the streets of Leeds and Bradford for the first time in 75 years\".",

      "The government will not get close to the extra homes needed to hit its housing target in England, official figures suggest.",
      "Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner's plan for 1.5 million new homes by 2029 is seen as crucial to solving the housing crisis and boosting economic growth.",
      "But latest estimates from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) suggest the government will fall short of that figure, even with planning reforms outlined in chancellor Rachel Reeves's Spring Statement on Wednesday.",
      "A government spokesperson said further reforms not reflected in the OBR's forecast would help to reach the 1.5 million target.",
      "The Home Builders Federation said the government \"urgently needs\" to make mortgages more accessible to first time buyers to meet the target.",
      "Rachel Reeves singled out the government's efforts to build more homes as a major success of the Labour government in her Spring Statement.",
      "She highlighted OBR figures that showed housebuilding was set to hit a 40-year-high and boost the economy by \u00a36.8bn.",
      "The chancellor claimed that reforms to the planning system would enable the government to get very close to achieving the 1.5 million target.",
      "But despite the chancellor's optimistic outlook, the figures actually suggest that planning reforms are on course to achieve far fewer new homes than first hoped.",
      "The central plank of those reforms are ambitious mandatory targets for every local authority, to grant more planning permissions.",
      "Reeves said the government would get to within \"touching distance\" of its 1.5m target, telling MPs that 1.3 million new homes would be created by 2029.",
      "However, the 1.3 million figure she used includes housebuilding in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.",
      "In fact, only 1 million new homes are expected to be built in England, it's understood.",
      "OBR figures also make clear that many of those homes would have been built anyway, regardless of the government's planning reforms.",
      "The watchdog says reforms introduced by Angela Rayner will only lead to an extra 170,000 homes in England, a quarter of the amount needed to hit her target.",
      "Ministers have been keen to point to the economic boost that those 170,000 new homes will achieve.",
      "Last year saw a record low for housing projects granted planning permission in England, with just over 30,000 projects given the go-ahead.",
      "The chief executive of the Home Builders Federation, Neil Jefferson, told the BBC the government needs to address \"other barriers\" to \"reverse the declines we have seen in supply and deliver much needed housing\".",
      "He said the planning changes were \"very positive but further interventions are urgently needed if we are to increase housebuilding to the level required\".",
      "A government spokesperson said: \"The OBR forecast only factors in reforms to the National Planning Policy Framework in England which is just one element of this government's efforts to increase housebuilding.",
      "\"Further reforms such as the Planning and Infrastructure Bill, the government's long term housing strategy and the new Affordable Homes Programme are not reflected in the forecast and will all help to reach the 1.5 million target.\"",

      "The UK government is trying to negotiate exemptions from a wide range of US import levies due to come into force at midnight on 3 April.",
      "But some car companies believe it is now too late to delay the measure, and instead want to discuss support options.",

      "There was also no indication that an agreement could be reached with the US on tariffs before the introduction next week, one source said.",
      "US tariffs could have a huge impact on the UK economy, with the government's official forecaster estimating that in a worst case scenario taxes could reduce economic growth by 1% and wipe out Chancellor Rachel Reeves's \u00a39.9bn headroom against her debt rules.",
      "Government sources said there is \"still all to play for\" in negotiations over 25% tariffs placed on car imports into the US ahead of next week.",
      "The UK has said it will \"not be jumping into a trade war\" with the US. Treasury minister Darren Jones said the UK has to take a \"different approach\" to other countries when it comes to negotiating tariffs with the US.",
      "Jones said \"there is no easy answer\" and there are \"complicated issues\" to be discussed.",
      "While the government said it was \"disappointed\" by the decision to impose tariffs on cars, it said the US was \"an indispensable ally\" and Britain was taking a \"pragmatic\" approach to import taxes.",

      "Ineos Automotive, a start-up carmaker, told the BBC the tariffs are a \"significant threat\" since the US is its biggest market and its manufacturing is based in the European Union (EU).",
      "Ineos chief executive Lynn Calder said she was \"hugely frustrated\" that EU politicians had \"sat on their hands\" and \"not come to the negotiating table\" with Trump.",

      "Vehicles are the UK's biggest export to the US, totalling 101,000 last year worth \u00a39bn.",
      "The industry is likely to ask for a support package from the UK government to manage the disruption.",
      "The government is already consulting on changing the mandate for zero electric vehicles, which could end up costing UK manufacturers and subsidising importers such as Tesla, which is controlled by key Trump ally Elon Musk.",
      "The mandate sets out the percentage of new zero emission cars and vans that manufacturers will be required to sell each year up to 2030.",
      "Reeves has told the BBC that Tesla gets some money from the ZEV mandate.",

      "Rachel Reeves has said she will not accept free concert tickets again, following a backlash over her attendance at a Sabrina Carpenter gig.",
      "She has repeatedly defended her decision to accept tickets worth \u00a3600 for her and a family member to watch the American singer from a box at London's O2 arena.",
      "She argued it was a way to continue doing \"normal everyday things\" with her family whilst respecting her security needs as chancellor.",

      "Not appropriate to take free tickets, minister says",
      "Reeves defends taking free Sabrina Carpenter tickets",
      "Speaking to ITV, she said she was unable to buy regular tickets for security reasons and had been offered the box tickets by AEG, which owns the arena.",
      "She did not confirm which member of her family attended the concert with her, but added that she faced a \"balancing act in my job to try and be a good parent\" alongside her security needs she now faces in her Treasury job.",
      "\"I felt I was doing the right thing, but I do understand perceptions,\" she said, adding: \"I recognise the feeling here. I have no intention of doing that again.\"",
      "She added she would continue to accept free hospitality if it was \"something that I need to do in my job, like I'm going to a formal dinner or a formal event\".",
      "\"But, look, I went with a family member. I'm not intending to take concert tickets in the future.\"",
      "'Weird'",
      "Ministers are not banned from accepting gifts, as long as they are declared, but under new rules they must consider the need to maintain public trust.",
      "The tickets have been declared on Reeves's public register of interests, which shows she accepted them on 8 March and registered them 10 days later.",
      "Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer had backed the chancellor on Monday, saying \"everything she has done is according to the rules\".",

      "\"If I want to go to a concert at the O2 I'll pay for it - but individual MPs, individual ministers, make their own decisions,\" he added.",
      "Speaking to ITV on Wednesday, Reeves said she understood her acceptance of the tickets would look \"weird\" to some people, adding: \"I totally get that\".",
      "\"But I do want to carry on doing the things that normal parents do with their kids, and that gave me the opportunity to do that,\"",
      "Speaking at a news conference on Wednesday, she said she had been advised it would be \"better for security reasons\" for her to watch the concert from a box.",
      "\"That's the reason why I did that, rather than just being in normal seats, which to be honest, for me and my family, would have been a lot nicer and a lot easier\".",
      "She added that she was \"not personally a huge Sabrina Carpenter fan, being a 46 year-old woman\"."

      "The figure, released by the Department for Work and Pensions, is an increase of 100,000 children from the previous year - and equates to 31% of children in the UK.",
      "The figure has risen sharply since 2021 and the Child Poverty Action Group (CPAG) predicts 4.8 million children will be in poverty by the end of this Parliament in 2029-30.",
      "It is calling for the government to scrap the two-child benefit limit in its upcoming child poverty strategy, and to pause the recent proposals for wider benefit cuts.",
      "The two-child cap prevents parents from claiming universal credit or child tax credit for a third child, with a few exemptions.",
      "The relative poverty definition - which is measured both before and after housing costs - refers to people living in households with income below 60% of the country's median average figure.",
      "Separately, the Scottish government has missed its legal targets for reducing child poverty for 2023-24.",
      "'Huge challenge'",
      "\"The latest data is a stark reminder of the scale of deprivation among families, with close to a third of children in Britain now living in poverty,\" said Adam Corlett, principal economist at the Resolution Foundation think tank.",
      "\"This is before any additional impact from new benefit cuts and a weak living standards outlook, which are set to reduce incomes across the poorest half of working-age households by \u00a3500 over the next five years.\"",
      "Speaking in the House of Commons on Thursday, work and pensions minister Sir Stephen Timms said the figures \"show just what a huge challenge\" the \"very high level of child poverty that's left by the previous government\" is for Labour.",
      "He added: \"We're going to be addressing that\".",
      "Chancellor Rachel Reeves confirmed a shake-up to the benefits system on Wednesday. This includes halving incapacity benefits for new claimants, and tighter criteria around the Personal Independence Payment for those with long term physical or mental health conditions.",
      "An extra 250,000 people, including 50,000 children, will be pushed into relative poverty by these changes, according to the government's own impact assessment.",
      "In the three years to 2024, the highest child poverty rates after housing costs were in the West Midlands and London, although London's levels were among the lowest if housing was not factored in.",
      "One in five families who had one child were living in poverty, compared with 44% of those who had three children or more.",
      "The Resolution Foundation echoed calls for the government to scrap the two-child benefit limit and wants the government to extend free school meal entitlement to all families on Universal Credit.",
      "When Labour took power in the summer of 2024, after the period covered by the figures, the prime minister announced the creation of a child poverty task force, promising to leave \"no stone unturned\" in tackling the root causes of the issue.",
      "The cross-government child poverty strategy is due to be published in spring 2025.",
      "\"No-one should be living in poverty, and we know that the best route out of poverty for struggling families is well paid, secure work, a Department for Work and Pensions spokesperson said.",

      "It may also force firms to manufacture and invest in the US. \"If you build your car in the United States there is no tariff,\" Trump has said.",

    "story": [
      "Rachel Reeves has squeezed the welfare budget further and boosted defence spending in a Spring Statement aimed at kick-starting the faltering economy.",
      "The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) - the government's financial watchdog - halved its growth forecast for this year to 1%.",
      "The chancellor blamed global instability, arguing that the world was \"changing before our eyes\" and promising a \"new era of security and national renewal\".",
      "The OBR painted a more upbeat picture of subsequent years, predicting growth will be higher than expected thanks, in part, to more housebuilding.",
      "Key points from the Spring Statement at a glanceThree ways the changes could affect you and your moneyWho is affected by the Pip and universal credit changes?Anxiety over welfare cuts rises among Labour MPs",
      "Key points from the Spring Statement at a glance",
      "Three ways the changes could affect you and your money",
      "Who is affected by the Pip and universal credit changes?",
      "Anxiety over welfare cuts rises among Labour MPs",
      "The Spring Statement was meant to be a routine update on the public finances but Reeves made more extensive changes after her plans were blown off course by lower growth and higher government borrowing costs.",
      "Reeves used her statement to announce a further \u00a32.2bn for defence, while a target has been set to reduce the administrative costs of government departments by 15% by 2030.",
      "Real household disposable income per person is expected to grow by an average of around 0.5% a year, the OBR said.",
      "Reeves said this meant that by 2029 households would be on average more than \u00a3500 a year better off compared with what the OBR had expected in October.",
      "Economist Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, told BBC Breakfast this was \"actually a pretty feeble rate of growth\".",
      "Writing in the Times, Reeves defended her handling of the economy, saying her plan was starting to \"bear fruit\", with wages up and interest rates down.",
      "\"I won't shy away from the challenges we face, and change won't happen overnight,\" Reeves added. \"But the prize on offer to us is immense.\"",
      "The Conservatives claimed her statement was an \"emergency budget\" to \"clean up the mess\" created by her decision in October to increase national insurance costs for business and government borrowing to fund public services.",
      "Shadow chancellor Mel Stride accused the chancellor of having \"tanked the economy\" due to her \"ineptitude\".",
      "This is hotly disputed by the government who insist they are sticking to rigid \"fiscal rules\" aimed at keeping a lid on borrowing - to prevent a repeat of the economic meltdown seen after Conservative PM Liz Truss's \"mini budget\".",
      "But the OBR - which was set up in 2010 to evaluate the government's figures - said Reeves will only manage to avoid breaking her fiscal rules through billions in public spending cuts.",
      "The government insists the most vulnerable will be protected from spending cuts - but some Labour MPs have accused the chancellor of seeking to balance the books on the backs of the poor and are threatening to vote against the changes.",
      "The Department for Work and Pensions' assessment finds that 3.8 million families are set to be on average \u00a3420 per year better off due to the changes.",
      "But the government analysis suggests more than 3 million families will on average be \u00a31,720 a year worse off by 2030 due to benefit cuts.",
      "On social media, Labour MP Jon Trickett said: \"I will not be voting for cuts to poorest people on welfare benefits. The chancellor has other options.",
      "\"Picking on disabled people is not the right thing to do.\"",
      "Another Labour MP, Brian Leishman, said he was \"very disappointed\" with the chancellor's statement, saying \"I'm not on board with that whatsoever\" and confirmed he would not vote in favour.",
      "Reeves also restored the government's \u00a39.9bn \"headroom\" - spare cash it will have by the end of its five year budget period to deal with unexpected developments.",
      "But the OBR says this is a \"very small margin\" and it would not take much to knock the government's finances off course.",
      "The watchdog believes Reeves has just over a 50% chance of meeting her own borrowing and debt rules by the end of the decade.",
      "But Reeves insisted at a news conference that she was determined to keep a grip on the public finances.",
      "\"People should have no doubt about my commitment and how seriously I take the fiscal rules, as I said today they are non-negotiable,\" she told reporters.",
      "She said the government would continue to make the case for free trade, amid the looming threat of US tariffs.",
      "On Wednesday, US President Donald Trump announced new import taxes of 25% on cars and car parts coming into America in a move that threatened to widen the global trade war.",
      "Lib Dem Treasury spokeswoman Daisy Cooper warned the chancellor she was \"flying blind\" into a trade war with Donald Trump that would leave her plans in \"tatters\" and the government should instead seek a new trade deal with the EU.",
      "Reform's deputy leader Richard Tice described the OBR's forecasts as \"delusional\" and said Labour should not rely so much on their advice.",
      "\"We can't keep spending more than we're earning,\" he told BBC Radio 5's Matt Chorley.",
      "\"I'm afraid we're heading to a very difficult place, led by the R-word \u2013 recession.\"",
      "Benefit cuts announced last week were extended after the OBR said they would not raise as much money as the government had expected.",
      "A rise in the standard rate of universal credit will be \u00a31 a week lower than previously announced, and the health element of universal credit - which reflects a limited capability to work - will be frozen at \u00a397 a week until 2029 for existing claimants.",
      "An extra 250,000 people, including 50,000 children, will be pushed into relative poverty by the government's changes, according to its own impact assessment.",
      "And an estimated 800,000 people will lose out on personal independent payments (Pips) by 2030.",
      "A further 2.25 million people currently receiving the health top up to universal credit will lose an average of \u00a3500 a year as a result of the freeze, and 730,000 future recipients will lose out.",
      "About 3.9 million households not on the health element of universal credit are expected to gain an average of \u00a3265 a year from the increase to the standard allowance.",
      "But the government stresses there are limits to their estimates because they don't take into account of funding for measures to support those with disabilities into employment.",
      "They also do not take into account the new protections for those with severe lifelong conditions.",

      "She died aged 57 at the Glasgow Royal Infirmary on Thursday morning.",

      "First Minister John Swinney told MSPs: \"Members across this parliament will feel that loss, but my party is aching at the news today.",
      "\"Christina was a parliamentarian of the highest motivation and the finest nature, I was proud that she was a member of my government, giving her all to make life better for others, which was always her motivation.\"",

    "summary": "Alex Mayer MP is calling for a return to \"Churchill Time\" where clocks are set two hours ahead.",
    "story": [
      "For many who dislike dark winter nights, this weekend will be one to savour as the clocks spring forward by an hour on Sunday 30 March from 01:00 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT).",
      "This marks the end for some and the gloom that can be caused by GMT, and the start of British Summer Time (BST) and lighter evenings.",
      "However, the Labour MP for Dunstable and Leighton Buzzard, Alex Mayer, has called for a \"major overhaul of time\" and a conversation about \"how best to use our nation's daylight hours\" in a parliamentary debate.",
      "But why do the clocks go back and forward in the UK each year?",
      "The process of moving the clocks forward by one hour in the summer was started during World War One in Germany in 1916, as a way to save energy resources during lighter evenings.",
      "Weeks later other countries followed suit, including the UK, where it was named British Summer Time. During World War Two in 1941, the then-prime minister Sir Winston Churchill introduced a system where clocks were advanced by two hours.",
      "This meant that during winter, while clocks went back an hour they were still one hour ahead of GMT to increase productivity during daylight.",
      "This ended in 1945, but briefly returned two years later due to severe fuel shortages that summer.",
      "What did the debate involve?",
      "Mayer wants a return to how things were in World War Two and hosted an adjournment debate in Parliament on the subject.",
      "She argued that a return to what is known as \"Churchill Time\" could help save a combined \u00a3485m in yearly electricity bills - and reduce carbon emissions by more than 400,000 tonnes.",
      "She called this \"a low-cost, high-impact proposal\" to \"help meet climate goals, reduce energy bills, and boost our High Streets by making better use of the daylight hours we already have\".",
      "Responding for the government, Business Minister Justin Madders said despite public debate about changing the clocks, the government was not going to introduce double summer time.",
      "Mayer is not the first MP to bring this discussion to Westminster.",
      "In 2012, a bid by Conservative MP Rebecca Harris to move UK clocks forward by an hour for a three-year trial period failed after the legislation ran out of time in the House of Commons.",
      "In 1968, there was a three-year experiment to keep BST in place throughout the year. On average, there was a huge reduction in road casualties, but this has since been attributed to new drink-driving legislation in 1967.",
      "What are the arguments against the change?",
      "During that experiment in northern Scotland, there was a net increase in the number of people killed or seriously injured on the roads, because during the darkest days of December sunrise would not take place until 10:00.",
      "In 2012, when MPs voted against it, many objections focused on the impact of a change on road accidents.",
      "Critics argued it would make the lives of outdoor workers harder and increase road accidents due to the darker mornings - although those in favour of a change argue it would reduce evening accidents.",
      "Other sources have expressed concerns about the negative impact of extended daylight evenings to health and sleep patterns.",
      "Recent studies suggested modern power consumption habits mean energy savings made by reducing evening lighting were now offset by increased energy consumption, in the warmer lighter evenings.",
      "Follow Beds, Herts and Bucks news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.",

      "The BBC reported that his account was being closed because he no longer met the wealth threshold for Coutts, citing a source familiar with the matter.",
      "However, the former UKIP leader later obtained a report from the bank which indicated his political views were also considered.",
      "NatWest's chief executive Dame Alison resigned in July 2023 after admitting she had made a mistake in speaking about Mr Farage's relationship with the bank.",
      "A public debate also followed over people being having their bank accounts shut due to their views. Farage said he was later refused personal and business accounts at seven more banks in the UK.",
      "An independent report found NatWest failed to communicate its decision properly when it decided to shut Farage's Coutts account.",

    "published": "Fri, 28 Mar 2025 00:00:13 GMT",
    "summary": "Why the reign of the free market is facing its biggest ever challenge",
    "story": [
      "I remember 1974 well. With inflation on the rise, the government had been locked in battle with trade unions over worker pay. The government appeared paralysed: stand up to the miners and strikes could shut down the power system, but give in and pay them more money and inflation would rocket.",
      "And then the global oil crisis came out of nowhere. It threw economies, including Britain's, into chaos. The government introduced a three-day week. Power cuts were common - we would be plunged into darkness without warning. And seemingly, the government just expected us to deal with it.",
      "This was also the year I began presenting the BBC's current affairs programme Panorama. We spent a lot of time debating these issues. People came on with all kinds of different ideas of what to do.",
      "There were even suggestions that what the country really needed to take back control from the unions was a military takeover - a coup.",
      "There was another idea out there too. It was proposed by the Conservative politician Keith Joseph and was entirely radical - so removed from the mainstream, in fact, that during filming of Panorama, Joseph turned to the production team and asked exasperatedly if they understood what he meant.",
      "That idea was the free market.",
      "This meant Britain departing from the post World War Two consensus that government should control the economy and that instead if you left the markets alone, they would deliver the country greater prosperity and security.",
      "If, in 2025, the idea sounds anything but radical, that's exactly the point.",
      "What we saw in the UK in the 1980s under Margaret Thatcher's government was just how quickly the free market transitioned from a radical idea into the new reality. Then before long it became what many assumed was the system that would last forever.",
      "US President Donald Trump is a billionaire businessman who has clearly done well financially out of capitalism. But suddenly, thanks in part to him, the free market system finds itself under assault like never before.",
      "It might yet weather the storm. However others are asking, is the free market system fatally flawed and doomed to failure?",
      "The fantasy world of Thatcher's Britain",
      "So much of what Thatcher did in the wake of her 1983 general election victory seems so obvious now. We take it for granted that private companies play a pivotal role in providing our water, electricity, gas, railways, ports and freight.",
      "But at the time few believed it possible to do what she had done - it seemed like a fantasy world, completely detached from how things had been done post war.",
      "I was six when the war ended. There was rationing \u2013 coupons that allowed you to buy meat or clothes, or of course, sweets. But out of these hard times and on the heels of victory, a new vision of society was emerging in Britain.",
      "With Clement Attlee's landslide election victory in July 1945, for the first time in Britain's political history a majority cast their votes for a party ostensibly dedicated to socialism.",
      "But more than that, a new consensus on how the country should run emerged, with those leading the Labour and Conservative parties singing from a broadly similar sheet.",
      "\"We have built our defences against want and sickness, and we're proud of it,\" was uttered not by a Labour prime minister but by Harold Macmillan, Conservative prime minister from 1957 to 1963. This had been how things were done.",
      "However not everyone bought into the consensus. Antony Fisher, who was a chicken farmer, was exasperated by what he saw as the meddling of the Egg Marketing Board. He set up the Institute of Economic Affairs think tank, inspired Keith Joseph and he in turn got Thatcher's ear.",
      "Trump's admiration of Thatcher",
      "That the current assault on the free market is coming, in part, from a Republican US president seems all the more ironic given how popular Thatcher's reforms were with the American right.",
      "Thatcher and President Ronald Reagan shared a similar world view, and Trump has spoken of his admiration for the two, albeit with the caveat that he didn't agree with some of Reagan's trade policies.",
      "Thatcher was convinced that the country would be much better off if gas and water and electricity were taken out of the hands of the state. And sold on the open market. The free market. Just like buying a loaf of bread.",
      "The Thatcher government's big idea was that they weren't just going to sell the shares in state-owned utilities to big businesses or investors. They were going to offer them to the British people.",
      "In December 1984 shares in British Telecom (BT) went on sale. The next morning, the numbers were staggering: more than two million Britons were now BT shareholders.",
      "And Thatcher began to realise that selling off these companies wasn't just about breaking the shackles of government control. It could be something bigger - turning every person in Britain into a capitalist and in doing so making capitalism popular.",
      "In Britain, by the end of the 1980s, the scale of transformation was staggering. The sum of \u00a360bn was raised by selling off state run companies. Up to 15 million Britons were now shareholders.",
      "Britain was embracing the free market. This wasn't just an economic shift. It was a cultural revolution. A redefinition of Britain's relationship with money, with government, and with itself.",
      "And if Thatcher's privatisation had given ordinary people the chance to buy shares, her reforms to Britain's financial services sector in 1986, known as the Big Bang, gave ordinary people the chance to sell them too, to get a job in the previously closed world of the City.",
      "There were many on the left for whom the principle alone of these reforms was something to object to. The assault on the free market from some on the right is not about the principles of the reforms, but the consequences.",
      "Offshore business and collapsing communities",
      "At the core of Thatcher's thinking was a belief that free market capitalism could work only if many people had a direct stake in it. And with share ownership of previously state run utilities, many people did. But before long, alarm bells were starting to be rung. And their chime has only gotten louder.",
      "James Goldsmith was a businessman who had made a fortune by buying struggling companies cheaply, reshaping them to maximise efficiency and then selling them at a profit. The 1980s reforms were like manna from heaven for him.",
      "But then he seemed to change his mind about things. In 1994 he told a committee of US senators that its premise contained a fatal flaw - that the system demanded maximum profit but to achieve maximum profit that meant severing the umbilical link with many of your own electorate.",
      "\"You get to a system whereby, to get the best corporate profits, you have to leave your own country. You have to say to your own sales force 'Goodbye, we can't use you anymore - you're too expensive'.",
      "\"You've got unions. You want holidays. You want protection. So we're going offshore.\"",
      "Goldsmith was predicting that companies would take their business wherever they would make the most money. If you are a CEO answerable to shareholders that's literally your job description. And the result, he said, would be job losses in the West, with communities collapsing.",
      "And to make things worse, he argued that Britain had ceded sovereignty to the likes of the European Union and the World Trade Organization, with Britain binding itself to an economic system run by unelected bureaucrats in Brussels, only adding to the sense of alienation felt in collapsing communities. And with global markets dictating policy. If an industry wasn't profitable, it was left to die.",
      "Today, the UK may be a global leader in science and financial services but is that of much consolation to communities where we once made things that are now made offshore?",
      "Based on what I often heard in my many years touring the country presenting Question Time, I'm not sure it is.",
      "Goldsmith would end up trying to go into politics. His Referendum Party was trounced in the 1997 general election but he had planted a seed. He had argued that the global free market path that Britain and the rest of the world was going down was dangerous. That it would spread division around the world.",
      "Fast-forward nearly 20 years to 2016 and his warning came to pass. Britain voted to leave the European Union and the verdict could not be clearer: the Leave vote was highest in those left-behind communities, seemingly fuelled by those who felt globalisation was not working for them.",
      "The dream of a nation of shareholders has soured too.",
      "In 1989 Thames Water was privatised. We were promised lower bills, better infrastructure, less red tape and investment in a system fraying at the edges. It was investment that the global capitalist system was supposedly best placed to provide.",
      "What followed was something else entirely. Debt ballooned and dividends flowed to shareholders. The company extracted profit while pipes leaked and sewage poured into rivers. And our bills now pay for interest on that debt - it feels like we've come a long way from Thatcher's nation of shareholders.",
      "Trump's tariffs 'defy easy explanation'",
      "Back in 1994, James Goldsmith had posited that the problem with the free market dream was that it didn't protect the home base.",
      "Now, there is someone else much more powerful who takes that view.",
      "President Trump's methods are so erratic that with him it's hard to tell what is going on. His readiness to slap hugely consequential tariffs on countries that are both traditional foes and supposed friends at times defies easy explanation.",
      "But what we can say is that he is trying to return to ideas that preceded the free market. He is trying to make America strong through protectionism, making it harder for anyone to simply sell anywhere.",
      "There is an argument that if you take the long view then perhaps the free market period is the outlier. Britain itself had a long, long period of protectionism before it embraced free trade.",
      "Tariffs are nothing new in world economic history and in a sense Trump is just trying to return the US to how things were, albeit in quite a chaotic way.",
      "The reign of the free market is facing its biggest ever challenge. But that challenge is coming not from supporters of socialism who ideologically back a big role for the state. Instead, the challenge is coming from Trump, a man who is broadly speaking of the right and has no qualms with capitalism allowing people to become very rich.",
      "That the challenge is coming from within is what makes it so potent.",

      "The story of this Spring Statement is that welfare has been cut back to make up for a notable rise in the cost of servicing the national debt. There is also a trim to the money being given to government departments.",
      "There is relatively little else actually happening in policy terms. There were no tax rises, no changes to Chancellor Rachel Reeves' borrowing rules and as expected, this was definitely not a Budget.",
      "The real question now is whether the chancellor can escape from a never-ending cycle of microhaggling with the government's independent forecaster the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) in this way, twice a year for the rest of the Parliament.",
      "When asked about whether new tax rises could now come in the Autumn like last year, she said emphatically: \"We'll never have to do a Budget like that again.\"",
      "But the numbers are precarious and extremely sensitive to the economic and political changes around the world.",
      "If the US imposes 20% tariffs on the UK next week, it could lead to a downgrade in UK growth and \"wipe out\" the \u00a39.9bn headroom the chancellor has to meet her borrowing rule, the OBR chairman, Richard Hughes, told me.",

      "The basic level of universal credit is worth \u00a3393.45 a month to a single person who is 25 or over.",
      "But if you have limited capacity to work because of a disability or long term condition, this payment more than doubles, because of an extra top up worth \u00a3416.19.",

      "The work capability assessment, which checks eligibility for the health related top-up to universal credit, will be scrapped by 2028.",
      "Instead, claimants will have to go through the Pip system to claim for a health benefit. The government says they will be assessed on how their disability affects their daily life, rather than on their capacity to work.",
      "While you can receive universal credit or Pip while in employment, universal credit is means-tested and tapers off as earnings increase, while Pip is not affected by how much someone works or their level of savings.",
      "A new \"right to try\" system will mean people will not be financially penalised if they take a job which doesn't work out.",
      "The government will also consult on merging employment and support allowance and jobseeker's allowance into a single time-limited benefit that is not means-tested. This would be more generous but available for a shorter period.",
      "\"If you have paid into the system, you'll get stronger income protection while we help you get back on track,\" Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall said.",
      "Why does the government want to cut welfare spending?",
      "Overall, the government currently spends \u00a365bn a year on health and disability-related benefits. Before the government announced the Pip and UC changes, this was projected to increase to \u00a3100bn by 2029.",
      "Pip is the second-largest element of the working-age welfare bill, with spending due to almost double to \u00a334bn by 2029-30.",
      "When Pip was introduced in 2013, the aim was to save \u00a31.4bn a year by reducing the number of people eligible for payments. However, initial savings were modest and the number of claimants has risen.",
      "About 1.3m people now claim disability benefits primarily for mental health or behavioural conditions.",
      "That is 44% of all working age claimants, according to the independent economic think-tank, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS).",

      "If you claim Personal Independence Payments and do not qualify when the criteria are tightened, then you are likely to be hardest hit. Some 370,000 people are expected to lose their entitlement altogether, and others will receive less than they expected. The average loss is \u00a34,500 a year",
      "Even if you are not affected by the Pip changes, you may still lose out. Overall, by 2029-30, some 3.2 million families - some current recipients and some future recipients - will see cuts, with an average loss of \u00a31,720 per year once inflation is taken into account",

      "Inflation - is expected to average 3.2% this year, according to the government's official forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility, before falling to 2.1% in 2026 and then 2% from 2027. The government's target is 2%.",
      "As a result,  interest rates, which are used to try and control the rate of rising prices, are expected to remain higher than previously thought.",
      "Overall, however, living standards are expected to improve.",
      "This is measured by real household disposable income which is expected to rise by just over 2% between now and 2030. That means on average you are expected to be \u00a3500 a year better off by 2030. However, this is relatively small by historical standards.",
      "Remember, these are only forecasts. They may be wrong and are subject to change.",
      "There's likely to be more speculation about the future of tax-free allowances in Individual Savings Accounts (Isas). The government says it is \"looking at options for reforms\" to encourage investing money.",
      "3. Jobs and services cut or created",
      "Forecasts about the general state of the economy will also influence the decisions the chancellor chooses to make and this could directly affect you.",
      "For example, official forecasts about economic growth this year have been halved from 2% to 1%, but are higher in subsequent years owing, in part, to the government's housebuilding programme.",

      "\"The world has changed\" is the mantra we are hearing from the government.",
      "It is a phrase designed to explain and justify the chancellor's argument on Wednesday in what is known as her Spring Statement.",
      "The Conservatives are branding it an \"emergency Budget\", which ministers insist is nonsense, but it is certainly true it is a bigger event than it was expected to be just a few months ago.",
      "We won't see Rachel Reeves standing on the steps of 11 Downing Street waving a red box around and it will be shadow chancellor Mel Stride responding to her in the House of Commons, rather than the leader of the opposition as happens on Budget Day.",
      "But other elements of the day will have a Budget day feel, not least in the overall vibe of whether Parliament and the country feel confidence in the government's economic prospectus.",
      "The backdrop is pretty bleak.",
      "When Labour won last year's general election, they said the first of their \"missions\" was to \"kickstart economic growth\".",
      "The thing is, there isn't any - the economy is flatlining.",
      "Plus, inflation is up and government borrowing costs are up.",
      "Then there are the big-picture challenges: the UK has an ageing population, the benefits bill is going skywards, the dangerous international picture is demanding more money for defence and the country is saddled with huge debt, which attracts huge debt interest payments.",
      "Add to that the wild unpredictability of US President Donald Trump, the looming prospect of tariffs and the vast uncertainty over Ukraine's future and European security.",
      "Follow Spring Statement 2025 live",
      "Follow Spring Statement 2025 live",
      "All of which prompts the question: if the world really has changed, how much appetite now or in the future might Labour have for a really far-reaching re-examination of how it approaches government?",
      "With big and potentially unpalatable trade-offs looming, what alternatives could there be?",
      "There are loads of ideas it could explore, from the left, the right and everywhere in between. But let's take a look at a few, all floated publicly by some on their own side.",
      "What is the chancellor's Spring Statement and what will be in it?",
      "Loosen the fiscal rules?",
      "At the heart of the political conversation this week are the government's self- imposed \"fiscal rules\".",
      "The government has chosen them in the hope they illustrate financial responsibility,  a trustworthiness on the international stage that the UK can pay its way and service its debts.",
      "The two rules are that day-to-day costs are met by tax revenues and that debt is falling as a share of the economy five years ahead.",
      "They are, ultimately, arbitrary: managing the national finances is complex and multilayered and while governments will often impose limits on themselves in the hope of portraying credibility, precisely what they are can vary significantly.",
      "Former Labour cabinet minister Lord David Blunkett told the BBC at the weekend he \"would like the Chancellor to loosen a little the self-imposed fiscal rules\", adding that they amounted to \"Treasury orthodoxy\u2026at its worst\".",
      "\"I would lift them marginally. I would raise the self-imposed rule by at least \u00a310-15 billion and I would spend a great chunk of it on what we did back in '97 with the new deal for the unemployed,\" the former work and pensions secretary told BBC Radio 4.",
      "Lord Blunkett isn't the only one \u2013 Jagjit Chadha, Professor of Economics at Cambridge University, has written in The Guardian this week of his scepticism about the value of the fiscal rules.",
      "There is another parallel that could be drawn too.",
      "Last week the German parliament voted to allow a massive increase in defence spending.",
      "The new law will exempt spending on defence and security from Germany's strict debt rules.",
      "Could, should, the UK do the same?",
      "Both the German parallel and Lord Blunkett's suggestion get short shrift from senior government figures.",
      "\"When people say change the fiscal rules, that means borrowing more money,\" is how one source put it to me.",
      "\"We have got to be honest about the implications of higher borrowing. If we did what Germany is doing, it could add \u00a34bn to borrowing costs, not far off the prisons budget,\" they added.",
      "It is also pointed out that Germany's national debt is vastly smaller than the UK's as a share of national income.",
      "And there is no appetite to do anything that might provoke the international markets to go wobbly about the UK again, as happened when Liz Truss was prime minister.",
      "What about a wealth tax?",
      "Some on the left of the Labour Party have been calling for this, as have the Green Party and others.",
      "The idea would attempt to do what it said on the tin, but observers such as Paul Johnson of the Institute for Fiscal Studies are cautious about its likely effectiveness as a revenue raiser.",
      "Before the last Budget in the autumn a cross-party group of MPs suggested it, while Labour MP Richard Burgon raised it as an idea at Prime Minister's Questions earlier this month.",
      "Reeves has long distanced herself from the idea, arguing in 2023: \"I don't see the way to prosperity as being through taxation.\"",
      "Reeves and Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer are fearful of being portrayed as high taxers and high spenders, an image plenty within Labour think has previously cost them dearly at elections.",
      "But could a one-off such tax ever be tempting as ministers confront awkward spending squeezes in places and that ever growing demand for defence spending?",
      "Other taxes rises in spotlight",
      "What about cranking up income tax, national insurance or VAT?",
      "After all, these are the big levers of revenue raising for any chancellor.",
      "But there is a catch: Labour promised not to in its election manifesto.",
      "They did, nonetheless, put up national insurance, albeit on employers not employees \u2013 a rise that is due to kick in next month and is causing considerable anxiety for many businesses.",
      "So why not ratchet up one of the others?",
      "Some say, for a start, it could further depress an already stagnant economy, as well as further depress the outlook of many on politicians' capacities to keep promises.",
      "On the other hand, increases to these taxes tend to lead to a reliable big uptick in tax revenue and because they reach significant swathes of the population, they don't energise smaller, often well organised sectors who can then vociferously oppose a more targeted and less revenue rich idea.",
      "A good example of this are the dozens of tractors on Whitehall as farmers in their thousands made their views known about changes to inheritance tax.",
      "Thinking about all this was hinted at, alongside changes to the fiscal rules, by the now former international development minister, Anneliese Dodds, in her resignation last month over the cut in the international aid budget to bolster defence spending.",
      "In her resignation letter to the prime minister, she wrote that she had hoped the government would \"collectively discuss our fiscal rules and approach to taxation, just as other nations are doing\".",
      "She added: \"It will be impossible to raise the substantial resources needed just through tactical cuts to public spending. These are unprecedented times, where strategic decisions for the sake of our country's security cannot be ducked.\"",
      "Smashing manifesto promises is not something governments do lightly and Labour would tread particularly carefully around these flagship pledges on the economy, so often for many a perceived weak spot in the party's credibility.",
      "The tax burden, on average, is also generationally high \u2013 another reason these ideas could be a mighty hard sell even if ministers were willing to break their promises.",
      "And if ideas from their own side, like these three, aren't palatable, all of which make an already big State even bigger, there are those suggested by the Conservatives and others.",
      "Reducing benefit spending",
      "Cutting benefits much more is one such idea.",
      "The former Conservative and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell, writing in the Telegraph, suggested closing eight government departments, saving \u00a324bn by cutting the public sector workforce and instituting a two year public sector pay freeze.",
      "He reckoned these ideas alongside others could cut government spending from 45% of national income to 40%.",
      "Many of these might not be instantly palatable to a Labour government, just like those from their own side, but all of this brings us back to where we began: has the world changed? By how much? For how long?",
      "And just how bold might the government have to think \u2013 and soon \u2013 if it really has?",

      "\"Definitely not a Budget\" is the basic message emerging from the Treasury about the chancellor's upcoming economic statement.",
      "There will not just be no red box outside Number 11, there will only be a \"thin book\" of new policies with a \"light scorecard\" of measures with no further tax rises.",
      "So what is the point of this Spring Statement?",
      "It is principally a spring forecast from the government's official forecasters, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR). In that process it has had to take into account a slower economy than expected, and higher government borrowing costs.",
      "This OBR forecast has wiped out the room for manoeuvre against the \"non-negotiable\" rules Chancellor Rachel Reeves has set on government borrowing in the future. She has made a number of further adjustments to keep the numbers on track.",
      "Essentially low growth and higher borrowing costs have blown the budgetary numbers off course.",
      "We will hear a lot from the chancellor about how \"the world has changed\".",
      "The reality is this course correction is likely to have been required even before US President Donald Trump transformed global diplomacy and trade.",

      "'As a student, \u00a3800 a month is quite tight'",
      "What are Rachel Reeves's borrowing rules?",
      "While no significant tax measures are expected, the chancellor may nonetheless leave the option on the table for the autumn Budget.",
      "Some economists do expect tax rises in the autumn, in particular to meet rising defence spending. There is talk of a \"conversation with the public\" on this matter.",
      "At her first Budget the chancellor rejected, for example, extending the Conservative freeze to income tax thresholds by another two years. The public could get a clear idea around this Spring Statement if that is back as an option.",
      "The \u00a35bn cut to welfare spending already announced is the biggest single welfare cut for a decade. That is likely to be the biggest saving. The chancellor is now set to expand the cuts after being told reforms to the system would save less than planned.",
      "Later on Wednesday, the number of people losing Personal Independence Payments (PIP) and Universal Credit, how much on average, and the split between current or future recipients should be revealed. Hundreds of thousands will lose thousands of pounds worth of health-related benefits.",
      "There is a \u00a32.2bn cut to civil service admin costs, including staffing by 2029-30. A 15% cut is a significant chunk of what is spent by central government on wages and consultants.",
      "However, the chancellor suggested a loss of 10,000 roles, which is only a pruning of a workforce of over half a million - especially as it sees 30-40,000 leavers every year.",
      "The unions say this cannot be done without harming front line services. There is a lot riding here on deployment of automation and Artificial Intelligence (AI).",
      "A further fractional trim to the rise in departmental budgets, a crackdown on tax avoidance, and the switch from aid to defence spending should all help restore the chancellor's room for manoeuvre by another few billion pounds.",
      "It will be difficult to characterise this as \"austerity\" given the early injection of significant upfront sums into public spending at the Budget.",
      "Divvying up the increase in defence spending will be a key feature of the Spring Statement.",
      "Defence spending (for example, on jets and tanks) is more capital intensive than aid spending, so more of it is exempted from the chancellor's self-imposed borrowing rules to limit day-to-day spending only to what is raised in taxes.",
      "Growth downgrade",
      "Understandably there will be a lot of focus on a chunky downgrade to the OBR forecast for the economy in 2025.",
      "The real question for the chancellor has been the extent to which that has carried through to the end of the forecast period, and so permanently dented the economy and tax revenues. It may have not, and therefore not impact the Budget numbers quite so much.",
      "The Treasury has also been trying to get the OBR to give it credit for growth-enhancing reforms such as planning changes.",
      "In theory, higher growth means lower forecast borrowing and more room for manoeuvre - a win-win. But the OBR may have become stricter on this after a recent external review of its methods.",
      "There is a bigger picture here about growth and the government's strategy. Investors and business are still awaiting the infrastructure, industrial and trade strategies of this government eight months since it took power.",
      "The new global reality means further uncertainty, but also creates a potential significant upside for a stable, rules-based advanced economy with cutting-edge frontier science, research and financial services.",
      "This is particularly the case for a nation that can simultaneously keep its trade and investment connections with the US, Europe, China and the Gulf, even amid the tariff tumult. In Cabinet they call it \"the most connected economy in the world\".",
      "Is the world hearing this? UK Government borrowing costs have risen again as markets await the new calendar of bond sales on Wednesday.",
      "UK bond yields went up with the US in January, but when that stopped they also rose in line with Europe after massive debt-fuelled rearmament plans. It's the worst of both worlds for the borrowing forecast.",
      "The Spring Statement might be an opportunity to project the opposite case - that the UK is uniquely placed to be the best of both worlds. Some sort of economic deal with the US is imminent, and talks over the Brexit reset are also progressing.",
      "There are some small signs of the economy breaking out of its recent rut, especially in the service sector. Small businesses in retail and hospitality fearing the rises to National Insurance and the National Living Wage are holding out for some sort of alleviation of the pain.",
      "So Wednesday, while definitely not a Budget, will answer some important questions about the economy."

Hollywood star Sigourney Weaver was onstage in her West End debut production of Shakespeare's The Tempest.  But Hayley, a Just Stop Oil activist, had her own drama planned.",
      "As Weaver's Prospero declaimed \"Come forth, I say,\" Hayley sprang from her seat and rushed the stage with Richard Weir, a 60-year-old mechanical engineer from Tyneside.  They launched a confetti cannon and unfurled a banner that read \"Over 1.5 Degrees is a Global Shipwreck\" - a reference to the news that 2024 was the first year to pass the symbolic 1.5C threshold in global average temperature rise, and a nod to the shipwreck theme in the play.",
      "It was a classic Just Stop Oil (JSO) action. The target was high profile and would guarantee publicity. The message was simple and presented in the group's signature fluorescent orange.",
      "The reaction of those affected was also a classic response to JSO.  Amid the boos and whistles you can hear a shout of \"idiots\".",
      "\"Drag them off the stage\", one audience member can be heard shouting, \"I hope you [expletive] get arrested,\" another says.",
      "JSO is a UK-based environmental activist group that aims to end fossil fuel extraction and uses direct action to draw attention to its cause. It has been called a \"criminal cult\" and its activists branded \"eco-loons\" by the Sun. The Daily Mail has described it as \"deranged\" and says its members have \"unleashed misery on thousands of ordinary people though their selfish antics\".",
      "The group has thrown soup at a Van Gogh in the National Gallery, exploded a chalk dust bomb during the World Snooker Championship in Sheffield, smashed a cabinet containing a copy of the Magna Carta at the British Library, sprayed temporary paint on the stones of Stonehenge and even defaced Charles Darwin's grave.",
      "But it is the group's road protests that have probably caused the most disruption \u2013 and public anger. In November 2022, 45 JSO members climbed gantries around the M25 severely disrupting traffic for over four days. People missed flights, medical appointments and exams as thousands of drivers were delayed for hours. The cost to the Metropolitan Police was put at \u00a31.1 million.",
      "Just Stop Oil was born out of Extinction Rebellion (XR).  XR \u2013 founded in 2018 - brought thousands of people onto the streets in what were dubbed \"festivals of resistance\".  They came to a peak in April 2019, when protestors brought parts of the capital to a halt for more than a week and plonked a large pink boat in the middle of Oxford Circus.",
      "The spectacle and disruption XR caused generated massive media attention, but the police were furious.  Hundreds of officers were diverted from frontline duties and by the end of 2019 the bill for policing the protests had reached \u00a337m.",
      "And behind the scenes XR was riven by furious debates about tactics.  Many inside the movement said it should be less confrontational and disruptive but a hard core of activists argued it would be more effective to double down on direct action.",
      "It became clear that there was room for what Sarah Lunnon, one of the co-founders of Just Stop Oil, calls \"a more radical flank\".  They decided a new, more focused operation was needed, modelled on earlier civil disobedience movements like the Suffragettes, Gandhi's civil disobedience campaigns and the civil rights movement in the US.",
      "The group was formally launched on Valentine's Day, 2022. It was a very different animal to XR. Instead of thousands of people taking part in street carnivals, JSO's actions involved a few committed activists. A small strategy group oversaw the campaign and meticulously planned its activities. A mobilisation team worked to recruit new members, and another team focused on supporting activists after they were arrested.",
      "The dozens of actions the group has carried out generated lots of publicity, but also massive public opposition. There were confrontations between members of the public and protestors and an outcry from politicians across all the main political parties.",
      "The police said they needed more powers to deal with this new form of protest and they got them. New offences were created including interfering with national infrastructure, \"locking on\" \u2013 chaining or gluing yourself to something \u2013 and tunnelling underground. Causing a public nuisance also became a potential crime \u2013 providing the police with a powerful new tool to use against protestors who block roads.",
      "In the four years since it was formed dozens of the group's supporters have been jailed. Five activists were handed multi-year sentences for their role in the M25 actions in 2022. Those were reduced on appeal earlier this month but are still the longest jail terms for non-violent civil disobedience ever issued.",
      "Senior JSO members deny the crackdown had anything to do with the group's decision to \"hang up the hi-vis\" \u2013 as its statement this week announcing the end of campaign put it.",
      "JSO's public position is that it has won its battle. \"Just Stop Oil's initial demand to end new oil and gas is now government policy, making us one of the most successful civil resistance campaigns in recent history,\" the group claimed.",
      "The government has said it does not plan to issue any new licences for oil and gas production but strongly denies its policies have a link to JSO. Furthermore, the Prime Minister's official spokesperson told journalists: \"We have been very clear when it comes to oil and gas that it has a future for decades to come in our energy mix.\"",
      "And the group's wider goal \u2013 to end the production of oil and gas \u2013 has manifestly not been achieved. The members of the group I spoke to for this article all agree the climate crisis has deepened.",
      "In the face of stiffer sentences, some climate campaigners have said they will turn to more clandestine activities. One new group says it plans a campaign of sabotage against key infrastructure. In a manifesto published online it says it plans to \"kickstart a new phase of the climate activist movement, aiming to shut down key actors of the fossil fuel economy.\"",
      "That's not a direction the JSO members I spoke to said they wanted to go. Sarah Lunnon said a key principle of JSO and the civil disobedience movement generally was that activists would take responsibility for their actions. One of the first questions new joiners were asked is whether they would be willing to be locked up.",
      "\"As corporations and billionaires corrupt political systems across the world, we need a different approach.",
      "\"We are creating a new strategy, to face this reality and to carry our responsibilities at this time,\" the group says, suggesting they may be planning to form a new movement.",
      "JSO's most high-profile figure, Roger Hallam, is one of the five activists convicted for their role in the M25 protests. In a message from his prison cell he acknowledged that JSO has only had a \"marginal impact\".",
      "That is \"not due to lack of trying,\" he said. The failure lay with the UK's \"elites and our leaders\" who had walked away from their responsibility to tackle the climate crisis, Hallam claimed. A hint perhaps that the group's new focus might be on the political system itself.",
      "JSO has said its last protest \u2013 to be held at the end of April \u2013 will mark \"the end of soup on Van Goghs, cornstarch on Stonehenge and slow marching in the streets\". But don't believe it. When pressed, the JSO members I spoke to said they may well turn back to disruptive tactics but under a new name and with a new and as yet unspecified objective.",

    "published": "Thu, 27 Mar 2025 12:13:45 GMT",
    "summary": "Sewage spilled into England's waterways for a record number of hours last year, the Environmental Agency says.",
    "story": [
      "Water companies released raw sewage into England's rivers and seas for a record 3.61 million hours last year, a slight increase on 2023.",
      "The data released by Environment Agency on Thursday showed that although the number of spills was down each spill lasted longer on average - resulting in a higher total number of hours.",
      "Some spilling can be legal, but concern has been mounting amongst scientists about the harm that regular sewage spilling is causing the country's aquatic life.",
      "Water UK, the industry body, said sewage spills are a \"disgrace\" but has committed to a programme of investment worth \u00a3104bn over the next five years.",
      "How much sewage is spilled near you?",
      "Water company makes case for higher bill increases",
      "\"These figures are disgraceful and are a stark reminder of how years of underinvestment have led to water companies discharging unacceptable levels of sewage into our rivers, lakes, and seas,\" said Environment Secretary Steve Reed.",
      "His views were echoed by Water UK Chief Executive David Henderson: \"Any sewage flowing into waterways is a disgrace. Unfortunately, it's a system fault that we have in our network which mixes rainwater and wastewater. Nobody wants to see any spill of sewage in our waterways.\"",
      "England, like much of the world, has a combined sewage system meaning that rainwater and sewage share the same pipes. In some instances, when there is too much rain, treatment works can be overwhelmed, and sewage is spilled via overflow points into the country's rivers, lakes and seas to prevent a back up to the system.",
      "This practice is legal. But previous investigations by the BBC and Environment Agency have revealed that sewage has also been spilled by water companies under dry conditions in breach of their permits.",
      "Water companies collectively oversee more than 15,000 of these overflow sites and this was the first year where all sites were monitored, revealing for the first time the extent of spilling.",
      "Sewage was spilt for 3.614 million hours in 2024 compared to 3.606 million hours in 2023.",
      "CEO of River Action, James Wallace, said: \"A year on from last year's catastrophic pollution figures, the true scale of the UK's water crisis is only now coming to light. The figures have barely budged, testament to the deepening sewage scandal.\"",
      "In 2022, Prof Chris Whitty, chief medical office for the UK, outlined the serious health risks sewage spills can pose for those using the country's waterways. Chief amongst them is bacteria from human faeces which he said can \"increase the risk of significant infections including antibiotic resistant bacteria\".",
      "Sewage also poses significant environmental risks \u2013 it increases nutrients in the water leading to algal blooms which then eventually denies other wildlife \u2013 like fish - oxygen. These spills also have been shown to introduce microplastics, drugs and sanitary products into rivers and seas.",
      "The River Ver in St Albans is one such location - the banks are littered with condoms, tampon applicators and wet wipes likely from sewage releases from nearby Markyate sewage treatment works owned by Thames Water. This rare chalk stream \u2013 one of around 200 worldwide \u2013 which supports important wildlife like water voles, saw more than 3,300 hours of spills in 2024.",
      "Of the spills a Thames Water spokesperson said: \"The Markyate area experienced one of the wettest years on record in 2024 which has caused excessive amounts of groundwater which has infiltrated into the network. This has resulted in the system being overwhelmed which has led to discharges into the river.\"",
      "Liberal Democrats Leader Ed Davey said the scale of spilling showed that the sector regulator, Ofwat, was not up to the task.",
      "\"This has to be the final nail in the coffin for Ofwat, a regulator that has time and again proven it is completely inadequate to protect customers and our beautiful environment,\" he said.",
      "In October, the government launched an Independent Water Commission, chaired by former deputy Bank of England governor Sir Jon Cunliffe, to look into the sector - including the effectiveness of Ofwat.",
      "An Ofwat spokesperson said: \"Where companies miss their targets, they will be penalised and money will be returned to customers. In parallel, companies will be held to account for past failures through our ongoing enforcement work into the operation and maintenance of sewage works and networks.\"",
      "The Markyate site is one of a number across the country that is due an upgrade as part of a five-year \u00a3104bn investment programme by water companies \u2013 with \u00a324bn going specifically to improving infrastructure.",
      "These upgrades will be paid largely through bill rises \u2013 which are due to take effect from 1 April \u2013 and will see the average annual bill hit \u00a3603. This has angered consumer groups and environmental charities who argue that the burden of upgrades should be carried by shareholders not households.",
      "Prof Ewan McGaughey, Professor of Law at Kings College London, said: \"The water companies have paid over \u00a385bn out to shareholders since privatisation and that means they haven't been able to put the money into infrastructure.\"",
      "Ofwat and the industry have previously denied the figure\u2013 which comes from University of Greenwich research \u2013 is as high, but there is agreement that significant investment is required.",
      "Phillip Clisham, specialist adviser to the Institution of Civil Engineers on water and sanitation, has worked in the industry for more than three decades, and said the challenge of fixing the issue has been \"underestimated\".",
      "He said the two main solutions are building bigger storm tanks \u2013 which produce a huge amount of planet warming emissions in their construction \u2013 or to reduce excess rainwater by increasing green areas and the use of sustainable urban drainage systems.",
      "What are sustainable urban drainage systems?",
      "What are sustainable urban drainage systems?",
      "It is this second solution that is preferable for the environment, he said, but it requires coordination between government, planning officers and housing developers \u2013 and takes longer to implement.",
      "\"A lot of this work is not as easy as it might seem from the outside in reality.",

      "Operators of the 225-year-old Monmouthshire and Brecon Canal have warned of an \"urgent\" water shortage without the prospect of imminent rainfall.",
      "It comes amid debate over how the historic attraction should secure its water supply in future after limits were placed on taking water from the environmentally sensitive River Usk.",

      "\"Everything the canal supports is at threat - we risk losing the jewel in the crown of south Wales,\" said Tracey Leake-Jones, who runs the Bridge 46 to Five Locks canal group.",
      "Made up of volunteers, the group runs events along the canal and has fundraised to install planters, benches and signs.",
      "The prospect of it having to close due to water shortages was \"utterly devastating\", she said.",
      "\"There has to be a solution found, and my view is that the Welsh government and its leaders are the only people who can bring all the main players together.\"",
      "She pointed to new housing estates being built along the canal with the waterway used as a marketing tool, and said the local council hoped to be able to open up further stretches down to Cwmbran, describing the economic benefits as \"unimaginable\".",
      "\"Should we have problems with water supply then what's going to happen to those plans for restoration that we've all been working on for the past three years?\"",
      "News broke of the difficulties facing the canal in a letter sent to local businesses by Gland\u0175r Cymru, the Canal and River Trust in Wales, in February.",
      "It explained the canal, which once transported iron and coal to Newport docks, had relied on funnelling water from the River Usk and its tributaries which accounted for 80-90% of its water supply.",
      "Recent changes in legislation, designed in part to protect rivers in the face of climate change, means licences are now required, restricting the amount of water that can be taken.",
      "Last year, Gland\u0175r Cymru lost an appeal against some of the conditions stipulated by environmental regulator Natural Resources Wales (NRW).",
      "The River Usk is a designated special area of conservation protected by law due to its importance for rare wildlife including the Atlantic salmon, which is threatened with extinction from Wales.",
      "\"The canal took around 30% of the total flow of the river in 2022 - which was the last dry year period,\" said Gail Davies-Walsh, chief executive of Afonydd Cymru which represents river groups across Wales.",
      "Limits on abstraction were needed to ensure the species and habitats had sufficient water to survive \"particularly during dry summers and low flow periods,\" she said.",
      "Mark Evans, director of Gland\u0175r Cymru, said the trust accepted it could no longer continue to abstract water from the Usk at the same level as it had in the past.",
      "But recent dry weather highlighted the urgency of finding an alternative supply, he said.",
      "\"The amount of water we can take is starting to really concern us,\" he explained.",
      "\"It's urgent today, looking at the forecast for the next week.",
      "\"At some point we'll have to stop the boats from using the locks,\" he warned, adding that both the canal's users and its wildlife would be impacted as levels fell.",
      "Discussions have been taking place in recent weeks with Welsh Water over whether it could help to support the canal during periods of prolonged dry weather.",
      "But this would come with \"financial implications\" and the potential of having to pay commercial rates for the water, resulting in a considerable bill the charity could not afford, he claimed.",
      "Alasdair Kirkpatrick, owner of Beacon Park Boats, said he had already received phone calls from customers who had booked boat trips asking about the impact on them.",
      "\"I never saw this one coming,\" he said, \"it has really shocked us all.\"",
      "\"All my customers nip down to the local pubs and restaurants, 25% of them fly in from overseas from places like America and Australia, using local taxis and train services and spending a fortune locally,\" he added.",
      "He urged the Welsh government \"to fund Welsh Water to continue to maintain water levels and keep all the operators of this canal in business - it cannot be lost\".",
      "Gavin Bown from Natural Resources Wales said regulating water abstraction was \"a complex, evidence-based process that carefully balances environmental needs with those of local communities\".",
      "\"Our priority is to protect the integrity of the River Usk and the Severn Estuary, both designated as special areas of conservation,\" he explained, adding the regulator would continue to work collaboratively with the Canal and River Trust.",
      "A Welsh Water spokesman said the River Usk was \"one of the primary sources of drinking water to around 250,000 customers across south east Wales\".",
      "But it remained \"one of our least drought-resilient supply areas\", with limited water resources to deal with the impacts of climate change and population growth.",
      "\"We have proposed in the driest of years to supply some customers with water from the River Tawe through an emergency pumping station and use this spare capacity in abstraction from the River Usk to support the canal,\" he explained.",
      "However this would come at a cost, with discussions ongoing over whether this would be affordable to the trust.",
      "\"To provide this free of charge or risk the future supply of drinking water to our customers, isn't an option for us,\" he said.",

      "A rare new species of two-clawed dinosaur has been discovered by scientists in Mongolia's Gobi Desert.",
      "The species, named Duonychus tsogtbaatari, was unique within a group of dinosaurs called Therizinosaurs, which stood on their hind legs and usually had three claws.",
      "It was medium-sized, with an estimated weight of approximately 260kg.",
      "Researchers believe the species' long, curved claws and its ability to strongly flex them would have made it an efficient grasper of vegetation.",

      "Unesco, the UN's Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, calls the Mongolian Gobi Desert the largest dinosaur fossil reservoir in the world.",
      "The region is an especially important source of fossils from the later Cretaceous period, which is the last of the main three periods of the dinosaur age, representing the final phase of dinosaur evolution.",
      "At nearly a foot long, the claws themselves were much larger than their underlying bone, the study revealed.",
      "Besides better grasping, the two-fingered hands may have been used for display, digging, or as formidable weapons.",

      "Archaeologists have helped uncover one of the \"largest and most important\" Iron Age finds in the UK.",
      "The Melsonby Hoard was discovered in a field near Melsonby, North Yorkshire, by metal detectorist Peter Heads and excavated with the help of Durham University.",
      "It includes more than 800 items, including two cauldrons or vessels, horse harness, bridle bits, ceremonial spears and 28 iron tyres, believed to have been buried about 2,000 years ago.",
      "Historians believe the \"unprecedented\" find could lead to a \"major re-evaluation\" of the wealth and status of the elite living in northern Britain at the time.",
      "After the initial discovery was reported to the authorities in December 2021, the site was excavated in 2022, with the support of the British Museum and a \u00a3120,000 grant from Historic England.",
      "Early analysis of the hoard, released on Tuesday, suggests a lot of the items had been purposefully burnt or broken before being buried as a show of power and wealth.",
      "Tom Moore, head of the department of archaeology at Durham University, said the size and scale of the find was \"exceptional for Britain and probably even Europe\".",
      "He said the hoard showed there was more wealth in the north of England at the time than previously thought.",
      "\"Whoever originally owned the material in this hoard was probably a part of a network of elites across Britain, into Europe and even the Roman world,\" he said.",
      "\"The destruction of so many high-status objects, evident in this hoard, is also of a scale rarely seen in Iron Age Britain and demonstrates that the elites of northern Britain were just as powerful as their southern counterparts.\"",
      "It is thought the objects may have been burnt on a funerary pyre before being buried, though no human remains were found.",
      "Analysis: Danny Savage, BBC News",
      "In the archaeology labs at Durham University there's a real buzz about the unveiling of the Melsonby Hoard. Curators feel this is the discovery of a lifetime.",
      "Hundreds of recovered artefacts are spread out in a climate controlled room on long tables.",

      "This will keep experts busy for years.",
      "There's also a bit of secrecy too. The exact location of the discovery is not being revealed over concern that rogue treasure hunters will turn up at night and start looking for other artefacts.",
      "History is valuable - to different people in different ways.",
      "Among the items uncovered were the partial remains of more than seven four-wheeled wagons and/or two-wheeled chariots, including elaborate harnesses for at least 14 ponies, some which were adorned with red, Mediterranean coral and coloured glass, and 28 iron tyres from horse-drawn vehicles, some of which had been intentionally bent out of shape.",
      "They also found three ceremonial spears and two ornate cauldrons or vessels, one that was decorated in both Mediterranean and Iron Age styles and probably used as a wine mixing bowl.",
      "Some of the objects found were most closely related to others found in continental Europe, suggesting people shared technologies over this distance.",
      "The objects were identified using scanning technology at the University of Southampton, which helped the archaeologists figure out how to excavate the objects without causing damage.",
      "Duncan Wilson, chief executive of Historic England, said: \"This is one of the most important and exciting Iron Age period discoveries made in the UK.",

    "summary": "Just Stop Oil says it will disband but does this mark an end to the chaos caused by its climate protests?",
    "story": [
      "The climate action group Just Stop Oil has announced it is to disband at the end of April. Its activists have been derided as attention-seeking zealots and vandals and it is loathed by many for its disruptive direct action tactics. It says it has won because its demand that there should be no new oil and gas licences is now government policy.  So, did they really win and does this mark an end to the chaos caused by its climate protests?",
      "Hayley Walsh's heart was racing as she sat in the audience at the Theatre Royal Drury Lane on 27 January  this year. The 42 year-old lecturer and mother of three tried to calm her breathing. Hollywood star Sigourney Weaver was onstage in her West End debut production of Shakespeare's The Tempest.  But Hayley, a Just Stop Oil activist, had her own drama planned.",
      "As Weaver's Prospero declaimed \"Come forth, I say,\" Hayley sprang from her seat and rushed the stage with Richard Weir, a 60-year-old mechanical engineer from Tyneside.  They launched a confetti cannon and unfurled a banner that read \"Over 1.5 Degrees is a Global Shipwreck\" - a reference to the news that 2024 was the first year to pass the symbolic 1.5C threshold in global average temperature rise, and a nod to the shipwreck theme in the play.",
      "It was a classic Just Stop Oil (JSO) action. The target was high profile and would guarantee publicity. The message was simple and presented in the group's signature fluorescent orange.",
      "The reaction of those affected was also a classic response to JSO.  Amid the boos and whistles you can hear a shout of \"idiots\".",
      "\"Drag them off the stage\", one audience member can be heard shouting, \"I hope you [expletive] get arrested,\" another says.",
      "JSO is a UK-based environmental activist group that aims to end fossil fuel extraction and uses direct action to draw attention to its cause. It has been called a \"criminal cult\" and its activists branded \"eco-loons\" by the Sun. The Daily Mail has described it as \"deranged\" and says its members have \"unleashed misery on thousands of ordinary people though their selfish antics\".",
      "The group has thrown soup at a Van Gogh in the National Gallery, exploded a chalk dust bomb during the World Snooker Championship in Sheffield, smashed a cabinet containing a copy of the Magna Carta at the British Library, sprayed temporary paint on the stones of Stonehenge and even defaced Charles Darwin's grave.",
      "But it is the group's road protests that have probably caused the most disruption \u2013 and public anger. In November 2022, 45 JSO members climbed gantries around the M25 severely disrupting traffic for over four days. People missed flights, medical appointments and exams as thousands of drivers were delayed for hours. The cost to the Metropolitan Police was put at \u00a31.1 million.",
      "Just Stop Oil was born out of Extinction Rebellion (XR).  XR \u2013 founded in 2018 - brought thousands of people onto the streets in what were dubbed \"festivals of resistance\".  They came to a peak in April 2019, when protestors brought parts of the capital to a halt for more than a week and plonked a large pink boat in the middle of Oxford Circus.",
      "The spectacle and disruption XR caused generated massive media attention, but the police were furious.  Hundreds of officers were diverted from frontline duties and by the end of 2019 the bill for policing the protests had reached \u00a337m.",
      "And behind the scenes XR was riven by furious debates about tactics.  Many inside the movement said it should be less confrontational and disruptive but a hard core of activists argued it would be more effective to double down on direct action.",
      "It became clear that there was room for what Sarah Lunnon, one of the co-founders of Just Stop Oil, calls \"a more radical flank\".  They decided a new, more focused operation was needed, modelled on earlier civil disobedience movements like the Suffragettes, Gandhi's civil disobedience campaigns and the civil rights movement in the US.",
      "The group was formally launched on Valentine's Day, 2022. It was a very different animal to XR. Instead of thousands of people taking part in street carnivals, JSO's actions involved a few committed activists. A small strategy group oversaw the campaign and meticulously planned its activities. A mobilisation team worked to recruit new members, and another team focused on supporting activists after they were arrested.",
      "The dozens of actions the group has carried out generated lots of publicity, but also massive public opposition. There were confrontations between members of the public and protestors and an outcry from politicians across all the main political parties.",
      "The police said they needed more powers to deal with this new form of protest and they got them. New offences were created including interfering with national infrastructure, \"locking on\" \u2013 chaining or gluing yourself to something \u2013 and tunnelling underground. Causing a public nuisance also became a potential crime \u2013 providing the police with a powerful new tool to use against protestors who block roads.",
      "In the four years since it was formed dozens of the group's supporters have been jailed. Five activists were handed multi-year sentences for their role in the M25 actions in 2022. Those were reduced on appeal earlier this month but are still the longest jail terms for non-violent civil disobedience ever issued.",
      "Senior JSO members deny the crackdown had anything to do with the group's decision to \"hang up the hi-vis\" \u2013 as its statement this week announcing the end of campaign put it.",
      "JSO's public position is that it has won its battle. \"Just Stop Oil's initial demand to end new oil and gas is now government policy, making us one of the most successful civil resistance campaigns in recent history,\" the group claimed.",
      "The government has said it does not plan to issue any new licences for oil and gas production but strongly denies its policies have a link to JSO. Furthermore, the Prime Minister's official spokesperson told journalists: \"We have been very clear when it comes to oil and gas that it has a future for decades to come in our energy mix.\"",
      "And the group's wider goal \u2013 to end the production of oil and gas \u2013 has manifestly not been achieved. The members of the group I spoke to for this article all agree the climate crisis has deepened.",
      "In the face of stiffer sentences, some climate campaigners have said they will turn to more clandestine activities. One new group says it plans a campaign of sabotage against key infrastructure. In a manifesto published online it says it plans to \"kickstart a new phase of the climate activist movement, aiming to shut down key actors of the fossil fuel economy.\"",
      "That's not a direction the JSO members I spoke to said they wanted to go. Sarah Lunnon said a key principle of JSO and the civil disobedience movement generally was that activists would take responsibility for their actions. One of the first questions new joiners were asked is whether they would be willing to be locked up.",
      "\"As corporations and billionaires corrupt political systems across the world, we need a different approach.",
      "\"We are creating a new strategy, to face this reality and to carry our responsibilities at this time,\" the group says, suggesting they may be planning to form a new movement.",
      "JSO's most high-profile figure, Roger Hallam, is one of the five activists convicted for their role in the M25 protests. In a message from his prison cell he acknowledged that JSO has only had a \"marginal impact\".",
      "That is \"not due to lack of trying,\" he said. The failure lay with the UK's \"elites and our leaders\" who had walked away from their responsibility to tackle the climate crisis, Hallam claimed. A hint perhaps that the group's new focus might be on the political system itself.",
      "JSO has said its last protest \u2013 to be held at the end of April \u2013 will mark \"the end of soup on Van Goghs, cornstarch on Stonehenge and slow marching in the streets\". But don't believe it. When pressed, the JSO members I spoke to said they may well turn back to disruptive tactics but under a new name and with a new and as yet unspecified objective.",

    "summary": "The site is littered with awful photos, particularly of celebrities - but a volunteer project is trying to fix that.",
    "story": [
      "Wikipedia is one of the most visited websites in the world but, by the admission of some of its own volunteer editors, it suffers from a persistent problem - terrible pictures, particularly of celebrities.",
      "It is so full of notable people with very old or unflattering photographs that there are even Instagram accounts dedicated to the very worst ones.",
      "The problem arises because professional photographers who attend, for example, film premieres tend to work for big agencies: their work is copyrighted and you usually need to pay to reproduce it.",
      "Wikipedia - which is largely sustained by volunteers - does not have a budget for that.",
      "Some enthusiasts launched WikiPortraits, a project to recruit a group of volunteer photographers around the world and get them accreditation to attend film festivals, conferences and other events.",
      "\"Wikipedia has for the longest time had missing or poor quality photos of people,\" said Kevin Payravi, one of the project's founders.",
      "\"This issue has always been in the back of our minds as Wikipedia editors.\"",
      "He spoke to the BBC from Austin, Texas where he and fellow founder Jennifer Lee were covering the SXSW festival, complete with their own photo booth for set-up portraits.",
      "\"Some people are super bothered by the terrible photos on Wikipedia, and want to save the world from them as well,\" Ms Lee said.",
      "\"The bad photos are so funny - there are some amazing blobs of humans there.\"",
      "Rogues' gallery",
      "Wikipedia has strict rules for photography and copyright, so the pictures uploaded must be a contributor's own, freely licenced or in the public domain.",
      "As a result it contains many images added by enthusiasts rather than taken by photographers.",
      "In some cases that merely means a non-descript image - but sometimes they are much worse than that.",
      "A prime example: the comedian Emil Wakim, of Saturday Night Live fame.",
      "For a week last November, the photo above - apparently taken at a stand-up show in New York - was his Wikipedia picture.",
      "When it was removed, an editor noted \"having no picture is better than what's currently there\".",
      "The photo of the English footballer Kyle Bartley, taken in 2011, has also been highlighted by social media users as evidence of Wikipedia's picture problem.",
      "The project so far",
      "WikiPortraits started its work at the beginning of 2024.",
      "The photographers are not paid and most are based in the US, but there are volunteers across the world.",
      "Jennifer and Kevin say their photographers tend to be Wikipedia enthusiasts, photography hobbyists, and professionals keen to build their portfolios.",
      "So far, 55 of them have done work for WikiPortraits, or are committed to doing so.",
      "Bryan Berlin is one of the photographers. A high school photography teacher and stand-up comedian from New York, he first got involved with WikiPortraits while he was performing at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe.",
      "He has attended the New York Film Festival and Sundance, and took pictures of Kieran Culkin and Mikey Madison.",
      "He says he is motivated by improving the service Wikipedia offers.",
      "\"Having a better photo of someone gives better information for somebody who is accessing Wikipedia,\" he told the BBC.",
      "He might not be paid but Bryan feels there is something in it for him too, saying working on the red carpet has made him a better photographer.",
      "One of his favourite experiences with a celebrity was with Lord of the Rings star Elijah Wood.",
      "\"He was just such a kind person, and said it was so cool that we were doing this.\"",
      "The Edinburgh festival, Cannes and the Nobel prizes are some of the events covered so far, and the project says its photographs are viewed around 100 million times a month.",
      "Some of the biggest names in entertainment now have a WikiPortraits image as their Wikipedia picture.",
      "While those pictures attract attention, the project is also proud to have taken photos of people, such as under-represented filmmakers, who had no Wikipedia picture at all.",
      "Frank Sun is a filmmaker and cinematography who does photography as a hobby. His work on WikiPortraits includes pictures of Florence Pugh and Ben Stiller.",
      "Also based in New York, he has taken pictures at Cannes, Sundance, and the Toronto film festivals.",
      "He fondly remembers an experience with Laetitia Dosch, the French actress, writer and director.",
      "\"She said 'my photo is terrible, it is from years ago. I am so excited to update as any time people search for me, it is an old photo'.",
      "\"I think she was pleased.\"",
      "What does the future look like? WikiPortraits hopes to attract more photographers from around the world to cover events in their countries.",
      "While sports photography is being featured, there are no plans for video.",
      "The glitz and glamour of the red carpet will always be a draw.",

      "A nuclear reactor at the site in Cumbria caught fire on 10 October 1957 and burned for three days, releasing radioactive material into the atmosphere.",
      "Many details of the event were kept quiet for decades, and it is far less famous than some of the more recent examples.",
      "But a new video game has brought the disaster, and the area where it happened, back into the spotlight.",
      "Atomfall is the latest release from Oxford-based Rebellion, best known for its long-running Sniper Elite series.",
      "CEO Jason Kingsley tells BBC Newsbeat he was walking in the Lake District when the idea of using the real-life Windscale story \"as a trigger point for a fictionalised version of the disaster\" began to take shape.",
      "Atomfall is a survival action game set in the rolling green landscapes of the beauty spot, but on an alternative sci-fi inspired timeline where the area surrounding the plant has become a quarantine zone.",
      "\"It went pretty wrong in real life, but it was controlled,\" says Jason.",
      "\"It was a proper disaster, but it didn't cause strange glowing plants or mutants or dangerous cults to emerge.\"",

      "\"Seeing that such a small space like Cumbria can be taken by the games industry and built upon and people are receptive to that, it's exciting for the future and I look forward to seeing what's next for me,\" he says.",

      "\"And you know, how wonderful is it to sort of talk about the Lake District to people that live in Africa or Southeast Asia or Canada or wherever it might be.",
      "\"That's a kind of form of soft power that very few types of media have.\"",

      "The Shenzhen-based firm says revenue rose by 29% to come in at 777 billion yuan ($107bn; \u00a383bn), boosted by sales of its hybrid vehicles. This topped the $97.7bn reported by Elon Musk's Tesla.",
      "BYD has also just launched a lower-priced car to rival Tesla's Model 3, which has long been the top selling EV in China.",
      "It comes as Tesla faces a backlash around the world over Musk's ties to US President Donald Trump, while Chinese carmakers have been hit with tariffs in Western countries.",
      "BYD sold around the same number of EVs as Tesla last year \u2013 1.76 million compared to 1.79 million, respectively.",
      "But when sales of the Chinese company's hybrid cars are taken into account it is much bigger, selling a record 4.3 million vehicles globally in 2024.",
      "On Sunday, BYD announced a new model to take on Tesla.",
      "Its Qin L model has a starting price in China of 119,800 yuan, while a basic version of Tesla's Model 3 is priced at 235,500 yuan.",
      "It comes as Chinese consumers are cutting spending in the face of economic challenges, including a property crisis, slowing growth, and high local government debt.",
      "Last week, BYD's founder Wang Chuanfu announced new battery charging technology, which he said could charge an EV in five minutes.",
      "That compares with around 15 minutes to charge a Tesla using its supercharger system.",
      "In February, BYD announced that its so-called \"God's Eye\" advanced driver-assistance technology would be available free in all its models.",

    "story": [
      "Jay Springett, a tech strategist and podcast host, joined the social media app Butterflies AI out of curiosity, and ended up staying for more than six months.",
      "The idea of Butterflies is to allow human and AI personas to interact.",
      "Mr Springett's online persona developed over time, interacting with other artificial characters, and even went as far as to start its own Beanie Babies [a line of soft toys] collection.",
      "He said it was like AIs were writing their own soap operas inside a simulation.",
      "\"I didn't engage with Butterflies in the same way I do with other platforms,\" Mr Springett told BBC.",
      "\"It felt more like observing than participating. I wouldn't pay for it, but it was interesting enough to keep watching.\"",
      "A host of social media services, like Butterflies, are trying to expand at a time when there is dissatisfaction with the social media giants.",
      "According to data from Similarweb, a digital market intelligence company, X's daily active users in the UK have dropped by nearly 25% since January 2024.",
      "And it's not just X that has been suffering, mobile and desktop traffic to Facebook has declined over the last few years according to Similarweb.",
      "A report by the Pew Research Centre found that a third of teens use Facebook and X, compared with three quarters a decade ago.",
      "Bluesky is one of the social media firms gaining ground.",
      "Over the past year, Bluesky has gained tens of millions of new users, often at the expense of X.",
      "Apart from just timing, though, BlueSky's success can be largely attributed to its novel architecture, which pairs an X-like experience with a high degree of customization.",
      "Unlike centralized systems, where social media companies have complete control over content and identities, Bluesky users can choose how their feeds are moderated, and what kind of posts the algorithm recommends to them, thanks to the hundreds of options offered by both Bluesky and the community.",
      "Don't like the broader discourse on Bluesky? Jump on the \"popular with friends\" feed to see what the people you follow specifically are talking about.",
      "It will not be simple for Bluesky to scale up to the size of X and Facebook, says Andy Tattersall, an information specialist at the University of Sheffield.",
      "He ways it will have to strike a balance between \"generating revenue, keeping users safe, and moderating content, which is much easier said than done\".",
      "Celebrity-backed foundation, Free Our Feeds, hopes to do that.",
      "It's backed some notable names, including musician Brian Eno and actor Mark Ruffalo, and plans to raise $30m (\u00a323m) over the next three years to support an open social media ecosystem powered by the AT Protocol, the decentralized network powering Bluesky.",
      "\"Bluesky has created a strong foundation for shared social media infrastructure,\" says Robin Berjonone, one of Free Our Feeds' nine custodians, \"but so long as they are the primary operator of this infrastructure the risk remains that it will stop operating in the public interest\".",
      "A bigger worry for these emerging platforms, though, is the network barrier. This can be summed up with Metcalfe's Law, explains Evan Prodromou, co-author and current editor of ActivityPub, another open social media architecture, which is behind popular platforms like Meta's Threads.",
      "The law states that the value of a network goes up with the square of the number of users. That means that bigger social networks have way more resources than smaller ones. They can use those resources to get bigger and bigger and crowd out smaller social media services.",
      "Non-profits like Free Our Feeds and the Social Web Foundation, which Mr Prodromou heads, have a strategy that they hope will help them overcome that Metcalfe's Law.",
      "They hope to replace the current situation, where users of social media hop between their favourite services.",
      "Instead Social Web Foundation is developing a platform which can offer content from all of them.",
      "Threads for example supports a protocol called ActivityPub, which makes it easier to combine services with other social media firms that use that protocol - like Mastodon for instance.",
      "Using this kind of interoperability, Mr Prodromou hopes that services like Social Web Foundation will provide the same value as giant, monolithic platforms.",
      "It's not straightforward, as not all social media firms support the same protocol, for example, BlueSky uses the AT Protocol.",
      "But there are workarounds to that problem, and Free Our Feeds and Social Web Foundation are also working on ways to aggregate sites that use different tech.",
      "\"One thing we've learnt from the past decades is that the last thing the world needs is a one-size-fits all solution for eight billion people,\" says Robin Berjon, one of Free Our Feeds' custodians.",
      "At the other end of the spectrum are those that want to carve a niche out for themselves, rather than replace the incumbents.",
      "In the last couple of years, a cottage industry of unique, new social apps has cropped.",
      "One of those is Mozi, created by Twitter co-founder Ev Williams. Mozi doesn't want you to socialise online at all.",
      "Instead it informs you when you're going to be in the same place (city or event) as someone you know and encourages you to connect with people more often in person.",
      "\"Until Mozi, no combination of apps could tell me what city my friends are in at any given time, or even what my friends locally are up to,\" says Mozi co-founder, Molly DeWolf Swenson.",
      "Mike McCue, the CEO of Flipboard, is convinced such innovation will result in a new era of social networking, where numerous new, more interesting types of social networks will emerge and offer people more choices.",
      "He hopes that Flipboard's app, Surf will help people manage a messy social media ecosystem. It allows users to browse from a centralized feed that can draw posts and content from a variety of platforms, including Threads, Bluesky, and YouTube.",
      "\"In the end,\" says Mr McCue, \"it's unlikely one service will replace the Facebook or Twitter we once knew, but instead several services will start to take our time away from these old-style single feed experiences, our behaviours will shift with these new choices and new generations will expect more.\"",

      "US Vice-President JD Vance has accused Denmark of leaving Greenland vulnerable to alleged incursions by China and Russia, as he asked its people to \"cut a deal\" with the US.",
      "Speaking during a visit to the Arctic island, Vance minimised recent threats by US President Donald Trump to take over the island by force.",

      "Vance used the opportunity to take aim at Denmark, alleging it had to \"keep the people of Greenland safe from a lot of very aggressive incursions from Russia, from China, and other nations\", without providing further details.",
      "He specifically called out the countries for taking interest in routes and minerals in the region, as the island of 57,000 people is believed to hold massive untapped mineral and oil reserves.",
      "In his remarks, Vance sought to reassure the people of Greenland that the US would not use military force to take the island from Denmark. Instead, he urged Greenlanders to embrace \"self-determination\" and sever ties with Denmark, which has controlled the region since 1721.",

      "\"For many years we have stood side by side with the Americans in very difficult situations,\" she said. \"Therefore, it is not an accurate way for the vice-president to refer to Denmark.\"",

      "Historically, Canadian leaders prioritise an early call with their US counterpart soon after becoming prime minister.",

      "The Canadian prime minister's office said the two leaders agreed to begin comprehensive negotiations about a new economic and security relationship immediately following the election, which will be held on 28 April.",
      "The US president's tone on Friday stood in contrast to his past remarks about Canada - particularly his frequent jabs at Carney's predecessor, Justin Trudeau, whom he mockingly referred to as \"Governor Trudeau\".",
      "\"I've always loved Canada,\" Trump told reporters after the call. \"We had a very good conversation. The prime minister - they've got an election going on, so we're going to meet after the election.\"",
      "The US has already partially imposed a blanket 25% tariff on Canadian goods, along with a 25% duty on all aluminium and steel imports. Canada has so far retaliated with about C$60bn ($42bn; \u00a332bn) of tariffs on US goods.",
      "The new car tariffs will come into effect next month, the White House has said. Taxes on parts are set to start in May or later.",

      "Tragically, Hyacinth is just one of an ever-increasing number of people on the tiny Caribbean island of Antigua to disappear without trace in what some have dubbed an epidemic, others a crisis. At least nine have vanished in the last two years alone.",
      "That day back in May 2019 started out ordinarily enough. Hyacinth, described as sprightly and self-sufficient, had gone for a routine check-up at the public hospital, but failed to return. She has never been seen since.",
      "It was to trigger an excruciating series of fruitless, island-wide searches and desperate appeals for help.",
      "\"We became detectives. My sister and I teamed up to look for leads. I went back to the hospital asking questions,\" Patricia explains.",
      "She was able to verify that while her mother had completed scheduled blood tests, she had not shown up for an electrocardiogram. Further investigations revealed she had apparently handed her handbag briefly to another patient to keep an eye on, but never returned. The bag was found by security staff the next day.",
      "The family were also able to track down a motorist who said she had given Hyacinth a lift to a location a short distance from the hospital.",
      "\"The police got angry at us for investigating and told us to stop,\" Patricia recalls. \"Then they became annoyed at our constant questions, so eventually we had to back off and just pray.\"",
      "Anniversaries are particularly painful: 6 March would have been Hyacinth's 80th birthday, a milestone for which the family had long planned a big celebration. Instead, Patricia took the day off work to spend in quiet reflection.",
      "The number of people to vanish in Antigua appears to be disproportionately high compared with neighbouring islands, Patricia says, a notion supported by sources in several of the islands who spoke to the BBC.",
      "In St Kitts, for example, which has a population of 48,000, official police stats provided show that of the total 54 people reported missing in 2023 and 2024, all but two are accounted for. The remaining two are believed to be Haitian migrants who have since left the country.",

      "The disappearance of a nine-year-old girl on 12 March sent the nation reeling and sparked extensive searches. Chantel Crump's body was found two days later in a case that has caused widespread public outrage and protests - and sent rumours into overdrive. A woman has been charged with Chantel's murder.",

    "story": [
      "They say writers are their own worst critics - but for the man who could become the next President of Poland, nothing could be further from the truth.",
      "Karol Nawrocki has been widely ridiculed after it emerged that several years ago he donned a disguise to praise his own book on TV.",
      "Written by a mysterious author called Tadeusz Batyr, the book documented the life of a gangster from 1980s communist Poland.",
      "But it has now been revealed that Tadeusz Batyr was a pseudonym created by Nawrocki, a historian and former museum director who is backed by the right-wing Law and Justice party (PiS) in the upcoming presidential election.",
      "In 2018, Nawrocki appeared on TV as his alter-ego Tadeusz Batyr, disguised in a hat and with his face blurred, and lavished praise on himself.",
      "\"This historian [Karol Nawrocki] actually really inspired me\u2026\" says the blurred figure. \"He was the first person to examine organised crime in communist Poland.\"",
      "Even more embarrassingly for the presidential candidate, a social media post has emerged in which Nawrocki claimed to have met the author.",
      "\"I spent several years studying organised crime\u2026so Tadeusz Batyr contacted me for some guidance,\" reads the post, which is still visible. \"He thanked me for my help with an interesting book, which I recommend.\"",
      "The scandal has led to a storm of mockery on Polish social media, with users wondering whether it would be Tadeusz Batyr or Karol Nawrocki campaigning in the presidential election.",
      "If Nawrocki is concerned about the impact of his deception on the election, he didn't show it when asked to comment on his apparent split personality.",
      "\"Literary pseudonyms are nothing new in Polish academia,\" he said, before going on to praise himself again: \"There was only one historian in Poland who had the courage to study organised crime, and I was that historian. But Tadeusz Batyr had no academic research or sources to refer to.\"",
      "According to the Polish Newsweek magazine, Nawrocki's \"fascination\" with the underworld is well-known. Local media have reported that the historian is acquainted with several figures associated with organised crime and biker gangs in Poland. Nawrocki says any interactions are strictly professional.",
      "He is currently in running second in the presidential race, behind Warsaw mayor Rafal Trzaskowski, who is from Prime Minister Donald Tusk's liberal Civic Coalition party.",
      "In third place is far-right candidate Slawomir Mentzen, who has recently seen a surge in popularity. His Confederation party advocates ultra-low taxes, stopping what it calls \"Leftist ideology\", and an end to immigration.",
      "The results of this election could have reverberations far beyond Warsaw, too.",
      "Poland is a key partner in the West's support for Ukraine. Up to 95% of military aid sent to the country passes through Poland, and around 10,000 US troops are stationed here.",
      "Poland shares borders with both Ukraine and Russia, and is rapidly expanding its armed forces, vowing to spend almost 5% of its GDP on the military this year - the highest among Nato nations.",
      "Nawrocki has blamed \"the decisions of the European elites\" for starting the war in Ukraine. Senior figures in the PiS party, which campaigns for lower taxes and energy security, have accused the EU of plotting to interfere in the election.",
      "\"This election is hugely important,\" says political analyst Marcin Zaborowski. \"[Tusk ally] Trzaskowski is the only candidate that is pro-European, an Atlanticist and supportive of Ukraine. He represents continuation in foreign policy.\"",
      "And this election matters for Poles at home, too. Better abortion access, same-sex marriage and rule of law reform were all promised by Tusk when his coalition came to power in 2023.",
      "But President Andrzej Duda, aligned with PiS, has the power of veto over legislation. That's why, so far, Tusk has been unable to pass any significant reforms.",
      "\"The people who voted for [Tusk], especially first-time voters or women, may be very disappointed,\" says Mr Zaborowski. \"But if Civic Coalition gets a president that supports their programme, that will be a real boost to what this government can do.\"",
      "With less than two months before the first round of voting, Civic Coalition's Trzaskowski remains favourite.",

    "story": [
      "I had just sent my family a message saying how happy I was to be back in Turkey, where I used to live, and how it felt like coming home. Then, the phone in my hotel room rang.",
      "\"We have an urgent matter to discuss in person,\" the receptionist said. \"Could you come down?\"",
      "I arrived to find three plain-clothes policemen waiting for me. They asked me for my passport and led me away, trying to prevent my colleagues from filming.",
      "I had been in Istanbul for three days by then, covering the anti-government protests sparked by the arrest of the city's mayor, Ekrem Imamoglu.",
      "I was taken first to the police headquarters and held for seven hours. Two colleagues were allowed to be present and lawyers could come in to talk. The atmosphere was generally cordial. Some of the police officers told me they didn't agree with what they said was a state decision. One hugged me and said he hoped for my freedom.",
      "At 9.30pm, I was moved to the foreigners' custody unit of the Istanbul police. There, the atmosphere hardened from a succession of chain-smoking officers, with whom I had to negotiate in my broken Turkish. I was fingerprinted and denied access to lawyers or any contact with the outside world.",
      "In the early hours of Thursday, I was presented with papers to say I was being deported for being \"a threat to public order\". When I asked for an explanation, they said it was a government decision.",
      "One police officer suggested he film me saying that I was leaving Turkey of my own accord, which could help me to return in the future and which he could show his bosses. I politely refused, suspecting it would be given to the government-controlled media to push their version of events.",
      "By 2.30am, I was being moved to a final location \u2013 the foreigners' custody department at the airport. I was put in a room with a few rows of hard chairs and told I could sleep there. Between police officers entering to brush their teeth, planes taking off and the morning call to prayer, no sleep came.",
      "Seventeen hours after my initial detention, I was driven to a waiting plane to board a one-way flight to London. That night, after the case was made public, sparking significant media coverage around the world, the Turkish government press office released a statement saying I had lacked the correct accreditation. At no point had they mentioned this during my detention and it seemed clear that it was an afterthought on their part to attempt to justify my case.",
      "I was never mistreated at any point during the ordeal. And I knew throughout that BBC management and the British Consulate in Istanbul were working hard to secure my release.",
      "So many others who have fallen foul of the Turkish authorities do not have such a safety net. When I lived there as the BBC Istanbul correspondent between 2014 and 2019, Turkey was the world's biggest jailer of journalists. The watchdog Reporters Without Borders ranks Turkey 158th of 180 countries in the Press Freedom Index. Since these latest protests began, eleven journalists are among the two thousand or so people who have been detained.",
      "The latest unrest was sparked by the arrest of Ekrem Imamoglu, Recep Tayyip Erdogan's main political rival, whom opinion polls suggest could unseat the President in an election.",
      "But they have grown into something much wider: a clamour for democracy in a country sliding further into authoritarianism. The clampdown on the media is central to that trajectory, as the government has progressively crushed criticism or debate. I caught a glimpse of that first hand. It ended for me with sadness and sleeplessness. For others, it's been so much worse.",
      "Meanwhile, President Erdogan is digging in, dismissing the protests as \"street terrorism\". He's emboldened by the current international climate of having an ally in the White House and of Turkey's importance to everything from Ukraine to Syria.",
      "The question now is whether the country's biggest demonstrations in over a decade can sustain momentum or whether Turkey's long-time leader can simply brush this off. Those out on the street may be chanting \"enough\" \u2013 but they also know never to write off Recep Tayyip Erdogan.",

      "Hezbollah said it was not involved. Israel said the attack was a ceasefire \"violation\", while the office of Lebanon's president Joseph Aoun also said Israel's attack was a \"violation of the agreement\".",
      "The strike came after the Israeli military issued an evacuation warning for a building in the Hadath area in the Lebanese capital. Videos showed people leaving in panic. Schools were ordered to be evacuated.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement on social media that the earlier rocket attack to which it was responding \"constitutes a blatant violation of the understandings between Israel and Lebanon and poses a direct threat to the civilians of the State of Israel\".",
      "\"The State of Lebanon bears responsibility for upholding the agreement,\" the IDF added.",
      "The Lebanese Presidency posted on X that Aoun, who is in Paris for meetings, informed French President Emmanuel Macron as well as the Cypriot president and the Greek prime minister that \"the Israeli attacks on the southern suburb and the threats are a continuation of Israel's violation of the agreement sponsored by France and the US\".",
      "\"The international community must put an end to these attacks and force Israel to abide by the agreement, just as Lebanon is committed to it,\" the statement read.",
      "The latest developments put further pressure on the fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed militia and political group, but, for now, the deal is likely to survive.",
      "Friday's attack is further proof of the challenges the Lebanese authorities face in trying to exert control over areas in the south of the country, where militant groups have been active for decades. Hezbollah is the most powerful of them, but Palestinian factions including Hamas and Islamic Jihad also operate there.",
      "Despite the deal, Israel has carried out near daily air strikes on people and targets it says are linked to Hezbollah, saying it is acting to stop Hezbollah from rearming. Lebanon's government says those attacks, and the permanence of Israeli soldiers in five locations in southern Lebanon, constitute violations of the truce.",
      "The rocket fire aimed at Israel on Friday was the second attack from Lebanon in a week.",
      "On 22 March, Israel carried out multiple air strikes on Lebanon after several rockets were fired from Lebanon into Israel. The Israeli military said it had hit dozens of rocket launchers and a command centre belonging to Hezbollah in southern Lebanon.",
      "Lebanon's health ministry said seven people, including a child, were killed and 40 injured in the air strikes.",
      "Hezbollah said it had no involvement and remained committed to the ceasefire, and no other armed group claimed responsibility.",
      "November's ceasefire put an end to more than 13 months of conflict.",
      "Hezbollah launched its campaign the day after the Hamas attacks on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, saying it was acting in solidarity with Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.",
      "The longstanding conflict escalated and led to an intense Israeli air campaign across Lebanon, and a ground invasion of southern Lebanon.",
      "The offensive killed about 4,000 people in Lebanon - including many civilians - and led to the displacement of more than 1.2 million residents.",
      "Israel's stated goal in its war against Hezbollah was to allow the return of about 60,000 residents who had been displaced from communities in the country's north because of the group's attacks, and to remove it from areas along the border.",

      "Strong tremors were also felt elsewhere, including in Thailand and south-west China.",
      "Around 100 construction workers are unaccounted for and six dead after an unfinished high-rise building collapsed hundreds of miles away from the epicentre, in the Thai capital Bangkok, according to local government officials.",

      "Getting information out of Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, is difficult.",
      "Myanmar has been ruled by a military junta since a coup in 2021, making access to information problematic.",
      "The state controls almost all local radio, television, print and online media. Internet use is also restricted.",
      "Mobile lines in the affected areas have been patchy since the quake struck, but tens of thousands of people also live without electricity, making it tough for the BBC to communicate with individuals on the ground.",
      "Foreign journalists are also rarely allowed to enter officially due to a lack of press freedom.",
      "What causes earthquakes?",
      "The Earth's crust is made up of separate bits, called plates, that nestle alongside each other.",
      "These plates often try to move but are prevented by the friction of rubbing up against an adjoining one.",
      "But sometimes the pressure builds until one plate suddenly jerks across, causing the surface to move.",
      "They are measured on a scale called the Moment Magnitude Scale (Mw). This has replaced the better known Richter scale, now considered outdated and less accurate.",
      "The number attributed to an earthquake represents a combination of the distance the fault line has moved and the force that moved it.",
      "A tremor of 2.5 or less usually cannot be felt, but can be detected by instruments. Quakes of up to five are felt and cause minor damage. The Myanmar earthquake at 7.7 is classified as major and usually causes serious damage, as it has in this instance.",
      "Anything above 8.0 causes catastrophic damage and can totally destroy communities at its centre.",
      "Is it safe to travel to Myanmar, Thailand or Laos?",
      "The UK's Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) has warned about the possibility of several strong aftershocks in places affected by the earthquake.",
      "It has advised people in the area, or tourists planning to travel to Myanmar, Thailand or Laos, to monitor local media and follow the advice of local authorities and tour operators.",
      "The FCDO has also previously issued advice against all travel to parts of Myanmar and all but essential travel to parts of Thailand and Laos.",
      "Myanmar's security situation \"may deteriorate at short notice and the military regime can introduce travel restrictions at any time\" amid an \"increasingly volatile\" conflict, it said.",
      "The FCDO's warning for parts of Thailand is \"due to regular attacks in the provinces by the border with Malaysia\" and its advice for Laos relates to \"intermittent attacks on infrastructure and armed clashes with anti-government groups\" in Xaisomboun province.",
      "How does this compare with other large earthquakes?",
      "This earthquake and its aftershocks were relatively shallow - about 10km in depth.",
      "That means the impact on the surface is likely to have been more devastating than a deeper earthquake, with buildings shaken much harder and more likely to collapse.",
      "On 26 December 2004, one of the largest earthquakes ever recorded struck off the coast of Indonesia, triggering a tsunami that swept away entire communities around the Indian Ocean.",
      "The 9.1 magnitude quake killed about 228,000 people.",

      "Husain's Untitled (Gram Yatra), a sprawling 14-foot-wide mural, sold for an unprecedented $13.8m (\u00a310.6m) at a Christie's auction in New York last week. It shattered the previous Indian high of $7.4m (\u00a35.7m) fetched by Amrita Sher-Gil's The Story Teller in 2023.",
      "Husain, who died in 2011, aged 95, was a pioneer of Indian modernism and remains a lasting inspiration for Indian artists. In 2006, he left India after death threats from Hindu hardline groups over his depictions of deities.",
      "For nearly five decades, the record-breaking painting unassumingly adorned the walls of a Norwegian hospital, overlooked and undervalued. Now, it stands as a defining work of modern South Asian art.",
      "Husain painted Gram Yatra - or village journey - in 1954, long before he became an icon.",
      "Its 13 vignettes - vivid snapshots of Indian village life - reflect his distinctive blend of Indian folk traditions and modernist influences. The vignettes are reminiscent of narrative paintings in India's miniature tradition, where small pictures weave a story.",
      "In Gram Yatra, Husain used vibrant, earthy tones to bring 13 frames to life, with women in everyday scenes such as cooking, caring for children and riding a cart.",
      "In one of the frames, a farmer extends his arm as if holding the land in the adjoining frame - a nod to the farming roots of Indian society.",
      "\"If you're looking for a single artwork that defines modern South Asian art, this is it,\" said Nishad Avari, head of South Asian Modern and Contemporary Art at Christie's.",
      "The painting, he added, also showed how Husain was influenced by his foreign travels, notably his 1952 trip to China which introduced him to the calligraphic brushwork of artists like Xu Beihong, traces of which can be seen in the painting's expressive strokes.",
      "In the years following India's independence, he sought inspiration not in Paris or New York, but in India's villages, mirroring Mahatma Gandhi's belief that the heart of the nation lay in its rural roots.",
      "According to Husain's biographer Akhilesh (who uses only one name), the painter's deep engagement with India's cultural fabric helped shape how the country saw itself - \"how people live, what they like and what they think\".",
      "The painting also shows the early signs of Husain's modified cubist style - where geometric shapes and bold lines stood out in his works.",
      "The painting's journey from Delhi to Oslo adds to its mystique.",
      "It was purchased in 1954 for just $295 by Ukrainian doctor Leon Elias Volodarsky, who was in India on a World Health Organization (WHO) mission.",
      "After he took it to Norway, the piece adorned the walls of Oslo University Hospital for nearly half a century, largely unnoticed by the art world.",
      "It stayed that way for several decades until auction house Christie's was alerted about it in 2013 - two years after Husain's death - leading to its global exhibitions before this record-smashing sale.",
      "Ashish Anand of Delhi Art Gallery believes this will elevate the value of Husain's entire body of work and \"lead to Indian art being viewed beyond just its aesthetic value to a tangible and serious financial asset\".",

      "The pair agreed to end the war in 2018 - and one of the aims of their power-sharing deal was to join their rival forces and create a unified military.",
      "But recent clashes in Nasir reveal the distrust over the slow progress on this.",
      "The region is where a militia, known as the White Army, is based. Its recruits fought in support of Machar during the civil war.",
      "Communities there distrust regular army troops seen as loyal to Kiir and have been calling for the deployment of the unified force.",
      "But last month, more regular army soldiers were sent to the area - a move Machar said was a violation of the ceasefire and transitional deal - and tensions flared.",
      "Kiir's side said the decision was a routine troop rotation, but the situation deteriorated rapidly when the White Army seized the army base on 4 March.",
      "This is when Capt Muzyka and his team were called on to fly the trapped soldiers out.",
      "They had already done one trip - on 6 March - successfully extracting 10 people after landing at a point designated for the UN to use.",

      "Then his flight attendant Sergii Prykhodko - who was standing in front of the chief UN negotiator - was shot.",
      "Capt Muzyka knew they were under attack, and his military training kicked in. \"Shooting started from the front and right and then from the left back. I decided immediately to perform take-off,\" he said.",
      "As he lifted up, he said he saw soldiers falling to the ground outside the aircraft.",
      "\"I couldn't say exactly what time we spent [between the start of gunfire and taking off] - maybe a tiny part of a second.\"",
      "The frame of the helicopter continued to be hit as it became airborne, and the fuel tanks were punctured.",

      "\"Some systems were damaged - like the main gearbox,\" he said.",
      "The possibility of crashlanding was ever-present during the flight. So Capt Muzyka decided to fly as fast and as low as he could.",
      "\"The temperature of the oil was [at] critical - maximum - and I flew 100m [328ft] above ground level.\"",
      "That way, as per his calculations, he could perform an emergency landing within 20 seconds.",
      "He also asked his crew to be on the lookout for clearings - free from trees and bushes - just in case one was needed.",
      "In the meantime, the flight engineer stopped the bleeding on the captain's arm by using his shirt as a torniquet.",
      "In the video clip the torn shirt can be seen tied just above an elbow - blood was on his lower arm and trousers, with spatters by his seat.",
      "The footage also shows a trickle of clotting blood on his forehead, before panning to the shirtless crew member and co-pilot, who had also been in injured.",
      "He was experiencing pain in his right side, said Capt Muzyka. \"Fortunately, it was a small injury from plastic splinters from the right window.\"",
      "As they finally approached Malakal airport, they experienced more difficulty. The front wheel of the helicopter was blocked, having taken a hit during the attack.",
      "Nevertheless, Capt Muzyka managed to land successfully 49 minutes after taking off under fire, with more than 20 gunshot holes on the helicopter's body.",
      "\"It was a big relief,\" he said.",
      "It was at that point that he felt some pain from his injury. It was so surreal he thought \"maybe I'm sleeping\".",
      "During his time as a military pilot, he said he had only ever come under attack once - in Afghanistan in 1987: \"I saw a couple of bullets which came through my blades during a night flight - and that's all.\"",
      "His crew and passengers in South Sudan were given medical attention as soon as they got to Malakal.",
      "However, it was not possible to save 41-year-old Mr Prykhodko, who had died of his injuries.",
      "\"We couldn't believe it,\" said the captain.",
      "Later, the Ukrainian Helicopters crew were feted at a ceremony where they were awarded the UN medal of honour. The UN head of mission said the attack \"may constitute a war crime under international law\".",
      "It has been tough for the crew to accept the loss of their colleague - and the incident has all added to their worries about relatives back home who are under attack by Russian forces.",
      "Capt Muzyka has now gone back to Ukraine for treatment and to see his family.",
      "He hopes for the future that \"common sense will prevail in the world\", and while he knows retirement is on the cards, he still feels young \"because I can fly\".",

    "story": [
      "For two years, Jeannie Dillard has saved what she can on her fixed income to replace the vehicle that was stolen from her home and found totalled a few miles away.",
      "She looked around a used car dealership in Virginia on Thursday, peering at sticker prices with a newfound worry: blanket tariffs on foreign cars and car parts that experts warn could drive up prices in the US, which kick in next week.",
      "She'd like to buy a car now, she said, but \"I have to wait until my finances improve\".",
      "Ms Dillard is among the plethora of Americans bracing for expected economic turbulence under President Donald Trump's sweeping auto tariffs - an unprecedented US trade policy manoeuvre.",
      "\"It took me a long time to save up for the last car,\" she said. \"If prices get too high, I'm obviously not going to buy something that I can't afford.\"",
      "She added: \"We'll just have to wait and see.\"",
      "On Wednesday, Trump announced new import taxes of 25% on cars and car parts entering the US from overseas, which go into effect on 2 April.",
      "Charges on businesses importing vehicles are expected on 3 April, and taxes on parts are set to start in May or later.",
      "Trump and members of his administration have argued that the tariffs will lead to \"tremendous growth\" and increase jobs in the US.",
      "But experts and automakers have warned in dire terms that tariffs could raise prices for US consumers, amplifying the stress of an already sluggish economy.",
      "How will carmakers be affected by Trump's tariffs?Trump announces 25% tariffs on car imports to US",
      "How will carmakers be affected by Trump's tariffs?",
      "Trump announces 25% tariffs on car imports to US",
      "Mohamad Husseini, co-owner of a used car dealership in Maryland, said that he expects the additional tariff costs to get passed on to the consumer.",
      "\"The prices in the wholesale market have skyrocketed already,\" he told the BBC.",
      "\"It's going to get worse.\"",
      "A car that would sell for $13,000 (\u00a310,000) might rise to $14,500 (\u00a311,200) because of the tariffs, Mr Husseini said. He predicted that consumers will see prices increase in the next three to six weeks.",
      "The auto tariffs will likely force car dealers like Mr Husseini to raise prices.",
      "\"We all still have bills to pay, mouths to feed and employees to pay,\" he said.",
      "At another car dealership, Robin Sloan was hoping to get a deal before prices increased.",
      "She said she probably would have waited until the summer to go car shopping, but \"with the tariffs, I decided I should go out and look now\".",
      "She rejected the Trump administration's claim that tariffs will cause Americans to buy US cars instead of foreign ones.",
      "\"I don't think I would buy a car made in the United States just because of the tariffs, I think I would probably wait a few years until things settle down,\" Ms Sloan said.",
      "From buyers to dealers, the effects of the tariffs will be widespread, for better or for worse, experts say.",
      "In the US, there are 908 motor vehicles per 1,000 people. About 92% of households own a vehicle.",
      "Car ownership is typically higher in the US than in Europe, surveys suggest, partly because, in the absence of extensive public transport, many Americans have no other choice of how to get around.",
      "Cars are also more than just a means of transportation. As symbols of both freedom and success, cars have a unique place in the national identity, from the show Pimp My Ride to Janice Joplin singing \"Oh Lord, won't you buy me a Mercedes Benz\".",
      "John Heitmann, a University of Dayton professor and automobile historian, who in his free time likes to polish his 1982 Mercedes SL, said that tariffs will have an existential, as well as an economic, impact.",
      "\"New cars are really out of the reach of a good number of Americans to begin with,\" he told the BBC.",
      "\"Consumers will not benefit, prices will go up,\" particularly amongst more affordable vehicles made in Korea, like Hyundais, he said.",
      "As a vintage-car enthusiast, he said tariffs have added a layer of uncertainty to his hobby.",
      "\"About 50 minutes ago, I got an email from a part supplier in the UK saying, 'Don't worry... they're not going to go up, probably',\" he said.",
      "\"'We haven't seen anything in writing yet.' That's what they said.\"",
      "Higher-end imported vehicles, such as Audis, BMWs and Mercedes, will increase in price, too, Prof Heitmann said, though many of those who buy from such brands might be able to absorb a heftier price tag.",
      "A 2024 study by the US International Trade Commission predicted that a 25% tariff on imports would reduce imports by almost 75%, while increasing average prices in the US by about 5%.",
      "The US imported about eight million cars last year - accounting for about $240bn (\u00a3186bn) in trade and roughly half of overall sales.",
      "Despite efforts from some car makers - including Ford and General Motors - to discourage Trump enacting auto tariffs, the president is forging ahead.",
      "Some car makers are embracing Trump's tariffs, however.",
      "On Tuesday, Hyundai, the South Korean car-marker, announced it would invest $21bn (\u00a316.3bn) in the US by building a new steel plant in Louisiana.",
      "Trump said the move is a \"clear demonstration that tariffs very strongly work\".",
      "But the tariffs are likely to impact the domestic car industry as well.",
      "US auto manufacturing has been deeply intertwined with industries in Canada and Mexico for decades. Parts criss-cross the borders several times before they are assembled, which means that even a vehicle as iconically American as a Ford pickup truck could see a sticker price increase.",
      "Ultimately, Trump's tariff strategy will thrust the US auto industry into uncharted territory, leaving uncertainty hanging over consumers, dealers and automakers until they go into effect on Wednesday.",
      "\"Everything's topsy turvy now, you know, and it's also terribly filled with uncertainty, because no one exactly knows what kind of game is really being played by the Trump administration related to all the bluster of these tariffs,\" Prof Heitmann said.",
      "Some, like Mya Fountain-Bunch, just want to get through the unease. She took her car into a dealership this week to avoid needing a replacement after the tariffs hit.",
      "\"[I'm] making sure that my car is working and hopefully I won't have to buy another car in the next few years, or at least the next four years until this administration is done with.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Trump on Thursday signed an\u00a0executive order\u00a0targeting funding for programs at the\u00a0Smithsonian Institution\u00a0that contain what he characterizes as \"divisive, race-centered ideology\" in his latest broadside against a liberalism that has critiqued Western culture and values.",
      "The president said in the order that there has been a \"concerted and widespread\" effort over the past decade to rewrite American history by replacing \"objective facts\" with a \"distorted narrative driven by ideology rather than truth.\" He said this narrative has cast the \"founding principles\" of the U.S. in a \"negative light.\"",
      "\"The Smithsonian Institution has, in recent years, come under the influence of a divisive, race-centered ideology,\" Mr. Trump said in the order. \"This shift has promoted narratives that portray American and Western values as inherently harmful and oppressive.\" He pointed to a sculpture exhibit at the Smithsonian American Art Museum representing that \"[s]ocieties including the United States have used race to establish and maintain systems of power, privilege, and disenfranchisement.\"",
      "The order tasks Vice President JD Vance, who serves on the Smithsonian Institution's Board of Regents, with overseeing efforts to \"remove improper ideology\" from all areas of the institution, including its museums, education and research centers and the National Zoo.",
      "It marks Mr. Trump's latest salvo against cultural pillars of society, such as universities and art, that he sees as out of step with conservative sensibilities. He recently had himself installed as chairman of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts with the aim of overhauling programming, including the annual Kennedy Center Honors awards show. The administration also recently forced Columbia University to make a series of policy changes by threatening the Ivy League school with the loss of several hundred million dollars in federal funding.",
      "The executive order also hints at the return of statues and monuments of Confederate figures, many of which were taken down or replaced around the country after the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis in 2020 and the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement, which is detested by Trump and other conservatives.",
      "The president directed the secretary of the interior to determine whether, since Jan. 1, 2020, \"public monuments, memorials, statues, markers, or similar properties within the Department of the Interior's jurisdiction have been removed or changed to perpetuate a false reconstruction of American history, inappropriately minimize the value of certain historical events or figures, or include any other improper partisan ideology.\"",

      "The Sex Pistols, the legendary English punk band that helped the underground subculture of the genre to reach mainstream heights, is going on its first North American tour in more than 20 years.",
      "The Pistols last went on a North American tour in 2003, when they were joined by original vocalist\u00a0John Lyndon (formerly Rotten).",
      "The 2025 iteration of the Pistols \u2014 original guitarist Steve Jones, drummer Paul Cook and bassist Glen Matlock joined by frontman Frank Carter (of Gallows, Pure Love and Frank Carter and the Rattlesnakes) \u2014 will hit the road on Sept. 16 at a very memorable stage: The Longhorn Ballroom in Dallas, Texas. It was the site of a particularly hostile show for the band when it first toured the U.S. in 1978.",
      "Jones told The Associated Press he recalls having \"pigs' hooves and bottles and whatnot slung at us by cowboys.\"",
      "It is one of a few dates featured in three \"Live in the U.S.A.\" albums, documenting the band's '78 run: Atlanta, Dallas and San Francisco. The latter will be released on April 25 and captures the show where the band originally called it quits.",
      "\"We were thinking of breaking up in San Francisco again,\" Jones joked.",
      "The 2025 tour is currently scheduled to conclude Oct. 16 at the Hollywood Palladium in Los Angeles. The band will hit Washington; Philadelphia; Brooklyn, New York; Montreal; Toronto; Cleveland; Detroit; Minneapolis; Denver; Seattle and San Francisco. Additional tour dates will be announced later.",
      "Pre-sale opens April 2 and 3.\u00a0Tickets go on sale\u00a0April 4 at 10 a.m. local time.",
      "They will perform the band's sole album, 1977's \"Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols Album\" live in its entirety as well as other material.",
      "So, why tour the U.S. and Canada now?",
      "\"Why not?\" Jones said.",
      "\"I think everybody needs this band right now. I think the world needs this band right now,\" Carter said. \"And I think definitely America is screaming out for a band like the Sex Pistols.\"",
      "\"At the end of the day, we're living in a really, really difficult time. So not only do people want to come and just be entertained, they want to enjoy themselves,\" he continued. \"Punk is an energetic music. It's one where you can go and vent and let your hair down, hopefully in a safe manner. Fingers crossed, no bottles or pigs' hooves.\"",
      "Carter fronted the Sex Pistols last year for a few U.K. dates. The band said they did not reach out to Lydon to see if he wanted to participate in this reunion tour.",
      "\"The last thing he wants to do is have anything to do with us right now,\" Jones said, referring to a previous lawsuit between the singer and the band over music use in\u00a0their TV series \"Pistol.\"\u00a0The judge ruled against Lydon's opposition.",
      "\"We wish him the best,\" Jones said.",
      "\"Good luck to him,\" Matlock added. \"I wish he thinks, maybe, 'good luck' to us. Probably doesn't. But over the years, John (has had) all our phone numbers, and I can't see many missed calls from him.\"",
      "As for the 2025 tour: Fans shouldn't expect the violence of their 1978 run, but they should anticipate a tighter performance.",
      "\"We're a bit older but we play just as well, if not better,\" Matlock said. \"And I think that's something that's got a great deal of aplomb that we're going to bring to the public over there.\"",
      "Does this mean there could be new Sex Pistols music in the future? \"It's early days,\" Jones said. \"Let's see what happens.\"",

      "The iconic Sundance Film Festival will be moving from Park City, Utah to Boulder, Colorado, starting in 2027, the festival and the Colorado Governor's Office announced on Thursday.",
      "The search for a new host city has been years in the making, with the festival announcing the search in 2023 and several cities, including Boulder, as possible new hosts being announced last year.",
      "\"Colorado is thrilled to welcome the Sundance Film Festival to its new home in Boulder starting in 2027,\" Colorado Gov. Jared Polis said in a statement. \"Here in our state we celebrate the arts and film industry as a key economic driver, job creator, and important contributor to our thriving culture. Now, with the addition of the iconic Sundance Film Festival, we can expect even more jobs, a huge benefit for our small businesses including stores and restaurants.\"",
      "\"This decision was informed by a detailed evaluation of the key components essential to creating our Festival. During the process, it became clear that Boulder is the ideal location in which to build our Festival's future, marking a key strategic step in its natural evolution,\" Sundance Institute Board Chair  Ebs Burnough said.",
      "The Sundance Film Festival takes place every January. The Boulder Film Festival will likely be pushed back by about a month, officials behind that festival previously told CBS News Colorado.",
      "Utah was home to the international film festival for 42 years, but festival organizers said the festival has outgrown its home.",
      "Since entering the selection process, state and local leaders in Colorado have mounted considerable efforts to get the festival moved to Boulder, citing the city's concentration of artists, its history of culture, and the revenue benefits to the city and state.",
      "\"I founded the Sundance Institute with a commitment to discovering and developing independent artists, with the Sundance Film Festival serving as the platform for stories to help expand audiences and broaden the landscape,\" Robert Redford, Sundance Institute president and founder, said in a statement. \"This move will ensure that the Festival continues its work of risk taking, supporting innovative storytellers, fostering independence, and entertaining and enlightening audiences. I am grateful to the Boulder community for its support, and I look forward to seeing what the future holds for the Festival there.\"",
      "As part of Boulder's efforts to attract Sundance, the state legislature is considering up to $34 million in refundable tax credits, which would kick in by 2027, when Sundance is set to relocate here. Some state lawmakers oppose that move, however, with one saying it was unfair to ask the entire state to subsidize what would largely only benefit one community.",
      "Nonetheless, the efforts didn't stop there. City leaders in Boulder previously said that local hotels have already committed to capping room price increases during the 11-day event.",
      "\"Our walkable downtown, iconic venues, and beautiful landscape at the base of the Rocky Mountains sets the stage for the Sundance Film Festival to flourish in its next chapter,\" said Charlene Hoffman, CEO of Visit Boulder. \"It's been a remarkable experience getting to share our vibrant community with the Sundance Institute and we eagerly await the Festival's debut in beautiful Boulder, Colorado with excitement and gratitude.\"",
      "A study by the State of Utah found Sundance had nearly 73,000 attendees in 2024, generating $132 million in economic output, $14 million in tax revenue, and $70 million in wages.",
      "\"Boulder is an art town, tech town, mountain town, and college town. It is a place where the Festival can build and flourish. This is the beginning of a bold, new journey as we invite everyone to be part of our community and to be entertained and inspired,\" the Sundance Institute's acting CEO Amanda Kelso said. \"We can't imagine a better fit than Boulder.\"",

    "story": [
      "Paris\u00a0\u2014 French cinema icon G\u00e9rard Depardieu is in court in Paris this week, accused of sexually assaulting two women in 2021. A set designer, 34, and an assistant producer, 54, claim the actor grabbed and groped them while filming \"Les Volets Verts\" (\"The Green Shutters\") in Paris in August and September 2021.",
      "Taking the stand Tuesday for the first time, Depardieu told the court he was nothing like the man described by the two women.",
      "\"I don't see why I would grope a woman, her buttocks, her breasts,\" he said. \"I'm not somebody who rubs himself up against people on the metro.\"",
      "The actor said it was \"very emotional\" being in court.",
      "The two women did not immediately report the alleged offenses. However, after the actor published an open letter in Le Figaro newspaper in October 2023 in which he stated: \"Never, never have I abused a woman,\" the set designer went to the police. She reported Depardieu for alleged sexual assault, sexual harassment and sexist insults.",
      "The trial first opened in October, but it was adjourned due to Depardieu's failing health. His lawyer told the court the 76-year-old was diabetic and had recently undergone a quadruple-bypass heart surgery.",
      "Medical experts later deemed him fit to attend the trial, but limited the hearings to six hours per day, with a provision for 15-minute pauses if Depardieu needed them. The trial that opened Monday was scheduled to run for only two days, but it may go longer if his health requires breaks in the proceedings.",
      "Depardieu was in court for the trial's opening on Monday. As they walked in together, his lawyer told reporters the actor was happy to have the chance to present his side.",
      "\"G\u00e9rard Depardieu is someone who is very free, who can be extremely direct,\" said his lawyer J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Assous, who dismissed the accusations as \"lies.\"",
      "Dozens of protesters, mostly women, gathered outside the courthouse, denouncing what they called endemic sexism and impunity for sex offenders in French cinema and French society. They told reporters they were pleased the actor was finally in court to answer the allegations, and waved placards with messages including: \"Victims, we believe you; rapists, we see you\"; \"Touch one, you answer to all\".",
      "A giant of French cinema, Depardieu has been more infamous than famous in recent years. He's been accused of sexual misconduct by more than a dozen women in the movie industry. Many of the claims surfaced years after the alleged incidents took place, however, so under French law the actor cannot be tried for them.",
      "In a high-profile move, the actor left his native France for a few years about a decade ago, moving to Belgium, having criticized French tax increases.",
      "Depardieu has been open about his admiration for Russia under autocratic President Vladimir Putin, who bestowed Russian citizenship on him in 2013.",
      "He later also became a citizen of Dubai.",

      "With stars like Denzel Washington and Jake Gyllenhaal, maybe it's no wonder \"Othello\" just became the highest-grossing Broadway play ever, pulling in $2.8 million in a single week.",
      "Washington said, \"It's the most excited I've been this century. Seriously. I haven't been this excited about anything I've done as I am about this.\"",
      "That's saying something coming from Washington. Known for roles in films like \"Glory\" and \"Training Day\" (both of which won him Oscars), he's been called the greatest actor of the 21st century. But be careful before you call him a \"Hollywood actor.\"",
      "\"What's the definition of a Hollywood actor?\" he said. \"Myself, I'm from Mt. Vernon, so I'm a 'Mt. Vernon actor.' I don't know what 'Hollywood' means.\"",
      "\"Somebody who's famous on film? A film actor, great success on film?\"",
      "\"I'm a stage actor who does film; it's not the other way around,\" Washington said. \"I did stage first. I learned how to act on stage, not on film. Movies are a filmmaker's medium. You shoot it, and then you're gone and they cut together and add music and do all of that. Theater is an actor's medium. The curtain goes up, nobody can help you.\"",
      "\"Othello\" is the Tony-winner's sixth Broadway show. He plays the title character, Othello, the military commander stirred into a murderous rage after his ensign, Iago, convinces him his wife, Desdemona, has been unfaithful.",
      "Jake Gyllenhaal plays the deceitful Iago, who seeks revenge on his longtime comrade and commander because he was passed over for a promotion.",
      "Shakespeare wrote \"Othello\" around 1604. But this production sets the play in \"the near future,\" adding modern themes like service members suffering from PTSD.",
      "Washington said, \"People, you know, they ordinarily think, 'Oh yeah, it's about jealousy. And he betrays him.' No, it's about two soldiers who trust each other with their lives.\"",
      "\"Well, then\u2026\" Gyllenhaal laughed.",
      "\"Yeah, what are you so pissed off about? What did I do to you?\" Washington laughed.",
      "\"What you know, you know!\" Gyllenhaal replied. \"But I mean, that what is shared is theirs, you know? And what is shared beyond something that they would share with others. That's what makes their bond so strong.\"",
      "At 44 years old, Gyllenhaal is widely celebrated for the emotional range and intensity he brings to roles, in films such as \"Brokeback Mountain,\" \"Zodiac\" and \"Nightcrawler.\" And like Washington, he is a theater veteran, with \"Othello\" marking his fourth appearance on Broadway. But this is his first time performing Shakespeare (almost). \"You know what I realized? I did do 'Much Ado About Nothing' in high school,\" he said. \"And I realized that this morning.\"",
      "\"You forgot?\" an astonished Washington laughed.",
      "\"Probably the audience and I would probably like to forget!\"",
      "We visited Gyllenhaal before a performance this past week at the Barrymore Theatre. Standing on stage, the actor said, \"It's my favorite place to be.\"",
      "He explained his character feeds off the audience: \"[Iago] does have a lot of moments [where] he has interactions with the audience, they kind of become his partner in it, and every night it is different. And that's what I love so much about it.\"",
      "Washington, now 70, is no stranger to Shakespeare. On stage he's played Richard III and Julius Caesar, and he has starred in movie versions of \"Much Ado About Nothing\" and an adaptation of \"Macbeth.\" \u00a0He first played Othello as a student at Fordham University in New York City.",
      "Asked how he relates to the play and its language differently from when he was 22, Washington replied, \"I know a lot less now. I thought I knew everything then! I didn't really like the part, 'cause I wasn't wise enough to understand it. Now I understand it's really about a bond, you know, that these characters have. He loves not wisely, but too well.\"",
      "\"Othello\" has been staged on Broadway more than 20 times. For most of those performances, Othello was played by a white actor in blackface. That changed in 1943, when Paul Robeson gave a legendary performance in the role. The last actor to play him on Broadway was James Earl Jones, in 1982.",
      "\"James Earl Jones was my northern star when I was in college,\" said Washington. \"He was who I wanted to be. I didn't get to see his Othello, but I know it wasn't as good as my 22-year-old interpretation! But you know, it's my turn.\"",
      "And what a turn it's been. The show is already a box office hit. But record-breaking sales have driven prices sky-high; prime seats go for nearly $1,000, drawing some criticism.",
      "But audiences are showing up, and by the sound of it are enjoying themselves \u2013 as are the stars.",
      "Gyllenhaal said, \"You get to a point where you're like, 'Oh, I've worked my whole career for this, for this moment.'\"",
      "\"That's what it feels like for me, too,\" said Washington. \"I worked my whole career for this moment. This is a 48-year journey for me. It's fascinating to have been too young for the part, and some may say now too old. But 48 years of experience, so 48 years of pain and pleasure and life has informed my approach to playing the role.\"",

      "A look back at the esteemed personalities who left us this year, who'd touched us with their innovation, creativity and humanity.",
      "By CBSNews.com senior producer David Morgan. The Associated Press contributed to this gallery.",
      "Boxer George Foreman (Jan. 10, 1949-March 21, 2025) rose up from poverty in a tough Houston neighborhood to become an Olympic gold medalist at 19, and heavyweight champion of the world twice. An uncommon man with the common touch, he also conquered success outside the ring as an advertising pitchman and star of infomercials.",
      "In 1973, at age 24, Foreman defeated Joe Frazier to become world champion. The following year, he defended his heavyweight title against Muhammad Ali in Kinshasa, Zaire, in one of the most touted boxing matches of all time, \"The Rumble in the Jungle.\" \"I beat him up for the first three rounds, four rounds. I think I even beat him up the sixth round, too,\" Foreman told \"Sunday Morning\" in 2005. \"Then all of a sudden I hit him in the seventh round and he whispered in my ear, `That all you got, George?' Oh, that was all I had. You've heard of the rope-a-dope? Well, here's the dope!\" Ali, then the underdog, won in the eighth round by a knockout; Foreman lost the title.",
      "At the time, he was devastated. \"I was young, only 25 years old. I didn't know what to do. I thought my life was over, because when you lose the championship it's not like you lost the title, you lose yourself, because it's like you're not a man anymore.\"",
      "Three years later, after another loss, Foreman had a religious experience that changed his life. He quit boxing and became an evangelist, preaching first on street corners, then in his own church. He opened the George Foreman Youth and Community Center, a safe place for kids to hang out. \"For 10 years, I didn't even make a fist,\" he said. \"I didn't box, I didn't try to box, I was done with it. I was a preacher, a happy, fat preacher.\"",
      "But money problems drove him back to the ring. So, at 37, Foreman began his comeback. He was ridiculed at first \u2014 too old, too fat, too slow, they said \u2014 but he was also too strong, and in 1994, more than 20 years after he beat Frazier for the title, Foreman knocked out the undefeated Michael Moorer. At age 45, Foreman became the oldest heavyweight champion ever.",
      "That same year, Foreman agreed to help market a kitchen grill that few were buying, in exchange for a piece of the company. In the first 15 years, Foreman said they sold 100 million of the George Foreman Lean Mean Fat Reducing Grilling Machines and its variations.",
      "\"When you go through the airport some time and people stop and say 'George, we love the grill!' that's greater than them telling me, 'George, you did a good job becoming the heavyweight champ of the world!'\" Foreman said.",
      "And he continued selling, not just grilling machines but also mufflers, chips, hot dogs, video games, home warranties, and a George Foreman clothing line.",
      "\"I'm driven,\" he said in 2005. \"I like the life I'm living, but I'm driven because there's so much more to obtain. I'm one of those guys who's going to have to fall out of the saddle. There's always one more star to reach for and I'm trying to.\"",
      "Married five times, Foreman had 12 children. And yes, he did name all five of his sons George. \"You got Muhammad Ali, Joe Frazier, Kenny Norton, Ron Lyle, you let those people hit you on the head and see how many names you're going to remember \u2014 it would be confusing,\" he told \"Sunday Morning.\" \"I kept it simple. I never forget a name!\"",
      "It also inspired a children's book he wrote, titled, \"Let George Do It!\""

    "summary": "As Conan O'Brien was honored with the Mark Twain Prize at the Kennedy Center, many comics targeted President Trump from the stage.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 On a night when half a dozen people made jokes about this being the last-ever Mark Twain Prize, Conan O'Brien made sure the ceremony at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts ended on a high note.",
      "O'Brien accepted the award for lifetime achievement in comedy Sunday night while acknowledging the backstage turmoil that hangs over the future of the cultural center in Washington.",
      "O'Brien, 61, was named the 26th recipient of the Mark Twain Prize in mid-January.",
      "Last month, Mr. Trump\u00a0dissolved the Kennedy Center's board of directors and named himself chairman. The new board includes\u00a0political allies like White House chief of staff Susie Wiles, longtime senior Trump aide Dan Scavino, second lady Usha Vance and Fox News host Laura Ingraham.",
      "On Sunday, O'Brien specifically thanked Rubenstein and Rutter \u2014 drawing an extended round of applause \u2014 as well as Kennedy Center staffers who, he said, were \"worried about what the future might bring.\"",
      "He said the example of Mark Twain's own life and career was particularly resonant at this moment in American history.",
      "\"Twain hated bullies. ... He punched up, not down, and he deeply empathized with the weak,\" O'Brien said. \"Twain loved America, but he knew it was deeply flawed.\"",
      "A Mark Twain impersonator then emerged from the audience. After a back-and-forth debate with O'Brien, he joined him on stage and the pair slow danced for a while. They were then joined by a dozen more Twain impersonators and previous Twain Prize recipient Adam Sandler for a raucous rendition of Neil Young's \"Rockin in the Free World.\"",
      "Barbs aimed at Trump's Kennedy Center changes",
      "That musical ending capped off a night when the uncertain fate of the Kennedy Center itself was woven through the multiple tributes and testimonials to O'Brien.",
      "\"I think it would be insane not to address the elephant in the room,\" comic Nikki Glaser said on the red carpet before the ceremony. \"It's in the air tonight. This night is about Conan, but it can be both.\"",
      "Once the festivities began, Stephen Colbert joked that the Kennedy Center had announced two new board members: Bashar Assad, the ousted president of Syria, and Skeletor, a fictional supervillain.",
      "John Mulaney quipped that the entire building would soon be renamed \"the Roy Cohn Pavilion\" after one of Trump's mentors. And Sarah Silverman made multiple Trump jokes that were too vulgar to print.",
      "Mr. Trump, in announcing the Kennedy Center changes, posted\u00a0on his Truth Social social media platform that those who were dismissed \"do not share our Vision for a Golden Age in Arts and Culture.\"",
      "How that vision takes shape remains to be seen, but Mr. Trump has spoken about wanting to book more Broadway shows there and floated the idea of granting Kennedy Center Honors status to actor Sylvester Stallone and singer-songwriter Paul Anka.",
      "Conan O'Brien's comedy honored",
      "Into this maelstrom stepped O'Brien, whose comedic persona has rarely been particularly political.",
      "The comic has always tended more toward goofiness and self-deprecation. But he has also leaned into sensitive societal issues at times.",
      "In 2011, O'Brien officiated a gay wedding live on his show, overseeing the marriage of his longtime costume designer Scott Cronick and his partner David Gorshein.",
      "O'Brien vaulted into the spotlight from near-total obscurity in 1993 when he was chosen to replace David Letterman as host of \"Late Night\" despite no significant on-camera experience. The former Harvard Lampoon editor had spent the previous years as a writer for \"Saturday Night Live\" and \"The Simpsons,\" appearing on camera only as an occasional background extra in \"SNL\" skits.",
      "He went on to host \"Late Night\" for 16 years, longer than any other host. O'Brien was later tapped to replace Jay Leno as host of \"The Tonight Show,\" but that experiment ended in public failure. After seven months of declining ratings, NBC executives brought Leno back for a new show that would bump \"The Tonight Show\" back. O'Brien refused to accept the move, leading to a public spat that ended with a multimillion-dollar payout for O'Brien and his staff to exit the network in early 2010.",
      "O'Brien went on to host another talk show on the cable station TBS, while launching successful podcasts and travel shows.",
      "He is currently on a late-career elder statesman hot streak. His travel series, \"Conan O'Brien Must Go,\" drew popular and critical acclaim, with a second season coming. His recent gig hosting the Academy Awards was so well received that the producers announced they are bringing him back next year.",
      "In the wake of Trump's takeover of the Kennedy Center, several artists, including the producers of \"Hamilton\" and actress and writer Issa Rae, announced they were canceling appearances at the venue.",
      "Others have chosen to perform while making their sentiments known from the stage. Comic W. Kamau Bell directly addressed the controversy in his performance just days after the shake-up. Earlier this month, cellist Erin Murphy Snedecor ended her set with a performance of the Woody Guthrie protest anthem \"All You Fascists Bound to Lose.\"",
      "Other comedians receiving the lifetime achievement award include both Letterman and Leno, along with George Carlin, Whoopi Goldberg, Bob Newhart, Carol Burnett, Bill Murray and Dave Chappelle.",

      "In his new memoir, \"When the Going Was Good: An Editor's Adventures During the Last Golden Age of Magazines\" (to be published Tuesday by Penguin Press), former Vanity Fair editor Graydon Carter recounts the glory days of magazine publishing, and of his stewardship of the trend-setting title for two-and-a-half decades.",
      "Among the colorful highlights Carter writes about from his career at the venerable Cond\u00e9 Nast property is the subterfuge required to protect Vanity Fair's 2015 scoop of Caitlyn Jenner's transition.",
      "Read an excerpt below, and don't miss Jane Pauley's interview with Graydon Carter on \"CBS Sunday Morning\" March 23!",
      "\"When the Going Was Good\" by Graydon Carter",
      "Prefer to listen?\u00a0Audible\u00a0has a 30-day free trial available right now.",
      "We were always on the lookout for covers that would fly off the newsstands and, in years to come, go viral on the internet. Sometimes the quest took us down unexpected byways. If the unmasking of Deep Throat was the biggest journalistic scoop of my time at Vanity Fair, the biggest scoop with regard to the overall culture was our cover exclusive about Caitlyn Jenner. I remembered Jenner as an Olympic decathlete who as Bruce Jenner had appeared on Wheaties boxes\u2014once among the highest accolades an athlete could aspire to.\u00a0 Jenner was tall and still good-looking\u2014later, with a bit of help from colorists and surgeons. There had been a minor and desultory film career early on, and by the time of transition, Jenner was a stepfather getting ordered about by sundry Kardashians on their reality television show. Jenner had become a slightly tragic figure. But word began to seep out that there was going to be some dramatic news.",
      "One day I called Jane Sarkin into my office and said, \"What about Bruce Jenner?\" There were stories floating about that Jenner was going through reassignment surgery. I said, \"At some point Jenner's going to make an announcement. Why not in Vanity Fair? Why don't you see if we can get it?\" Our initial approach was turned down flat. Then Jenner switched to a public relations person Jane was friends with. After a lot of to-ing and fro-ing, Jane had some news. Jenner was game to do it with us, she said.",
      "To get the cover and the inside pictures and the story, we went into deep-secrecy mode. As we had done with Deep Throat, we set up a special room at the office and covered the windows with kraft paper. Nothing suspicious about that! We had one key for the room, and a computer to handle traffic on a server separate from the one that handled the rest of the magazine. Only eight people in the office knew about the project. I assigned Annie Leibovitz to do the pictures and Buzz Bissinger, a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and the author of Friday Night Lights, to do the story. I thought Buzz would be ideal. He could talk sports, and given that he had dabbled with a bit of cross-dressing, he could converse in the language of women's finery as well.\u00a0 Buzz made a number of trips west as Bruce began the process of transition. The plan was that Bruce would have surgery and then recuperate in isolation at his home in Malibu. Our agreement was that no one else was allowed to visit him during this period. Only Buzz. As the reporting progressed, we had issues to contend with, including finding women's clothes for a six-foot, two-inch former athlete and then smuggling the most famous photographer in the world into a house that was surrounded by paparazzi. Word had gotten out about Jenner, and there were even news helicopters circling overhead. We put security guards around the perimeter. And then we put the entire staff for the shoot in two large vans with darkened windows. Jane and Buzz were in one of them, as was Buzz's editor, Dana Brown. Later, Jane described walking in with Annie's team. \"The house looked out at a beautiful vista of Malibu. Very modest house. But a beautiful pool. You walk up the steps, and as I come up, this person is coming towards me in a silk robe with marabou feathers, and kitten heels with marabou feathers. Her legs are glistening with satin oil. The hair is down, and the hands are huge. She says to me, 'Hi, I'm Caitlyn.'\"",
      "Once we had the story and the shoot, it was time to pick the cover and figure out what to say on it. We toyed with any number of options. Finally, I just wrote the line \"Call Me Caitlyn.\" I figured that, by the time the issue hit the \u00a0newsstands, her name would be everywhere, and we wouldn't have to say much more than that. We were still in relatively primitive digital times, but we decided to make it the first cover we ever released online. No waiting around for the printing and binding and delivery trucks\u2014all constant sources of leaks. We prepared a brief description and a short video that had been filmed during the shoot. At noon on the appointed day, we released our story to the world. A dozen or so of us sat at a long borrowed conference table, watching the traffic on a big TV monitor. It started slowly and then, as the minutes clicked by, the graph arm just began to climb until it was completely vertical. I have no idea whether you can \"break\" the internet or not, but if it is possible, we surely came close.",

    "summary": "The former editor of Vanity Fair for 25 years, and cofounder of Spy Magazine, Graydon Carter recounts a career as a tastemaker quietly shaping pop culture in his new memoir, \"When the Going Was Good.\"",
    "story": [
      "The former editor of Vanity Fair for 25 years, Graydon Carter is a family man, father of five grown children, better known for his signature white hair and urbane elegance, never without a handkerchief \u2013 Herm\u00e8s, he has 30 of them (\"This is my greatest luxury,\" he says) \u2013   chronicler of the privileged set of which he is a member, though not born to it.",
      "Growing up middle class, in Ottawa, he credits a mix of Canadian affability and inner strength for his enduring career at the top of the glittering world of magazines. \"Canadians are not weak,\" he said. \"We may look affable on the outside, but if you can survive playing hockey on an open rink in 30\u00b0 weather, you develop a spine.\"",
      "He tells the story of watching a super liner flitting by: \"And I could see in the light, the sort of the amber light of the window, a very attractive couple, and they were sort of dressed up having, I guess, cocktails or dinner. And I realized I wanted to be on that side of the window rather than this side I was standing on.\"",
      "I asked, \"Before that, would you have described yourself as having driving ambitions?\"",
      "\"No. I had absolutely no ambition whatsoever,\" he replied.",
      "He left college before graduating, but with a passion for magazines, and in 1978, set his sights on New York. It was summer in the city. He was not dressed for success. \"I had a Canadian tweed coat on, and it was about as thick as this chair. And I've never felt heat like this in my entire life. And I was drenched in sweat. Water was squirting out of me! So, I had the interview. But he said, 'Why don't you just sit in front of the air conditioner for a while?' So I sat there for a half an hour \u2026 trying to cool down.\"",
      "He left with a job that launched a career in the golden age of magazines, as he writes in his memoir: \"When the Going Was Good: An Editor's Adventures During the Last Golden Age of Magazines\" (to be published Tuesday by Penguin Press).",
      "And the timing was golden, too. In 1985, New York City was ripe for satire. \"With the invention of the investment banker, everything changed in New York,\" Carter said. \"People were showing off their money in a big way.\"",
      "He was a cofounder of Spy magazine, cheeky and fearless. Among his subjects: A real estate mogul named Donald Trump. \"I had met him a couple of years before,\" Carter said. \"I'd been assigned to do a story on him. I hung around with him for three weeks, and I wrote the story, and I did point out that he was sort of a sharpy from Queens and he was trying to make it. But I pointed out in the story that his hands appeared to be too small for his body. Well, he hated that.",
      "\"And so, at Spy we came up with funny epithets for people, and in Trump's case we called him a 'short-fingered vulgarian' every time we mentioned his name. And he hated that!\"",
      "And yes, Carter has dual citizenship \u2013 American and Canadian. I asked, \"How does that feel at this point in time?\"",
      "\"Especially in the last month or so, I feel very strongly Canadian, and very proud, and very happy that Mark Carney is the prime minister,\" Carter replied.",
      "The New York Observer was a weekly Manhattan newspaper memorable for the color of paper it was printed on, when Carter saw possibilities, leaving Spy in 1991. \"I thought, 'I can make this a thing.'\"",
      "And in a year, the Observer could be seen in the offices of major editors all over Europe (because Carter had sent them). But a visiting American publisher took note.\u00a0 \"And he comes back thinking, 'This is a huge international hit!'\" laughed Carter.",
      "S.I. Newhouse, head of the Cond\u00e9 Nast magazine empire, made Graydon Carter editor of Vanity Fair, where the going was very good indeed. \"I flew the Concord more than 60 times,\" Carter said. \"When you went to another city you had a car and driver. You had a car and driver in New York. It was very heady. But at the same time, it was all predicated on you making a successful magazine.\"",
      "Through the magazine, and his own outsized persona, Carter was often described as a tastemaker quietly shaping pop culture \u2014 someone making who's who, and saying what's what. He was responsible for bringing Monica Lewinsky back for a reset \u2026 revealing the identity of \"Deep Throat\" \u2026 squiring Diana, Princess of Wales in London \u2026 the worldwide exclusive worldwide introductions of Tom Cruise and his family, and of Caitlyn Jenner.",
      "But Jennifer Aniston was the all-time best-selling cover. \"You look back now, you think, 'What was all the fuss?'\" he said. \"But she had just broken up with Brad Pitt, and this is her talking about him, and crying.\"",
      "A successful magazine is something greater than sum of subscription and newsstand sales. For 31 years, Vanity Fair has been synonymous with Oscar party. Hollywood's party of the year was Graydon Carter's magic. \"It became not how to get people in, but how to keep people out,\" he said.",
      "So, what is it about parties that he is so good at? \"We had no VIP sections,\" he explained. \"Once you got in, everybody's the same. And with a party, it's about the right curation of people.\"",
      "\"Curation is very important to everything you've done,\" I said.",
      "\"If it's interesting to me, I think it might be interesting to others,\" he replied.",
      "Graydon Carter resigned from Vanity Fair in 2017 and retired to the south of France. It didn't take.",
      "His idea of retirement was to start something brand new. \"I wanted to produce something that'd be like a dispatch,\" he said.",
      "Air Mail is an email newsletter. It began six years ago, and is said to have half a million subscribers in 219 countries. Filled with thoughtful features and travel and shopping recommendations (all carefully curated, of course), Carter, at 76, is still finding ways to bring in readers.",
      "The impresario says he has \"stumbled\" a lot along the way. Asked to define \"stumble,\" Carter replied, \"Life is a bone yard of minor mistakes and fumbles.\"",
      "\"I've always felt that introductions would be far more interesting if you skipped the highlights \u2026 it's the lowlights where everything happens,\" I said.",
      "\"100%,\" said Carter. \"Successes are really boring. Failures are much more fascinating.\"",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/salvador-dali-museum-of-surrealist-art/",
    "published": "Sun, 23 Mar 2025 09:33:32 -0400",
    "summary": "More than 2,400 works by the Spanish artist Salvador Dal\u00ed, from oil paintings and prints to sculptural mashups, are featured at The Dal\u00ed Museum in St. Petersburg, Fla., which also hosts immersive exhibitions celebrating the Surrealist.",
    "story": [
      "When Mike Wallace interviewed Salvador Dal\u00ed in 1958, the painter seemed to believe that he might live forever. Asked what he believed would happen to him when he died, the Surrealist replied, \"Myself not believe in my death.\"",
      "\"You will not die?\"",
      "\"No, no. Believe in general in death, but in the death of Dal\u00ed? Absolutely no, not.\"",
      "Dal\u00ed did die, in 1989. But in a way, he was right. The artist lives on at the Dal\u00ed Museum in St. Petersburg, Florida.",
      "The collection chronicles his career through more than 2,400 of his works, from oil paintings to sculptural mashups to fine jewelry. Inside the Dal\u00ed Dome, a \"Dal\u00ed Alive 360\" show fully immerses visitors in his art.",
      "\"Its spirit is based in Dal\u00ed's,\" said Hank Hine, the executive director of the museum. \"That is, Dal\u00ed was always trying to do things in new ways. The amazing thing about Dal\u00ed is that his impact is still felt today, not only in art, but in culture generally.\"",
      "Today, Salvador Dal\u00ed may be a household name, but his name first belonged to his parents' firstborn son. \"His parents named him after his dead brother,\" said Hine. \"That saddled him with a burden of identity that lasted all his life, and can explain a lot of his art \u2013 for instance, his double images, where you see one thing, and you see another. So, this Salvador Dal\u00ed was always wondering, 'Am I myself or am I the other?'\"",
      "Many of Dal\u00ed's works combine the real and the surreal \u2013 a juxtaposition he could pull off thanks to his training as a precise classical painter. \"He can paint like an old master; however, he wasn't content to stay there,\" said program director Kim Macuare.",
      "She said Dal\u00ed found inspiration by diving deep into the subconscious: \"He was very interested in the writings of the Austrian psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud. And so, when he cuts the drawers into the Venus, what's he's imagining is, 'What would happen if we could go up and open the drawers and look inside someone to see what really makes them tick?'\"",
      "As far as ticking goes, Dal\u00ed's famous painting of melting watches, \"The Persistence of Memory,\" is actually at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. But his follow-up is here, hanging in a museum in a state Dal\u00ed never even visited.",
      "The artist had no connection with St. Petersburg, Florida. But what he did have were two very big fans. A wealthy Ohio couple, Eleanor and Reynolds Morse, bought a Dal\u00ed painting to celebrate their first anniversary, a purchase that kicked off a lifetime of collecting and friendship. They acquired everything from Dal\u00ed's early Cubist paintings to his later, larger religious-themed canvases.",
      "Hine said, \"They loved Dal\u00ed so much that they bought only Dal\u00ed for four decades, and were able to put together what is the preeminent collection of Dal\u00ed in the world.\"",
      "When the Morse family decided to donate their collection in the late 1970s, they were insistent that it all go to one location, but no museum stepped up. After the Wall Street Journal wrote an article (\"U.S. Art World Dillydallies Over Dal\u00eds\"), the people of St. Petersburg, Florida, said, \"Well, heck, we'll take it.\" The city made an agreement to find a building for the collection \u2013 a marine warehouse that, in 1982, opened as the Dal\u00ed Museum.",
      "In 2011, the collection moved to its current location, where the Morses' son Brad now comes to see the paintings that once covered his childhood home. \"There was not a square foot or inch even of wall space that wasn't holding a Dal\u00ed painting,\" he said.",
      "In fact, Dal\u00ed's 1956 oil painting \"Nature Morte Vivante (Still Life-Fast Moving)\" hung above Brad Morse's bed.",
      "Now, more than 300,000 visitors a year come to see the fascinating ways in which Dal\u00ed saw the world.",
      "Macuare said, \"Dal\u00ed had a really great quote, and I think it's indicative of how he saw himself and how he saw the world, and that was, 'I don't do drugs. I am drugs.' He thought that seeing as he did would absolutely change your perspective.\"",
      "Dal\u00ed was perceived as an eccentric. Especially in his later life, he was known just as much for his wild persona as he was for his art. But in death his work has gained greater critical appreciation.",
      "\"I think the height of his fame is not over,\" said Hine. \"Dal\u00ed's star is still rising in the world, largely because of what he suggested in his art about the ability to see the world in a different way, something that we really need in this world today.\"",

Because the person was a Michigan resident, it will be counted as a Michigan human rabies case rather than an Ohio one, the local health department said. According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), it is Michigan's first human case of rabies since 2009.",
      "Lucas County and its county seat of Toledo are just south of the Michigan-Ohio state line. Authorities from both states were involved in the investigation; and the CDC made the rabies confirmation.",

    "published": "Tue, 25 Mar 2025 13:34:45 -0400",
    "summary": "Disability rights advocates say income and asset caps for Medicaid buy-in programs are a \"poverty trap\" for millions of Americans.",
    "story": [
      "PLEASANTVILLE, Iowa \u2014 Zach Mecham has heard politicians demand that Medicaid recipients work or lose their benefits. He also has run into a jumble of Medicaid rules that effectively prevent many people with disabilities from holding full-time jobs.",
      "\"Which is it? Do you want us to work or not?\" he said.",
      "Mecham, 31, relies on the public insurance program to pay for services that help him live on his own despite a disability caused by muscular dystrophy. He uses a wheelchair to get around and a portable ventilator to breathe.",
      "A paid assistant stays with Mecham at night. Then a home health aide comes in the morning to help him get out of bed, go to the bathroom, shower, and get dressed for work at his online marketing business. Without the assistance, he would have to shutter his company and move into a nursing home, he said.",
      "Private health insurance plans generally do not cover such support services, so he relies on Medicaid, which is jointly financed by federal and state governments and covers millions of Americans who have low incomes or disabilities.",
      "Like most other states, Iowa has a Medicaid \"buy-in program,\" which allows people with disabilities to join Medicaid even if their incomes are a bit higher than would typically be permitted. About two-thirds of such programs charge premiums, and most have caps on how much money participants can earn and save.",
      "Some states have raised or eliminated such financial caps for people with disabilities. Mecham has repeatedly traveled to the Iowa Capitol to lobby legislators to follow those states' lead. The \"Work Without Worry\" bill would remove income and asset caps and instead require Iowans with disabilities to pay 6% of their incomes as premiums to remain in Medicaid. Those fees would be waived if participants pay premiums for employer-based health insurance, which would help cover standard medical care.",
      "Disability rights advocates say income and asset caps for Medicaid buy-in programs can prevent participants from working full time or accepting promotions. \"It's a trap \u2014 a poverty trap,\" said Stephen Lieberman, a policy director for the United Spinal Association, which supports the changes.",
      "Lawmakers in Florida, Hawaii, Indiana, Iowa, Maine, Mississippi, and New Jersey have introduced bills to address the issue this year, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.",
      "Several other states have raised or eliminated their program's income and asset caps. Iowa's proposal is modeled on a Tennessee law passed last year, said Josh Turek, a Democratic state representative from Council Bluffs. Turek, who is promoting the Iowa bill, uses a wheelchair and earned two gold medals as a member of the U.S. Paralympics basketball team.",
      "Proponents say allowing people with disabilities to earn more money and still qualify for Medicaid would help ease persistent worker shortages, including in rural areas where the working-age population is shrinking.",
      "Turek believes now is a good time to seek expanded employment rights for people with disabilities, since Republicans who control the state and federal governments have been touting the value of holding a job. \"That's the trumpet I've been blowing,\" he said with a smile.",
      "The Iowa Legislature has been moving to require many nondisabled Medicaid recipients to work or to document why they can't. Opponents say most Medicaid recipients who can work already do so, and the critics say work requirements add red tape that is expensive to administer and could lead Medicaid recipients to lose their coverage over paperwork issues.",
      "Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds has made Medicaid work requirements a priority this year. \"If you can work, you should. It's common sense and good policy,\" the Republican governor told legislators in January in her \"Condition of the State Address.\" \"Getting back to work can be a lifeline to stability and self-sufficiency.\"",
      "Her office did not respond to KFF Health News' queries about whether Reynolds supports eliminating income and asset caps for Iowa's buy-in program, known as Medicaid for Employed People with Disabilities.",
      "Spouse's income counts toward cap",
      "National disability rights activists say income and asset caps on Medicaid buy-in programs discourage couples from marrying or even pressure them to split up if one or both partners have disabilities. That's because in many states a spouse's income and assets are counted when determining eligibility.",
      "In Iowa, for example, the monthly net income cap is $3,138 for a single person and $4,259 for a couple.",
      "Iowa's current asset cap for a single person in the Medicaid buy-in plan is $12,000. For a couple, that cap rises only to $13,000. Countable assets include investments, bank accounts, and other things that could be easily converted to cash, but not a primary home, vehicle, or household furnishings.",
      "\"You have couples who have been married for decades who have to go through what we call a 'Medicaid divorce,' just to get access to these supports and services that cannot be covered in any other way,\" said Maria Town, president of the American Association of People with Disabilities.",
      "Town said some states, including Massachusetts, have removed income caps for people with disabilities who want to join Medicaid. She said the cost of adding such people to the program is at least partially offset by the premiums they pay for coverage and the increased taxes they contribute because they are allowed to work more hours. \"I don't think it has to be expensive\" for the state and federal governments, she said.",
      "Congress has considered a similar proposal to allow people with disabilities to work more hours without losing their Social Security disability benefits, but that bill has not advanced.",
      "Although most states have Medicaid buy-in programs, enrollment is relatively low, said Alice Burns, a Medicaid analyst at KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.",
      "Fewer than 200,000 people nationwide are covered under the options, Burns said. \"Awareness of these programs is really limited,\" she said, and the income limits and paperwork can dissuade potential participants.",
      "In states that charge premiums for Medicaid buy-in programs, monthly fees can range from $10 to 10% of a person's income, according to a KFF analysis of 2022 data.",
      "Iowa bill to remove caps",
      "The Iowa proposal to remove income and asset caps has drawn bipartisan backing from legislators, including a 20-0 vote of approval from the House Health and Human Services Committee. \"This aligns with things both parties are aiming to do,\" said state Rep. Carter Nordman, a Republican who chaired a subcommittee meeting on the bill. Nordman said he supports the idea but wants to see an official estimate of how much it would cost the state to let more people with disabilities participate in the Medicaid buy-in program.",
      "Mecham, the citizen activist lobbying for the Iowa bill, said he hopes it allows him to expand his online marketing and graphic design business, \"Zach of All Trades.\"",
      "On a recent morning, health aide Courtnie Imler visited Mecham's modest house in Pleasantville, a town of about 1,700 people in an agricultural region of central Iowa. Imler chatted with Mecham while she used a hoist to lift him out of his wheelchair and onto the toilet. Then she cleaned him up, brushed his hair, and helped him put on jeans and a John Deere T-shirt. She poured him a cup of coffee and put a straw in it so he could drink it on his own, swept the kitchen floor, and wiped the counters. After about an hour, she said goodbye.",
      "After getting cleaned up and dressed, Mecham rolled his motorized wheelchair over to his plain wooden desk, fired up his computer, and began working on a social media video for a client promoting a book. He scrolled back and forth through footage of an interview she'd done, so he could pick the best clip to post online. He also shoots video, takes photos, and writes advertising copy.",
      "Mecham loves feeling productive, and he figures he could work at least twice as many hours if not for the risk of losing Medicaid coverage. He said he's allowed to make a bit more money than Iowa Medicaid's standard limit because he signed up for a federal option under which he eventually expects to work his way off Social Security disability payments.",
      "There are several such options for people with disabilities, but they all involve complicated paperwork and frequent reports, he said. \"This is such a convoluted system that I have to navigate to build any kind of life for myself,\" he said. Many people with disabilities are intimidated by the rules, so they don't apply, he said. \"If you get it wrong, you lose the health care your life depends on.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 25 Mar 2025 09:40:28 -0400",
    "summary": "West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey signed a bill into law this week that bans some artificial dyes as well as two preservatives from foods sold statewide.",
    "story": [
      "West Virginia has outlawed foods that contain\u00a0some artificial dyes\u00a0or other additives, in one of the most comprehensive statewide bans of its kind. The move cites potentially harmful health effects and comes amid a broader push from scientists and government leaders to clamp down on synthetics in the nation's food supply.",
      "On Monday, West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey signed into law a bill that was passed earlier by legislators to eliminate seven artificial dyes \u2014 Red Dye No. 3, Red Dye No. 40, Yellow Dye No. 5, Yellow Dye No. 6, Blue Dye No. 1, Blue Dye No. 2 and Green Dye No. 3 \u2014\u00a0 from food products and drugs sold in the state. The preservatives butylated hydroxyanisole and propylparaben will also be banned.",
      "The dyes will not be allowed in meals served as part of school nutrition programs starting on Aug. 1 this year, while the dyes and the two preservatives will not be permitted in drugs and food sold in the state starting on Jan. 1, 2028, according to the governor's office.",
      "\"West Virginia ranks at the bottom of many public health metrics, which is why there's no better place to lead the Make America Healthy Again mission,\" Morrisey said in a statement, citing the campaign slogan popularized by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has said he is prioritizing the removal of artificial dyes from food and drinks sold around the United States. \"By eliminating harmful chemicals from our food, we're taking steps toward improving the health of our residents and protecting our children from significant long-term health and learning challenges.\"",
      "The latest ban in West Virginia follows a pair of laws passed in California in recent years to remove some additives from foods sold statewide and synthetic dyes from school meals. Dozens of other U.S. states have introduced legislation to ban or more strictly regulate certain food additives, including artificial dyes, since the beginning of the year, according to the Environmental Working Group, an advocacy organization focused on food safety.",
      "Thirty-six color additives are approved by the Federal Drug Administration for use in food and drinks in the U.S., including nine artificial dyes.",
      "Rising concerns from advocacy groups and scientists about possible health consequences of synthetic food components, particularly for children, prompted the FDA to undertake a new effort in December to review previously approved additives, although the agency's deputy commissioner for human foods warned at the time that budget restrictions might prevent a timely turnaround. In January, the FDA announced its decision to revoke the authorization for one dye, Red 3, to be added to foods, after evidence showed a link between the dye and cancer in laboratory animals.",

      "Jackson ruled that, without a court order, President Trump's administration would move quickly to shut down the agency that Congress created in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis.",
      "\"If the defendants are not enjoined, they will eliminate the agency before the Court has the opportunity to decide whether the law permits them to do it, and as the defendants' own witness warned, the harm will be irreparable,\" Berman Jackson said in her order.",
      "During a March 10 hearing, Jackson heard testimony about the chaos that erupted inside the agency after government employees were ordered to stop working last month. The bureau's chief operating officer, Adam Martinez, said the agency was in \"wind-down mode\" after Trump fired its previous director, Rohit Chopra, on Feb. 1.",
      "Trump installed a temporary replacement who ordered the immediate suspension of all agency operations, cancelled $100 million in contracts and fired 70 employees.",
      "Martinez said the agency's current leaders have adopted a more methodical approach than they initially did last month, when representatives of Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency arrived at its Washington headquarters.",
      "CFPB is responsible for protecting consumers from financial fraud and deceptive practices. It processes consumer complaints and examines banks to protect student loan borrowers.",
      "The National Treasury Employees Union, which represents more than 1,000 workers at the bureau, sued on Feb. 9 to block mass firings. Plaintiffs' attorneys argue that the administration doesn't have the constitutional authority to eliminate an agency that Congress created by statute.",
      "\"The defendants' unlawful action will have immediate consequences for the Americans that the CFPB was designed by Congress to protect,\"\u00a0the lawyers wrote.",
      "Government lawyers have said the plaintiffs are seeking to impermissibly place the CFPB in a \"judicially managed receivership,\" with the court overseeing its day-to-day operations.",
      "Jackson started her 112-page ruling by quoting Mr. Trump and his allies' own words about the bureau. Trump's billionaire adviser, Elon Musk, posted \"CFPB RIP\" on X, his social media platform, and added an emoji of a tombstone. White House budget director Russell Vought said it has been \"a woke and weaponized agency against disfavored industries and individuals for a long time.\" Mr. Trump called it \"a very important thing to get rid of.\"",
      "Among the plaintiffs was 83-year-old Eva Steege, a Lutheran pastor in hospice care who had been working with CFPB to resolve her student loan debt before her death. The agency found she qualified for loan forgiveness and a $15,000 refund of overpayments, but the stop-work order went into effect before she could have a follow-up meeting and the official she was working with was fired.",
      "\"Steege's fear of leaving her surviving family members saddled with her student loan debt came to pass on March 15, when she died,\" the judge wrote.",

      "Visits from Canada to the U.S. account for the sharpest projected decline in travel this year, with analysts pointing to President Trump's plan to slap tariffs on Canadian imports as causing some Canadians to hold off on traveling to the U.S.",
      "\"This sharp drop suggests that travellers are holding off on making reservations, likely due to ongoing uncertainty surrounding the broader trade dispute,\" the report states.",
      "Mr. Trump has delayed 25% tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports until April 2, but economists say the import duties could have detrimental effects on their economies given their deep reliance on the U.S. The drop in airline demand reflects \"a degradation of travel demand between the two countries, especially coming from the Canadian side,\" Scott Keyes, founder of Going.com, a flight deals website, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "As Mr. Trump promotes an \"America First\" trade policy, Canadians are similarly focusing on spending their dollars domestically, following former Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's please last month for residents to \"choose Canada,\" former Canadian Member of Parliament Dr. Ruby Dhalla told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"Instead of traveling to the U.S., we are seeing families travel visiting cities, towns and villages and exploring Canada's history and heritage,\" Dhalla said.",

      "Slashing routes to the U.S.",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration's 25% tariffs on vehicles and auto parts imported into the U.S. could lead to sticker shock for American consumers, including for those buying cars manufactured domestically, analysts say.",
      "Few vehicle manufacturers will be spared by the fresh levies, which are aimed at revitalizing domestic automobile manufacturing. Industry analysts say the tax will surely raise car prices in the U.S. and squeeze some would-be car buyers out of the market.",
      "Some manufacturers could move a share of production to the U.S., but it would come \"at the expense of reduced competition, higher prices, and significantly lower production in the U.S.'s main trading partners,\" Oxford Economics analyst Abby Stamp said in a research note.",
      "The automobile supply chain is highly complex and intertwined with the economies of Mexico and Canada, from which American brands source finished vehicles and parts. Mr. Trump's tariff on passenger cars and light trucks imported into the U.S. will go into effect April 3, according to the executive order, and a 25% tariff on auto parts shipped from foreign countries goes into effect \"no later than May 3.\"",
      "While all car manufacturers will be impacted by the new tariffs, according to analysts, some will be hit much harder than others.",
      "Tesla",
      "Tesla CEO Elon Musk, a close ally of Mr. Trump, posted on X Wednesday that the new tariffs would affect the company's American-made electric vehicles.",
      "\"Important to note that Tesla is NOT unscathed here. The tariff impact on Tesla is still significant,\" Musk wrote on X Wednesday. \"To be clear, this will affect the price of parts in Tesla cars that come from other countries. The cost impact is not trivial,\" he wrote in a later post.",
      "That said, Tesla is expected to be among the automakers that are least affected by the tariffs, given that its vehicles are made in the U.S., and most of their parts are sourced domestically, too. The EV brand does, however, rely on China for some batteries, \"so the tariffs will have an impact,\" Art Wheaton, a transportation industry expert and director of labor studies at Cornell's School of Industrial and Labor Relations, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Tesla rival Rivian could also be spared for similar reasons, according to UBS.",
      "\"We believe TSLA and RIVN could fare better as 100% of their production is in the U.S. (though not all components),\" UBS analysts said in a research note.",
      "General Motors",
      "General Motors, one of the so-called Big Three automakers, along with Stellantis and Ford, is widely expected to be the most exposed to the forthcoming auto tariffs. Headquartered in Detroit, the U.S. car company makes just 45% of vehicles it sells to U.S. customers domestically, leaving 55% of its lineup exposed to tariffs, according to Cox Automotive.",
      "GM, which makes Chevrolet, Buick, GMC and Cadillac vehicles, is heavily invested in Mexico and Canada, where it builds heavy-duty vehicles, according to Cornell's Wheaton.",
      "Stellantis",
      "Stellantis, whose brands include Jeep, Chrysler, Dodge and Ram, among others, is similarly susceptible to rising costs from the tariffs, as it makes between 73%-75% of vehicles for sale in the U.S. stateside, according to Cox Automotive.",
      "That means, a $80,000 RAM truck from Stellantis could cost $100,000 once it reaches the U.S., under the new policy.",
      "\"The impact is quite large,\" Wheaton said.",
      "Ford",
      "Ford is among the car companies better positioned to weather the tariffs, according to Cox Automotive analyst Erin Keating, as 80% of its vehicles are manufactured in the U.S. and therefore would not be subject to the 25% tariff on passenger cars. However, any imported parts used in Ford's U.S.-manufactured vehicles could be tariffed at 25%.",
      "Ford vehicles made in the U.S. include the F-150 pickup truck lineup. Some of its smaller vehicles, including the Maverick pickup truck and Bronco Sport SUV are made in Mexico and \"will take a hit,\" said Wheaton.",
      "While domestic automakers will face increased costs, it's unclear how much of the tax they'll pass along to consumers. The\u00a0Wall Street Journal,\u00a0reported that Mr. Trump warned the CEOs of the Big Three not to raise car prices because of tariffs, according to people familiar with the matter.",
      "Toyota and Honda",
      "Japanese automakers Toyota and Honda export a large number of vehicles and auto parts from Japan to the U.S., which represents a sizable market for the companies. Both also operate big plants in Canada, Wheaten noted, leaving them particularly vulnerable to added costs from new tariffs.",
      "The same goes for South Korean automakers Hyundai and Kia.",
      "BMW and Volkswagen",
      "German automakers, including BMW and Volkswagen, which makes Audi vehicles, both operate big plants in Mexico.",
      "The May 3 auto-parts tariff will likely apply to engines and transmission systems, and hit the company \"heavily,\" according to Wheaton.",
      "BMW, for instance, makes a lot of engines in Germany, which it then ships to South Carolina, where the automaker manufactures SUVs. The company could be hit \"heavily,\" by the auto-parts tariffs, according to Wheaton.",
      "Mercedes-Benz operates similarly, sending engines and transmission from Germany to a plant in Alabama, where the company manufactures SUVs. The 25% auto tariffs would also likely apply to fully assembled Mercedes vehicles shipped to the U.S.",
      "\"I don't think any brands will be spared, because none are 100% in the U.S.,\" Wheaton said. \"They all have products from Canada, Mexico or elsewhere. And even Tesla, which is the most American, still has non-U.S. content in their vehicles.\"",
      "Tariffs could spark affordability issues",
      "Even vehicles whose parts aren't subject to tariffs and that are assembled in the U.S. could face price hikes, as automakers attempt to spread new costs out across their lineups. While Cox Automotive expects price hikes of between 15%-20% on vehicles that are caught in the tariffs' crosshairs, those that are exempt could still go up by about 5%, Keating noted.",
      "The auto tariffs could ignite new affordability challenges for consumers by moving lower-cost vehicles closer to, or in some cases over the $30,000 threshold.",
      "Take, for example, a Hyundai Venue, a subcompact crossover SUV, with an average current list price of $24,000. Under Mr. Trump's auto tariffs, that price could rise to about $28,500, adding more than $4,000 to an affordable design.",
      "\"Sub- $30,000 compact SUVs and crossovers that are the most popular are almost all foreign-made, with the exception of one or two,\" Keating said. \"So they'd all be subjected to the 25% tariffs.\"",
      "At the other end of the economic spectrum, luxury Italian car maker Ferrari on Thursday said it would hike prices on certain car models by 10% after April 1, citing Mr. Trump's auto tariffs. The vehicles subject to price increase include the Ferrari 296, SF90 and Roma, which already retail for hundreds of thousands of dollars each.",

    "story": [
      "Stocks are taking a battering on Friday amid growing concerns on Wall Street about the impact of President Trump's tariff regime as well as hotter-than-expected price data, sparking worries that the Federal Reserve is far from declaring victory on inflation.",
      "The Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled 758 points, or 1.8%, to 41,541.09 in Friday afternoon trading, while the broad-based S&P 500 shed 2%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index skidded 2.8%.",
      "Friday's stock market rout comes after Wall Street has already suffered a pummeling this year, with the S&P 500 down 9% from its most recent February high.",
      "Mr. Trump on Wednesday said he is imposing a\u00a025% tariff on all vehicles\u00a0and auto parts imported into the U.S., a move that is expected to add thousands of dollars to the cost of many vehicles. He also plans to announce more tariffs on April 2. Because tariffs are import taxes that companies largely pass onto consumers, many economists are forecasting an uptick in inflation later this year.",
      "At the same time, new economic data released on Friday shows that core inflation heated up last month, posing a challenge to the Federal Reserve's goal of driving inflation down to a 2% annual rate.",
      "\"The recent U.S. stock market correction appears to have been partially triggered by investors realising that Trump may follow through with his tariff threats and that this will hurt the U.S. economy,\" said Oxford Economics lead economist Daniel Harenberg and senior economist Kiki Sondh in a Friday report. \"Similarly, consumer sentiment has weakened due to tariff-induced inflation fears.\"",
      "The economy has so far been holding up relatively well, but if it were to weaken while inflation stays high, it would produce a worst-case scenario called \"stagflation,\" which policymakers in Washington have few good tools to fix.",
      "A report on Friday morning showed that U.S. consumers, including Republicans, Independents and Democrats, getting more pessimistic about their future finances. Two out of three consumers surveyed by the University of Michigan expect unemployment to worsen in the year ahead. That's the the highest reading since 2009, and it raises worries about a job market that's been the linchpin keeping the U.S. economy solid.",
      "At the same time, recent CBS News polling shows that Americans have become more dour in their economic outlooks, with relatively more consumers bracing for a slowdown or\u00a0recession\u00a0over the next year.",
      "Automaker stocks",

      "On Wall Street, Ford Motor fell 2.6%, and General Motors sank 1.7%. Even U.S. automakers selling vehicles in the country can feel the pain of such tariffs because their supply chains are spread throughout North America. Trump says he wants more manufacturing to take place within the United States.",
      "The rout also hit shares outside the auto industry, with investors concerned that Mr. Trump's trade war may cause U.S. households and businesses to freeze their spending. Even if the tariffs end up being less painful than feared, all the uncertainty may filter into changed behaviors that hurt the economy.",
      "Leading the market lower on Friday was Lululemon Athletica, which dropped 15%. Even though the seller of athletic apparel reported a stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected, it warned that its revenue growth may slow this upcoming year as consumers grow more cautious.",
      "\"Consumers are spending less due to increased concerns about inflation and the economy,\" said CEO Calvin McDonald.",
      "Lululemon also said tariffs and shifting foreign-currency values may account for about half of its expected drop in a key measure of performance: how much profit it can squeeze out of each $1 of revenue.",
      "Oxford Industries, the company behind the Tommy Bahama and Lilly Pulitzer brands, likewise reported stronger results for the latest quarter than expected but still saw its stock fall 3.1%. CEO Tom Chubb said it saw a \"deterioration in consumer sentiment that also weighed on demand\" beginning in January, which accelerated into February.",

    "summary": "Here's what to know about tariffs ahead of President Trump's plans to announce new import duties on April 2.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is planning to impose a round of fresh tariffs on April 2, a day President Trump has dubbed \"liberation day.\" The announcement is viewed by economists as the culmination of his \"America First Trade Policy,\" an\u00a0executive order he signed on his first day in office aimed at revitalizing U.S. manufacturing.",
      "Mr. Trump has referred to his April 2 tariff announcement as \"the big one,\" suggesting that the plans may be more far reaching than the import levies he's already unleashed on goods from other nations, such as his March 26 declaration of 25% tariffs on vehicles and auto parts imported into the\u00a0U.S.",
      "\"For DECADES we have been ripped off and abused by every nation in the World, both friend and foe. Now it is finally time for the Good Ol' USA to get some of that MONEY, and RESPECT, BACK. GOD BLESS AMERICA!!!\" Trump said about his April 2 plans in a post\u00a0earlier this month on Truth Social.",
      "On April 2, Mr. Trump is expected to announce his administration's plans for so-called reciprocal tariffs, which he deems necessary to erase trade imbalances with nations that export more goods to the U.S. than they import from America. But the addition of broad-based tariffs to a host of imports is likely to heat up a global trade war that could, at least in the short term, boost prices for U.S. consumers and juice inflation.",
      "\"Tariffs are a tax on imported goods, and research shows that that majority gets passed along to consumers,\" Colin Grabow, associate director of the Herbert A. Stiefel Center for trade policy studies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Ultimately, the Trump administration's goal is to increase prices on imports to the point where it's economically favorable for companies to relocate their manufacturing to the U.S., he noted.",
      "\"If prices don't go up, it doesn't deter imports, and therefore there is no reason to set up shop in the U.S.,\" Grabow explained. \"Part of the logic is premised on prices going up, otherwise they are not going to accomplish their goal.\"",
      "Economists say that Mr. Trump's tariff agenda, including the uncertainty surrounding it, could drag down U.S. GDP by depressing financial markets and consumer sentiment.",
      "\"The main channel from trade policy uncertainty to GDP is via business investment. Under higher trade policy uncertainty, future revenue streams of an investment become more uncertain, raising the option value of delaying investment decisions until the situation is clearer,\" Oxford Economics analysts said in a research note.",
      "What tariffs will Trump announce April 2?",
      "Mr. Trump teased his April 2 announcement on Wednesday when he announced his new 25% tariffs on foreign-made cars and auto parts. \"That's Liberation Day, that's gonna be on the 2nd, and that's gonna be reciprocal, and I think people will be impressed,\" the president said.",
      "Reciprocal tariffs are designed to match the import duties placed on U.S. goods and services by other nations, as well as compensate for other trade barriers, according to the Yale Budget Lab, a non-partisan public policy think tank. According to a White House memo from Feb. 13, the U.S. faces additional trade barriers aside from tariffs such as regulatory requirements that can make it more difficult for American exports to reach other nations.",
      "While the size and scope of the reciprocal tariffs that Mr. Trump plans to announce are unknown, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent last week said the administration's reciprocal tariffs would target countries with the biggest trade surpluses, as well as those which have imposed the highest tariffs plus non-tariff trade barriers on U.S. goods.",
      "Multiple nations run large annual trade surpluses with the U.S., including Germany, Ireland and Italy in the European Union, as well as Vietnam, Japan and Taiwan. The U.S. also has a large trade deficit with China, although Mr. Trump has already imposed new tariffs on that nation.",
      "\"It'll be in many cases less than the tariff that they've been charging us for decades ... I think we're trying to keep it somewhat conservative,\" Mr. Trump said on March 26.",
      "Mr. Trump added that he'll introduce a reciprocal tariff policy on \"all countries,\" which he said would be \"very lenient.\"",
      "Meanwhile, additional tariffs are also slated to go into effect on April 2, with Mr. Trump's one-month delay on 25% tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports set to expire that day. The 25% auto tariff announced by the president on March 26 is also scheduled to take effect on April 2.",
      "What are reciprocal tariffs?",
      "Reciprocal tariffs enacted by the U.S. would match foreign nations' levies and other trade policies on American goods.",
      "A reciprocal tariff policy would include calculating a country-specific number that the Trump administration deems representative of all trade barriers. But import restrictions other than tariffs, such as regulatory requirements, could be hard to quantify, economists say.",
      "\"There are a lot of intangibles, like testing regulations for different products in countries, or perceived openness to business with American companies,\" Simon Macadam, deputy chief global economist at Capital Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"These are things you can't easily put a number on.\"",
      "Because of this complexity, some experts expect Trump's reciprocal tariffs could be more limited in scope, and might not be truly \"reciprocal\" because they may not exactly match other countries' levies.",
      "\"We shouldn't be surprised if some of the stuff is rolled back, or not as sweeping as maybe originally talked about, because logistically, from a practical perspective, running the calculations and coming up with a number is extremely time consuming,\" Grabow of the Cato Institute said.",
      "Wilbur Ross, who served as the U.S. Secretary of Commerce during the first Trump administration, agreed that a truly reciprocal tariff policy would be \"very complicated to get to work.\"",
      "\"If you were literally going to be reciprocal, you would put the same tariff on a product that comes into the U.S. as that country charges on products from the U.S.,\" he said. \"But the problem is you'd be charging a different tariff on the same item from different countries.\"",
      "That would create loopholes for exporters to ship products through lower-tariffed countries to the U.S., Ross added. \"It would make it easy for people to game the system,\" he said.",
      "What does Trump want to achieve?",
      "Through his \"Fair and Reciprocal Plan\" on trade, Mr. Trump is aiming to bring about three outcomes: Boost U.S. manufacturing jobs; close the $1.2 trillion U.S. trade deficit; and gain leverage over U.S. trade partners.",
      "But experts say that trade barriers such as tariffs may not be enough to revitalize U.S. manufacturing jobs, which have fallen sharply over the last few decades. Fewer than 13 million people are employed in manufacturing today, down from a peak of 19.6 million in 1979,\u00a0according to federal data.",
      "\"To a large extent, and particularly in low- and medium-tech industries, the economics of production will not be significantly altered by a 10-20% tariff,\" Macadam said. \"When labor costs in hubs like Mexico are one-fifth of what they are in the U.S., in order to induce companies to seriously relocate a lot of production back to the U.S. a 20% tariff isn't going to cut it.\"",
      "There's also the unknown of how long any new tariffs announced by Mr. Trump will remain in place. Such uncertainty could deter American or foreign businesses from investing heavily in re-shoring manufacturing to the U.S.",
      "\"Even if for some companies it gets to the point where it seems to make financial sense to move back to the U.S., there's the question of, 'Are these tariffs actually going to last a long time?'\" Macadam said. \"If you think the tariff is going to be there forever, then yeah, absolutely relocate. But if it's reversed or rates are lowered, then it would have been silly to relocate.\"",
      "What will tariffs mean for consumers?",
      "Consumers typically pay the price for tariffs, as companies have said they plan on passing off much of the costs to their customers.",
      "As a result, a round of fresh tariffs could boost inflation, economists say. According to an analysis by Oxford Economics, if the effective tariff rate on imports into the U.S. rises from their 2024 level of 2.5% to 10% in April, which is what Oxford Economics expects, prices in aggregate would rise by half a percentage point.",
      "\"Inflation was on trend to fall \u2014 now we expect it to rise,\" Michael Pearce, senior U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, told CBS MoneyWatch.",

      "\"I just got a call from the president of the United States on my phone that he signed a full and unconditional pardon of innocence,\" Milton said in an Instagram video message posted Thursday. \"I am free.\"",
      "In December 2023, Milton was sentenced to four years in prison after he was convicted of exaggerating claims about his electric vehicle company's production of zero-emission 18-wheel trucks, which prosecutors claimed caused investors to lose hundreds of thousands of dollars. Milton's conviction came after a short seller called Hindenburg Research alleged in 2020 that the EV maker had misrepresented its technology.",
      "In his video, Milton said, \"The greatest comeback story in America is about to happen.\"",
      "Nikola filed\u00a0for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in February, a move that came months after it warned it could likely run out of cash in early 2025. Once valued at around $30 billion, exceeding the market capitalization of Ford Motor Co., the EV maker was a rising Wall Street star before it became embroiled in scandal.",
      "Last month, Nikola said it plans to to continue limited service and support operations for vehicles on the road, including fueling operations through the end of March, subject to court approval. The company said that it would need to raise more funding to support those types of activities after that time.",
      "In the video, Milton didn't disclose whether he had plans for Nikola or his involvement in the EV industry.",
      "\"I get to be with my wife now, I get to be with my family,\" Milton said. \"It is done, it is over.\"",

An optional add-on to potentially increase nonjackpot prizes for an additional dollar and a $3 feature for two plays for the jackpot will be discontinued.",
      "In exchange for the higher price, the game boasts better odds for winning. While the odds for winning any prize will improve from 1 in 24 to 1 in 23, the chances of winning the big prize will still be astronomical: going from 1 in 302,575,350 to 1 in 290,472,336.

      "\"This will continue to spur growth like you haven't seen before,\" Mr. Trump said from the Oval Office Wednesday afternoon. \"We'll effectively be charging a 25% tariff. But if you build your car in the United States, there is no tariff.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said the new auto tariffs will take effect on April 2 and that the U.S. would start collecting the duties the following day. The president added he believes the new import duty could raise between $600 billion and $1 trillion in revenue for the U.S. over the next two years.",
      "\"This number will be used to reduce debt greatly,\" Mr. Trump said. \"Basically I view it as reducing taxes and reducing debt.\"",
      "White House staff secretary Will Scharf, who stood next to Mr. Trump during the announcement, offered a more conservative estimate of how much the new auto tariffs would raise, predicting roughly $100 billion in new revenue.",
      "Mr. Trump also reiterated his goal of making interest paid on auto loans tax deductible, while noting that such a deduction would apply only to cars made in the U.S.",
      "Tax deductions are generally only employed by high-income Americans because most taxpayers take the standard deduction, which means tax-deductible auto loans wouldn't impact low- or middle-income households.",
      "Meanwhile, car prices are \"likely to rise significantly\" for consumers, according to Rella Suskin, equity analyst at Morningstar in a Thursday research note. Suskin added, \"Domestically produced vehicles are expected to gain market share, but very few, even from US-based manufacturers, are made with 100% U.S. content.\"",
      "Automaker shares take a hit",
      "The latest salvo of tariffs comes after Mr. Trump earlier this month gave a one-month exemption to U.S. automakers from the round of import duties that took effect on March 4.",
      "Because tariffs are taxes on imports that are largely passed onto U.S. consumers, they can cause households to cut back on spending and dampen economic growth, according to experts.",
      "Shares of the Big Three U.S. automakers \u2014 Ford, General Motors and Stellantis \u2014 all sank after Mr. Trump announced the new tariffs. In Thursday morning trading, Ford's shares slipped 38 cents, or 3.7% to $9.92, while GM tumbled 7.3%. Stellantis shed 2.6%.",
      "Tesla shares, which have slumped this year because of disappointing sales and\u00a0consumer unhappiness\u00a0over CEO Elon Musk's involvement with the Trump administration, rose $7.13, or 2.6%, to $279.19. Tesla manufactures its vehicles within the U.S., although Musk said on social media that the electric vehicle maker will still feel an impact. Some Tesla parts are imported from other countries.",
      "\"Important to note that Tesla is NOT unscathed here. The tariff impact on Tesla is still significant,\" Musk wrote on X.",
      "In a statement Wednesday night, Matt Blunt, president of the American Automotive Policy Council, a U.S. trade group that represents the Big Three, said that \"U.S. Automakers are committed to President Trump's vision of increasing automotive production and jobs in the U.S. and will continue to work with the Administration on durable policies that help Americans.\"",

      "Tesla warns that Trump's trade war could hurt U.S. automakers",
      "Blunt added, \"In particular, it is critical that tariffs are implemented in a way that avoids raising prices for consumers and that preserves the competitiveness of the integrated North American automotive sector that has been a key success of the President's USMCA agreement.\"",
      "When reached for comment, Stellantis directed CBS News to the AAPC's statement.",
      "Mr. Trump has long said that tariffs on auto imports would be a\u00a0defining policy\u00a0of his presidency, betting that the costs created by the taxes would lead both American and foreign automakers to relocate production to U.S. soil.",
      "Automakers with U.S. plants still depend on Canada, Mexico and other nations for parts and finished vehicles. Because booting up manufacturing facilities would take time, in the medium term domestic auto prices would likely increase and car sales decline, experts say.",
      "Car prices could jump",
      "One analysis of Mr. Trump's tariffs estimated that auto prices could rise as much as\u00a0$12,200 for some models\u00a0due to the new import duties, according to a report from Anderson Economic Group, a Michigan-based economic consultancy.",
      "\"In the long-run, this could boost domestic investment and production. In the short-run, however, it will be inflationary and, assuming that domestic producers respond by substantially increasing their own prices, could make new vehicles something of a luxury item,\" Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist with Capital Economics, said in a report.",
      "Targeting imported cars also could strain ties with key trading U.S. partners including Canada, Japan, Mexico and South Korea, as well as Europe.",
      "\"I deeply regret the U.S. decision to impose tariffs on EU automotive exports,\" Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, said in a social media post. \"Tariffs are taxes \u2014 bad for businesses, worse for consumers in the U.S. and the EU. The EU will continue to seek negotiated solutions, while safeguarding its economic interests.\"",
      "About 50% of cars sold in the U.S. are manufactured within the country. Among imports, about half come from Mexico and Canada, with Japan, South Korea and Germany, also major suppliers.",
      "Other groups expressed support for the new auto tariffs.",
      "\"Auto production is the bedrock of a nation's manufacturing ecosystem,\" Scott Paul, president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing, an industry trade group, said in a statement posted social media. \"We've seen it eroded in the U.S. over the past four decades first by Asian imports then by NAFTA. A 25% tariff on auto imports isn't the only way to spur more auto plants here, but it is in my view necessary.\"",
      "Shawn Fain, president of United Auto Workers, said the tariffs could bolster job growth in the U.S. \"With these tariffs, thousands of good-paying blue-collar auto jobs could be brought back to working-class communities across the United States within a matter of months, simply by adding additional shifts or lines in a number of underutilized auto plants,\" he said.",

    "published": "Thu, 27 Mar 2025 09:53:55 -0400",
    "summary": "Starting today, the Social Security Administration will again take 100% of a beneficiary's check to recoup overpayments. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "Some Social Security recipients could soon find themselves in the crosshairs of a policy that advocates for seniors say could cause financial hardship for many older Americans.",
      "Starting today, the Social Security Administration will begin clawing back overpayments from the retirement program by taking 100% of a beneficiary's monthly check until the money is repaid, up from the prior rate of 10%. The policy will impact new cases of overpayments starting on March 27. The benefits withholding rate for people who were overpaid before that date will remain at 10%.",
      "The agency's 100% recovery rate was announced earlier this month by SSA Acting Commissioner Lee Dudek, who has worked with Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, to cut costs at the agency by firing thousands of workers and closing field offices.",
      "Dudek has\u00a0described the 100% clawback rate as part of the agency's responsibility to recover overpaid funds. But advocates for older Americans say the policy will cause financial distress for many people, especially those who rely on the program for all or most of their income.",
      "\"If an overpayment is being made, that means the Social Security Administration is withholding 100% of their payment for however long it takes to repay the agency \u2014 and they are without money to pay for food\" or other living expenses, Dan Adcock, director of government relations and policy for the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, an advocacy group, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The clawback policy could prove especially hard on the 40% of Social Security beneficiaries who rely on the program for 90% of more of their income, he added.",
      "In many cases, Social Security overpayments are the fault of agency, with a\u00a02022 report\u00a0by its inspector general finding that about 73,000 overpayments that year were due to a lack of \"effective controls over benefit-computation accuracy.\"",
      "Under the Biden administration, the Social Security Administration in 2024\u00a0capped the clawback rate at 10%, stepping back from its prior 100% level following reports that the higher rate had pushed some Americans into financial hardship and even\u00a0homelessness.",
      "\"The thing is, this administration has said, 'We're going back to the old way, we're getting 100% of the money back going forward,'\" CBS News business analyst Jill Schlesinger told CBS News.",
      "Can you avoid a Social Security overpayment?",
      "In some cases, overpayments are due to miscalculations on the part of the Social Security Administration, or because the agency doesn't update beneficiaries' records in a timely way. That can make it difficult for seniors to know if they're getting paid too much.",
      "But it's also important for beneficiaries to update the SSA with their latest information, such as increases in their income that can lead to overpayments. The importance of updating the agency about such changes may not be fully appreciated by some beneficiaries because of the complexity of the Social Security system, the agency's inspector general said in a 2024 report.",
      "\"We urge beneficiaries to keep a close eye on their benefits going forward,\" said Shannon Benton, executive director of The Senior Citizens League, an advocacy group for older Americans. \"If they notice any unscheduled changes to their benefits, they should contact Social Security immediately.\"",
      "It's important to keep records of your payments and flag any issues, such as if your check is larger than it previously was, Schlesinger said. \"Unfortunately the onus is on us\" to correct the record, she added.",
      "DOGE cuts, long waits",
      "Because of DOGE's job cuts at the Social Security Administration and the closure of agency field offices, it's recently become more difficult for seniors and other beneficiaries to contact the agency to report changes or ask for help, Adcock said.",
      "Those issues arose in a Tuesday Senate confirmation hearing for President Trump's nominee for Social Security commissioner, Frank Bisignano, who said that only about 46% of phone calls to the agency are answered \"because people get discouraged and hang up\" due to long wait times.",
      "Sen. Steve Daines, a Republican from Montana, told Bisignano that one of his staffers this week called the agency's 800 number to assess the level of customer service, but was disconnected three times, once after being on hold for an hour.",
      "\"We've got a lot of work to do to serve the taxpayers in this country,\" Daines said.",
      "Improvements to Social Security?",
      "In the hearing, Bisignano also said he wants to reduce what the agency calls \"improper payments,\" which include both overpayments and underpayments to beneficiaries. Currently, about 1% of Social Security's annual payments are improper, with Bisignano saying he believes that rate should be \"five decimal points to the right.\"",
      "Yet enhancing the accuracy of benefits will likely take a large investment in Social Security because it would require changes in systems, technology and other resources, Benton said.",
      "\"While improvements are possible, achieving such a low error rate is challenging due to the complexity of Social Security benefits and past challenges with fraud and reporting errors,\" she said. \"Some progress is likely and will probably be incremental, but a significant reduction over the next four years will be extremely challenging.\"",
      "In the meantime, seniors and other Social Security recipients should watch their benefits closely and report changes in their income to the agency. And if people receives a beneficiary letter from the agency, they can also request a waiver, which can be made through\u00a0SSA form 632.",
      "\"While we believe that overpayments should be recouped, we believe it's essential that beneficiaries have time to plan, and not face undue pressure from an almost immediate 100% reduction in benefits,\" Benton said.",

The U.S. is scheduled to announce a raft of tariffs on April 2, including 25% duties on imports from Mexico and Canada, along with even more sweeping matching levies on a number of U.S. trading partners.",
      "\"The fact of the matter is that Trump remains firmly wedded to a Tariff First policy, his pain threshold is high and there are no voices around him counseling restraint or prudence,\" Adam Crisafulli, head of investment advisory firm Vital Knowledge, said Wednesday in a note to investors.",

They also asked him point blank if he'd block DOGE workers from accessing Americans' personally identifiable information.",
      "Sen. Ron Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon, pointed to a March 24 statement from a former senior SSA employee who claims that Bisignano has already been coordinating with DOGE despite not yet being confirmed as commissioner. The statement also alleges that Bisignano discussed hiring DOGE employees with SSA personnel.",

      "The Social Security Administration delivers more than $1.6 trillion annually in benefits to 70 million seniors, disabled people and children, with the monthly benefit checks providing a major source of retirement income to many older Americans. At the same time, Social Security is facing a potential financial crunch, with the program set to cut benefits starting in 2035 because its spending is outpacing income.",
      "Here's what Bisignano said during the hearing.",
      "Who is Frank Bisignano?",
      "Bisignano has served as the chief executive of Fiserv, a financial technology company, since July 2020. Under his leadership, Fiserv's stock price has more than doubled, while the company reported revenue of $20.5 billion for the year ended Dec. 31 2024, up from roughly $15 billion in 2020.",
      "Prior to serving as CEO of Fiserv, he was the chairman and CEO of First Data Corp., and oversaw the merger of First Data and Fiserv in 2019. Earlier in his career, Bisignano worked as co-chief operating officer of JPMorgan Chase & Co., and had also previously held senior positions at Citigroup.",
      "What does Bisignano say about Social Security?",
      "In an interview with CNBC in February, Bisignano said he views Social Security as both a technology and services organization, while pledging not to make any changes that affect the level of benefits.",
      "\"The objective isn't to touch benefits,\" Bisignano told CNBC. \"The objective is there is going to be fraud, waste and abuse in there,\" adding that he views himself as \"fundamentally a DOGE person.\"",
      "During Tuesday's hearing, the executive also said he plans to use artificial intelligence to identify and weed out fraud, waste or abuse within the system. He repeatedly referred to the current 1% payments error rate, which he said he believes is \"five decimal places too high.\" He added that he plans to \"focus on what we need to do to drive the 1% error rate down.\"",
      "Bisignano said part of that effort will start with what he described as an unsatisfied workforce at the agency.",
      "\"My objective is to come in and motivate the workforce we have ... to be able to get our job right the first time for the American public,\" Bisignano said in response to questioning.",
      "Mr. Trump and Musk have claimed on social media and in press briefings that people who are well over 100 years old are improperly and routinely drawing benefits from Social Security, a claim that has been refuted by the acting Social Security Administration commissioner.",
      "The program also automatically stops payments to people who are older than 115 years old, an agency rule that has been in effect since September 2015.",
      "On protecting Americans' data",
      "A key concern among some Social Security recipients and lawmakers is the potential exposure of millions of Americans' personal data after DOGE employees accessed the agency's systems. Bisignano claimed he is committed to protecting that data.",
      "When Sen. Wyden asked Bisignano if he would \"lock DOGE out of databases\" that workers have accessed, the nominee said that personally identifiable information \"will not be exposed.\"",
      "\"I am going to do whatever is required to protect the information,\" he said.",
      "On privatization and agency cuts",
      "Bisignano repeatedly said he had not thought about privatizing the agency, responding to a suggestion from Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat from Rhode Island, that the Trump administration's aim is to discredit the system and then send in \"tech bros and private equity folks\" to \"save\" it.",
      "Bisignano did not explicitly commit to opposing such a scheme, but rather answered that \"my job is to ensure claims are processed in the manner they should be.\"",
      "\"I've only been given one order, which is to run the agency in the right fashion,\" Mr. Bisignano said.",
      "Regarding customer service enhancements, Bisignano stressed the importance of meeting beneficiaries where they are, such as by providing customer service via phone as well as in person and online. He also touted his company's experience handling 400 million phone calls per year, compared to the estimated 80 million calls that SSA fields annually.",

      "\"We write regarding our concerns about the Trump Administration's ongoing efforts \u2014 in conjunction with Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) \u2014 to hollow out the Social Security Administration (SSA) and deprive Americans of Social Security benefits they earned and need,\" the lawmakers wrote. \"In recent days, SSA officials have intensified their efforts to undermine the program, imposing burdensome administrative requirements on beneficiaries while simultaneously cutting thousands of agency jobs and closing dozens of Social Security offices.\"",
      "On the campaign trail in 2024, Mr. Trump\u00a0promised not to touch\u00a0the Social Security program, which provides monthly financial payments to\u00a0roughly\u00a01 in 5 Americans.",
      "Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, and Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon, also want Bisignano to vow not to privatize any part of Social Security, a move they say would benefit private-sector players like Fiserv.",

      "By contrast, Senate Finance Committee Chairman Mike Crapo and an Idaho Republican, said in a March\u00a0statement\u00a0that Bisignano's private-sector experience \"make him exceptionally qualified for the task ahead.\"",
      "In his Senate confirmation hearing on Tuesday, Bisignano repeatedly said he hasn't thought about privatizing the agency, responding to a suggestion from Sen.

      "What do advocates for seniors have to say?",
      "Some advocacy groups that represent older Americans also question if Bisignano is the right person to lead the SSA.",
      "\"Mr. Bisignano's experience in the private sector could bring some fresh ideas to the SSA.

The reading was short of analysts expectations for a reading of 94.5, according to a survey by FactSet.",
      "The consumer confidence index measures both Americans' assessment of current economic conditions and their outlook for the next six months. The business group found that the measure of Americans' short-term expectations for income, business and the job market fell 9.6 points to 65.2. That's the lowest reading in 12 years and well below the threshold of 80, which the Conference Board says can signal a potential recession in the near future.",
      "The proportion of U.S. consumers anticipating a recession remains at a nine-month high, the board reported.",
      "\"Consumer confidence has come under a microscope in recent months as investors worry about retail sales and consumer spending \u2014 the engine of the U.S. economy,\" Bret Kenwell, U.S. investment analyst at eToro, said in an email. \"If consumer confidence continues to sag, it stands to reason that consumer spending, which accounts for roughly two-thirds of U.S. GDP, could also come under pressure.\"",
      "Consumer optimism has \"largely vanished\"",
      "\"Consumers' optimism about future income \u2014 which had held up quite strongly in the past few months \u2014 largely vanished, suggesting worries about the economy and labor market have started to spread into consumers' assessments of their personal situations,\" Stephanie Guichard, senior economist at The Conference Board, said in a statement.",
      "\"Like the Michigan survey results, this index says that consumers are rattled,\" added Carl Weinburg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics, referring to the University of Michigan's Survey of Consumers, which earlier this month showed that consumer sentiment had fallen to a two-year low. \"Their current situation is not so bad, but a growing do not feel so good about the future,\" he added.",
      "The Trump administration has largely played down the souring mood among Americans, saying it doesn't necessarily reflect what's happening in the actual economy. This argument is similar to what officials in former President Biden's administration said as high inflation dented consumer confidence without undermining growth.",
      "\"I just don't think that there's been a very strong correlation between the confidence data and actual consumer spending in recent years,\" Stephen Miran, chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, told CNBC on Tuesday. \"You go out in the street, people are going about their lives, you know, they're getting their paychecks, they're spending their paychecks, the economy is marching on ahead.\"",
      "Yet some of the nation's biggest retailers, who have noted a shift in consumer behavior, are telling a different story.",
      "Walmart and others lower profit forecasts",
      "Walmart has thrived with Americans trying to offset higher prices by seeking bargains. Late last month, however, the nation's largest retailer slashed its profit forecast for this year. Its sales outlook was also conservative and the company does not include the potential impact of tariffs in its expectations for 2025.",
      "Target's sales and profit slipped during the crucial holiday quarter, and the company predicted that there would be \"meaningful pressure\" on its profits to start the year in part because of tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China.",
      "Macy's, Best Buy, Abercrombie & Fitch, Dollar General and others also have grown cautious about their expectations for 2025, with many citing \"economic uncertainty.\"",
      "Home and car sales decline",
      "The Conference Board's survey showed that demand for both homes and cars has waned. However, in somewhat of a surprise given respondents' anxiety about the future, intentions to buy big-ticket items like appliances increased in March. The group said that could reflect a desire to buy before U.S. tariffs kick in, leading to price increases.",
      "While inflation has retreated from the highs during the post-pandemic rebound, it has remained above the Federal Reserve's 2% annual target. It is also important to note that while inflation isn't at the 9% high we saw in summer 2022, prices are still rising, just at a slower pace. Consumers have seen cumulative price increases above 20% since the inflation crisis began \u2014 higher than their income.",
      "\"Until there's more certainty on the tariff and macro front, sentiment and confidence remain vulnerable,\" eToro's Kenwell said.",
      "Consumers had appeared increasingly confident heading into the year-end holidays and spent generously. One month later, however, in January, U.S. retail sales fell sharply, though cold weather shared some of the blame.",
      "\"Consumers are spooked by headlines about higher tariffs and trade war, DOGE cuts and the stock market sell-off,\" Bill Adams, chief economist for Comerica Bank, said in a research note. \"When people fear for their jobs, they will cut back on discretionary spending on vacations and going out, and delay big purchases like new houses, cars, or appliances,\" he added.",

      "The National Security Council said the messages seem to be \"authentic,\" in a statement to CBS News after the story was published.",
      "The use of Signal to discuss sensitive military operations is raising questions about the app, including its level of security against hackers and other bad actors. It's an app that many Americans may not be familiar with, given that Signal had about 70 million users in 2024, a fraction of the 1 billion active monthly users of Apple's iMessage, according to the national security publication Lawfare.",

      "Signal has been gaining users because of its end-to-end encryption, which is boosting its \"adoption during uncertain times or specific events which reinforce its position as the go-to communication service,\" PP Foresight analyst Paolo Pescatore told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Its encryption prevents any third-party from viewing conversation content or listening in on calls. In other words, messages and calls sent on Signal are scrambled and only the sender and recipient at each end will have the key to decipher them.",
      "Unlike another popular messaging app, Telegram, encryption on Signal is turned on by default. Signal also says it doesn't collect or store any sensitive information.",
      "\"Signal messages and calls cannot be accessed by us or other third parties because they are always end-to-end encrypted, private and secure,\" according to the service.",
      "Signal didn't immediately reply to a request for comment about the Trump administration's use of the app.",
      "Who owns Signal?",
      "Signal is owned by the nonprofit Signal Foundation, which was set up by co-founders Moxie Marlinspike and Brian Acton to support the app's operations as well as \"investigate the future of private communication,\" according to the foundation's website. The foundation says it is a nonprofit \"with no advertisers or investors, sustained only by the people who use and value it.\"",
      "The foundation's board has five members, including Marlinspike and Acton, who co-founded WhatsApp and donated $50 million to set up the foundation.",
      "The Signal app was created more than a decade ago by Marlinspike, an entrepreneur, who was briefly head of product security at Twitter after he sold his mobile security startup, called Whisper Systems, to the social media company in 2011. Marlinspike merged two existing open source apps, one for texting and one for voice calls, to create Signal.",
      "Can Signal be hacked?",
      "Signal touts the privacy of its service, and experts agree it is more secure than conventional texting.",
      "But they also caution that it could be hacked. And in February 2025, the National Security Agency sent out an operational security special bulletin to its employees cautioning them of vulnerabilities in the Signal app, according to internal NSA documents obtained by CBS News.",
      "\"A vulnerability has been identified in the Signal Messenger Application. The use of Signal by common targets of surveillance and espionage activity has made the application a high value target to intercept sensitive information,\" the internal bulletin says.",
      "Signal\u00a0responded\u00a0to the bulletin in a social media post Tuesday, saying the NSA's \"memo used the term 'vulnerability' in relation to Signal-but it had nothing to do with Signal's core tech. It was warning against phishing scams targeting Signal users.\"",
      "\"Phishing isn't new, and it's not a flaw in our encryption or any of Signal's underlying technology,\" the company said. \"Phishing attacks are a constant threat for popular apps and websites.\"",
      "Government officials have used Signal for organizational correspondence, such as scheduling sensitive meetings. But in the Biden administration, people who had permission to download it on their White House-issued phones were instructed to use the app sparingly, according to a former national security official who served in the administration.",
      "\"Unlike other end-to-end encryption messaging services, Signal does boast a rich range of features,\" Pescatore said. \"However, hackers are always on the prowl to find weaknesses and use apps maliciously.\"",
      "What is Signal typically used for?",
      "Because of its end-to-end encryption, Signal is often used by national security and intelligence professionals, as well as activists, among others, according to Lawfare.",
      "A recent\u00a0Associated Press review\u00a0found that encrypted messaging apps are increasingly popular with government officials, with some using government mobile phone numbers, while others registered their accounts to personal numbers.",
      "Are there legal issues for government officials using Signal?",
      "Possibly, yes. Sharing sensitive national security details over Signal could violate the Espionage Act, CBS News national security contributor Sam Vinograd, who served in former President Barack Obama's Homeland Security Department, said Tuesday.",
      "\"By communicating classified information on a nonsecure platform like Signal, senior U.S. government officials ... increased the chance that foreign governments could get access to sensitive operational security plans \u2014 and that could put our own troops in harm's way,\" Vinograd said.",
      "While Mr. Trump told reporters from the Oval Office on Tuesday that \"I don't know anything about Signal, I wasn't involved in this,\" he indicated that other branches of government use the app.",
      "\"I hear it's used by a lot of groups, I hear it's used by the media a lot,\" he said. \"A lot of the military, I think successfully. Sometimes people can get onto those things, that's one of the prices you pay when you're not sitting in the Situation Room with no phones, which is always the best, frankly. The best is to be there.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said Signal is the \"No. 1 device or app that is used\" that he had asked Waltz to explore its use by government officials.",

    "published": "Tue, 25 Mar 2025 13:34:45 -0400",
    "summary": "Disability rights advocates say income and asset caps for Medicaid buy-in programs are a \"poverty trap\" for millions of Americans.",
    "story": [
      "PLEASANTVILLE, Iowa \u2014 Zach Mecham has heard politicians demand that Medicaid recipients work or lose their benefits. He also has run into a jumble of Medicaid rules that effectively prevent many people with disabilities from holding full-time jobs.",
      "\"Which is it? Do you want us to work or not?\" he said.",
      "Mecham, 31, relies on the public insurance program to pay for services that help him live on his own despite a disability caused by muscular dystrophy. He uses a wheelchair to get around and a portable ventilator to breathe.",
      "A paid assistant stays with Mecham at night. Then a home health aide comes in the morning to help him get out of bed, go to the bathroom, shower, and get dressed for work at his online marketing business. Without the assistance, he would have to shutter his company and move into a nursing home, he said.",
      "Private health insurance plans generally do not cover such support services, so he relies on Medicaid, which is jointly financed by federal and state governments and covers millions of Americans who have low incomes or disabilities.",
      "Like most other states, Iowa has a Medicaid \"buy-in program,\" which allows people with disabilities to join Medicaid even if their incomes are a bit higher than would typically be permitted. About two-thirds of such programs charge premiums, and most have caps on how much money participants can earn and save.",
      "Some states have raised or eliminated such financial caps for people with disabilities. Mecham has repeatedly traveled to the Iowa Capitol to lobby legislators to follow those states' lead. The \"Work Without Worry\" bill would remove income and asset caps and instead require Iowans with disabilities to pay 6% of their incomes as premiums to remain in Medicaid. Those fees would be waived if participants pay premiums for employer-based health insurance, which would help cover standard medical care.",
      "Disability rights advocates say income and asset caps for Medicaid buy-in programs can prevent participants from working full time or accepting promotions. \"It's a trap \u2014 a poverty trap,\" said Stephen Lieberman, a policy director for the United Spinal Association, which supports the changes.",
      "Lawmakers in Florida, Hawaii, Indiana, Iowa, Maine, Mississippi, and New Jersey have introduced bills to address the issue this year, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.",
      "Several other states have raised or eliminated their program's income and asset caps. Iowa's proposal is modeled on a Tennessee law passed last year, said Josh Turek, a Democratic state representative from Council Bluffs. Turek, who is promoting the Iowa bill, uses a wheelchair and earned two gold medals as a member of the U.S. Paralympics basketball team.",
      "Proponents say allowing people with disabilities to earn more money and still qualify for Medicaid would help ease persistent worker shortages, including in rural areas where the working-age population is shrinking.",
      "Turek believes now is a good time to seek expanded employment rights for people with disabilities, since Republicans who control the state and federal governments have been touting the value of holding a job. \"That's the trumpet I've been blowing,\" he said with a smile.",
      "The Iowa Legislature has been moving to require many nondisabled Medicaid recipients to work or to document why they can't. Opponents say most Medicaid recipients who can work already do so, and the critics say work requirements add red tape that is expensive to administer and could lead Medicaid recipients to lose their coverage over paperwork issues.",
      "Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds has made Medicaid work requirements a priority this year. \"If you can work, you should. It's common sense and good policy,\" the Republican governor told legislators in January in her \"Condition of the State Address.\" \"Getting back to work can be a lifeline to stability and self-sufficiency.\"",
      "Her office did not respond to KFF Health News' queries about whether Reynolds supports eliminating income and asset caps for Iowa's buy-in program, known as Medicaid for Employed People with Disabilities.",
      "Spouse's income counts toward cap",
      "National disability rights activists say income and asset caps on Medicaid buy-in programs discourage couples from marrying or even pressure them to split up if one or both partners have disabilities. That's because in many states a spouse's income and assets are counted when determining eligibility.",
      "In Iowa, for example, the monthly net income cap is $3,138 for a single person and $4,259 for a couple.",
      "Iowa's current asset cap for a single person in the Medicaid buy-in plan is $12,000. For a couple, that cap rises only to $13,000. Countable assets include investments, bank accounts, and other things that could be easily converted to cash, but not a primary home, vehicle, or household furnishings.",
      "\"You have couples who have been married for decades who have to go through what we call a 'Medicaid divorce,' just to get access to these supports and services that cannot be covered in any other way,\" said Maria Town, president of the American Association of People with Disabilities.",
      "Town said some states, including Massachusetts, have removed income caps for people with disabilities who want to join Medicaid. She said the cost of adding such people to the program is at least partially offset by the premiums they pay for coverage and the increased taxes they contribute because they are allowed to work more hours. \"I don't think it has to be expensive\" for the state and federal governments, she said.",
      "Congress has considered a similar proposal to allow people with disabilities to work more hours without losing their Social Security disability benefits, but that bill has not advanced.",
      "Although most states have Medicaid buy-in programs, enrollment is relatively low, said Alice Burns, a Medicaid analyst at KFF, a health information nonprofit that includes KFF Health News.",
      "Fewer than 200,000 people nationwide are covered under the options, Burns said. \"Awareness of these programs is really limited,\" she said, and the income limits and paperwork can dissuade potential participants.",
      "In states that charge premiums for Medicaid buy-in programs, monthly fees can range from $10 to 10% of a person's income, according to a KFF analysis of 2022 data.",
      "Iowa bill to remove caps",
      "The Iowa proposal to remove income and asset caps has drawn bipartisan backing from legislators, including a 20-0 vote of approval from the House Health and Human Services Committee. \"This aligns with things both parties are aiming to do,\" said state Rep. Carter Nordman, a Republican who chaired a subcommittee meeting on the bill. Nordman said he supports the idea but wants to see an official estimate of how much it would cost the state to let more people with disabilities participate in the Medicaid buy-in program.",
      "Mecham, the citizen activist lobbying for the Iowa bill, said he hopes it allows him to expand his online marketing and graphic design business, \"Zach of All Trades.\"",
      "On a recent morning, health aide Courtnie Imler visited Mecham's modest house in Pleasantville, a town of about 1,700 people in an agricultural region of central Iowa. Imler chatted with Mecham while she used a hoist to lift him out of his wheelchair and onto the toilet. Then she cleaned him up, brushed his hair, and helped him put on jeans and a John Deere T-shirt. She poured him a cup of coffee and put a straw in it so he could drink it on his own, swept the kitchen floor, and wiped the counters. After about an hour, she said goodbye.",
      "After getting cleaned up and dressed, Mecham rolled his motorized wheelchair over to his plain wooden desk, fired up his computer, and began working on a social media video for a client promoting a book. He scrolled back and forth through footage of an interview she'd done, so he could pick the best clip to post online. He also shoots video, takes photos, and writes advertising copy.",
      "Mecham loves feeling productive, and he figures he could work at least twice as many hours if not for the risk of losing Medicaid coverage. He said he's allowed to make a bit more money than Iowa Medicaid's standard limit because he signed up for a federal option under which he eventually expects to work his way off Social Security disability payments.",
      "There are several such options for people with disabilities, but they all involve complicated paperwork and frequent reports, he said. \"This is such a convoluted system that I have to navigate to build any kind of life for myself,\" he said. Many people with disabilities are intimidated by the rules, so they don't apply, he said. \"If you get it wrong, you lose the health care your life depends on.\"",

    "published": "Tue, 25 Mar 2025 09:34:50 -0400",
    "summary": "A once-every-four-year report card on the upkeep of America's infrastructure gave it a \"C\" grade in 2025, up slightly from previous reports.",
    "story": [
      "A once-every-four-year report card on the upkeep of America's infrastructure\u00a0gave it a \"C\" grade on Tuesday, up slightly from previous reports, largely due to investments made during former President Joe Biden's administration.",
      "The report from the American Society of Civil Engineers, which examined everything from roads and dams to drinking water and railroads, warns that federal funding must be sustained or increased to avoid further deterioration and escalating costs.",
      "\"We have seen the investments start to pay off, but we still have a lot of work to do out there,\" said Darren Olson, chair of this year's report. He said decrepit infrastructure \u2014 from poor roads that damage cars to delayed flights to power outages that spoil groceries \u2014 hurts people and the economy.",
      "\"By investing in our infrastructure, we're making our economy more efficient, we're making it stronger (and) we're making ourselves globally more competitive,\" he said.",
      "The report was the first ever not to have any categories with a D-minus grade, CBS News senior transportation and national correspondent Kris Van Cleave notes.",
      "Eight categories saw grade increases, Van Cleave says. Many of them had been chronically stuck at D-minus or D for years",
      "Olson said it's especially critical that infrastructure can handle more extreme weather due to climate change, pointing to hurricanes that devastated the East Coast and parts of Appalachia last year. The U.S. saw 27 weather disasters last year that cost at least $1 billion, the second-most since 1980.",
      "The 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act provided $550 billion in new infrastructure investments but is set to expire in 2026. Another $30 billion came from the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, including for projects focused on clean energy and climate change, the engineering group said.",
      "President Trump's administration has targeted some of Biden's green policies. Public parks improved to a C-minus from a D-plus, for example, thanks in part to significant investments over several years. Recently, however, the Trump administration moved to slash National Park Service staffing.",
      "Massive spending needed",
      "In 2021, the U.S. earned a C-minus overall. The investments made since then are just a fraction of the $9.1 trillion the civil engineers group estimates is needed to bring all of the nation's current infrastructure into a state of good repair.",
      "Even if current federal infrastructure funding were maintained, there still would be a $3.7 trillion gap over a decade, according to the report.",
      "The bill to upgrade and maintain the nation's roughly 50,000 water utilities, for example, is $625 billion over the next two decades, according to the federal government. The grade for drinking water was C-minus, unchanged from four years ago.",
      "Many communities already struggling to maintain old, outdated drinking water systems also face new requirements to replace lead service lines and reduce per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, collectively known as PFAS.",
      "The infrastructure bill helped complete or start \"a lot of really important projects,\" said Scott Berry, director of policy and governmental affairs at the US Water Alliance. \"But the gap has widened so much over the last couple of decades that a lot, lot more investment is going to be needed.\"",
      "The bill also provided billions to help the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers upgrade inland waterways, which move roughly $150 billion in commerce every year, improving the grade from a D-plus to a C-minus.",
      "Barges on the Mississippi River, for example, carry enormous amounts of coal, soybeans, corn and other raw materials to international markets. But critical infrastructure like locks and dams \u2014 many built more than a half-century ago and requiring regular maintenance and repair \u2014 is often invisible to the public, making it easy to neglect, said Mike Steenhoek, executive director of the Soy Transportation Coalition.",
      "And when big projects are funded, it too often comes in stages, he said. That forces projects to pause until more money is appropriated, driving up costs for materials and labor.",
      "\"If we really want to make the taxpayer dollars stretch further, you have got to be able to bring a greater degree of predictability and reliability in how you fund these projects,\" he said.",
      "The report's focus on engineering and money misses the importance of adopting policies that could improve how people use and pay for infrastructure, according to Clifford Winston, a microeconomist in the Brookings Institution's economic studies program.",
      "\"You fail to make the most efficient use of what you have,\" said Winston. For example, he noted that congestion pricing like that recently adopted by New York City\u00a0\u2014 charging people to drive in crowded areas \u2014 places the burden on frequent users and can pressure people to drive less, reducing the need for new bridges, tunnels and repairs.",
      "Roads remain in chronically poor shape, receiving a D-plus compared to a D in the last report, despite $591 billion in investments since 2021.",
      "Aviation also came in with a D-plus, Van Cleave notes.",
      "Two categories, rail and energy, received lower grades. Disasters like the derailment of a train carrying dangerous chemicals in East Palestine, Ohio, in 2023 lowered rail's previous B mark to a B-minus.",
      "The energy sector, stressed by surging demand from data centers and electric vehicles, got a D-plus, down from C-minus.",
      "Invest now or pay more later",
      "Engineers say problems in many sectors have festered for so long that the nation must figure out how to address the shortcomings now or pay for them when systems fail.",
      "On Wednesday, a delegation of engineers will visit Washington to talk to lawmakers about the funding impacts and \"the importance of continuing that investment,\" said Olson, who said the needs are a bipartisan issue.",
      "\"When we talk about it in ways of how better infrastructure saves the American family money, how better infrastructure supports economic growth, we're really confident that ... there is strong support,\" he said."

      "23andMe users must explicitly affirm that the company may share their personal data, although people's data could be included as part of a sale of the company. Some states have passed privacy laws that would require a person's consent before their genetic data is transferred from one entity to another.",

On social media, he said the U.S. will impose a \"secondary\" tariff on the country because it is home to a transnational gang known as Tren de Aragua..",
      "The Trump administration has deported immigrants it claims belong to the gang, which Mr. Trump has labeled a foreign terrorist group and wartime enemy.",
      "Markets clinging to hope",
      "Financial markets have slumped this year on concerns that the Trump administration's aggressive use of tariffs could torpedo U.S. economic growth and boost inflation.",
      "\"Markets opened in a bit of a risk-on mood overnight. U.S. equity index futures gained from the outset, finding support from recent reports that President Trump's promised tariffs may be more targeted than he has previously stated,\" said John Canavan, lead U.S. analyst with Oxford Economics.",
      "The S&P 500 rose 0.5% last week, the index's first weekly gain since Feb. 14, although it remains down nearly 2% on the year. The Nasdaq has slid 5.8% in 2025 over concerns the huge technology companies that dominate the index could get caught in the crossfire between U.S. tariffs and countermeasures by other countries. The blue-chip Dow is essentially flat this year.",
      "Citing the potential impact of tariffs, the Federal Reserve earlier this month lowered its outlook for economic growth to 1.7%, down from its December forecast of 2.1%, while forecasting hotter inflation this year. A Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta model\u00a0that assesses current economic conditions forecasts growth in the first three months of the year at -1.8%.",
      "What investors are watching this week",
      "This week's calendar is relatively light on events likely to move markets. But on Tuesday, investors will zero in on a closely watched gauge of consumer confidence. The Conference Board, which represents large U.S. companies, in February reported the sharpest decline in its consumer sentiment index in more than four years.",
      "Analysts with investment research firm Wrightson-ICAP expect the Conference Board index in March to show a fourth straight monthly decline in consumer confidence.",
      "\"We look for a 5-point decline to 93, which would bring the cumulative decline since November to roughly 20 points and would be the weakest reading in more than four years,\" they wrote in a research note.",
      "Spending by Americans accounts for roughly two-thirds of economic activity, so rising pessimism among consumers and businesses can weigh on growth.",

    "summary": "Billionaire Elon Musk on Friday clarified his reasons for visiting Wisconsin two days ahead of its hotly contested Supreme Court election after deleting a social media post saying he planned to \"personally hand over\" $2 million.",
    "story": [
      "Wisconsin's Democratic attorney general asked a court on Friday to block billionaire\u00a0Elon Musk from handing out $1 million checks to voters this weekend, just two days before the state's\u00a0hotly contested Supreme Court race was to be decided.",
      "Attorney General Josh Kaul filed the lawsuit in Dane County Circuit Court to stop Musk from making the payments, which he said he would make Sunday in Wisconsin. Musk initially said in a post on his social media platform, X, that he planned to \"personally hand over\" $2 million to a pair of voters who have already cast their ballots in the race.",
      "Musk later posted a clarification, saying the money will go to people who will be \"spokesmen\" for an online petition against \"activist\" judges. After first saying the event would only be open to people who had voted in the Supreme Court race, he said attendance would be limited to those who have signed the petition.",
      "Also on Friday, Musk's political action committee identified the recipient of its first $1 million giveaway \u2014 a Green Bay man who had donated to the Wisconsin GOP and the conservative candidate in the court race, and who has a history of posting support for President Donald Trump and his agenda.",
      "Musk deleted the post from his social media platform, X, about 12 hours after he initially posted it late Thursday night. He issued the clarification about an hour later.",
      "He had posted that he planned to give $1 million each to two voters at the event on Sunday, just two days before the election\u00a0that will determine ideological control of the court\u00a0in the battleground state.",
      "\"I will also personally hand over two checks for a million dollars each in appreciation for you taking the time to vote,\" Musk's now-deleted post said. \"This is super important.\"",
      "The Supreme Court race has\u00a0shattered previous spending records for a U.S. judicial election\u00a0and has become a referendum on Musk and the first months of President Donald Trump's administration.",
      "Trump, a Republican, endorsed Brad Schimel and hosted a telephone town hall with him on Thursday night.",
      "\"It's a very important race,\" Trump said in brief remarks by phone, in a call organized by Schimel's campaign. \"I know you feel it's local, but it's not. It's really much more than local. The whole country is watching.\"",
      "Schimel, a Waukesha County judge, faces Dane County Judge Susan Crawford in Tuesday's election. Crawford is backed by a wide range of Democrats, including the liberal justices who hold a 4-3 majority on the Wisconsin Supreme Court and former President Barack Obama. The retirement this year of a liberal justice puts majority control of the court in play.",
      "Musk's political action committee said Friday that it had awarded $1 million to Scott Ainsworth, a mechanical engineer from Green Bay, for signing its petition protesting against \"activist\" judges. In a video posted on X, Ainsworth encouraged people to sign the petition and \"get out and vote early for Brad Schimel.\"",
      "\"If everyone in the MAGA movement shows up and votes for Brad Schimel, we will win,\" Ainsworth said in the video.",
      "Ainsworth donated $350 to Schimel's campaign this year, campaign finance records show.",
      "Andrew Romeo, a spokesperson for Musk's political action committee, declined to say whether Ainsworth was one of the two who would be receiving $1 million on Sunday.",
      "Musk promised $100 to any registered Wisconsin voter\u00a0who signed the petition or forwarded it to someone who did.",
      "That raised questions about whether the petition violated Wisconsin law that makes it a felony to offer, give, lend or promise to lend or give anything of value to induce a voter to cast a ballot or not vote.",
      "Any legal challenge to Musk's payments could end up before the Wisconsin Supreme Court.",
      "A bipartisan coalition of government watchdog groups and former office holders, along with a liberal Madison law firm, asked the Wisconsin attorney general and the Milwaukee County district attorney to investigate the $1 million payment and the offer of $100 for signing the petition.",
      "The group, in its letter sent Thursday night, said the payments appear to violate the state law against election bribery.",
      "Attorney General Josh Kaul and Milwaukee County District Attorney Kent Lovern did not immediately return messages Friday seeking comment.",
      "Schimel, a former attorney general, was asked about the petition on Thursday by WISN-TV.",
      "\"I, frankly, thought, 'Should I sign that petition? I'm against activist judges, but I don't think I should do that,'\" Schimel said.",
      "When asked about the $1 million award, Schimel said, \"I don't know what the criteria to get it was.\"",
      "Crawford's campaign spokesperson Derrick Honeyman, called Musk's announced visit to Wisconsin a \"last-minute desperate distraction.\"",
      "\"Wisconsinites don't want a billionaire like Musk telling them who to vote for, and, on Tuesday, voters should reject Musk's lackey Brad Schimel,\" he said.",
      "Musk's political action committee used a nearly identical tactic before the White House election last year, offering to pay $1 million a day to voters in Wisconsin and six other battleground states\u00a0who signed a petition supporting the First and Second Amendments.",
      "During last year's presidential race, Philadelphia's district attorney sued in an attempt to stop the payments under Pennsylvania law. But a judge said prosecutors failed to show the effort was an illegal lottery and allowed it to continue through Election Day.",
      "Musk and groups he funds have already spent more than $20 million in an effort to elect Schimel, while billionaire George Soros has given $2 million to bolster Crawford, and Democratic Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker has donated $1.5 million.",
      "Musk got involved in the race just days after his electric car company, Tesla, filed a lawsuit against Wisconsin in an effort to open dealerships in the state.",
      "Crawford and her allies have accused Musk of trying to buy influence on the court given that Tesla's lawsuit could end up before the justices.",
      "The race comes as the Wisconsin Supreme Court is also expected to rule on abortion rights, congressional redistricting, union power and voting rules that could affect the 2026 midterms and the 2028 presidential election.",
      "Wisconsin is one of a handful of true battleground states, which only intensifies the focus on court races where rules for voting will be decided. Trump won Wisconsin in 2016 and 2024 by less than a percentage point, but he lost it in 2020 by a similar margin. Five of the past seven presidential elections in the state have been decided by less than a percentage point.",
      "More than $81 million has been spent on the Supreme Court race so far, obliterating the record for a judicial race in the U.S. of $51 million set in Wisconsin just two years ago, according to Brennan Center tallies.",

      "Update: A judge in Washington, D.C., issued a temporary restraining order on Friday, March 28, blocking the Trump administration's executive order against the law firm Jenner & Block.",
      "President Trump issued an executive order Tuesday targeting Chicago law firm Jenner & Block. The firm also has an office in Washington, D.C.",
      "Jenner & Block has been an active part of the legal challenges against Mr. Trump's executive orders, including successfully securing a preliminary injunction against an order from the administration that reduced health care access for transgender youth.",
      "That case is still pending in a Maryland-based federal court.",
      "This executive order instructs officials to review and revoke firm members' security clearance, identify any good, property, material and services provided by the federal government and stop providing them, terminate any government contracts that may exist with the law firm, and not hire any employees of the firm for any future federal government jobs.",
      "The order also singles out attorney Andrew Weissman, who worked on Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. The executive order says he was re-hired at Jenner & Block, but the firm clarified that Weissman hasn't worked there since 2021.",
      "The executive order specifies that Weissman is prohibited from being hired by or working for the federal government unless a waiver is issued.",
      "The Trump administration has targeted a number of law firms that have been active in challenging or pausing executive orders and policies in the courts.",
      "Previously, the president issued and then rescinded an executive order targeting international law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Garrison & Wharton after it pledged to review its hiring practices and provide tens of millions of dollars in free legal services to support certain White House initiatives.",
      "A spokesperson for Jenner & Block responded to the order in a statement, writing in part, \"Today, we have been named in an Executive Order similar to one which has already been declared unconstitutional by a federal court. We remain focused on serving and safeguarding our clients' interests with the dedication, integrity, and expertise that has defined our firm for more than one hundred years and will pursue all appropriate remedies.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump has issued executive orders targeting law firms that have employed his purported political opponents.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump announced Friday that the law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom agreed to provide more than $100 million in pro bono work for initiatives backed by his administration.",
      "The agreement makes Skadden Arps the second major firm to reach a deal with Mr. Trump amid a recent blitz of executive orders targeting law firms that have employed his purported political opponents. The orders issued by the president have focused on the firms Perkins Coie, Jenner & Block, and Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr, known as WilmerHale.",
      "All three of those firms have filed federal lawsuits challenging the executive orders as a violation of the First Amendment. A federal judge in Washington blocked parts of Mr. Trump's executive order against Perkins Coie earlier this month, and on Friday, two separate judges issued temporary restraining orders halting the president's actions against Jenner & Block and WilmerHale.",
      "While Mr. Trump earlier in the month issued an order going after a fourth firm, Paul, Weiss, it was rescinded after the international firm agreed to provide $40 million in free legal services to support causes backed by the administration.",
      "The president said in a statement posted to Truth Social that in addition to providing $100 million in pro bono work, the firm will not engage in \"illegal DEI discrimination and preferences\" and work with an outside counsel to advise it on employment practices.",
      "Mr. Trump also said Skadden Arps \"will not deny representation to clients, such as members of politically disenfranchised groups, who have not historically received legal representation from major National Law Firms, including in pro bono matters, and in support of non-profits, because of the personal political views of individual lawyers.\"",
      "The White House said Skadden Arps approached the administration \"and declared the Firm's strong commitment to ending the Weaponization of the Justice System and the Legal Profession.\"",
      "Jeremy London, the firm's executive partner, said in a statement distributed by Mr. Trump that it is \"pleased to have achieved a successful agreement with President Trump and his Administration. We engaged proactively with the President and his team in working together constructively to reach this agreement. The Firm looks forward to continuing our productive relationship with President Trump and his Administration. We firmly believe that this outcome is in the best interests of our clients, our people, and our Firm.\"",
      "The executive orders targeting the law firms are among a number of actions taken by Mr. Trump since he returned to the White House that have gone after his perceived enemies. He revoked the security clearances of former Vice President Kamala Harris, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and other top Biden administration officials, as well as others who have been critical of him, last week. Mr. Trump also pulled the security details for Dr. Anthony Fauci and retired Gen. Mark Milley, who was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff during the Trump and Biden administrations.",
      "Executive orders targeting major law firms",
      "The law firm-related orders take issue with the work they have performed and the lawyers previously on their payrolls. In the directive targeting Perkins Coie, Mr. Trump attacked the firm for representing Clinton during her 2016 presidential campaign and hiring a research firm that retained a former British spy, Christopher Steele, who\u00a0produced the infamous \"Steele Dossier.\"",
      "The president's order attacking Jenner & Block singles out the firm for hiring Andrew Weissmann, who worked with former special counsel Robert Mueller on his investigation into Russia's efforts to influence the 2016 presidential election. Weissmann left the firm in 2021. It also took issue with Jenner & Block's work on a challenge to Mr. Trump's executive order that seeks to strip federal funds from medical institutions that provide gender-affirming care to minors, among other lawsuits.",
      "In a ruling late Friday, Judge John D. Bates, an appointee of President George W. Bush, issued an order temporarily blocking the action, saying it likely violates the First, Fifth and Sixth Amendments. The judge called Mr. Trump's executive order \"disturbing\" and \"troubling\" on the grounds that it attacks pro bono practice.",
      "\"The court does not take lightly the power to enjoin the executive branch, but the government has not made any persuasive case that the public interest will be harmed\" by halting enforcement, he said.",
      "Mr. Trump's latest executive order, which targets WilmerHale, accused the firm of weaponizing the justice system by employing Mueller and two others who worked on his investigation, James Quarles and Aaron Zebley. Mueller left WilmerHale more than three years ago, according to the firm, and Quarles is retired. Zebley is a partner at WilmerHale.",
      "In his ruling Friday night temporarily blocking\u00a0portions of Mr. Trump's executive order, U.S. District Judge Richard Leon wrote: \"There is no doubt this retaliatory action chills speech and legal advocacy, or that it qualifies as a constitutional harm.\"",
      "Leon said WilmerHale \"faces more than economic harm\" from the executive order, \"it faces crippling losses and its very survival is at stake.\" He wrote that the injuries to the firm from the order \"would be so severe and would spill over to its clients and the justice system at large. The public interest demands protecting against harms of this magnitude.\"",
      "His temporary restraining order stops the Trump administration from requiring government contracting agencies to terminate all contracts with WilmerHale, and stops the administration from restricting WilmerHale employees' access to federal buildings and officials.",
      "The executive orders directed agency heads to suspend any active security clearances held by employees of three firms and require federal contractors to disclose any business with WilmerHale, Jenner & Block and Perkins Coie. The administration is also directed to review all contracts with the firms or with entities that disclose doing business with them.",
      "The fallout from the executive orders has been swift. In a declaration filed with the court, Thomas Perrelli, firm chair and a partner at Jenner & Block, warned that if allowed to take the effect, the restrictions laid out in Mr. Trump's order would be \"devastating and irreparable.\"",
      "According to Perrelli, one client has already informed Jenner & Block that the Justice Department notified them that they cannot bring their lawyers from the firm to a department meeting set for April 3. That client, Perrelli wrote, will need to attend the meeting without their outside representation or hire new counsel before it.",
      "Some Jenner & Block clients are also worried the firm cannot represent them in federal court or go into government buildings to engage with regulatory agencies or government officials, he said. Within 24 hours of Mr. Trump's order, Perrelli said several clients expressed concerns about the firm's representation because they were unsure whether Jenner & Block lawyers could enter federal buildings and courthouses, negotiate with government officials or participate in meetings with the Justice Department.",
      "As to the order's provisions targeting government contractors with a relationship with Jenner & Block, Perrelli said 40% of the firm's revenue came from clients who have federal contracts or subcontracts.",
      "\"If we lost that business, or even a portion of it, it would be a serious threat to the firm's financial health,\" Perrelli wrote.",

    "summary": "A recent poll\u200b shows 85% of Greenlanders do not want to be part of the United States.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Vice President JD Vance\u00a0said Friday during a day trip to a U.S. base in Greenland that the Trump administration doesn't think that \"military force is ever going to be necessary\" there, the same day President Trump said, \"We have to have Greenland.\"",
      "Vance visited the Pituffik Space Base, the northernmost U.S. military installation, along with second lady Usha Vance, national security adviser Mike Waltz, Secretary of Energy Chris Wright and Sen. Mike Lee of Utah. While there, the vice president blasted Denmark for its handling of the island, as the Trump White House eyes the semi-autonomous Danish territory despite opposition from residents and leaders. While Vance was there, President Trump reiterated his strong desire to acquire the island.",
      "\"We need Greenland, very importantly, for international security,\" the president told reporters at the White House. \"We have to have Greenland. It's not a question of, 'Do you think we can do without it?' We can't.\"",
      "Mr. Trump hasn't ruled out military force in Greenland, while Vance on Friday said he believes the people of Greenland will seek independence from Denmark. A reporter asked Vance if his message is consistent with the president's. Vance said the president wants more of a U.S. presence in Greenland, but \"the president has said clearly he doesn't think that military force is going to be necessary.\"",
      "\"What we think is going to happen is that the Greenlanders are going to choose through self-determination to become independent of Denmark, and then we're going to have conversations with the people of Greenland from there,\" Vance said. \"So I think talking about anything too far in the future is way too premature. We do not think that military force is ever going to be necessary. We think this makes sense. And because we think the people of Greenland are rational and good, we think we're going to be able to cut a deal, Donald Trump style, to ensure the security of this territory but also the United States of America.\"",
      "Vance said his trip to the base helped him see up close how critical Greenland is for U.S. national security. If an enemy fired a missile on the U.S., it would be the American soldiers at the Greenland base who would alert their countrymen, he said. Vance said the U.S. knows Russia and China are taking serious interest in the Arctic, and the U.S. needs to make sure it's leading in the Arctic. But while Vance recognized Denmark has been an important security partner in the past, he launched into criticisms of the European country, saying the U.S. base in Greenland is less secure than it was decades ago because of Denmark's stewardship.",
      "\"There is no amount of bullying, no amount of obfuscating, no amount of confusing the issue,\" Vance said. \"Our message to Denmark is very simple: You have not done a good job by the people of Greenland, you have underinvested in the people of Greenland, and you have underinvested in the security architecture of this incredible, beautiful landmass filled with incredible people. That has to change. And because it hasn't changed, that's why President Trump's policy in Greenland is what it is.\"",
      "The second lady was originally scheduled to visit Greenland in an expanded cultural trip this week, and then the vice president\u00a0announced\u00a0Tuesday that he would be joining her for a shorter trip that was more focused on U.S. policy and defense.",
      "Vance also thanked soldiers on the base, who are there for a year at a time and can't bring their families with them.",
      "\"I know it's a lot of sacrifice to spend a year away from your families, but the mission is really important,\" Vance said. \"The Trump administration, the president, is really interested in Arctic security. As you all know, that's a big issue, and it's only going to get bigger over the coming decade, so thanks for doing what you do.\"",
      "Waltz told the soldiers they're carrying a \"tradition\" of U.S. soldiers in Greenland, and said the president is very serious about Arctic security.",
      "A statement earlier this week by the vice president's office that announced Vance would join his wife on the trip emphasized Greenland's role in U.S. national security.",
      "\"During World War II, the United States established over a dozen military bases in Greenland to defend the North Atlantic from Nazi incursion,\" the statement said. \"During the Cold War, the United States committed additional resources to Greenland to defend against Soviet missile attacks.\"",
      "The statement went on to criticize Denmark, claiming, \"In the decades since, neglect and inaction from Danish leaders and past U.S. administrations have presented our adversaries with the opportunity to advance their own priorities in Greenland and the Arctic. President Trump is rightly changing course.\"",
      "Mr. Trump hasn't given up on the idea of absorbing Greenland into the U.S., despite opposition from Greenland's leadership and people. Greenland is an expansive island to the north and east of Canada that's a semi-autonomous territory of Denmark. It's roughly three times the size of Texas, but mostly covered by ice. Most of its roughly 57,000 people \u2014 a population smaller than Carson City, Nevada \u2014 live along Greenland's southern coast.",
      "A\u00a0recent poll shows 85% of Greenlanders do not want to be part of the United States, and residents who spoke with CBS News ahead of Vance's visit to a remote U.S. installation on the island \u2014 America's furthest north military base \u2014 clearly reflected the sentiments shown in that poll.",
      "\"He can't just take it like that,\" said Daniel Rosing, a trainee electrician who said he was proud of being a Greenlander.",
      "And Greenland's prime minister, M\u00fate Bourup Egede,\u00a0has called the planned visits from U.S. officials \"aggressive.\" And Mette Frederiksen, the Danish prime minister, said the U.S. is putting \"unacceptable pressure\" on Greenland.",
      "Despite this opposition, Mr. Trump said earlier this month in a speech before the joint session of Congress that he had \"a message tonight for the incredible people of Greenland: We strongly support your right to determine your own future, and if you choose, we welcome you into the United States of America.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said the territory is important to U.S. national security and that his administration is \"working with everybody involved to try and get it.\"",
      "\"And I think we're going to get it, one way or the other,\" Mr. Trump said. \"We're going to get it. We will keep you safe, we will make you rich, and together, we will take Greenland to heights like you have never thought possible before. It's a very small population, but very, very large piece of land, and very, very important for military security.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Israeli officials are furious over the Signal chat leak involving senior Trump administration officials because it included sensitive intelligence Israel provided to the U.S. from a human intelligence source in Yemen, CBS News has learned.",
      "While the Signal chat messages published by Jeffrey Goldberg of The Atlantic this week may not have compromised the effectiveness of the airstrike, given the publication's restraint on releasing the information, it did compromise a human source who provided the intelligence to the Israelis, who then provided it to the U.S. for targeting, a senior American intelligence official and a source with knowledge of the Israelis' ire told CBS News. They spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive national security matters.",
      "The Wall Street Journal on Thursday first reported about the Israelis complaining to U.S. officials about Mike Waltz, President Trump's national security adviser, who set up the group chat and apparently added Goldberg by mistake. The group spent several days earlier this month exchanging messages about possible plans to strike Iranian-backed Houthi militants in Yemen, who have repeatedly launched missiles at Israel and targeted shipping in the Red Sea.",
      "CBS News reached out to the National Security Council and the Israeli Embassy in the U.S. for comment on Friday, but has not received a response.",
      "On March 15, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth texted the group chat, composed of what's known as the principals committee \u2014 the highest level of the National Security Council, which includes Cabinet members and other senior U.S. officials.",
      "According to Goldberg's report, one of Hegseth's messages said:",
      "\"Trigger Based\" F-18 1st Strike Window Starts (Target Terrorist is @ his Known Location so SHOULD BE ON TIME \u2013 also, Strike Drones Launch (MQ-9s)",
      "The senior American intelligence official told CBS News that in this context, \"Trigger Based\" refers to an operation that is contingent upon a specific condition or event \u2014 essentially, a go or no-go decision to launch an airstrike based on confirmation of the target's presence.",
      "That day, Navy F/A-18F Super Hornets launched from the aircraft carrier Harry S. Truman located in the Red Sea, while the MQ-9 Reaper drones took flight from bases in the Middle East. U.S. Central Command said in a statement that they had begun an operation which consisted of \"precision strikes against Iran-backed Houthi targets across Yemen in order to restore freedom of navigation.\"",
      "Hegseth said in another text, prior to the decision to strike, that he supported doing so to restore freedom of navigation and reestablish deterrence, which he described as being \"cratered\" under the Biden administration.",
      "After the U.S. airstrikes began on the Iranian-backed Houthis, Waltz addressed Vice President JD Vance in the chat group to say the building had collapsed and that U.S. military forces had \"multiple positive ID,\" indicating positive identification of the Houthi member or members they were aiming to kill.",
      "Waltz added: \"The first target \u2014 their top missile guy \u2014 we had positive ID of him walking into his girlfriend's building and it's now collapsed,\" according to the texts posted by The Atlantic.",
      "As a barrage of criticism rolled in this week towards those involved in the Signal chat, senior Trump administration officials have repeatedly said the information was not classified and that no sources or methods were compromised.",
      "\"No locations. No sources & methods. No WAR PLANS,\" Waltz wrote on X on Wednesday. \"Foreign partners had already been notified that strikes were imminent.\"",
      "But the sources who spoke to CBS News say Israeli intelligence is angry that the intelligence they provided to the U.S. was revealed. It's unclear what the fallout will be, if any, between the U.S. and Israel over the situation.",
      "CBS News reported Thursday that President Trump has been privately venting his irritation about the Signal chat leak and is closely monitoring the news to see if the fallout quiets down, according to sources familiar with the matter.",
      "On Tuesday, National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe, both of whom were in the Signal group chat, testified before a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing.",
      "\"There was no classified material that was shared in that Signal chat,\" Gabbard told lawmakers. The following day, testifying before a House panel, Gabbard acknowledged the conversation was \"sensitive\" but again denied classified information was shared in the chat. \"There were no sources, methods, locations or war plans that were shared,\" she said.",
      "Multiple U.S. intelligence officials and members of the U.S. military who have spoken to CBS News this week contended that this type of information is always classified, but even if the information was somehow unclassified, it would still be a violation of cybersecurity and operational security protocols.",
      "CBS News on Tuesday published unclassified internal documents from a National Security Agency bulletin warning of vulnerabilities in using the Signal app, even though it is encrypted. The NSA bulletin was widely distributed to NSA employees a month before the Signal chat group was created by Waltz.",
      "The bulletin also underscored to NSA employees that third-party messaging applications such as Signal and WhatsApp are permitted for certain \"unclassified accountability/recall exercises\" but not for communicating more sensitive information.",
      "NSA employees were also warned to not send \"anything compromising over any social media or Internet-based tool or application,\" and to not \"establish connections with people you do not know.\"",

      "U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson issued a preliminary injunction Friday that blocks the Trump administration from dismantling the Consumer Protection Financial Bureau.",
      "\"The court cannot look away or the CFPB will be dissolved and dismantled completely in approximately thirty days, well before this lawsuit has come to its conclusion,\" she wrote in a 112-page decision.",
      "Her order keeps the CFPB in existence until the case has been resolved on the merits. It also reinstates the agency's contracts, workforce, data and operational capacity.",
      "Jackson ruled that, without a court order, President Trump's administration would move quickly to shut down the agency that Congress created in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis.",
      "\"If the defendants are not enjoined, they will eliminate the agency before the Court has the opportunity to decide whether the law permits them to do it, and as the defendants' own witness warned, the harm will be irreparable,\" Berman Jackson said in her order.",
      "During a March 10 hearing, Jackson heard testimony about the chaos that erupted inside the agency after government employees were ordered to stop working last month. The bureau's chief operating officer, Adam Martinez, said the agency was in \"wind-down mode\" after Trump fired its previous director, Rohit Chopra, on Feb. 1.",
      "Trump installed a temporary replacement who ordered the immediate suspension of all agency operations, cancelled $100 million in contracts and fired 70 employees.",
      "Martinez said the agency's current leaders have adopted a more methodical approach than they initially did last month, when representatives of Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency arrived at its Washington headquarters.",
      "CFPB is responsible for protecting consumers from financial fraud and deceptive practices. It processes consumer complaints and examines banks to protect student loan borrowers.",
      "The National Treasury Employees Union, which represents more than 1,000 workers at the bureau, sued on Feb. 9 to block mass firings. Plaintiffs' attorneys argue that the administration doesn't have the constitutional authority to eliminate an agency that Congress created by statute.",
      "\"The defendants' unlawful action will have immediate consequences for the Americans that the CFPB was designed by Congress to protect,\"\u00a0the lawyers wrote.",

White House budget director Russell Vought said it has been \"a woke and weaponized agency against disfavored industries and individuals for a long time.\" Mr. Trump called it \"a very important thing to get rid of.\"",
      "Among the plaintiffs was 83-year-old Eva Steege, a Lutheran pastor in hospice care who had been working with CFPB to resolve her student loan debt before her death.

      "Washington \u2014 A federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., cleared the way for President Trump to fire members of the National Labor Relations Board and Merit Systems Protection Board after district courts had earlier blocked their removals and ordered them reinstated.",
      "A three-judge panel of judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit divided 2-1 in agreeing to halt the lower court orders that voided Mr. Trump's firings of Gwynne Wilcox from the National Labor Relations Board and Cathy Harris from the Merit Systems Protection Board while legal proceedings move forward.",
      "Wilcox and Harris had argued that their firings violated federal laws that limited their removals only for neglect of duty or malfeasance in office. The Trump administration, meanwhile, defended the terminations and said the restrictions on the president's ability to remove the officials are unconstitutional.",
      "\"The people elected the president to enforce the nation's laws, and a stay serves that purpose by allowing the people's chosen officer to control the executive branch,\" Judge Justin Walker, who was appointed by Mr. Trump in his first term, wrote in an opinion siding with the administration.",
      "Wilcox was nominated to the National Labor Relations Board by former President Joe Biden and confirmed by the Senate to a five-year term in September 2023. She was designated chair of the board in December 2024.",
      "Harris was selected to serve on the Merit Systems Protection Board by Biden and confirmed in 2022. She was approved by the Senate as chair last year.",
      "Soon after Mr. Trump returned to the White House for his second term, Wilcox received a letter from the president informing her that the labor board had not been operating in a manner consistent with his administration's objectives, and telling her she had been removed. In Harris' case, she received an email in early February from the White House Presidential Personnel Office that stated, \"On behalf of President Donald J. Trump, I am writing to inform you that your position on the Merit Systems Protection Board is terminated, effective immediately.\"",
      "Both officials filed lawsuits seeking reinstatement in the federal district court in Washington. District court judges separately ruled in favor of Wilcox and Harris, finding their removals were unlawful and returning them to their roles.",
      "The Trump administration appealed the decisions and asked the D.C. Circuit to put them on hold while it considered the matter.",
      "In his concurring opinion, Walker said the district court orders effectively nullify the president's power under Article II to remove executive officials.",
      "\"The people elected the president, not Harris or Wilcox, to execute the nation's laws,\" he said. \"The forcible reinstatement of a presidentially removed principal officer disenfranchises voters by hampering the president's ability to govern during the four short years the people have assigned him the solemn duty of leading the executive branch.\"",
      "Judge Patricia Millet, appointed by former President Barack Obama, dissented from the court's decision to grant a stay.",
      "\"The whole purpose of a stay is to avoid instability and turmoil. But the court's decision today creates them,\" she wrote.",

    "summary": "President Trump invoked the wartime Aliens Enemies Act to deport alleged Venezuelan gang members earlier this month.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Trump administration on Friday asked the Supreme Court to lift lower court orders blocking deportations of alleged Venezuelan gang members under the wartime Alien Enemies Act.",
      "The Justice Department made the request for emergency relief just days after a federal appeals court in Washington declined to let the administration resume the deportations of people believed to be members of the Tren de Aragua gang to El Salvador under the wartime authority.",
      "\"This case presents fundamental questions about who decides how to conduct sensitive national-security-related operations in this country \u2014 the President, through Article II, or the Judiciary, through [temporary restraining orders],\" acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris wrote. \"The Constitution supplies a clear answer: the President. The republic cannot afford a different choice.\"",
      "The Supreme Court has asked lawyers for a group of five Venezuelan nationals who challenged the administration's efforts to invoke the Alien Enemies Act to respond to the Justice Department's request by April 1.",
      "The dispute over President Trump's effort to use the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan migrants believed to be members of the gang Tren de Aragua has played out amid a host of lawsuits challenging many aspects of his second-term agenda. The request for emergency relief from the Supreme Court is now the sixth made by the Justice Department. Three others are still awaiting action by the justices.",
      "As with the others, the latest bid for intervention by the high court attacks the scope of the order issued by the district judge presiding over the case, U.S. District Judge James Boasberg. But the criticisms of Boasberg by the president and his allies escalated the administration's ongoing tension with the courts. Mr. Trump called for the judge to be impeached after he issued an order that blocked the administration earlier this month from using the Alien Enemies Act to summarily deport migrants, prompting a rare rebuke from Chief Justice John Roberts.",
      "\"[T]he district court's orders have rebuffed the president's judgments as to how to protect the nation against foreign terrorist organizations and risk debilitating effects for delicate foreign negotiations,\" Harris wrote in her filing with the Supreme Court. \"More broadly, rule-by-TRO has become so commonplace among district courts that the Executive Branch's basic functions are in peril.\"",
      "The legal battle began earlier this month when the president invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to order the deportation of Venezuelan migrants suspected of being members of Tren de Aragua prison gang. Mr. Trump claimed in his proclamation that the gang was \"perpetrating, attempting, and threatening an invasion or predatory incursion against the territory of the United States,\" the legal threshold for using the authority, which has only been invoked three times before, and all during times of war.",
      "The president declared that all members of the gang who are in the U.S. unlawfully were \"subject to immediate apprehension, detention and removal.\"",
      "Five Venezuelan nationals who are being held at an immigration detention center in Texas filed a lawsuit in Washington, D.C., on March 15 that sought to stop the administration from removing them under the Alien Enemies Act.",
      "Boasberg agreed to block the removals\u00a0of the five Venezuelans for 14 days. Several hours later, the judge expanded his order to prevent the Trump administration from deporting any migrants believed to be members of Tren de Aragua under the Alien Enemies Act.",
      "The judge had also told the Justice Department in person during a hearing that any planes carrying people subject to Mr. Trump's proclamation that were going to take off or were already in the air needed to return to the U.S. Planes carrying migrants later landed in El Salvador, raising questions\u00a0about whether the government complied with Boasberg's order.",
      "The Justice Department has argued that it was not bound by the oral directive, though the district court has continued to examine whether the government complied with his order.",
      "The Trump administration appealed the court's two-week ban on deportations under the Alien Enemies Act to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, which issued a 2-1 decision\u00a0Wednesday that declined to allow the administration to resume the deportations.",
      "In the filing with the Supreme Court, Harris argued that the Alien Enemies Act gives the president sweeping national-security authority, and she warned that the district court's orders are harming the administration's ability to conduct foreign policy.",
      "\"That order is forcing the United States to harbor individuals whom national-security officials have identified as members of a foreign terrorist organization bent upon grievously harming Americans,\" she argued. \"Those orders \u2014which are likely to extend additional weeks \u2014 now jeopardize sensitive diplomatic negotiations and delicate national-security operations, which were designed to extirpate TdA's presence in our country before it gains a greater foothold.\"",
      "In addition to this case, the Supreme Court is also weighing requests for emergency relief arising from challenges to Mr. Trump's executive order seeking to end birthright citizenship, the mass firings of federal probationary workers\u00a0and the Department of Education's cancellation of teacher preparation grants that purportedly funded diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.",

    "summary": "President Trump signed an executive order targeting funding for Smithsonian Institution programs that he says contain \"divisive, race-centered ideology.\"",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Thursday signed an\u00a0executive order\u00a0targeting funding for programs at the\u00a0Smithsonian Institution\u00a0that contain what he characterizes as \"divisive, race-centered ideology\" in his latest broadside against a liberalism that has critiqued Western culture and values.",
      "The president said in the order that there has been a \"concerted and widespread\" effort over the past decade to rewrite American history by replacing \"objective facts\" with a \"distorted narrative driven by ideology rather than truth.\" He said this narrative has cast the \"founding principles\" of the U.S. in a \"negative light.\"",
      "\"The Smithsonian Institution has, in recent years, come under the influence of a divisive, race-centered ideology,\" Mr. Trump said in the order. \"This shift has promoted narratives that portray American and Western values as inherently harmful and oppressive.\" He pointed to a sculpture exhibit at the Smithsonian American Art Museum representing that \"[s]ocieties including the United States have used race to establish and maintain systems of power, privilege, and disenfranchisement.\"",
      "The order tasks Vice President JD Vance, who serves on the Smithsonian Institution's Board of Regents, with overseeing efforts to \"remove improper ideology\" from all areas of the institution, including its museums, education and research centers and the National Zoo.",
      "It marks Mr. Trump's latest salvo against cultural pillars of society, such as universities and art, that he sees as out of step with conservative sensibilities. He recently had himself installed as chairman of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts with the aim of overhauling programming, including the annual Kennedy Center Honors awards show. The administration also recently forced Columbia University to make a series of policy changes by threatening the Ivy League school with the loss of several hundred million dollars in federal funding.",
      "The executive order also hints at the return of statues and monuments of Confederate figures, many of which were taken down or replaced around the country after the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis in 2020 and the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement, which is detested by Trump and other conservatives.",
      "The president directed the secretary of the interior to determine whether, since Jan. 1, 2020, \"public monuments, memorials, statues, markers, or similar properties within the Department of the Interior's jurisdiction have been removed or changed to perpetuate a false reconstruction of American history, inappropriately minimize the value of certain historical events or figures, or include any other improper partisan ideology.\"",
      "The order also calls for improvements to Independence Hall in Philadelphia by July 4, 2026, in time for the 250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence.",
      "Mr. Trump singled out the National Museum of African American History and Culture, which opened in 2016 near the White House, the Women's History Museum, which is in development, and the American Art Museum for criticism.",
      "\"Museums in our Nation's capital should be places where individuals go to learn \u2014 not to be subjected to ideological indoctrination or divisive narratives that distort our shared history,\" he said in the order.",
      "Linda St. Thomas, the Smithsonian Institution's chief spokesperson, said in an email late Thursday, \"We have no comment for now.\"",
      "Under the order, Vance is to work with the White House budget office to make sure future funding for the Smithsonian Institution isn't spent on programs that \"degrade shared American values, divide Americans based on race, or promote programs or ideologies inconsistent with federal law and policy.\" The president also wants to ensure that the women's history museum celebrates women and not \"recognize men as women in any respect.\"",
      "The Smithsonian Institution is the world's largest museum, education and research complex. It consists of 21 museums and the National Zoo. Eleven museums are located along the National Mall in Washington.",
      "The institution was established by Congress with money from James Smithson, a British scientist who left his estate to the United States to found \"at Washington, under the name of the Smithsonian Institution, an establishment for the increase and diffusion of knowledge.\"",

    "summary": "A new study shows how cuts to foreign aid could lead to millions of HIV/AIDS deaths and soaring rates of infections, undoing decades of progress against the virus.",
    "story": [
      "Proposed cuts to global foreign aid, including slashing programs in the United States, could lead to millions of HIV deaths and soaring rates of infections around the world in the coming years, according to a new study.",
      "Published Wednesday in\u00a0The Lancet HIV journal, the modeling study estimates that by 2030, there could be between 4.4 million to 10.8 million additional new HIV infections in low- and middle-income countries and 770,000 to 2.9 million HIV-related deaths in children and adults. To estimate the impacts, the authors examined 26 countries that used foreign aid for HIV resources, including Albania, Cambodia, Colombia, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, South Africa and Sri Lanka.",
      "They noted that international funding has been crucial in reducing HIV transmissions and deaths, and that five countries \u2014 the U.S., U.K., France, Germany and the Netherlands \u2014 provide over 90% of international HIV funding, with the U.S. being by far the largest contributor. The U.S. committed $5.71 billion in 2023, or about 73% of total donor government funding, according to analysis by KFF, a nonpartisan health policy organization.",
      "But as of February, they authors report, donor nations have announced reductions in aid of between 8% and 70% between 2025 and 2026. The Trump administration froze foreign aid\u00a0spending, including funding for HIV/AIDS programs, soon after taking office, and the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, is spearheading major cutbacks.",
      "\"The United States has historically been the largest contributor to global efforts to treat and prevent HIV, but the current cuts to PEPFAR and USAID-supported programs have already disrupted access to essential HIV services including for antiretroviral therapy and HIV prevention and testing,\" co-lead study author Debra ten Brink of the Burnet Institute in Australia said in a news release.",
      "The study's authors said ongoing disruptions could undo decades of progress to end HIV/AIDS as a public health threat.",
      "\"Looking ahead, if other donor countries reduce funding, decades of progress to treat and prevent HIV could be unravelled. It is imperative to secure sustainable financing and avoid a resurgence of the HIV epidemic, which could have devastating consequences, not just in regions such as sub-Saharan Africa, but globally,\" said ten Brink.",
      "PEPFAR, or the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, was launched under then-President George W. Bush in 2003 and has invested over $100 billion in the global HIV/AIDS response over the years. According to the State Department, the program has saved the lives of\u00a026 million people since it began\u00a0\u2014 but its funding stopped after Secretary of State Marco Rubio ordered a\u00a0pause on foreign aid\u00a0earlier this year.",
      "\"PEPFAR is the largest commitment by any nation to address a single disease in history, enabled by strong bipartisan support across ten U.S. congresses and four presidential administrations, and through the American people's generosity,\" the government website HIV.gov reads. \"PEPFAR shows the power of what is possible through compassionate, cost-effective, accountable, and transparent American foreign assistance.\"",
      "Others have already warned about the devastation these cuts could bring to those who rely on it. Earlier this week, the UNAIDS chief warned that without funding, millions will die and the global AIDS pandemic will resurge.",
      "\"It is reasonable for the United States to want to reduce its funding over time, but the sudden withdrawal of lifesaving support is having a devastating impact,\" UNAIDS executive director Winnie Byanyima told reporters in Geneva. \"We urge for a reconsideration and an urgent restoration of services \u2014 lifesaving services.\"",
      "Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News, said the U.S. contributions play a key role that could not be easily replaced.",
      "\"Many of these countries rely heavily on the United States. Some of them between 50 and 70% of their budgets for HIV diagnosis, treatment and prevention is coming from the United States,\" she said on \"CBS Mornings Plus.\" \"There's not really any other country that can easily step in. And big picture, this is sort of like telling a surgeon in the middle of surgery to walk away. It's just not that easy to jump in and take over.\"",

    "summary": "President Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798\u200b to deport alleged Venezuelan gang members kicked off a legal battle.\u200b",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to deport Venezuelan migrants suspected of being members of the Tren de Aragua gang quickly kicked off a legal battle.",
      "A federal judge on March 15 issued a temporary restraining order that blocked the use of the 18th-century law. That order was upheld\u00a0by a federal appeals court on March 26. Two days later, the Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to lift the lower court orders.",
      "However, on the same day as the March 15 order, three flights carrying more than 200 Venezuelan men were flown to El Salvador to be held in the nation's maximum security prison.",
      "White House officials told CBS News last week that 137 of those Venezuelans were expelled under the Alien Enemies Act. Another 101 were removed under what officials described as \"regular\" proceedings under the 1952 Immigration and Nationality Act, including people who allegedly signed deportation papers after crossing the border illegally, officials said.",
      "Here's what to know about the Alien Enemies Act and how it has been used.",
      "What is the Alien Enemies Act of 1798?",
      "The Alien Enemies Act is one of the laws enacted as part of the Alien and Sedition Acts in 1798 under President John Adams and the Federalist-controlled Congress. At the time, the U.S. was anticipating a war with France.",
      "The law states that when the U.S. is at war or facing an \"invasion or predatory incursion\" by another nation, the president can detain and deport citizens of the enemy nation without due process.",
      "Two other laws in the Alien and Sedition Acts increased the number of years an immigrant needed to be in the U.S. to become a citizen and allowed the president to deport non-citizens deemed to be \"dangerous to the peace and safety of the United States,\" according to the National Archives. The fourth law, the Sedition Act, restricted speech that was considered critical of the government and was used to prosecute journalists and others.",
      "Opposition to the Alien and Sedition Acts contributed to the defeat of the Federalists in the election of 1800, which was won by Thomas Jefferson, the Democratic-Republican candidate.",
      "Jefferson allowed three of the four laws to expire, according to historians. But, there was no expiration written into the Alien Enemies Act, so it remained.",
      "The\u00a0Neighbors Not Enemies Act\u00a0is a proposed law that would repeal the Alien Enemies Act. It was reintroduced in January by Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Sen. Mazie Hirono of Hawaii, both Democrats.",
      "How is Trump using the Alien Enemies Act?",
      "In a proclamation\u00a0invoking the Alien Enemies Act on March 15, Mr. Trump declared that Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang, \"is perpetrating, attempting, and threatening an invasion or predatory incursion against the territory of the United States\" and that all Venezuelan citizens over 14 years old who are members of Tren de Aragua and are not U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents are \"liable to be apprehended, restrained, secured, and removed as Alien Enemies.\"",
      "Chief D.C. District Judge James Boasberg, whose order has temporarily blocked Mr. Trump from removing immigrants under the law, questioned the legality of its use in this case.",
      "\"Despite the President's determination otherwise, Tren de Aragua is not a 'foreign nation or government,' and its actions, however heinous, do not amount to an 'invasion' or a 'predatory incursion,'\" he wrote.",
      "In a March 19 briefing, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said that \"when you read the act ... a predatory incursion is absolutely what has happened with Tren de Aragua. They have been sent here by the hostile Maduro regime in Venezuela. And the president, immediately upon taking office, designated TdA as a foreign terrorist organization.\"",
      "When else has the Alien Enemies Act been used?",
      "The law has been invoked three other times in U.S. history: during the War of 1812, World War I and World War II.",
      "In 1812, the Madison administration required British nationals in the U.S. to report information to the government, including their age, addresses, the length of time they'd been in the U.S. and their occupations, according to a document signed by then-Secretary of State James Monroe.",
      "President Woodrow Wilson used the act in 1917 to limit the activities and speech of citizens of Germany and its allies in World War I. The use of the act led to the internment of more than 6,000 German nationals and \"other enemy aliens,\" the National Archives says.",
      "Then, after the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor in 1941, President Franklin D. Roosevelt invoked the Alien Enemies Act to detain citizens of Japan and the other Axis powers, Germany and Italy. But, Roosevelt also issued an executive order that allowed for the internment of Japanese Americans. More than 100,000 people of Japanese descent were sent to internment camps, which the federal government\u00a0formally apologized for\u00a0in 1988.",
      "In 1948, the Supreme Court ruled in Ludecke v. Watkins, a case involving a German national who was ordered to be removed in 1946 under the Alien Enemies Act, despite the end of fighting in World War II. In a 5-4 decision, the high court dismissed the German national's challenge, arguing \"a state of war\" remained and it was a matter of \"political judgment\" to determine if an individual could be removed under the Alien Enemies Act, which precludes judicial review.",
      "\"It is not for us to question a belief by the President that enemy aliens who were justifiably deemed fit subjects for internment during active hostilities do not lose their potency for mischief during the period of confusion and conflict which is characteristic of a state of war even when the guns are silent but the peace of Peace has not come,\" Justice Felix Frankfurter wrote in the opinion.",
      "In a dissent, Justice Hugo Black argued it is \"nothing but a fiction\" to say the U.S. was currently at war with Germany, and that \"the 1798 Act did not grant its extraordinary and dangerous powers to be used during the period of fictional wars.\"",

    "summary": "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy will cut 3,500 jobs from the Food and Drug Administration and 2,400 from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration plans to shrink the workforce of the Department of Health and Human Services by nearly a quarter, officials\u00a0announced Thursday, as part of a major restructuring of the department.",
      "Managers in several health agencies are now racing to figure out details on how the reorganization will impact their work.",
      "Trump officials in multiple parts of the department have said they are aiming to implement much of the changes quickly, often within 10 days.",
      "The changes amount to a workforce that will be around 33% smaller than it was at the end of the Biden administration. There were around 92,620 employees at the department in September 2024, according to federal\u00a0records, up from 81,917 at the end of the Trump administration.",
      "Some 10,000 full-time employees will be cut through the layoffs, in addition to other vacant positions that will not be replaced. Thousands of full-time staff have already left the department in recent months, in addition to thousands more contractor and fellowship positions that were also eliminated.",
      "\"When combined with HHS' other efforts, including early retirement and Fork in the Road, the restructuring results in a total downsizing from 82,000 to 62,000 full-time employees,\" the department said in a release, estimating that taxpayers would save $1.8 billion from the changes.",
      "A fact sheet shared with reporters and health officials says that \"no additional cuts are currently planned\" beyond those announced Thursday and in recent weeks.",
      "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy will cut 3,500 jobs from the Food and Drug Administration, according to the fact sheet. \"This reduction will not affect drug, medical device, or food reviewers, nor will it impact inspectors,\" the fact sheet says of the FDA changes.",
      "At the CDC, the department says the workforce will decline by around 2,400 employees, to \"focus on returning to its core mission of preparing for and respond to epidemics and outbreaks.\" One U.S. official said the cuts are not intended to undermine infectious disease work at the agency.",
      "The administration is also cutting 1,200 jobs from the National Institutes of Health.",
      "From the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the workforce will decline by \"approximately 300 employees, with a focus on reducing minor duplication\" at CMS, which had already been facing hiring limits due to a budget crunch in recent years. The reorganization will not impact Medicare or Medicaid services, it says.",
      "The department's reduction-in-force \"is primarily aimed at administrative positions,\" according to a letter sent Thursday to unions in mutliple HHS agencies, but \"will also target roles in high-cost regions\" and who are \"determined to be redundant or duplicative\" with others.",
      "\"Specific notices to employees may be sent as early as Friday, March 28,\" according to the letter, a copy of which was obtained by CBS News.",
      "\"This will be a painful period for HHS\"",
      "On \"CBS Mornings\" on Friday, Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News, said these cuts' impact on Americans' health remains to be seen but called the move \"very concerning.\"",
      "\"We're talking about agencies that touch so many parts of Americans' lives,\" she said. \"Will we see more food-borne disease outbreaks? Will we see delays in drug approvals or measures to improve our food supply? Which is, by the way, one of the agenda items for the new HHS secretary. Will we see a slowing in biomedical research?\"",
      "Gounder added China and European countries are already trying to recruit American scientists \u2014 \"Because scientists here are concerned about their job opportunities,\" she said.",
      "\"(These cuts are) very concerning, both in terms of the immediate impacts on health care, public health, and the longer term impacts on whether we will maintain our leadership in the health space,\" Gounder added.",
      "\"The entire federal workforce is downsizing now. So this will be a painful period for HHS,\" Kennedy said in a\u00a0video\u00a0announcement shared Thursday by the department.",
      "The Wall Street Journal\u00a0first reported details of the reorganization.",
      "Health officials had been bracing for steep cuts to be announced this week, as part of the sweeping restructuring architected with the White House's Department of Government Efficiency cost-cutting task force.",
      "Several health agency officials said they had seen stepped-up security measures coming into work Thursday morning. Managers have largely been in the dark about the changes, officials have said, aside from a handful of changes already announced within the department.",
      "One major change announced earlier this month would result in significantly cutting the number of general counsel offices, shrinking the ranks of the department's attorneys. One health official said the closures would amount to eliminating two-thirds of the HHS regional attorneys.",
      "Kennedy said earlier this week at the White House that the DOGE team headed by billionaire Elon Musk had \"identified extraordinary waste in my department and HHS.\" He cited what they considered duplicated work for communications, procurement, IT and HR departments across 40 operating divisions in HHS.",
      "\"We are with Elon's help eliminating the redundancies,\" Kennedy said Monday.",
      "Creating a new Administration for a Healthy America, and other changes",
      "One of Kennedy's biggest proposed changes is to create a new grouping of agencies called the Administration for a Healthy America, or AHA, which he says will save money and \"radically improve our quality of service.\"",
      "\"We're going to imbue the agency with a clear sense of mission to radically improve the health of Americans and to improve agency morale. We're going to eliminate an entire alphabet soup of departments and agencies while preserving their core functions,\" Kennedy said in the Thursday video.",
      "The new administration will consolidate work from the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health, Health Resources and Services Administration, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, Agency for Toxc Substances and Disease Registry and National Institute for Occupational Safety and Healthy \"into a new, unified entity,\" the department said.",
      "This new AHA agency also effectively combines many of Kennedy's \"Make America Healthy Again\" priorities under one roof, ranging from this year's update to federal dietary guidelines to public health statements about the use of fluoride. The work will be supported by the U.S. surgeon general, the fact sheet says.",
      "Officials within the Health Resources and Services Administration are expecting deep cuts from the merger, including to the agency's human resources and Provider Relief Bureau staff, two officials said.",
      "HRSA's Provider Relief Bureau had been charged with oversight of aid dollars during the COVID-19 pandemic in the health care industry. More than $1 billion in debts to the federal government could go unrecouped if the team's work is left unfinished, one official said.",
      "\"Our budget was already covered with the original funding and would have been recouped five times over, had we been allowed to do our job,\" the official said.",
      "The Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response, which was elevated into a separate agency under the Biden administration to oversee tasks like the pandemic stockpile, will be absorbed into the CDC.",
      "The two agencies are now scrambling to draw up plans by Saturday on how to merge the two, one health official said.",
      "Work from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, which had been bracing for as much as 90% of their staff to be cut by DOGE, will be merged with another agency to create the Office of Strategy.",
      "And the functions from the Administration for Community Living targeted at older adults and people with disabilities will be moved to other agencies, the department said, including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.",
      "Details of who exactly will be cut from the department within the agencies remain unclear, under the new reorganization plans. As of Thursday morning, multiple federal health officials said they had received little guidance from the department, aside from Kennedy's announcement.",
      "In his remarks in the video, Kennedy said that they were \"focused on paring away excess administrators while increasing the number of scientists and frontline health providers\" in the changes.",
      "\"We're going to streamline our agency and eliminate redundancies and invite everyone to align behind a simple, bold mission: I want every HHS employee to wake up every morning asking themselves, 'What can I do to restore American health today,'\" he added.",

      "Washington \u2014 National security adviser Mike Waltz and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth have so far survived the disclosure that they ran a high-level meeting on a military operation via a non-government app and inadvertently included a journalist.",
      "But President Trump continues to privately vent his irritation about it and is closely monitoring the news to see if the fallout is quieting down, according to sources familiar with the matter. The issue is \"still a hot potato,\" one official told CBS News.",
      "Sources said Mr. Trump has been more irritated that Waltz had the phone number for the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic, Jeffrey Goldberg, than he was about the use of the Signal app by top national security officials to discuss coming plans for a military strike on Houthi targets in Yemen. The magazine published its account on Monday.",
      "After Waltz admitted behind closed doors the authenticity of the reporting, White House officials debated whether he should resign, multiple sources said. But in the end, Waltz never made the offer, and Mr. Trump has not asked him to step down, several sources said. Publicly, Mr. Trump signaled his support for Waltz by calling him \"a good man\" who \"learned a lesson.\"",
      "The Signal situation, which Waltz called \"a mistake,\" hasn't been the only snafu for the president's team this week. Mr. Trump on Wednesday evening was unaware that four U.S. military members had gone missing the day before in Lithuania until a reporter asked him about it during an on-camera event in the Oval Office.",
      "The Army soldiers went missing early Tuesday during a military exercise. The Pentagon had publicly released information about the overseas incident at midday Wednesday, but staff hadn't yet told the president.",
      "Asked if he had been briefed, Mr. Trump told the reporter: \"No, I haven't,\" before moving on to the next press question. Mr. Trump typically chooses to not receive daily classified intelligence briefings, unlike past presidents. The search for the soldiers was continuing Thursday.",
      "On Thursday, the White House still hadn't ruled out ousting someone over the Signal incident, sources said. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Wednesday, the president \"continues to have confidence in his national security team.\"",
      "But Mr. Trump is still unhappy with Waltz, as are some other top White House and Cabinet officials, according to multiple people familiar with their thinking.",
      "Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Roger Wicker, a Republican, sent a letter Thursday asking the acting inspector general for the Defense Department to conduct an inquiry into the incident and brief senators.",
      "It was Waltz who added Goldberg to the Signal chain, sources said. Deputy national security adviser Alex Wong, who has been taking fire from staunch Trump supporters and the conservative media over the incident, wasn't involved in setting up the chat, although he was a participant in the conversation, sources said.",
      "Senior officials don't think there was anything nefarious in adding the journalist to the chat \u2014 they believe it was inadvertent. A review of the incident by Elon Musk continued Thursday.",

      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth",
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is the official who sent out the times and types of weapons that would be used in the attack ahead of time, according to screenshots of the conversation published by The Atlantic.

      "As the secretary of defense, Hegseth is the chief defense policy adviser to the president, as well as the second person in the chain of command to Mr. Trump.",
      "Speaking at the White House on Wednesday, March, 26, President Trump said Hegseth \"did nothing wrong\" and suggested that Hegseth himself could lead a review into whether any of the information should have been classified. \"Sure, I'll ask him to do that,\" Mr. Trump said. \"There are a lot of ways to answer that question. But I'd certainly ask him to take a look at it.\"",
      "Vice President JD Vance",
      "Vice President JD Vance also makes an appearance in the group chat, offering his concerns about the operation, such as risking a spike in oil prices. In the chat, Vance's account said he was \"willing to support the consensus of the team and keep these concerns to myself,\" while saying \"there is a strong argument for delaying this a month.\"",
      "Since The Atlantic articles published, Vance said Goldberg \"oversold what he had.\"",

      "CIA Director John Ratcliffe",
      "CIA Director John Ratcliffe's name appears in the chat as well, and he confirmed it was him in testimony before the Senate this week. The Ratcliffe comments in the chat included saying that from a CIA perspective, \"we are mobilizing assets to support now but a delay would not negatively impact us and additional time would be used to identify better starting points for coverage on Houthi leadership.\"",
      "In his congressional testimony, Ratcliffe said his \"communications, to be clear, in the Signal message group were entirely permissible and lawful and did not include classified information.\"",
      "\"TG\" \u2014 Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/epa-trump-presidential-exemption-clean-air/",
    "published": "Thu, 27 Mar 2025 22:58:00 -0400",
    "summary": "The EPA announced that it would speed up the process by which industry can bypass provisions of the Clean Air Act by emailing President Trump.",
    "story": [
      "In its latest move to dismantle environmental regulation under the Trump Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency announced Monday that it would speed up the process by which industry can bypass provisions of the Clean Air Act and other rules designed to limit air pollution with a simple offer: email us for a presidential exemption.",
      "Businesses that would like to avoid complying with certain EPA rules can email the agency with a reason justifying why it should be allowed an exemption and how it is in the best interest of the national security of the United States. According to the EPA website, all emails do not entitle the submitter to an exemption, but the president \"will make a decision\" based on the merits of the request.",
      "The EPA said in a statement to CBS News that section 112(i)(4) of the Clean Air Act \"specifically states that the President may exempt any stationary source 'if the President determines that the technology to implement such standard is not available and that it is in the national security interests of the United States to do so.'\"",
      "But many in the environmental sector were stunned by the proposal.",
      "\"This section of the Clean Air Act is designed to protect people from exposure to the most toxic chemicals \u2014 the ones that are dangerous in the smallest concentrations,\" environmental law expert Michael Gerrard said in an email. \"It's shocking that EPA is now providing industries with a simple form they can use to get out of these rules and keep on emitting these harmful substances.\"",
      "For years, heavy industry has abided by rules and regulations set by the EPA to comply with the Clean Air Act, which has often led companies to invest heavily in expensive technology to reduce toxic air emissions, an expense critics have often derided as onerous.",
      "So, on March 12, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced the \"greatest day of deregulation\" and said the agency was reviewing 31 rules that, he claims, amount to \"trillions of dollars in regulatory costs and hidden taxes.\" The mission of the rollback is to reduce costly regulations that burden the industry. By reviewing the rules, Zeldin said in an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal that \"As we unleash American energy, revitalize domestic manufacturing, cut costs for families, and restore the rule of law, we do so with the firm belief that America's greatest days lie ahead.\"",
      "The rollbacks were cheered by Republican leaders and industry alike, \"The action taken by the Trump EPA today is exactly what needs to be done to secure American energy dominance and restore the communities who have been negatively impacted by regulations and overreach from the Biden administration,\" Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, a Republican from West Virginia, said in a statement. Capito is also the chair of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, which oversees the EPA.",
      "It could take years for the agency to finalize new rules to reduce the costs of environmental compliance, let alone the legal challenges it will face. In an attempt to fast-track this process, the EPA is offering this unique \"hall pass,\" as some describe the presidential exemption, to enable companies to stop complying now, rather than years later when the updated rules are complete.",
      "\"Under Administrator Zeldin, the EPA is now the Environmental Polluter Agency. His invitation for companies to put arsenic and mercury into the air if they claim it enhances 'national security' is a vast abuse of the President's given authority,\" Sen. Jeff Merkley, a Democrat from Oregon, said in a statement to CBS News. Merkley also sits on the Senate Committee on the Environment and Public Works and its first priority is to review legislation on air pollution.",
      "Merkley's fellow committee member, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat from Rhode Island, had similar concerns, \"Trump and his puppets at EPA are giving the most toxic polluters carte blanche to poison our air,\" he said in an email to CBS News. \" As corrupt as this is, no one can have any confidence that either the technology or national security standards will be met.\"",
      "Rep. Zoe Lofgren, a Democrat from California and the ranking member of the House Science Committee, said in a statement, \"The idea that some obscure, rarely-used provision of the Clean Air Act empowers EPA to grant sweeping exemptions to polluting companies because they send an email is preposterous. It's clearly illegal \u2014 no doubt there.\"",
      "Environmental law experts believe the policy will be challenged in court. \"I've never seen anything like this before,\" said Mary Nichols, a distinguished counsel for the Emmett Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at UCLA Law School. Nichols says because the statute is so broad, it is subject to abuse. \"I think the likely first lawsuit is a blanket challenge to the entire procedure,\" she said.",
      "CBS News asked the EPA if it could explain how all the emails will be processed and assessed, whether each one will be individually considered by President Trump, and how many emails the agency has already received, but the EPA did not address those questions.",
      "But sending the email request to the EPA does create a paper trail that companies may want to consider. \"This is something that we will fight to make public,\" said Joe Bonfiglio, executive director of the U.S. region of the Environmental Defense Fund, a prominent environmental nonprofit. \"For companies who take advantage of this hall pass, there are organizations like ours who will make sure communities around those facilities know about the requests.\"",
      "Companies have until March 31 to email the EPA with the required information for the president to consider.",

      "Rubio said that at least 300 students had their visas revoked. \"We do it every day. Every time I find one of these lunatics, I take away their visa,\" he said.",
      "It's unclear if these students were notified of the revocations in advance.",
      "Rubio's remarks came in response to a question about\u00a0Tufts University graduate student Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish national who was taken into custody by Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Massachusetts on Tuesday.",
      "A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said Ozturk had \"engaged in activities in support of Hamas,\" but did not provide details about her alleged activities. Ozturk was one of four university students who was listed as the author of a March 2024 campus newspaper opinion piece urging Tufts to adopt resolutions from the student government to \"acknowledge the Palestinian genocide\" and \"divest from companies with direct or indirect ties to Israel.\" That article does not mention Hamas.",
      "Ozturk is currently being held at a federal detention facility in Louisiana.",
      "The university said in a statement that she had been returning from a Ramadan iftar dinner when she was detained.\u00a0Surveillance video\u00a0showed she was taken into custody by six ICE agents who appear wearing masks and plain clothes and driving unmarked cars.",
      "A\u00a0University of Alabama doctoral student\u00a0originally from Iran was also taken into custody on Tuesday, according to the university. A search of an ICE database showed the student, Alireza Doroudi, was in custody. It was unclear as of Thursday why he was being detained or where he was being held.",
      "Both Ozturk and Doroudi were in the U.S. on F-1 visas, which allow international students to enter the country to study full-time at American universities.",
      "Labor unions representing university professors on Wednesday filed a lawsuit claiming the detentions of noncitizen students and faculty is a violation of the First Amendment, as is the threat to remove Columbia University's $400 million in federal funds if the university did not make changes.",
      "The lawsuit cites President Trump's March 4 post on social media that those participating in \"illegal protests\" would be arrested, saying that \"under First Amendment doctrine, the category 'illegal protests' is carefully circumscribed.\"",
      "\"Nevertheless, the post did not say how federal officials would identify 'illegal protests' or 'agitators' for purposes of implementing the President's stated policy, nor did it otherwise provide guidance to faculty, students, or administrators seeking to exercise (or allow others to exercise) First Amendment rights while avoiding the risk of imprisonment, deportation, expulsion, arrest, or loss of \"[a]ll\" federal funding,\" the lawsuit claims.",
      "The high-profile detentions of Ozturk and Doroudi  followed the detention earlier this month of Mahmoud Khalil, a former Columbia University grad student who had been active in the 2024 campus pro-Palestinian protests. Khalil is a Palestinian born in Syria with a green card, or legal permanent residency, not a student visa. Khalil's attorney, Amy Greer, said at the time of his detention that an ICE agent said\u00a0they were acting on a State Department order to revoke his student visa, but when they were informed that Khalil was in the U.S. as a permanent resident with a green card, the agent said they were revoking that, too.",
      "After he was taken into custody, the government said it was invoking a rarely used section of U.S. immigration law to justify Khalil's detention and eventual deportation that allows the secretary of state to make noncitizens subject to deportation if he determines their presence and activities threaten the foreign policy interests of the U.S., citing alleged support for Hamas, a U.S.-designated terror group. CBS News has not found evidence that Khalil has said he supports Hamas.",
      "In a court filing earlier this week, the government also alleged that\u00a0Khalil failed to disclose on his immigration forms\u00a0his involvement with UNRWA, the United Nations agency for Palestine refugees; the Syria office of the British embassy in Beirut; and a group known as Columbia University Apartheid Divest.",
      "The government also said in the filing that claims by Khalil's attorneys that his detention violated the First Amendment were a \"red herring.\"",
      "Khalil is currently in custody in a federal detention facility in Louisiana.",
      "Rubio said after Khalil was taken into custody that the administration would be revoking the visas and green cards \"of Hamas supporters in America so they can be deported.\"",
      "When asked on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" if Rubio could provide evidence to support a link to terrorism, or whether Khalil was simply espousing a controversial political point of view, Rubio cited news footage, saying \"these guys take over entire buildings, they vandalize colleges.\"",
      "Rubio said Khalil is \"going to leave \u2014 and so are others.\"",
      "\"We're going to keep doing it,\" Rubio said about revoking visas.",

      "Billboards such as those spotted in the Metro Detroit area this week read, \"Tariffs are a tax on your grocery bill.\"",
      "CBS News Detroit reached out to the Government of Canada, which paid for the ad, on Wednesday. John Babcock, spokesperson for Global Affairs Canada, sent a statement Thursday, saying that the billboards were placed in Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, as well as Washington, D.C., and surrounding areas.",
      "\"The Government of Canada has launched an educational campaign to inform Americans of the economic impacts of tariffs. The campaign is a strategic investment in Canada's long-term economic interests, and its trade relationship with the United States,\" Babcock said. \"Tariffs are a tax on hard-working Americans in their daily lives. They lead to increased costs on everyday essentials, including fuel and groceries. The purpose is to increase the understanding of the American public and to counter misinformation.\"",
      "President Trump's tariffs were answered by Canada, who then implemented tariffs against the United States. Mr. Trump proposed 25% tariffs on the country and on all steel and aluminum imports. In response, Canada threatened to implement nearly $21 billion in retaliatory tariffs.",
      "Mr. Trump said he would raise the tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum imports to 50%, but retracted that proposal and stayed at the 25% rate.",
      "Earlier this month, Ontario announced it was adding a 25% surcharge on all electricity exports\u00a0sent to the U.S. That surcharge would have affected consumers and businesses in Michigan, Minnesota and New York, but then Ontario Premier Doug Ford announced Canada would suspend that plan and the Trump administration backed off doubling Canadian steel and aluminum tariffs.",
      "In his latest move, Mr. Trump imposed 25% tariffs on vehicles and auto parts imported into the U.S. on Wednesday. Experts say targeting imported cars could also strain ties with key trading U.S. partners, including Canada, Japan, Mexico, South Korea and Europe. Half of the cars sold in the U.S. are manufactured within the country. Among imports, about half come from Mexico and Canada, with Japan, South Korea and Germany also major suppliers.",

    "published": "Thu, 27 Mar 2025 17:20:19 -0400",
    "summary": "Sen. Roger Wicker, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, penned a letter seeking an expedited inspector general report on the Signal chat leak.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Sen. Roger Wicker, a Mississippi Republican and chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, on Thursday requested an expedited inspector general investigation into the leak of a sensitive Signal group chat about strikes in Yemen that has stunned Washington in recent days.",
      "Earlier this week, Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor of The Atlantic, revealed that he was added to the group on the encrypted messaging app and observed as top Trump officials discussed sensitive plans to strike targets in Yemen. On Wednesday, a day after top administration officials claimed that \"no war plans\" were discussed, The Atlantic\u00a0published screenshots of more texts that showed Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth provided operational details about the timing of the strikes and the weapons and aircraft that would carry them out.",
      "Wicker on Thursday announced a letter had been sent to Steven Stebbins, the acting Inspector General of the Department of Defense, requesting an inquiry into the \"facts and circumstances surrounding the above referenced Signal chat incident, including an accounting of what was communicated and any remedial actions taken as a result.\" The letter also asked for clarity on the Defense Department's policies surrounding employees sharing \"sensitive and non-classified information on non-goverment networks and electronic applications\" and whether this chat violated them.",
      "Speaking to reporters at the Capitol Wednesday, Wicker previewed the committee's path forward. He said he and ranking member Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat, would be sending a letter asking the administration to expedite an investigation by the Defense Department's Office of Inspector General and provide the findings to the committee. The chairman said another letter to the administration would seek \"to get ground truth,\" and he noted that the committee wants to determine whether the published transcript is accurate.",
      "Wicker also noted Wednesday to reporters that the information that has been published \"appears to me to be of such a sensitive nature that, based on my knowledge, I would have wanted it classified.\" Intelligence officials again said in testimony on Wednesday that no information in the chats was classified, an assertion that has been met with intense skepticism from Democrats and former government officials, given the nature of the information that Hegseth disclosed.",
      "Separately, a federal judge in Washington, D.C., on Thursday ordered the administration officials who were part of the Signal chat to preserve all messages exchanged on the platform from March 11 to March 15 \u2014 the time frame during which the app was used to discuss the strikes in Yemen.",
      "The order from U.S. District Judge James Boasberg represented agreement between the Justice Department and American Oversight, a watchdog group that had sued and claimed officials failed to follow federal recordkeeping laws. Ahead of the hearing, the Justice Department submitted a declaration from a top lawyer at the Treasury Department who said the messages had been preserved.",
      "\"We're committed to preserving what the agencies have,\" Amber Richer, a Justice Department lawyer, told Boasberg.",
      "She said the department is working with the agencies to determine the records they have and ensure they are maintained as required by law.",
      "The judge, who has faced attacks by the president over his decision in a separate case, told the parties that the government is \"moving toward implementing what the plaintiffs seek.\"",
      "\"What I see here is a real chance to reach common ground on a number of the issues raised,\" Boasberg said.",
      "The Trump administration fired the inspector general at the Defense Department shortly after President Trump took office, part of a broader purge of internal watchdogs at agencies across the government. The Pentagon's IG office is currently being overseen on an acting basis by Stebbins, formerly the principal deputy inspector general. Asked whether he had confidence that the Pentagon would comply with his request for an inspector general probe given the vacancy, Wicker said he did.",
      "Wicker said that he and Reed are seeking a classified briefing to the Armed Services Committee \"relatively soon\" with a senior administration official.",
      "\"The chair and the ranking member are working together on a bipartisan basis, as we've always tried to do,\" Wicker said.",
      "The Mississippi Republican defended the mission at the center of the group chat, saying \"the strike on the Houthis was a hugely successful mission, of which I greatly approved.\" He said it was \"a shame that this security question is distracting the public from \u2014 and all of us from \u2014 a big success internationally.\"",
      "Earlier in the day, Wicker said he did not believe Hegseth should resign. Asked later about any consequences he should face, Wicker said he's \"glad, in this case, no real damage was done.\"",
      "\"The fact is that the plans for the strike, the timing, the locations, were not revealed to the enemy, and it was a very successful operation,\" Wicker said. \"If, early on in this administration, there were mistakes, I would hope they can be rectified. ... If mistakes were made, I think we're all human, and they should be acknowledged.\"",

I have asked Elise, as one of my biggest Allies, to remain in Congress to help me deliver Historic Tax Cuts, GREAT Jobs, Record Economic Growth, a Secure Border, Energy Dominance, Peace Through Strength, and much more, so we can MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. With a very tight Majority, I don't want to take a chance on anyone else running for Elise's seat.\"",
      "Earlier Thursday, CBS News reported her nomination was in jeopardy as GOP pressure mounted for her to back away from the position.",
      "Multiple sources told CBS News there were ongoing discussions about whether she should withdraw from consideration. Stefanik had not resigned from her seat in Congress, and with the narrow majority in the House, Republicans need all the votes they can muster. House Speaker Mike Johnson was aware of some of the conversations about Stefanik that took place Thursday.",
      "Republicans hold just 218 seats in the House, while Democrats hold 213 seats. There are currently four vacant seats. After the president's announcement, Johnson acknowledged the Republicans' slim majority on social media as he hailed Stefanik's \"selfless decision.\"",
      "\"It is well known Republicans have a razor-thin House majority, and Elise's agreement to withdraw her nomination will allow us to keep one of the toughest, most resolute members of our Conference in place to help drive forward President Trump's America First policies,\" Johnson said on social platform X, calling Stefanik \"a great leader and a devoted patriot.\"",
      "The speaker said he would invite Stefanik to return to the House Republicans' leadership team immediately.",
      "Democrats pounced on the withdrawal, with House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries noting Mr. Trump's margin of victory in Stefanik's district during November's presidential election.",
      "\"Donald Trump won the Elise Stefanik district by 21 points in November 2024. He withdrew her nomination to be U.N. Ambassador because the extremists are afraid they will lose the special election to replace her,\" Jeffries said in a statement. \"The Republican agenda is extremely unpopular, they are crashing the economy in real time and House Republicans are running scared. What happened to their so-called mandate?\"",
      "In the Senate, there was little doubt Stefanik would have the votes to be confirmed. Her nomination was advanced by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Jan. 30.",
      "Republicans had discussed waiting to take further action on Stefanik's nomination to see how the Florida special elections go on April 1 for two vacant GOP seats. Both are expected to remain in Republican control.",

      "Stefanik\u00a0has been among President Trump's most faithful allies and was the second nominee he announced for a Senate-confirmed position after the 2024 election. She was elected to Congress in 2014 and rose to House GOP leadership to be the highest-ranking Republican woman in the House.",

The tour included two crowded cell blocks, the armory and an isolation unit.",
      "Noem's trip to the prison \u2014 where inmates are packed into cells and never allowed outside \u2014 comes as the Trump administration seeks to show it is deporting people it describes as the \"worst of the worst.\"",

      "Noem notably dodged questions by the press about if the Venezuelan deportees were going to be in the prison indefinitely and if the Venezuelans could ever be brought back to the U.S. if a court orders the administration to do so.",
      "\"We're going to let the courts play out,\" she told reporters following the visit.",
      "Noem toured an area holding some of the Venezuelans accused of being gang members. In the sweltering building, the men in white T-shirts and shorts stared silently from their cell, then were heard shouting an indiscernible chant when she left.",
      "In a cell block holding Salvadoran prisoners, about a dozen were lined up by guards near the front of their cell and told to remove their T-shirts and face masks. The men were heavily tattooed, some bearing the letters MS, for the Mara Salvatrucha gang, on their chests.",
      "After listening to Salvadoran officials, Noem turned her back to the cell and recorded a video message.",
      "If an immigrant commits a crime, \"this is one of the consequences you could face,\" Noem said. \"First of all, do not come to our country illegally. You will be removed and you will be prosecuted. But know that this facility is one of the tools in our toolkit that we will use if you commit crimes against the American people.\"",
      "Noem also met with El Salvador President Nayib Bukele, a populist who has gained right-wing admiration in the U.S. due to his crackdown on the country's gangs, despite the democratic and due process implications that have come with it.",
      "\"This unprecedented relationship we have with El Salvador is going to be a model for other countries on how they can work with America,\" Noem said to reporters Wednesday.",
      "Since taking office, Noem has frequently been front and center in efforts to highlight the immigration crackdown. She took part in immigration enforcement operations, rode horses with Border Patrol agents and was the face of a television campaign warning people in the country illegally to self-deport.",
      "Noem's Wednesday visit is part of a three-day trip. She'll also travel to Colombia and Mexico.",
      "The Venezuelans were removed from the U.S. this month after Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 and said the U.S. was being invaded by the Tren de Aragua gang. The Alien Enemies Act gives the president wartime powers and allows noncitizens to be deported without the opportunity to go before an immigration or federal court judge.",

They no longer appear in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's online detainee locator and have not appeared before a judge in El Salvador.",
      "The Trump administration refers to them as the \"worst of the worst\" but hasn't identified who was deported or provided evidence that they're gang members.",
      "Relatives of some of the deportees have categorically denied any gang affiliation. The Venezuelan government and a group called the Families of Immigrants Committee in Venezuela hired a lawyer to help free those held in El Salvador. A lawyer for the firm, which currently represents about 30 Venezuelans, said they aren't gang members and have no criminal records.",
      "The U.S. government has acknowledged that many do not have such records.",
      "Flights were in the air March 15 when a federal judge issued a verbal order temporarily barring the deportations and ordered planes to return to the U.S.",
      "The Trump administration has argued that the judge's verbal directions did not count, that only his written order needed to be followed and that it couldn't apply to flights that had already left the U.S.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters that about 261 people were deported on the flights, including 137 under the Alien Enemies Act.",
      "Bukele opened the prison in 2023 as he made the Central American country's stark, harsh prisons a trademark of his fight against crime. The facility has eight sprawling pavilions and can hold up to 40,000 inmates. Each cell can fit 65 to 70 prisoners.",
      "Prisoners can't have visitors. There are no workshops or educational programs.",
      "El Salvador hasn't had diplomatic relations with Venezuela since 2019, so the Venezuelans imprisoned there do not have consular support from their government.",
      "Video released by El Salvador's government after the deportees' arrival showed men exiting airplanes onto an airport tarmac lined by officers in riot gear. The men, who had their hands and ankles shackled, struggled to walk as officers pushed their heads down.",

      "NOAA's Office of Space Commerce is tasked with helping to manage commercial and military satellite traffic in space to help guard against collisions, as well as licensing and regulating commercial satellite systems. The office has recently gotten attention around Washington as a key government office for commercial space companies.",
      "Its already small team lost eight employees in the initial round of layoffs in late February, representing around 30% of its staff, according to multiple sources. Since then, three staffers in leadership roles were brought back, but lawmakers still worry about the impact.",
      "The members of Congress are calling for all fired employees within the office to be reinstated permanently. Earlier this month, fired employees were placed on administrative leave after their firings were blocked by a federal court ruling.",
      "In a letter to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, obtained by CBS News, lawmakers including the committee's ranking member Zoe Lofgren, of California, say the firings could compromise the office's public safety programs and risk hurting U.S. leadership in space.",
      "They also question whether there's a conflict of interest given Trump adviser and DOGE leader Elon Musk's stake in SpaceX.",
      "\"If OSC is gutted, the harm to America's economy, its national security, and its public safety will leave everyone worse off \u2014 except perhaps for SpaceX, whose size and scale will allow it to mitigate the damage done to the rest of the commercial space sector,\" reads the letter in part.",

    "published": "Thu, 27 Mar 2025 10:26:08 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump on Wednesday said he is imposing a 25% tariff on automobiles not manufactured in the U.S.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Wednesday said he will put a 25% tariff on vehicles and auto parts imported into the\u00a0U.S., escalating his administration's use of aggressive trade measures in an effort to boost domestic manufacturers.",
      "\"This will continue to spur growth like you haven't seen before,\" Mr. Trump said from the Oval Office Wednesday afternoon. \"We'll effectively be charging a 25% tariff. But if you build your car in the United States, there is no tariff.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said the new auto tariffs will take effect on April 2 and that the U.S. would start collecting the duties the following day. The president added he believes the new import duty could raise between $600 billion and $1 trillion in revenue for the U.S. over the next two years.",
      "\"This number will be used to reduce debt greatly,\" Mr. Trump said. \"Basically I view it as reducing taxes and reducing debt.\"",
      "White House staff secretary Will Scharf, who stood next to Mr. Trump during the announcement, offered a more conservative estimate of how much the new auto tariffs would raise, predicting roughly $100 billion in new revenue.",
      "Mr. Trump also reiterated his goal of making interest paid on auto loans tax deductible, while noting that such a deduction would apply only to cars made in the U.S.",
      "Tax deductions are generally only employed by high-income Americans because most taxpayers take the standard deduction, which means tax-deductible auto loans wouldn't impact low- or middle-income households.",
      "Meanwhile, car prices are \"likely to rise significantly\" for consumers, according to Rella Suskin, equity analyst at Morningstar in a Thursday research note. Suskin added, \"Domestically produced vehicles are expected to gain market share, but very few, even from US-based manufacturers, are made with 100% U.S. content.\"",
      "Automaker shares take a hit",
      "The latest salvo of tariffs comes after Mr. Trump earlier this month gave a one-month exemption to U.S. automakers from the round of import duties that took effect on March 4.",
      "Because tariffs are taxes on imports that are largely passed onto U.S. consumers, they can cause households to cut back on spending and dampen economic growth, according to experts.",
      "Shares of the Big Three U.S. automakers \u2014 Ford, General Motors and Stellantis \u2014 all sank after Mr. Trump announced the new tariffs. In Thursday morning trading, Ford's shares slipped 38 cents, or 3.7% to $9.92, while GM tumbled 7.3%. Stellantis shed 2.6%.",
      "Tesla shares, which have slumped this year because of disappointing sales and\u00a0consumer unhappiness\u00a0over CEO Elon Musk's involvement with the Trump administration, rose $7.13, or 2.6%, to $279.19. Tesla manufactures its vehicles within the U.S., although Musk said on social media that the electric vehicle maker will still feel an impact. Some Tesla parts are imported from other countries.",
      "\"Important to note that Tesla is NOT unscathed here. The tariff impact on Tesla is still significant,\" Musk wrote on X.",
      "In a statement Wednesday night, Matt Blunt, president of the American Automotive Policy Council, a U.S. trade group that represents the Big Three, said that \"U.S. Automakers are committed to President Trump's vision of increasing automotive production and jobs in the U.S. and will continue to work with the Administration on durable policies that help Americans.\"",
      "Tesla warns that Trump's trade war could hurt U.S. automakers",
      "Tesla warns that Trump's trade war could hurt U.S. automakers",
      "Blunt added, \"In particular, it is critical that tariffs are implemented in a way that avoids raising prices for consumers and that preserves the competitiveness of the integrated North American automotive sector that has been a key success of the President's USMCA agreement.\"",
      "When reached for comment, Stellantis directed CBS News to the AAPC's statement.",
      "Mr. Trump has long said that tariffs on auto imports would be a\u00a0defining policy\u00a0of his presidency, betting that the costs created by the taxes would lead both American and foreign automakers to relocate production to U.S. soil.",
      "Automakers with U.S. plants still depend on Canada, Mexico and other nations for parts and finished vehicles. Because booting up manufacturing facilities would take time, in the medium term domestic auto prices would likely increase and car sales decline, experts say.",
      "Car prices could jump",
      "One analysis of Mr. Trump's tariffs estimated that auto prices could rise as much as\u00a0$12,200 for some models\u00a0due to the new import duties, according to a report from Anderson Economic Group, a Michigan-based economic consultancy.",
      "\"In the long-run, this could boost domestic investment and production. In the short-run, however, it will be inflationary and, assuming that domestic producers respond by substantially increasing their own prices, could make new vehicles something of a luxury item,\" Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist with Capital Economics, said in a report.",
      "Targeting imported cars also could strain ties with key trading U.S. partners including Canada, Japan, Mexico and South Korea, as well as Europe.",
      "\"I deeply regret the U.S. decision to impose tariffs on EU automotive exports,\" Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, said in a social media post. \"Tariffs are taxes \u2014 bad for businesses, worse for consumers in the U.S. and the EU. The EU will continue to seek negotiated solutions, while safeguarding its economic interests.\"",
      "About 50% of cars sold in the U.S. are manufactured within the country. Among imports, about half come from Mexico and Canada, with Japan, South Korea and Germany, also major suppliers.",
      "Other groups expressed support for the new auto tariffs.",
      "\"Auto production is the bedrock of a nation's manufacturing ecosystem,\" Scott Paul, president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing, an industry trade group, said in a statement posted social media. \"We've seen it eroded in the U.S. over the past four decades first by Asian imports then by NAFTA. A 25% tariff on auto imports isn't the only way to spur more auto plants here, but it is in my view necessary.\"",
      "Shawn Fain, president of United Auto Workers, said the tariffs could bolster job growth in the U.S. \"With these tariffs, thousands of good-paying blue-collar auto jobs could be brought back to working-class communities across the United States within a matter of months, simply by adding additional shifts or lines in a number of underutilized auto plants,\" he said.",

    "summary": "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and other Trump officials allegedly used Signal for a group chat to discuss a highly sensitive operation.",
    "story": [
      "An encrypted messaging app called Signal is drawing attention and questions after top Trump officials \u2014 including Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Vice President JD Vance \u2014 allegedly used the service to discuss a highly sensitive military operation while inadvertently including The Atlantic's editor-in-chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, in the chat.",
      "On Monday, Goldberg published a piece in The Atlantic about how he was added to an 18-person chat on Signal earlier this month to discuss military strikes in Yemen, writing that at first he \"didn't think it could be real.\"",
      "The National Security Council said the messages seem to be \"authentic,\" in a statement to CBS News after the story was published.",
      "The use of Signal to discuss sensitive military operations is raising questions about the app, including its level of security against hackers and other bad actors. It's an app that many Americans may not be familiar with, given that Signal had about 70 million users in 2024, a fraction of the 1 billion active monthly users of Apple's iMessage, according to the national security publication Lawfare.",
      "President Trump told reporters on Tuesday that he had asked national security adviser Mike Waltz, who Goldberg said added him to the group chat, to \"immediately study\" the use of Signal by government officials.",
      "Here's what to know about the service.",
      "What is Signal?",
      "Signal is an encrypted service for text messaging, but it can also handle phone and video calls, making it a versatile app for talking on a secure channel with others. Up to 1,000 people can join a group chat, and messages can be set to disappear after a period of time.",
      "Signal has been gaining users because of its end-to-end encryption, which is boosting its \"adoption during uncertain times or specific events which reinforce its position as the go-to communication service,\" PP Foresight analyst Paolo Pescatore told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Its encryption prevents any third-party from viewing conversation content or listening in on calls. In other words, messages and calls sent on Signal are scrambled and only the sender and recipient at each end will have the key to decipher them.",
      "Unlike another popular messaging app, Telegram, encryption on Signal is turned on by default. Signal also says it doesn't collect or store any sensitive information.",
      "\"Signal messages and calls cannot be accessed by us or other third parties because they are always end-to-end encrypted, private and secure,\" according to the service.",
      "Signal didn't immediately reply to a request for comment about the Trump administration's use of the app.",
      "Who owns Signal?",
      "Signal is owned by the nonprofit Signal Foundation, which was set up by co-founders Moxie Marlinspike and Brian Acton to support the app's operations as well as \"investigate the future of private communication,\" according to the foundation's website. The foundation says it is a nonprofit \"with no advertisers or investors, sustained only by the people who use and value it.\"",
      "The foundation's board has five members, including Marlinspike and Acton, who co-founded WhatsApp and donated $50 million to set up the foundation.",
      "The Signal app was created more than a decade ago by Marlinspike, an entrepreneur, who was briefly head of product security at Twitter after he sold his mobile security startup, called Whisper Systems, to the social media company in 2011. Marlinspike merged two existing open source apps, one for texting and one for voice calls, to create Signal.",
      "Can Signal be hacked?",
      "Signal touts the privacy of its service, and experts agree it is more secure than conventional texting.",
      "But they also caution that it could be hacked. And in February 2025, the National Security Agency sent out an operational security special bulletin to its employees cautioning them of vulnerabilities in the Signal app, according to internal NSA documents obtained by CBS News.",
      "\"A vulnerability has been identified in the Signal Messenger Application. The use of Signal by common targets of surveillance and espionage activity has made the application a high value target to intercept sensitive information,\" the internal bulletin says.",
      "Signal\u00a0responded\u00a0to the bulletin in a social media post Tuesday, saying the NSA's \"memo used the term 'vulnerability' in relation to Signal-but it had nothing to do with Signal's core tech. It was warning against phishing scams targeting Signal users.\"",
      "\"Phishing isn't new, and it's not a flaw in our encryption or any of Signal's underlying technology,\" the company said. \"Phishing attacks are a constant threat for popular apps and websites.\"",
      "Government officials have used Signal for organizational correspondence, such as scheduling sensitive meetings. But in the Biden administration, people who had permission to download it on their White House-issued phones were instructed to use the app sparingly, according to a former national security official who served in the administration.",
      "\"Unlike other end-to-end encryption messaging services, Signal does boast a rich range of features,\" Pescatore said. \"However, hackers are always on the prowl to find weaknesses and use apps maliciously.\"",
      "What is Signal typically used for?",
      "Because of its end-to-end encryption, Signal is often used by national security and intelligence professionals, as well as activists, among others, according to Lawfare.",
      "A recent\u00a0Associated Press review\u00a0found that encrypted messaging apps are increasingly popular with government officials, with some using government mobile phone numbers, while others registered their accounts to personal numbers.",
      "Are there legal issues for government officials using Signal?",
      "Possibly, yes. Sharing sensitive national security details over Signal could violate the Espionage Act, CBS News national security contributor Sam Vinograd, who served in former President Barack Obama's Homeland Security Department, said Tuesday.",
      "\"By communicating classified information on a nonsecure platform like Signal, senior U.S. government officials ... increased the chance that foreign governments could get access to sensitive operational security plans \u2014 and that could put our own troops in harm's way,\" Vinograd said.",
      "While Mr. Trump told reporters from the Oval Office on Tuesday that \"I don't know anything about Signal, I wasn't involved in this,\" he indicated that other branches of government use the app.",
      "\"I hear it's used by a lot of groups, I hear it's used by the media a lot,\" he said. \"A lot of the military, I think successfully. Sometimes people can get onto those things, that's one of the prices you pay when you're not sitting in the Situation Room with no phones, which is always the best, frankly. The best is to be there.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said Signal is the \"No. 1 device or app that is used\" that he had asked Waltz to explore its use by government officials.",
      "Meanwhile, Democratic lawmakers are\u00a0demanding an investigation\u00a0into why highly\u00a0sensitive information\u00a0was being discussed on a commercially available messaging app, rather than secure government channels.",
      "The Atlantic's Goldberg also alleged that some of the messages in the group chat were designed to disappear after one week, and others after four weeks, which could be a violation of federal law requiring the preservation of official records.",
      "The Associated Press\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

The publication's editor-in-chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, detailed how Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth inadvertently disclosed war plans to him in an encrypted Signal chat group two hours before the U.S. military launched attacks against Houthi militia in Yemen. Goldberg wrote that Hegseth's messages included \"precise information about weapons packages, targets, and timing.\"",
      "The NSA is an arm of the Defense Department and specializes in signals intelligence \u2014 which is derived from electronic transmissions \u2014 and cybersecurity. The agency is responsible for monitoring, collecting and processing information and data for U.S. national security interests.",
      "The unclassified but for-official-use-only documents provided to CBS News by a senior U.S. intelligence official are entitled \"Signal Vulnerability\" and were sent out the month before Goldberg was accidentally added to the group chat allegedly by national security adviser Mike Waltz.",
      "\"A vulnerability has been identified in the Signal Messenger Application. The use of Signal by common targets of surveillance and espionage activity has made the application a high value target to intercept sensitive information,\" the internal bulletin begins.",
      "The bulletin warned of Russian professional hacking groups employing phishing scams to gain access to encrypted conversations, bypassing the end-to-end encryption the application uses.",
      "The bulletin also underscored to NSA employees that third-party messaging applications such as Signal and Whatsapp are permitted for certain \"unclassified accountability/recall exercises\" but not for communicating more sensitive information.",
      "NSA employees were also warned to not send \"anything compromising over any social media or Internet-based tool or application,\" and to not \"establish connections with people you do not know.\"",

      "\"There was no classified material that was shared in that Signal chat,\" Gabbard told lawmakers. But the NSA bulletin advises that even information that is not categorized as classified should not be shared on Signal, advising users not to share \"unclassified, nonpublic\" information on the messaging platform.",
      "Ratcliffe said Signal \"is a permissible use\" application that has been approved by the White House for use by senior officials. The group chat, Ratcliffe said, was a \"mechanism for communicating between senior level officials but not a substitute for using high side or classified communications.\"",
      "Both Ratcliffe and Gabbard were asked by Democratic Sen. Martin Heinrich of New Mexico whether the Signal conversation included information on \"weapons packages, targets or timing.\" Ratcliffe replied, \"Not that I'm aware of,\" and Gabbard said, \"Same answer and defer to the Department of Defense on that question.\" Both said they had no knowledge of the chat including operational details of the strike in Yemen.",

    "story": [
      "Wisconsin's Democratic attorney general asked a court on Friday to block billionaire\u00a0Elon Musk from handing out $1 million checks to voters this weekend, just two days before the state's\u00a0hotly contested Supreme Court race was to be decided.",
      "Attorney General Josh Kaul filed the lawsuit in Dane County Circuit Court to stop Musk from making the payments, which he said he would make Sunday in Wisconsin. Musk initially said in a post on his social media platform, X, that he planned to \"personally hand over\" $2 million to a pair of voters who have already cast their ballots in the race.",
      "Musk later posted a clarification, saying the money will go to people who will be \"spokesmen\" for an online petition against \"activist\" judges. After first saying the event would only be open to people who had voted in the Supreme Court race, he said attendance would be limited to those who have signed the petition.",
      "Also on Friday, Musk's political action committee identified the recipient of its first $1 million giveaway \u2014 a Green Bay man who had donated to the Wisconsin GOP and the conservative candidate in the court race, and who has a history of posting support for President Donald Trump and his agenda.",
      "Musk deleted the post from his social media platform, X, about 12 hours after he initially posted it late Thursday night. He issued the clarification about an hour later.",
      "He had posted that he planned to give $1 million each to two voters at the event on Sunday, just two days before the election\u00a0that will determine ideological control of the court\u00a0in the battleground state.",
      "\"I will also personally hand over two checks for a million dollars each in appreciation for you taking the time to vote,\" Musk's now-deleted post said. \"This is super important.\"",

      "Schimel, a Waukesha County judge, faces Dane County Judge Susan Crawford in Tuesday's election. Crawford is backed by a wide range of Democrats, including the liberal justices who hold a 4-3 majority on the Wisconsin Supreme Court and former President Barack Obama. The retirement this year of a liberal justice puts majority control of the court in play.",
      "Musk's political action committee said Friday that it had awarded $1 million to Scott Ainsworth, a mechanical engineer from Green Bay, for signing its petition protesting against \"activist\" judges. In a video posted on X, Ainsworth encouraged people to sign the petition and \"get out and vote early for Brad Schimel.\"",
      "\"If everyone in the MAGA movement shows up and votes for Brad Schimel, we will win,\" Ainsworth said in the video.",
      "Ainsworth donated $350 to Schimel's campaign this year, campaign finance records show.",
      "Andrew Romeo, a spokesperson for Musk's political action committee, declined to say whether Ainsworth was one of the two who would be receiving $1 million on Sunday.",
      "Musk promised $100 to any registered Wisconsin voter\u00a0who signed the petition or forwarded it to someone who did.",
      "That raised questions about whether the petition violated Wisconsin law that makes it a felony to offer, give, lend or promise to lend or give anything of value to induce a voter to cast a ballot or not vote.",
      "Any legal challenge to Musk's payments could end up before the Wisconsin Supreme Court.",
      "A bipartisan coalition of government watchdog groups and former office holders, along with a liberal Madison law firm, asked the Wisconsin attorney general and the Milwaukee County district attorney to investigate the $1 million payment and the offer of $100 for signing the petition.",
      "The group, in its letter sent Thursday night, said the payments appear to violate the state law against election bribery.",
      "Attorney General Josh Kaul and Milwaukee County District Attorney Kent Lovern did not immediately return messages Friday seeking comment.",
      "Schimel, a former attorney general, was asked about the petition on Thursday by WISN-TV.",
      "\"I, frankly, thought, 'Should I sign that petition? I'm against activist judges, but I don't think I should do that,'\" Schimel said.",
      "When asked about the $1 million award, Schimel said, \"I don't know what the criteria to get it was.\"",
      "Crawford's campaign spokesperson Derrick Honeyman, called Musk's announced visit to Wisconsin a \"last-minute desperate distraction.\"",
      "\"Wisconsinites don't want a billionaire like Musk telling them who to vote for, and, on Tuesday, voters should reject Musk's lackey Brad Schimel,\" he said.",
      "Musk's political action committee used a nearly identical tactic before the White House election last year, offering to pay $1 million a day to voters in Wisconsin and six other battleground states\u00a0who signed a petition supporting the First and Second Amendments.",
      "During last year's presidential race, Philadelphia's district attorney sued in an attempt to stop the payments under Pennsylvania law. But a judge said prosecutors failed to show the effort was an illegal lottery and allowed it to continue through Election Day.",
      "Musk and groups he funds have already spent more than $20 million in an effort to elect Schimel, while billionaire George Soros has given $2 million to bolster Crawford, and Democratic Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker has donated $1.5 million.",
      "Musk got involved in the race just days after his electric car company, Tesla, filed a lawsuit against Wisconsin in an effort to open dealerships in the state.",
      "Crawford and her allies have accused Musk of trying to buy influence on the court given that Tesla's lawsuit could end up before the justices.",
      "The race comes as the Wisconsin Supreme Court is also expected to rule on abortion rights, congressional redistricting, union power and voting rules that could affect the 2026 midterms and the 2028 presidential election.",
      "Wisconsin is one of a handful of true battleground states, which only intensifies the focus on court races where rules for voting will be decided. Trump won Wisconsin in 2016 and 2024 by less than a percentage point, but he lost it in 2020 by a similar margin. Five of the past seven presidential elections in the state have been decided by less than a percentage point.",

    "published": "Fri, 28 Mar 2025 21:13:00 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump has issued executive orders targeting law firms that have employed his purported political opponents.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump announced Friday that the law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom agreed to provide more than $100 million in pro bono work for initiatives backed by his administration.",
      "The agreement makes Skadden Arps the second major firm to reach a deal with Mr. Trump amid a recent blitz of executive orders targeting law firms that have employed his purported political opponents. The orders issued by the president have focused on the firms Perkins Coie, Jenner & Block, and Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr, known as WilmerHale.",
      "All three of those firms have filed federal lawsuits challenging the executive orders as a violation of the First Amendment. A federal judge in Washington blocked parts of Mr. Trump's executive order against Perkins Coie earlier this month, and on Friday, two separate judges issued temporary restraining orders halting the president's actions against Jenner & Block and WilmerHale.",
      "While Mr. Trump earlier in the month issued an order going after a fourth firm, Paul, Weiss, it was rescinded after the international firm agreed to provide $40 million in free legal services to support causes backed by the administration.",
      "The president said in a statement posted to Truth Social that in addition to providing $100 million in pro bono work, the firm will not engage in \"illegal DEI discrimination and preferences\" and work with an outside counsel to advise it on employment practices.",
      "Mr. Trump also said Skadden Arps \"will not deny representation to clients, such as members of politically disenfranchised groups, who have not historically received legal representation from major National Law Firms, including in pro bono matters, and in support of non-profits, because of the personal political views of individual lawyers.\"",
      "The White House said Skadden Arps approached the administration \"and declared the Firm's strong commitment to ending the Weaponization of the Justice System and the Legal Profession.\"",
      "Jeremy London, the firm's executive partner, said in a statement distributed by Mr. Trump that it is \"pleased to have achieved a successful agreement with President Trump and his Administration. We engaged proactively with the President and his team in working together constructively to reach this agreement. The Firm looks forward to continuing our productive relationship with President Trump and his Administration. We firmly believe that this outcome is in the best interests of our clients, our people, and our Firm.\"",
      "The executive orders targeting the law firms are among a number of actions taken by Mr. Trump since he returned to the White House that have gone after his perceived enemies. He revoked the security clearances of former Vice President Kamala Harris, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and other top Biden administration officials, as well as others who have been critical of him, last week. Mr. Trump also pulled the security details for Dr. Anthony Fauci and retired Gen. Mark Milley, who was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff during the Trump and Biden administrations.",
      "Executive orders targeting major law firms",
      "The law firm-related orders take issue with the work they have performed and the lawyers previously on their payrolls. In the directive targeting Perkins Coie, Mr. Trump attacked the firm for representing Clinton during her 2016 presidential campaign and hiring a research firm that retained a former British spy, Christopher Steele, who\u00a0produced the infamous \"Steele Dossier.\"",
      "The president's order attacking Jenner & Block singles out the firm for hiring Andrew Weissmann, who worked with former special counsel Robert Mueller on his investigation into Russia's efforts to influence the 2016 presidential election. Weissmann left the firm in 2021. It also took issue with Jenner & Block's work on a challenge to Mr. Trump's executive order that seeks to strip federal funds from medical institutions that provide gender-affirming care to minors, among other lawsuits.",
      "In a ruling late Friday, Judge John D. Bates, an appointee of President George W. Bush, issued an order temporarily blocking the action, saying it likely violates the First, Fifth and Sixth Amendments. The judge called Mr. Trump's executive order \"disturbing\" and \"troubling\" on the grounds that it attacks pro bono practice.",
      "\"The court does not take lightly the power to enjoin the executive branch, but the government has not made any persuasive case that the public interest will be harmed\" by halting enforcement, he said.",
      "Mr. Trump's latest executive order, which targets WilmerHale, accused the firm of weaponizing the justice system by employing Mueller and two others who worked on his investigation, James Quarles and Aaron Zebley. Mueller left WilmerHale more than three years ago, according to the firm, and Quarles is retired. Zebley is a partner at WilmerHale.",
      "In his ruling Friday night temporarily blocking\u00a0portions of Mr. Trump's executive order, U.S. District Judge Richard Leon wrote: \"There is no doubt this retaliatory action chills speech and legal advocacy, or that it qualifies as a constitutional harm.\"",
      "Leon said WilmerHale \"faces more than economic harm\" from the executive order, \"it faces crippling losses and its very survival is at stake.\" He wrote that the injuries to the firm from the order \"would be so severe and would spill over to its clients and the justice system at large. The public interest demands protecting against harms of this magnitude.\"",
      "His temporary restraining order stops the Trump administration from requiring government contracting agencies to terminate all contracts with WilmerHale, and stops the administration from restricting WilmerHale employees' access to federal buildings and officials.",
      "The executive orders directed agency heads to suspend any active security clearances held by employees of three firms and require federal contractors to disclose any business with WilmerHale, Jenner & Block and Perkins Coie. The administration is also directed to review all contracts with the firms or with entities that disclose doing business with them.",
      "The fallout from the executive orders has been swift. In a declaration filed with the court, Thomas Perrelli, firm chair and a partner at Jenner & Block, warned that if allowed to take the effect, the restrictions laid out in Mr. Trump's order would be \"devastating and irreparable.\"",
      "According to Perrelli, one client has already informed Jenner & Block that the Justice Department notified them that they cannot bring their lawyers from the firm to a department meeting set for April 3. That client, Perrelli wrote, will need to attend the meeting without their outside representation or hire new counsel before it.",
      "Some Jenner & Block clients are also worried the firm cannot represent them in federal court or go into government buildings to engage with regulatory agencies or government officials, he said. Within 24 hours of Mr. Trump's order, Perrelli said several clients expressed concerns about the firm's representation because they were unsure whether Jenner & Block lawyers could enter federal buildings and courthouses, negotiate with government officials or participate in meetings with the Justice Department.",
      "As to the order's provisions targeting government contractors with a relationship with Jenner & Block, Perrelli said 40% of the firm's revenue came from clients who have federal contracts or subcontracts.",
      "\"If we lost that business, or even a portion of it, it would be a serious threat to the firm's financial health,\" Perrelli wrote.",

    "summary": "23 measles cases\u200b have been confirmed in Kansas, marking an outbreak for the state, according to local health officials. Ohio has reported 10 cases.",
    "story": [
      "Kansas health officials have confirmed 23 measles cases, marking an outbreak for the state as infections in at least 17 states have led to the most cases in the U.S. in a single year since 2019.",
      "The Kansas outbreak is spread across 6 southwest counties, the state's\u00a0Department of Health and Environment\u00a0said Wednesday.",
      "The majority of cases, 20, are individuals who were not vaccinated against the infection. Fifteen cases are in school-aged children, between ages 5 and 17, six patients are 4 years old or younger and two are over 18, officials said.",
      "Health officials in Ohio have also\u00a0reported 10 cases this week.",
      "\"Given the measles activity in Texas, New Mexico, and other states around the country, we're disappointed but not surprised we now have several cases here in Ohio and known exposure in some counties,\" Ohio Department of Health Director Dr. Bruce Vanderhoff said in a news release Tuesday.",
      "Measles, a highly contagious infectious disease, can in some cases cause\u00a0severe infections\u00a0in the lungs and brain that may lead to cognitive issues, deafness or death.\u00a0A vaccine\u00a0against the illness is safe and effective, doctors and health officials say.",
      "While most people's symptoms improve, about 1 in 5 unvaccinated people who get measles will be hospitalized. About 1 out of every 1,000 children with measles will develop brain swelling that can lead to brain damage, and up to 3 of every 1,000 children who become infected will die, the CDC says.",
      "So far, no cases in Kansas have led to hospitalization or death, according to the data from the state's health department.",
      "The Kansas cases come as other states are facing rising infections too. The majority of the cases have been reported in an outbreak in Texas that has sickened more than 400 people since late January and has caused the death of a child. An adult with measles also\u00a0died in New Mexico.",
      "Earlier this month, a person with a confirmed measles infection may have exposed Amtrak passengers on a train to Washington, D.C., according to officials at the\u00a0D.C. Department of Health.",
      "Measles cases have also been reported in a number of other states, including\u00a0New Jersey, Georgia,\u00a0California, Rhode Island, Kentucky,\u00a0Michigan, Alaska and Pennsylvania.",
      "The measles vaccine is usually administered in childhood as part of the measles-mumps-rubella, or MMR, shot. Two doses are about 97% effective at preventing measles, and a single dose is about 93% effective, the CDC says.",
      "Similar to the Kansas cases, the Texas outbreak largely spread in a community with very low vaccination rates, and Texas health officials said the child who died in that outbreak was unvaccinated.",

    "summary": "A recent poll\u200b shows 85% of Greenlanders do not want to be part of the United States.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Vice President JD Vance\u00a0said Friday during a day trip to a U.S. base in Greenland that the Trump administration doesn't think that \"military force is ever going to be necessary\" there, the same day President Trump said, \"We have to have Greenland.\"",
      "Vance visited the Pituffik Space Base, the northernmost U.S. military installation, along with second lady Usha Vance, national security adviser Mike Waltz, Secretary of Energy Chris Wright and Sen. Mike Lee of Utah. While there, the vice president blasted Denmark for its handling of the island, as the Trump White House eyes the semi-autonomous Danish territory despite opposition from residents and leaders. While Vance was there, President Trump reiterated his strong desire to acquire the island.",
      "\"We need Greenland, very importantly, for international security,\" the president told reporters at the White House. \"We have to have Greenland. It's not a question of, 'Do you think we can do without it?' We can't.\"",
      "Mr. Trump hasn't ruled out military force in Greenland, while Vance on Friday said he believes the people of Greenland will seek independence from Denmark. A reporter asked Vance if his message is consistent with the president's. Vance said the president wants more of a U.S. presence in Greenland, but \"the president has said clearly he doesn't think that military force is going to be necessary.\"",
      "\"What we think is going to happen is that the Greenlanders are going to choose through self-determination to become independent of Denmark, and then we're going to have conversations with the people of Greenland from there,\" Vance said. \"So I think talking about anything too far in the future is way too premature. We do not think that military force is ever going to be necessary. We think this makes sense. And because we think the people of Greenland are rational and good, we think we're going to be able to cut a deal, Donald Trump style, to ensure the security of this territory but also the United States of America.\"",
      "Vance said his trip to the base helped him see up close how critical Greenland is for U.S. national security. If an enemy fired a missile on the U.S., it would be the American soldiers at the Greenland base who would alert their countrymen, he said. Vance said the U.S. knows Russia and China are taking serious interest in the Arctic, and the U.S. needs to make sure it's leading in the Arctic. But while Vance recognized Denmark has been an important security partner in the past, he launched into criticisms of the European country, saying the U.S. base in Greenland is less secure than it was decades ago because of Denmark's stewardship.",
      "\"There is no amount of bullying, no amount of obfuscating, no amount of confusing the issue,\" Vance said. \"Our message to Denmark is very simple: You have not done a good job by the people of Greenland, you have underinvested in the people of Greenland, and you have underinvested in the security architecture of this incredible, beautiful landmass filled with incredible people. That has to change. And because it hasn't changed, that's why President Trump's policy in Greenland is what it is.\"",
      "The second lady was originally scheduled to visit Greenland in an expanded cultural trip this week, and then the vice president\u00a0announced\u00a0Tuesday that he would be joining her for a shorter trip that was more focused on U.S. policy and defense.",
      "Vance also thanked soldiers on the base, who are there for a year at a time and can't bring their families with them.",
      "\"I know it's a lot of sacrifice to spend a year away from your families, but the mission is really important,\" Vance said. \"The Trump administration, the president, is really interested in Arctic security. As you all know, that's a big issue, and it's only going to get bigger over the coming decade, so thanks for doing what you do.\"",
      "Waltz told the soldiers they're carrying a \"tradition\" of U.S. soldiers in Greenland, and said the president is very serious about Arctic security.",
      "A statement earlier this week by the vice president's office that announced Vance would join his wife on the trip emphasized Greenland's role in U.S. national security.",
      "\"During World War II, the United States established over a dozen military bases in Greenland to defend the North Atlantic from Nazi incursion,\" the statement said. \"During the Cold War, the United States committed additional resources to Greenland to defend against Soviet missile attacks.\"",
      "The statement went on to criticize Denmark, claiming, \"In the decades since, neglect and inaction from Danish leaders and past U.S. administrations have presented our adversaries with the opportunity to advance their own priorities in Greenland and the Arctic. President Trump is rightly changing course.\"",
      "Mr. Trump hasn't given up on the idea of absorbing Greenland into the U.S., despite opposition from Greenland's leadership and people. Greenland is an expansive island to the north and east of Canada that's a semi-autonomous territory of Denmark. It's roughly three times the size of Texas, but mostly covered by ice. Most of its roughly 57,000 people \u2014 a population smaller than Carson City, Nevada \u2014 live along Greenland's southern coast.",
      "A\u00a0recent poll shows 85% of Greenlanders do not want to be part of the United States, and residents who spoke with CBS News ahead of Vance's visit to a remote U.S. installation on the island \u2014 America's furthest north military base \u2014 clearly reflected the sentiments shown in that poll.",
      "\"He can't just take it like that,\" said Daniel Rosing, a trainee electrician who said he was proud of being a Greenlander.",
      "And Greenland's prime minister, M\u00fate Bourup Egede,\u00a0has called the planned visits from U.S. officials \"aggressive.\" And Mette Frederiksen, the Danish prime minister, said the U.S. is putting \"unacceptable pressure\" on Greenland.",
      "Despite this opposition, Mr. Trump said earlier this month in a speech before the joint session of Congress that he had \"a message tonight for the incredible people of Greenland: We strongly support your right to determine your own future, and if you choose, we welcome you into the United States of America.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said the territory is important to U.S. national security and that his administration is \"working with everybody involved to try and get it.\"",
      "\"And I think we're going to get it, one way or the other,\" Mr. Trump said. \"We're going to get it. We will keep you safe, we will make you rich, and together, we will take Greenland to heights like you have never thought possible before. It's a very small population, but very, very large piece of land, and very, very important for military security.\"",

      "Jackson ruled that, without a court order, President Trump's administration would move quickly to shut down the agency that Congress created in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis.",
      "\"If the defendants are not enjoined, they will eliminate the agency before the Court has the opportunity to decide whether the law permits them to do it, and as the defendants' own witness warned, the harm will be irreparable,\" Berman Jackson said in her order.",
      "During a March 10 hearing, Jackson heard testimony about the chaos that erupted inside the agency after government employees were ordered to stop working last month. The bureau's chief operating officer, Adam Martinez, said the agency was in \"wind-down mode\" after Trump fired its previous director, Rohit Chopra, on Feb. 1.",
      "Trump installed a temporary replacement who ordered the immediate suspension of all agency operations, cancelled $100 million in contracts and fired 70 employees.",
      "Martinez said the agency's current leaders have adopted a more methodical approach than they initially did last month, when representatives of Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency arrived at its Washington headquarters.",
      "CFPB is responsible for protecting consumers from financial fraud and deceptive practices. It processes consumer complaints and examines banks to protect student loan borrowers.",
      "The National Treasury Employees Union, which represents more than 1,000 workers at the bureau, sued on Feb. 9 to block mass firings. Plaintiffs' attorneys argue that the administration doesn't have the constitutional authority to eliminate an agency that Congress created by statute.",
      "\"The defendants' unlawful action will have immediate consequences for the Americans that the CFPB was designed by Congress to protect,\"\u00a0the lawyers wrote.",
      "Government lawyers have said the plaintiffs are seeking to impermissibly place the CFPB in a \"judicially managed receivership,\" with the court overseeing its day-to-day operations.",
      "Jackson started her 112-page ruling by quoting Mr. Trump and his allies' own words about the bureau. Trump's billionaire adviser, Elon Musk, posted \"CFPB RIP\" on X, his social media platform, and added an emoji of a tombstone. White House budget director Russell Vought said it has been \"a woke and weaponized agency against disfavored industries and individuals for a long time.\" Mr. Trump called it \"a very important thing to get rid of.\"",
      "Among the plaintiffs was 83-year-old Eva Steege, a Lutheran pastor in hospice care who had been working with CFPB to resolve her student loan debt before her death. The agency found she qualified for loan forgiveness and a $15,000 refund of overpayments, but the stop-work order went into effect before she could have a follow-up meeting and the official she was working with was fired.",
      "\"Steege's fear of leaving her surviving family members saddled with her student loan debt came to pass on March 15, when she died,\" the judge wrote.",

      "Flight bookings between Canada and the U.S. are plunging amid rising trade tensions between the two allied nations.",
      "Demand, measured by passenger bookings on flights between Canada and the U.S., has \"collapsed,\" falling 70% compared to the same period last year, according to a March 26\u00a0report\u00a0from OAG aviation, a flight analytics company.",
      "Visits from Canada to the U.S. account for the sharpest projected decline in travel this year, with analysts pointing to President Trump's plan to slap tariffs on Canadian imports as causing some Canadians to hold off on traveling to the U.S.",
      "\"This sharp drop suggests that travellers are holding off on making reservations, likely due to ongoing uncertainty surrounding the broader trade dispute,\" the report states.",
      "Mr. Trump has delayed 25% tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports until April 2, but economists say the import duties could have detrimental effects on their economies given their deep reliance on the U.S. The drop in airline demand reflects \"a degradation of travel demand between the two countries, especially coming from the Canadian side,\" Scott Keyes, founder of Going.com, a flight deals website, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "As Mr. Trump promotes an \"America First\" trade policy, Canadians are similarly focusing on spending their dollars domestically, following former Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's please last month for residents to \"choose Canada,\" former Canadian Member of Parliament Dr. Ruby Dhalla told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"Instead of traveling to the U.S., we are seeing families travel visiting cities, towns and villages and exploring Canada's history and heritage,\" Dhalla said.",

      "Slashing routes to the U.S.",
      "Canadian airlines are expected to be hit harder than their American counterparts because the nation's residents are driving the downward trend, experts say. Americans typically prefer to fly American airlines because they might have loyalty accounts with a carrier, for example.",

    "published": "Fri, 28 Mar 2025 16:23:24 -0400",
    "summary": "These automakers are the most and least exposed to President Trump's sweeping tariffs on automobiles.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration's 25% tariffs on vehicles and auto parts imported into the U.S. could lead to sticker shock for American consumers, including for those buying cars manufactured domestically, analysts say.",
      "Few vehicle manufacturers will be spared by the fresh levies, which are aimed at revitalizing domestic automobile manufacturing. Industry analysts say the tax will surely raise car prices in the U.S. and squeeze some would-be car buyers out of the market.",
      "Some manufacturers could move a share of production to the U.S., but it would come \"at the expense of reduced competition, higher prices, and significantly lower production in the U.S.'s main trading partners,\" Oxford Economics analyst Abby Stamp said in a research note.",
      "The automobile supply chain is highly complex and intertwined with the economies of Mexico and Canada, from which American brands source finished vehicles and parts. Mr. Trump's tariff on passenger cars and light trucks imported into the U.S. will go into effect April 3, according to the executive order, and a 25% tariff on auto parts shipped from foreign countries goes into effect \"no later than May 3.\"",
      "While all car manufacturers will be impacted by the new tariffs, according to analysts, some will be hit much harder than others.",
      "Tesla",
      "Tesla CEO Elon Musk, a close ally of Mr. Trump, posted on X Wednesday that the new tariffs would affect the company's American-made electric vehicles.",
      "\"Important to note that Tesla is NOT unscathed here. The tariff impact on Tesla is still significant,\" Musk wrote on X Wednesday. \"To be clear, this will affect the price of parts in Tesla cars that come from other countries. The cost impact is not trivial,\" he wrote in a later post.",
      "That said, Tesla is expected to be among the automakers that are least affected by the tariffs, given that its vehicles are made in the U.S., and most of their parts are sourced domestically, too. The EV brand does, however, rely on China for some batteries, \"so the tariffs will have an impact,\" Art Wheaton, a transportation industry expert and director of labor studies at Cornell's School of Industrial and Labor Relations, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Tesla rival Rivian could also be spared for similar reasons, according to UBS.",
      "\"We believe TSLA and RIVN could fare better as 100% of their production is in the U.S. (though not all components),\" UBS analysts said in a research note.",
      "General Motors",
      "General Motors, one of the so-called Big Three automakers, along with Stellantis and Ford, is widely expected to be the most exposed to the forthcoming auto tariffs. Headquartered in Detroit, the U.S. car company makes just 45% of vehicles it sells to U.S. customers domestically, leaving 55% of its lineup exposed to tariffs, according to Cox Automotive.",
      "GM, which makes Chevrolet, Buick, GMC and Cadillac vehicles, is heavily invested in Mexico and Canada, where it builds heavy-duty vehicles, according to Cornell's Wheaton.",
      "Stellantis",
      "Stellantis, whose brands include Jeep, Chrysler, Dodge and Ram, among others, is similarly susceptible to rising costs from the tariffs, as it makes between 73%-75% of vehicles for sale in the U.S. stateside, according to Cox Automotive.",
      "That means, a $80,000 RAM truck from Stellantis could cost $100,000 once it reaches the U.S., under the new policy.",
      "\"The impact is quite large,\" Wheaton said.",
      "Ford",
      "Ford is among the car companies better positioned to weather the tariffs, according to Cox Automotive analyst Erin Keating, as 80% of its vehicles are manufactured in the U.S. and therefore would not be subject to the 25% tariff on passenger cars. However, any imported parts used in Ford's U.S.-manufactured vehicles could be tariffed at 25%.",
      "Ford vehicles made in the U.S. include the F-150 pickup truck lineup. Some of its smaller vehicles, including the Maverick pickup truck and Bronco Sport SUV are made in Mexico and \"will take a hit,\" said Wheaton.",
      "While domestic automakers will face increased costs, it's unclear how much of the tax they'll pass along to consumers. The\u00a0Wall Street Journal,\u00a0reported that Mr. Trump warned the CEOs of the Big Three not to raise car prices because of tariffs, according to people familiar with the matter.",
      "Toyota and Honda",
      "Japanese automakers Toyota and Honda export a large number of vehicles and auto parts from Japan to the U.S., which represents a sizable market for the companies. Both also operate big plants in Canada, Wheaten noted, leaving them particularly vulnerable to added costs from new tariffs.",
      "The same goes for South Korean automakers Hyundai and Kia.",
      "BMW and Volkswagen",
      "German automakers, including BMW and Volkswagen, which makes Audi vehicles, both operate big plants in Mexico.",
      "The May 3 auto-parts tariff will likely apply to engines and transmission systems, and hit the company \"heavily,\" according to Wheaton.",
      "BMW, for instance, makes a lot of engines in Germany, which it then ships to South Carolina, where the automaker manufactures SUVs. The company could be hit \"heavily,\" by the auto-parts tariffs, according to Wheaton.",
      "Mercedes-Benz operates similarly, sending engines and transmission from Germany to a plant in Alabama, where the company manufactures SUVs. The 25% auto tariffs would also likely apply to fully assembled Mercedes vehicles shipped to the U.S.",
      "\"I don't think any brands will be spared, because none are 100% in the U.S.,\" Wheaton said. \"They all have products from Canada, Mexico or elsewhere. And even Tesla, which is the most American, still has non-U.S. content in their vehicles.\"",
      "Tariffs could spark affordability issues",
      "Even vehicles whose parts aren't subject to tariffs and that are assembled in the U.S. could face price hikes, as automakers attempt to spread new costs out across their lineups. While Cox Automotive expects price hikes of between 15%-20% on vehicles that are caught in the tariffs' crosshairs, those that are exempt could still go up by about 5%, Keating noted.",
      "The auto tariffs could ignite new affordability challenges for consumers by moving lower-cost vehicles closer to, or in some cases over the $30,000 threshold.",
      "Take, for example, a Hyundai Venue, a subcompact crossover SUV, with an average current list price of $24,000. Under Mr. Trump's auto tariffs, that price could rise to about $28,500, adding more than $4,000 to an affordable design.",
      "\"Sub- $30,000 compact SUVs and crossovers that are the most popular are almost all foreign-made, with the exception of one or two,\" Keating said. \"So they'd all be subjected to the 25% tariffs.\"",
      "At the other end of the economic spectrum, luxury Italian car maker Ferrari on Thursday said it would hike prices on certain car models by 10% after April 1, citing Mr. Trump's auto tariffs. The vehicles subject to price increase include the Ferrari 296, SF90 and Roma, which already retail for hundreds of thousands of dollars each.",

      "Washington \u2014 A federal appeals court in Washington, D.C., cleared the way for President Trump to fire members of the National Labor Relations Board and Merit Systems Protection Board after district courts had earlier blocked their removals and ordered them reinstated.",
      "A three-judge panel of judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit divided 2-1 in agreeing to halt the lower court orders that voided Mr. Trump's firings of Gwynne Wilcox from the National Labor Relations Board and Cathy Harris from the Merit Systems Protection Board while legal proceedings move forward.",
      "Wilcox and Harris had argued that their firings violated federal laws that limited their removals only for neglect of duty or malfeasance in office. The Trump administration, meanwhile, defended the terminations and said the restrictions on the president's ability to remove the officials are unconstitutional.",
      "\"The people elected the president to enforce the nation's laws, and a stay serves that purpose by allowing the people's chosen officer to control the executive branch,\" Judge Justin Walker, who was appointed by Mr. Trump in his first term, wrote in an opinion siding with the administration.",
      "Wilcox was nominated to the National Labor Relations Board by former President Joe Biden and confirmed by the Senate to a five-year term in September 2023. She was designated chair of the board in December 2024.",
      "Harris was selected to serve on the Merit Systems Protection Board by Biden and confirmed in 2022. She was approved by the Senate as chair last year.",
      "Soon after Mr. Trump returned to the White House for his second term, Wilcox received a letter from the president informing her that the labor board had not been operating in a manner consistent with his administration's objectives, and telling her she had been removed. In Harris' case, she received an email in early February from the White House Presidential Personnel Office that stated, \"On behalf of President Donald J. Trump, I am writing to inform you that your position on the Merit Systems Protection Board is terminated, effective immediately.\"",
      "Both officials filed lawsuits seeking reinstatement in the federal district court in Washington. District court judges separately ruled in favor of Wilcox and Harris, finding their removals were unlawful and returning them to their roles.",
      "The Trump administration appealed the decisions and asked the D.C. Circuit to put them on hold while it considered the matter.",
      "In his concurring opinion, Walker said the district court orders effectively nullify the president's power under Article II to remove executive officials.",
      "\"The people elected the president, not Harris or Wilcox, to execute the nation's laws,\" he said. \"The forcible reinstatement of a presidentially removed principal officer disenfranchises voters by hampering the president's ability to govern during the four short years the people have assigned him the solemn duty of leading the executive branch.\"",
      "Judge Patricia Millet, appointed by former President Barack Obama, dissented from the court's decision to grant a stay.",
      "\"The whole purpose of a stay is to avoid instability and turmoil. But the court's decision today creates them,\" she wrote.",
      "Millett wrote that majority's rationale \"openly calls into question\" the constitutionality of dozens of federal statutes that limit the circumstances for when an official on a multimember board can be removed, from the Federal Reserve to the National Transportation Safety Board to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.",
      "\"I cannot join a decision that uses a hurried and preliminary first-look ruling by this court to announce a revolution in the law that the Supreme Court has expressly avoided, and to trap in legal limbo millions of employees and employers whom the law says must go to these boards for the resolution of their employment disputes,\" she said.",

    "summary": "A recent poll\u200b shows 85% of Greenlanders do not want to be part of the United States.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Vice President JD Vance\u00a0said Friday during a day trip to a U.S. base in Greenland that the Trump administration doesn't think that \"military force is ever going to be necessary\" there, the same day President Trump said, \"We have to have Greenland.\"",
      "Vance visited the Pituffik Space Base, the northernmost U.S. military installation, along with second lady Usha Vance, national security adviser Mike Waltz, Secretary of Energy Chris Wright and Sen. Mike Lee of Utah. While there, the vice president blasted Denmark for its handling of the island, as the Trump White House eyes the semi-autonomous Danish territory despite opposition from residents and leaders. While Vance was there, President Trump reiterated his strong desire to acquire the island.",
      "\"We need Greenland, very importantly, for international security,\" the president told reporters at the White House. \"We have to have Greenland. It's not a question of, 'Do you think we can do without it?' We can't.\"",
      "Mr. Trump hasn't ruled out military force in Greenland, while Vance on Friday said he believes the people of Greenland will seek independence from Denmark. A reporter asked Vance if his message is consistent with the president's. Vance said the president wants more of a U.S. presence in Greenland, but \"the president has said clearly he doesn't think that military force is going to be necessary.\"",
      "\"What we think is going to happen is that the Greenlanders are going to choose through self-determination to become independent of Denmark, and then we're going to have conversations with the people of Greenland from there,\" Vance said. \"So I think talking about anything too far in the future is way too premature. We do not think that military force is ever going to be necessary. We think this makes sense. And because we think the people of Greenland are rational and good, we think we're going to be able to cut a deal, Donald Trump style, to ensure the security of this territory but also the United States of America.\"",
      "Vance said his trip to the base helped him see up close how critical Greenland is for U.S. national security. If an enemy fired a missile on the U.S., it would be the American soldiers at the Greenland base who would alert their countrymen, he said. Vance said the U.S. knows Russia and China are taking serious interest in the Arctic, and the U.S. needs to make sure it's leading in the Arctic. But while Vance recognized Denmark has been an important security partner in the past, he launched into criticisms of the European country, saying the U.S. base in Greenland is less secure than it was decades ago because of Denmark's stewardship.",
      "\"There is no amount of bullying, no amount of obfuscating, no amount of confusing the issue,\" Vance said. \"Our message to Denmark is very simple: You have not done a good job by the people of Greenland, you have underinvested in the people of Greenland, and you have underinvested in the security architecture of this incredible, beautiful landmass filled with incredible people. That has to change. And because it hasn't changed, that's why President Trump's policy in Greenland is what it is.\"",
      "The second lady was originally scheduled to visit Greenland in an expanded cultural trip this week, and then the vice president\u00a0announced\u00a0Tuesday that he would be joining her for a shorter trip that was more focused on U.S. policy and defense.",
      "Vance also thanked soldiers on the base, who are there for a year at a time and can't bring their families with them.",
      "\"I know it's a lot of sacrifice to spend a year away from your families, but the mission is really important,\" Vance said. \"The Trump administration, the president, is really interested in Arctic security. As you all know, that's a big issue, and it's only going to get bigger over the coming decade, so thanks for doing what you do.\"",
      "Waltz told the soldiers they're carrying a \"tradition\" of U.S. soldiers in Greenland, and said the president is very serious about Arctic security.",
      "A statement earlier this week by the vice president's office that announced Vance would join his wife on the trip emphasized Greenland's role in U.S. national security.",
      "\"During World War II, the United States established over a dozen military bases in Greenland to defend the North Atlantic from Nazi incursion,\" the statement said. \"During the Cold War, the United States committed additional resources to Greenland to defend against Soviet missile attacks.\"",
      "The statement went on to criticize Denmark, claiming, \"In the decades since, neglect and inaction from Danish leaders and past U.S. administrations have presented our adversaries with the opportunity to advance their own priorities in Greenland and the Arctic. President Trump is rightly changing course.\"",
      "Mr. Trump hasn't given up on the idea of absorbing Greenland into the U.S., despite opposition from Greenland's leadership and people. Greenland is an expansive island to the north and east of Canada that's a semi-autonomous territory of Denmark. It's roughly three times the size of Texas, but mostly covered by ice. Most of its roughly 57,000 people \u2014 a population smaller than Carson City, Nevada \u2014 live along Greenland's southern coast.",
      "A\u00a0recent poll shows 85% of Greenlanders do not want to be part of the United States, and residents who spoke with CBS News ahead of Vance's visit to a remote U.S. installation on the island \u2014 America's furthest north military base \u2014 clearly reflected the sentiments shown in that poll.",
      "\"He can't just take it like that,\" said Daniel Rosing, a trainee electrician who said he was proud of being a Greenlander.",
      "And Greenland's prime minister, M\u00fate Bourup Egede,\u00a0has called the planned visits from U.S. officials \"aggressive.\" And Mette Frederiksen, the Danish prime minister, said the U.S. is putting \"unacceptable pressure\" on Greenland.",
      "Despite this opposition, Mr. Trump said earlier this month in a speech before the joint session of Congress that he had \"a message tonight for the incredible people of Greenland: We strongly support your right to determine your own future, and if you choose, we welcome you into the United States of America.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said the territory is important to U.S. national security and that his administration is \"working with everybody involved to try and get it.\"",
      "\"And I think we're going to get it, one way or the other,\" Mr. Trump said. \"We're going to get it. We will keep you safe, we will make you rich, and together, we will take Greenland to heights like you have never thought possible before. It's a very small population, but very, very large piece of land, and very, very important for military security.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Israeli officials are furious over the Signal chat leak involving senior Trump administration officials because it included sensitive intelligence Israel provided to the U.S. from a human intelligence source in Yemen, CBS News has learned.",
      "While the Signal chat messages published by Jeffrey Goldberg of The Atlantic this week may not have compromised the effectiveness of the airstrike, given the publication's restraint on releasing the information, it did compromise a human source who provided the intelligence to the Israelis, who then provided it to the U.S. for targeting, a senior American intelligence official and a source with knowledge of the Israelis' ire told CBS News. They spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive national security matters.",
      "The Wall Street Journal on Thursday first reported about the Israelis complaining to U.S. officials about Mike Waltz, President Trump's national security adviser, who set up the group chat and apparently added Goldberg by mistake. The group spent several days earlier this month exchanging messages about possible plans to strike Iranian-backed Houthi militants in Yemen, who have repeatedly launched missiles at Israel and targeted shipping in the Red Sea.",
      "CBS News reached out to the National Security Council and the Israeli Embassy in the U.S. for comment on Friday, but has not received a response.",
      "On March 15, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth texted the group chat, composed of what's known as the principals committee \u2014 the highest level of the National Security Council, which includes Cabinet members and other senior U.S. officials.",
      "According to Goldberg's report, one of Hegseth's messages said:",
      "\"Trigger Based\" F-18 1st Strike Window Starts (Target Terrorist is @ his Known Location so SHOULD BE ON TIME \u2013 also, Strike Drones Launch (MQ-9s)",
      "The senior American intelligence official told CBS News that in this context, \"Trigger Based\" refers to an operation that is contingent upon a specific condition or event \u2014 essentially, a go or no-go decision to launch an airstrike based on confirmation of the target's presence.",
      "That day, Navy F/A-18F Super Hornets launched from the aircraft carrier Harry S. Truman located in the Red Sea, while the MQ-9 Reaper drones took flight from bases in the Middle East. U.S. Central Command said in a statement that they had begun an operation which consisted of \"precision strikes against Iran-backed Houthi targets across Yemen in order to restore freedom of navigation.\"",
      "Hegseth said in another text, prior to the decision to strike, that he supported doing so to restore freedom of navigation and reestablish deterrence, which he described as being \"cratered\" under the Biden administration.",
      "After the U.S. airstrikes began on the Iranian-backed Houthis, Waltz addressed Vice President JD Vance in the chat group to say the building had collapsed and that U.S. military forces had \"multiple positive ID,\" indicating positive identification of the Houthi member or members they were aiming to kill.",
      "Waltz added: \"The first target \u2014 their top missile guy \u2014 we had positive ID of him walking into his girlfriend's building and it's now collapsed,\" according to the texts posted by The Atlantic.",
      "As a barrage of criticism rolled in this week towards those involved in the Signal chat, senior Trump administration officials have repeatedly said the information was not classified and that no sources or methods were compromised.",
      "\"No locations. No sources & methods. No WAR PLANS,\" Waltz wrote on X on Wednesday. \"Foreign partners had already been notified that strikes were imminent.\"",
      "But the sources who spoke to CBS News say Israeli intelligence is angry that the intelligence they provided to the U.S. was revealed. It's unclear what the fallout will be, if any, between the U.S. and Israel over the situation.",
      "CBS News reported Thursday that President Trump has been privately venting his irritation about the Signal chat leak and is closely monitoring the news to see if the fallout quiets down, according to sources familiar with the matter.",
      "On Tuesday, National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe, both of whom were in the Signal group chat, testified before a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing.",
      "\"There was no classified material that was shared in that Signal chat,\" Gabbard told lawmakers. The following day, testifying before a House panel, Gabbard acknowledged the conversation was \"sensitive\" but again denied classified information was shared in the chat. \"There were no sources, methods, locations or war plans that were shared,\" she said.",
      "Multiple U.S. intelligence officials and members of the U.S. military who have spoken to CBS News this week contended that this type of information is always classified, but even if the information was somehow unclassified, it would still be a violation of cybersecurity and operational security protocols.",
      "CBS News on Tuesday published unclassified internal documents from a National Security Agency bulletin warning of vulnerabilities in using the Signal app, even though it is encrypted. The NSA bulletin was widely distributed to NSA employees a month before the Signal chat group was created by Waltz.",
      "The bulletin also underscored to NSA employees that third-party messaging applications such as Signal and WhatsApp are permitted for certain \"unclassified accountability/recall exercises\" but not for communicating more sensitive information.",
      "NSA employees were also warned to not send \"anything compromising over any social media or Internet-based tool or application,\" and to not \"establish connections with people you do not know.\"",

The four soldiers, assigned to the Army's 1st Brigade, 3rd Infantry Division, went missing early Tuesday morning during a maintenance mission to recover another U.S. Army vehicle in the Pabrade training area, near Lithuania's border with Belarus, during a scheduled training missing, the Army has said.",
      "Search and rescue teams were at the scene on Friday using heavy military equipment and excavators to remove silt from the body of water where the vehicle was found on Wednesday.",
      "\"I am still hoping for a miracle,\" Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda told reporters in Pabrade. \"Although many sceptics would probably say that there is nothing to hope for in these circumstances, I want to believe.\"",
      "In a statement issued Friday, the U.S. Army said the hulking, 70-ton M88 Hercules armored recovery vehicle the missing U.S. soldiers had been operating \"was found submerged approximately 15 feet under a body of water and mud in a boggy area\" connected to a nearby lake.",
      "\"The area around the site is incredibly wet and marshy and doesn't support the weight of the equipment,\" the U.S. Army Europe and Africa's public affairs office said in a statement Friday. \"Draining the area has been slow and difficult due to ground water seepage,\" it said.",
      "\"This will be a long and difficult recovery operation, but we are absolutely committed to bringing our soldiers home,\" said Curtis Taylor, Commanding General of the 1st Armored Division.",
      "The main goal Friday was to remove the mud from the submerged vehicle and identify possible attachment points for extraction, Lithuanian Armed Forces chief General Raimundas Vaiksnoras said.",

      "On the Panama Canal, Mr. Trump said in his March 4 address, \"To further enhance our national security, my administration will be reclaiming the Panama Canal, and we've already started doing it,\" referring to a deal to give an American company control of key ports.",

      "Below is a look at where the two places are and what Mr. Trump has said about wanting the U.S. to control them.",
      "Where is Greenland and why does President Trump want it?",
      "Greenland is located to the northeast of Canada. The largest island in the world, it is about 836,000 square miles, around the size of Sweden. It is largely covered by the Greenland Ice Sheet and is home to only around 60,000 people. It is a semi-autonomous territory of the Kingdom of Denmark and has its own elected government.",
      "Its location between the U.S., Russia and Europe makes it strategic for both economic and defense purposes \u2014 especially as melting sea ice has opened up new shipping routes through the Arctic. It is also the location of the northernmost U.S. military base.",
      "Mr. Trump has repeatedly claimed the U.S. needs Greenland for national security purposes. \"I'm talking about protecting the free world,\" he said in early January. \"You look at \u2014 you don't even need binoculars \u2014 you look outside. You have China ships all over the place. You have Russian ships all over the place. We're not letting that happen. We're not letting it happen.\"",
      "The Northwest Passage, or Northern Sea route, was first crossed in the winter months by a Russian commercial vessel several years ago, and is a shorter route linking east Asia's major ports to Europe and the Atlantic Ocean. Western powers have already voiced concern about Russia and China using it to boost their presence in the North Atlantic.",
      "\"The Americans have a strong interest in overseeing the activities of foreign countries in Greenland because it's such a big security asset for foreign states, and due to that, any investment or activity, from the American point of view, may be seen as a security threat,\" Frank Sejersen, associate professor at the University of Copenhagen, told CBS News.",
      "Pernille Benjaminsen, a human rights lawyer in Greenland, told CBS News the ties between the territory's semi-autonomous government and the Danish government had grown tense in recent years, and Mr. Trump could be trying to take advantage of that.",
      "\"He has noticed that there is this tense relationship between Denmark and Greenland and seen opportunities in that,\" she said.",
      "Greenland also has oil, natural gas and highly sought after mineral resources.",
      "Those mineral resources, which include rare earth elements, \"have only been lightly explored and developed,\" Jose W. Fernandez, the U.S. Department of State's undersecretary for economic growth, energy and the environment, said at a\u00a0Minerals Security Partnership event in Greenland in November.",
      "Greenland may have significant reserves of up to 31 different minerals, including lithium and graphite, both of which are needed to produce electric vehicle batteries, according to a 2023 report assessing the island's resources.",
      "Currently, lithium production is dominated by Australia, Chile and China, while China produces about 65% of the world's graphite, the report noted.",
      "Greenland also has the potential to provide a significant amount of rare earth minerals like Neodymium, which is used to make the magnets used in electric motors, the 2023 report said.",
      "Currently, China produces about 70% of rare earth elements.",
      "\"The world is currently too dependent on a small set of actors for mining and processing many critical minerals,\" Fernandez said in November.",
      "Demand for rare earth minerals is outstripping supply, which has kept prices high, according to the Swiss newspaper Neue Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung. Still, there are significant hurdles to mining in Greenland, including environmental and cost issues.",
      "Inside the Vances' Greenland visit",
      "Usha Vance was originally supposed to visit Greenland solo in late March as part of an expanded cultural trip, but then the vice president announced he would join her.",
      "The Vances arrived along with national security adviser Mike Waltz on Friday, March 28, to spend the day at Pituffik Space Base, the United States' northernmost military installation. The base, formerly known as Thule Air Base, is locked in by ice for much of the year, according to its website, but operates its airfield year-round.",
      "They met with service members at the base and received a briefing on Arctic security issues.",
      "\"As you've heard, we have some interest in Greenland from the Trump administration,\" the vice president told a group of service members at the dining hall.",
      "Vance said Mr. Trump wants more of a U.S. presence in Greenland, but \"the president has said clearly he doesn't think that military force is going to be necessary.\"",
      "While announcing his visit, Vance said \"a lot of other countries\" pose\u00a0a threat to Greenland and its waterways, and would use them to threaten the U.S.",
      "\"Unfortunately, leaders in both America and in Denmark, I think, ignored Greenland for far too long,\" he said in a video message before his trip. \"That's been bad for Greenland, it's also been bad for the security of the entire world. We think we can take things in a different direction, so I'm gonna go check it out.\"",
      "A\u00a0recent poll showed\u00a0that 85% of Greenlanders do not want to be part of the United States.",
      "\"He can't just take it like that,\" Daniel Rosing, a trainee electrician who said he was proud of being a Greenlander, told CBS News.",
      "What is the Panama Canal and why does Trump want it?",
      "About 40% of U.S. container shipping currently travels through the Panama Canal, according to the trade publication CargoNOW. The canal serves as a shortcut between the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea and, beyond that, the Atlantic Ocean.",
      "Mr. Trump has said that the United States needs the Panama Canal for \"economic security,\" falsely alleging that it is being \"operated by China.\"",
      "\"The Panama Canal is vital to our country. It's being operated by China. China! And we gave the Panama Canal to Panama. We didn't give it to China, and they've abused it. They've abused that gift. It should have never been made,\" he said before taking office again on Jan. 20.",
      "Panama President Jose Raul Mulino has disputed claims that China controls the canal.",
      "\"There is absolutely no Chinese interference nor involvement in anything to do with the Panama Canal,\" he said in late December.",
      "But in February, Panama decided not to renew a key infrastructure agreement with Beijing after a visit from Secretary of State Marco Rubio.",
      "Ahead of Mr. Trump's address to Congress, a Hong Kong-based conglomerate that operates ports at either end of the canal announced an agreement to sell shares of its units to an investment group led by American company BlackRock.",
      "Mr. Trump touted the deal in his speech. \"The Panama Canal was built by Americans for Americans, not for others. But others could use it,\" he said.",
      "In his response, Mulino said, \"President Trump is lying.\"",
      "\"The Panama Canal is not in the process of being restored, and this is certainly not the task that was even discussed in our conversations with Secretary Rubio or anyone else,\" he wrote on social media. \"The Canal is Panamanian and will continue to be Panamanian!\"",
      "China has denied trying to claim any control over the canal, with Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning saying in December that Beijing would \"always respect Panama's sovereignty over the Canal and recognize the Canal as a permanently neutral international waterway.\"",
      "The history of Greenland",
      "The Kingdom of Denmark began colonizing Greenland in the early 18th century, hundreds of years after Vikings from the same distant land first arrived to set up residency. It was not until World War II that the U.S. established a presence on the island, when then-Danish Ambassador to the U.S., Henrik Kauffmann, refused to surrender to the rule of Denmark's Nazi occupiers.",
      "Denmark was liberated from Nazi occupation in 1945, but the U.S. did not leave its military base, Pituffik Space Base, which to this day remains the American military's northernmost installation.",
      "The history of the Panama Canal",
      "The Panama Canal\u00a0was built by the U.S. between 1904 and 1914. It serves as a shortcut between the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean, dramatically shortening shipping routes from Asia to ports in the eastern U.S.",
      "It was first managed by the U.S. government for decades, which caused tension with Panama.",
      "In the 1970s, the U.S. and Panama signed a treaty agreeing to the permanent neutrality of the canal. The U.S. committed to relinquishing control of the canal and did so fully in 1999. The canal is now run by the Panama Canal Authority.",

      "The strike came after Israel's army urgently warned people to evacuate parts of a Beirut suburb, vowing to retaliate against strikes which it said were launched from Lebanon into northern Israel. Israel's defense minister said Friday that if there was no peace in Israel's northern communities there would be no peace in Beirut either.",
      "The Israel Defense Forces said the strike in Beirut had targeted a Hezbollah drone storage facility in the Dahiyeh neighborhood, which Israel has long described as a key Hezbollah stronghold. Israel accuses Hezbollah of using civilians as human shields and the IDF noted its advanced warning for people to leave the area on Friday.",
      "Hezbollah denied firing the rockets at northern Israel, and accused Israel of seeking a pretext to continue attacking Lebanon.",
      "Lebanon's government ordered all schools and universities in Beirut's southern suburb of Hadath to close for the day. Residents were seen fleeing the area in cars and on foot ahead of the strike.",
      "It was the first strike on Beirut since a ceasefire took hold on Nov. 27, 2024, between Israel and Hezbollah, a U.S.- and Israeli-designated terrorist organization that has long been powerful political force in Lebanon, although Israel has struck targets in southern Lebanon almost daily since then.",
      "Hezbollah began launching rockets, drones and missiles into Israel the day after its ally Hamas' unprecedented Oct. 7, 2023 terrorist attack, which ignited the war in Gaza. The Israel-Hezbollah conflict boiled over into all-out war in September as Israel carried out waves of airstrikes and killed most of the militant group's senior leaders. The fighting killed over 4,000 people in Lebanon and displaced about 60,000 Israelis who live in communities near the country's shared border.",
      "Israeli forces were supposed to withdraw from all Lebanese territory by late January under the ceasefire deal. The deadline was extended to Feb. 18, but Israel has remained in five locations in Lebanon across from communities in northern Israel. Meanwhile, Israel has carried out dozens of airstrikes on southern and eastern Lebanon, saying it attacked Hezbollah, while continuing drone attacks that have killed several members of the militant group.",
      "Last week, Israeli airstrikes on several locations in Lebanon killed six people.",
      "The United Nations Special Coordinator for Lebanon, Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert, said the exchange of fire was deeply concerning. \"This is a critical period for Lebanon and the wider region,\" she said Friday.",
      "The Israeli strikes on Beirut came as Lebanon's President Joseph Aoun made his first visit to Paris as his country's leader. He met Friday with President Emmanuel Macron who, following their meeting, called the Israeli strike \"unacceptable\" and a \"violation of the ceasefire\" that he argued would \"play into the hands of Hezbollah.\"",
      "Aoun called the Friday strike a continuation \"of Israel's violations\" of the November ceasefire agreement, which was sponsored by the U.S. and France.",
      "Israel continues bombing Gaza as humanitarian crisis deepens",
      "The escalation comes 11 days after Israel abruptly ended its separate ceasefire agreement with Hamas in Gaza, by launching a surprise wave of strikes that killed hundreds of people in the decimated Palestinian territory.",
      "Earlier this month, Israel halted deliveries of food, fuel, medicine and humanitarian aid to Gaza's roughly 2 million inhabitants.",
      "Israel has vowed to escalate the war until Hamas returns the 59 hostages it still holds in Gaza \u2014 24 of whom are still believed to be alive. Israel is demanding that Hamas give up power, disarm and send its leaders out of Gaza into exile.",
      "Hamas has said it will only release the remaining captives in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, a lasting ceasefire, and an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza.",
      "The war triggered by Hamas' terrorist attack has killed more than 50,000 Palestinians in Gaza, many of them women and children, according to the enclave's Hamas-run Health Ministry. The attack on Israel saw Hamas and its allies kill some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and take 251 others hostage.",
      "Almost 40 more people were killed in Israeli strikes across the Gaza Strip overnight, Palestinian media outlets said Friday, including 14 who were reportedly killed in a strike that hit a house in the al-Zaytoun neighborhood in Gaza city. The Gaza Health Ministry said Thursday that 855 people had been killed since the resumption of Israeli attacks on March 18. The Hamas-run ministry's figures do not differentiate between civilian and combatant casualties.",
      "The World Central Kitchen charity said in a social media post that one of its volunteers in Gaza was killed in an Israeli airstrike Thursday that hit near one of its kitchens during a meal distribution.",
      "\"Our hearts are heavy today,\" the organization, founded by American-Spanish chef Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s,\u00a0said in a social media post, adding that six other people were wounded in the same strike. About a year ago, Andr\u00e9s accused Israeli forces of \"targeting us in a deconflicting zone\" in Gaza. The charity acknowledged dismissing some staff in Gaza in December after Israeli authorities provided a list of about 60 WCK volunteers whom it alleged were linked to terrorism.",
      "\"This should not be taken as a conclusion by WCK that the individuals are affiliated with any terror organization,\" the Washington D.C-based charity said at the time. \"Prior to receiving the results of the COGAT [Israeli government] security check, we had no reason for concern regarding any of these individuals and, because Israel does not share intelligence with aid organizations, we do not know the basis for Israel's decision to flag these individuals. However, we felt this step was necessary to protect our team and operations.\"",
      "The United Nations' World Food Program also sounded alarm Friday over the deepening hunger crisis in Gaza more than two weeks after Israel cut off the flow of most humanitarian aid into the territory, with its director in the region telling the Al Jazeera network that more than 90% of the enclave's population lacked food security.",
      "According to a report by the U.N.'s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, Israel obstructed 82% of aid convoys intended for Gaza between March 18 and March 24), hampering relief efforts.",

    "summary": "A new study shows how cuts to foreign aid could lead to millions of HIV/AIDS deaths and soaring rates of infections, undoing decades of progress against the virus.",
    "story": [
      "Proposed cuts to global foreign aid, including slashing programs in the United States, could lead to millions of HIV deaths and soaring rates of infections around the world in the coming years, according to a new study.",
      "Published Wednesday in\u00a0The Lancet HIV journal, the modeling study estimates that by 2030, there could be between 4.4 million to 10.8 million additional new HIV infections in low- and middle-income countries and 770,000 to 2.9 million HIV-related deaths in children and adults. To estimate the impacts, the authors examined 26 countries that used foreign aid for HIV resources, including Albania, Cambodia, Colombia, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, South Africa and Sri Lanka.",
      "They noted that international funding has been crucial in reducing HIV transmissions and deaths, and that five countries \u2014 the U.S., U.K., France, Germany and the Netherlands \u2014 provide over 90% of international HIV funding, with the U.S. being by far the largest contributor. The U.S. committed $5.71 billion in 2023, or about 73% of total donor government funding, according to analysis by KFF, a nonpartisan health policy organization.",
      "But as of February, they authors report, donor nations have announced reductions in aid of between 8% and 70% between 2025 and 2026. The Trump administration froze foreign aid\u00a0spending, including funding for HIV/AIDS programs, soon after taking office, and the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, is spearheading major cutbacks.",
      "\"The United States has historically been the largest contributor to global efforts to treat and prevent HIV, but the current cuts to PEPFAR and USAID-supported programs have already disrupted access to essential HIV services including for antiretroviral therapy and HIV prevention and testing,\" co-lead study author Debra ten Brink of the Burnet Institute in Australia said in a news release.",
      "The study's authors said ongoing disruptions could undo decades of progress to end HIV/AIDS as a public health threat.",
      "\"Looking ahead, if other donor countries reduce funding, decades of progress to treat and prevent HIV could be unravelled. It is imperative to secure sustainable financing and avoid a resurgence of the HIV epidemic, which could have devastating consequences, not just in regions such as sub-Saharan Africa, but globally,\" said ten Brink.",
      "PEPFAR, or the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, was launched under then-President George W. Bush in 2003 and has invested over $100 billion in the global HIV/AIDS response over the years. According to the State Department, the program has saved the lives of\u00a026 million people since it began\u00a0\u2014 but its funding stopped after Secretary of State Marco Rubio ordered a\u00a0pause on foreign aid\u00a0earlier this year.",
      "\"PEPFAR is the largest commitment by any nation to address a single disease in history, enabled by strong bipartisan support across ten U.S. congresses and four presidential administrations, and through the American people's generosity,\" the government website HIV.gov reads. \"PEPFAR shows the power of what is possible through compassionate, cost-effective, accountable, and transparent American foreign assistance.\"",
      "Others have already warned about the devastation these cuts could bring to those who rely on it. Earlier this week, the UNAIDS chief warned that without funding, millions will die and the global AIDS pandemic will resurge.",
      "\"It is reasonable for the United States to want to reduce its funding over time, but the sudden withdrawal of lifesaving support is having a devastating impact,\" UNAIDS executive director Winnie Byanyima told reporters in Geneva. \"We urge for a reconsideration and an urgent restoration of services \u2014 lifesaving services.\"",
      "Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News, said the U.S. contributions play a key role that could not be easily replaced.",
      "\"Many of these countries rely heavily on the United States. Some of them between 50 and 70% of their budgets for HIV diagnosis, treatment and prevention is coming from the United States,\" she said on \"CBS Mornings Plus.\" \"There's not really any other country that can easily step in. And big picture, this is sort of like telling a surgeon in the middle of surgery to walk away. It's just not that easy to jump in and take over.\"",

Coming more than a year after Charles revealed that he had been diagnosed with an unspecified form of cancer and begun treatment, the incident renewed concern about the 76-year-old monarch's health.",

He reappeared Friday morning, leaving his London residence Clarence House and waving to well-wishers from inside a black Audi.",
      "Tourist Julian Mati told The Associated Press he was relieved to see Charles looking well as he left Clarence House.",
      "\"We were horrified when we heard the news yesterday,\" Mati told the AP. \"We had come down to the palace today to take pictures but we never imagined we would see the king. To see him smiling and waving, it's such a relief.\"",
      "Charles returned to Clarence House on Thursday night, but his events for Friday, which included a trip to Birmingham, about two hours north of London, were all canceled.",
      "The king has maintained a busy schedule of official events in recent weeks, having steadily ramped up his work after returning to public duties in April last year, just several months after beginning his treatment. He made his first foreign trip during the treatment in July 2024, to Australia.",
      "Last week, Charles was in Northern Ireland with Queen Camilla, and he met with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy earlier this month.",

      "\"The Government of Canada has launched an educational campaign to inform Americans of the economic impacts of tariffs. The campaign is a strategic investment in Canada's long-term economic interests, and its trade relationship with the United States,\" Babcock said. \"Tariffs are a tax on hard-working Americans in their daily lives.

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-japan-military-defense-ties-trump-china-threat/",
    "published": "Thu, 27 Mar 2025 08:34:37 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump has complained the U.S.-Japan defense partnership is one-sided, but with China throwing its weight around, Tokyo is hoping for even more support.",
    "story": [
      "Tokyo \u2014\u00a0President Trump in early March criticized what he characterized as a one-sided security alliance between the U.S. and Japan. Officials in Japan have heard these comments from Mr. Trump before, and so far, they've continued shaping the country's national security plans based on the assurance of backing from the United States.",
      "Government officials admit they really have no other choice.",
      "\"There is no Plan B for Japan other than the U.S.,\" Takuya Akiyama, Principal Deputy Director of the North American Affairs Bureau at the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told CBS News. \"Treaty wise and also as a physical presence, no other country can substitute the U.S. It is unthinkable.\"",
      "The U.S. may be pulling back from Europe under President Trump, but despite his remarks about Japan, U.S. military cooperation with Tokyo has appeared stable, and may even expand as the White House ramps up its standoff with Asia's increasingly assertive superpower, China.",
      "China's threat to its neighbors",
      "Japanese officials may have breathed a sigh of relief after Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's visit to the White House in February. The Trump administration reaffirmed its commitment to Japan's defense, including amid Tokyo's dispute with Beijing over ownership of the Senkaku islands.",
      "It is one of many land ownership disputes between China and its neighbors over islands in the South China Sea \u2014 virtually all of which Beijing claims as its territory. The White House has repeatedly condemned Chinese aggression and militarization in the South China Sea, and U.S. warships and aircraft routinely carry out \"freedom of navigation\" exercises in the area \u2014 often drawing sharp rebukes from Beijing.",
      "Advisers to the Japanese prime minister spent the months after the U.S. election preparing him for the meeting with Mr. Trump. They focused on using clear and concise language to convey the benefits of the security alliance to the U.S., and the increase Japan has made in its own defense spending and military procurement from America, according to officials at the Japanese foreign ministry.",
      "China has been rapidly bolstering its military capabilities, including its nuclear program, in recent years, according to U.S. officials. Last year, China announced a 7.2% increase in its defense budget, which was already the world's second-highest, behind only the United States.",
      "In February, Taiwan condemned China and deployed its own forces in response as the Chinese military held \"shooting training\" drills in the Taiwan Strait.",
      "\"From an American perspective, it's clear that if Taiwan falls, and if Japan falls, that our alliances in the Indo-Pacific are over,\" Kenneth Weinstein, Japan Chair at the Hudson Institute think tank, told CBS News. \"China will exercise extraordinary military sway \u2014 will be able to close down global shipping such as they see it, will be able to throttle access to the South China Sea and elsewhere.\"",
      "There have already been tense encounters between Japanese and Chinese naval vessels around the Senkaku islands, a group of uninhabited islands claimed by both Beijing and Tokyo. According to data from Japan's coast guard, Chinese government vessels entered the maritime zone around the islands, which China calls the Diaoyus, on 355 of the 366 days of 2024 \u2014 the highest number of intrusions reported by Japan since China started operating around the islands in 2008.",
      "The Chinese vessels operating around the islands have increased not only in number, but in armament, carrying more and larger weapons as they circle the disputed territories, according to officials at the foreign and defense ministries.",
      "While Japanese analysts don't believe a Chinese military invasion of the Senkaku islands is imminent, they say there's a risk that an accident or incident involving fishing or other non-military vessels in the area could lead to a rapid military escalation.",
      "\"The Chinese Communist Party believes in power. They have started to act because they believe they now have the power to do so,\" China expert Akio Takahara, a professor at the Tokyo Woman's Christian University, told CBS News. \"We want the U.S. to increase their presence in this region, because the Chinese are certainly going to enhance their presence in the region.\"",
      "Major boost to U.S.-Japan defense cooperation coming?",
      "Japan has revamped its approach to defense in recent years, including by committing to spend 2% of its GDP on defense by 2027. Japan announced a major policy shift in 2022, abandoning the country's post-World War II, exclusively defense posture with a decision to acquire counterstrike capabilities.",
      "The Trump administration has seemingly approved of the changes, and it has not asked Japan for even greater increases in defense spending as some Japanese officials feared it might.",
      "While Mr. Trump complained specifically this month about Japan's hypothetical preparedness to meet its mutual defense obligation to the U.S. under Article 5 of the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty, Japanese officials have tried to focus more on Article 6, under which Japan provides bases and facilities for U.S. forces. And that aspect of the relationship could be set to expand.",
      "The U.S. and Japan have been in discussions since before Mr. Trump came back to the White House about the possible establishment of a Joint Force Headquarters in Japan. If it happens, it would upgrade the role of the U.S. forces in Japan to a command headquarters with operational authority. The dialogue over the upgrade was announced under the Biden administration, after being requested by the Japanese.",
      "In the event of a regional security crisis \u2014 such as a Chinese attack on Taiwan or a disputed South China Sea island \u2014 having a Joint Force Headquarters in Japan would give the U.S. military the capacity to respond with commands from the region, rather than waiting for orders to come from the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command in Hawaii.",
      "U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is expected to meet with his Japanese counterpart in late March to discuss efforts to bolster U.S. forces in the Pacific region.",
      "Concern over Ukraine",
      "The dramatic vacillations by the Trump administration in its stance on Ukraine have also raised concern in Japan. Since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022, Japan has been a staunch supporter of Ukraine. Japanese officials worry about the precedent that would be set if the U.S. is seen to abandon a partner nation in the face of an invasion by a more powerful neighbor.",
      "\"In light of Russia's aggression against Ukraine, countries' perceptions on security have drastically changed around the world,\" then-Japanese Prime minister Fumio Kishida said at a regional security summit In June 2022, several months into Russia's invasion. \"I myself have a strong sense of urgency that Ukraine today may be East Asia tomorrow.\"",
      "The Japanese fear that if the U.S. and the world at large are prepared to accept a change in Europe's borders forced by Russian aggression, they could also decline to intervene in the case of a Chinese attack on Taiwan.",
      "\"The Chinese will be encouraged that, perhaps if Xi Jinping did something similar, Trump will be as kind to Xi Jinping as he's been to Putin,\" professor Takahara told CBS News. \"That kind of message will be received in Beijing.\"",
      "Officials in Tokyo are trying to remain focused on the long-term bilateral relationship with Washington, looking beyond the Trump administration, but they know China is watching closely as the relationship develops, especially given the volatile nature of the Trump administration's foreign policy.",
      "\"We don't know what Mr. Trump will be saying tomorrow and doing the day after. So, at least the Ishiba visit, the first round, went okay. We were happy about that,\" Takahara said. \"But what about the next round? When is it coming? No one knows.\"",

    "story": [
      "Authorities in Belize said Wednesday that three American women who were found dead last month while\u00a0on vacation in the country died as a result of carbon monoxide poisoning.",
      "The three women from Revere, Massachusetts, 23-year-old Kaoutar Naqqad, 24-year-old Imane Mallah and 26-year-old Wafae El-Arar, were found unconscious in their hotel room at the Royal Kahal Beach Resort in February. Investigators in Belize said last month that the women had a build-up of fluids in their lungs but were still awaiting final test results for the cause of death.",
      "Gian Cho, executive director of the National Forensics Science Service, said Wednesday that all three women had carboxyhemoglobin levels higher than 60%. Carboxyhemoglobin levels are typically lower than 2% in nonsmokers and lower than 5% in smokers.",
      "Carbon monoxide is an odorless, colorless gas and is produced any time a fossil fuel is burned.\u00a0 Accidental poisoning can occur when home appliances like furnaces, kerosene heaters, stoves, lanterns and generators produce fumes that people breathe in.",
      "Belize Police Commissioner Chester Williams said that as a result of the findings, authorities have conducted a second test of the hotel room for carbon monoxide poisoning after initial testing showed no signs. Williams said they are still awaiting the final test results.",
      "Authorities also found and tested the alcohol and gummies found in the room. THC was found in one of the items, but no illicit substances were found in the bodies of the three women, Cho said.",
      "The families of the deceased said in a joint statement, \"While we remain shattered by the loss of these three bright lights in our world, we are incredibly heartened by the results of this investigation and grateful to those who completed it in a thorough and independent manner.\"",
      "\"We have said since the beginning of this investigation that their deaths were suspicious and raised concerns about initial reports in the news media. While today's official finding puts to rest those initial reports, we hope this will give authorities in law enforcement pause before they make similar suggestions during future investigations,\" the families said, noting they were still awaiting results of an independent review being conducted by Massachusettes authorities. \"Survivors such as our families deserve their best, honest work. We received it today but needed it throughout this investigative process.\"",
      "\"Our families remain incredibly grateful to the outpouring of support we have received from family, friends, leaders and loved ones since their passing. We appreciate the privacy that has been extended to our families as we grieve and are also grateful to the media who have helped ensure that Wafae, Imane, Kaoutar and the impact of their loss are a central part of your news coverage,\" they added. \"Our families ask for continued prayers, patience, and privacy as we navigate this unimaginable loss. May their beautiful souls rest in eternal peace. We will forever love and miss you, Kaoutar, Imane and Wafae.",

    "story": [
      "The editor of The Atlantic, Jeffrey Goldberg, has nothing to say about his relationship with national security adviser Mike Waltz, who inadvertently added him to a group chat about the United States' highly sensitive plans to bomb Yemen days ago.",
      "\"I'm just not going to comment on my relationship with Mike Waltz,\" Goldberg told CBS News in an interview Wednesday.",
      "Waltz claimed he has \"never met\" with Goldberg, wouldn't be able to pick him out of a police lineup and trashed his reputation, calling him \"the bottom scum of journalists.\" But photos surfaced online earlier Wednesday of the two together at an event at the French Embassy in 2021.",
      "\"If your eyeballs see us together, then I guess your eyeballs are seeing us together,\" Goldberg said of the photos.",
      "Waltz has also suggested that Goldberg somehow added himself to the Signal chat that also included Vice President JD Vance and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth \u2014 or that some other technical mishap that led to the breach. Goldberg called the claims \"crazy.\"",
      "\"This is what happened on March 11,\" Goldberg continued. \"I got a message request from Michael Waltz. I accepted the message request. That's what happened.\" Signal only allows users to add people to chat groups by phone number, QR code or username of the person they wish to add. The Atlantic story published Wednesday included a screenshot that showed Waltz as administrator and \"JG\" as a member of the group chat, named the \"Houthi PC small group.\"",
      "\"If I'm such a nefarious character,\" Goldberg said, \"why am I in Mike Waltz's phone? Why does he have my phone number? Why is he including me in this chat? And what do you expect a reporter to do when you learn interesting information about the way an administration is contemplating military action? What do they really think is going to happen?\"",
      "Goldberg did not publish the contents of the message thread until more than a week after the Yemen strikes. On Monday, he posted a piece detailing how he was added to the 18-person chat and characterized parts of the conversation about plans to bomb Houthi targets, rather than quoting them directly, citing his concerns that the details were too sensitive to publish. But after the group chat members and President Trump repeatedly denied that the information was classified, Goldberg, after checking with the administration to see if officials wanted anything redacted, published the text messages about the strikes on Wednesday.",
      "The additional messages showed Hegseth provided detailed information to the group about the strikes targeting Houthi rebels earlier this month, including a timeline of when fighter jets would take off and what kind of weapons would be used.",
      "Goldberg said it's in the public's interest to have the information and be able to judge the incident for themselves.",
      "\"The public has a right to know if there's a massive security breach in the national security apparatus of the United States. There's obvious proof here that national security officials we're talking about real-time intelligence and military information on an open source messaging app that they're not supposed to use for that sort of thing,\" Goldberg said. \"When reporters discover a massive national security breach, it's our duty to tell the public.\"",

    "summary": "As Trump Cabinet members sent texts on Signal, one of them, Steve Witkoff, was in Russia, but the White House says he didn't have his phone.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump's Ukraine and Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff was in Moscow, where he met with Russian President Vladimir Putin, when he was included in a group chat with more than a dozen other top administration officials \u2014 and inadvertently, one journalist \u2014 on the messaging app Signal, a CBS News analysis of open-source flight information and Russian media reporting has revealed.",
      "Witkoff arrived in Moscow shortly after noon local time on March 13, according to data from the flight tracking website FlightRadar24, and Russian state media broadcast video of his motorcade leaving Vnukovo International Airport shortly after. About 12 hours later, he was added to the \"Houthi PC small group\" chat on Signal, along with other top Trump administration officials, to discuss an imminent military operation against the Houthis in Yemen, according to The Atlantic magazine editor Jeffrey Goldberg, who was included on the chat for reasons that remain unclear.",
      "Goldberg has not recounted Witkoff making any comments in the group chat until Saturday, after he left Russia and returned to the U.S., with a stop on Friday in Baku, Azerbaijan. Sources told CBS News on Wednesday that no device the senior envoy brought with him to Russia had Signal on it.",
      "Speaking Wednesday during a briefing at the White House, press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Witkoff did not have his personal device or his government-issued phone with him in Moscow. She said he was given access to a \"classified protected server by the United States government, and he was very careful about his communications when he was in Russia.\"",
      "Russia has repeatedly tried to compromise Signal, a popular commercial messaging platform that many were shocked to learn senior Trump administration officials had used to discuss sensitive military planning.",
      "It is unclear whether a phone issued to Witkoff by the U.S. government or a personal device was included in the Signal chat, but U.S. officials have been discouraged from using the messaging app on government devices, including by the Department of Defense.",
      "Witkoff, in his own social media post Wednesday, said he \"had no access to my personal devices until I returned from my trip.\"",
      "\"I only had with me a secure phone provided by the government for special circumstances when you travel to regions where you do not want your devices compromised,\" Witkoff said.",
      "The White House has not answered CBS News' question about whether Witkoff's government-issued phone had on it the Signal account in question. During a congressional hearing\u00a0Wednesday, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard said \"the Signal message app comes pre-installed on government devices.\"",
      "On Tuesday, Leavitt criticized The Atlantic report, saying\u00a0no \"war plans\" were discussed, and, without naming Signal, adding that the White House Counsel's Office had \"provided guidance on a number of different platforms for President Trump's top officials to communicate as safely and efficiently as possible.\"",
      "Two members of the group chat, Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe, appeared before the Senate Intelligence Committee for the pre-planned hearing\u00a0on worldwide security threats  that continued on Wednesday. Ratcliffe acknowledged Tuesday during the hearing that he was part of the chat.",
      "U.S. lawmakers, both Democrats and Republicans, have questioned the use of the commercial communications platform for the conversation, which Goldberg revealed Monday in his own\u00a0report\u00a0for The Atlantic.",
      "During the group discussion on Signal, Goldberg reported, Ratcliffe named an active CIA intelligence officer in the chat at 5:24 p.m. eastern time, which was just after midnight in Russia. Witkoff's flight did not leave Moscow until around 2 a.m. local time, and Sergei Markov, a former Putin advisor who is still close to the Russian president, said in a Telegram post that Witkoff and Putin were meeting in the Kremlin until 1:30 a.m.",
      "Neither the Kremlin nor the White House have confirmed the timing of Witkoff's meeting with Putin.",
      "Signal has a good reputation for security in part because it is built on open-source code and can therefore be inspected for vulnerabilities, Neil Ashdown, a consultant working on cybersecurity, told CBS News.",
      "Ashdown said, however, that considering whether the platform is secure, \"is to miss the crux of the problem, which is to question whether the use of that application in that environment to convey that level of information was in line with policies and processes, and if it wasn't, then that becomes an issue.\"",
      "The Signal app offers end-to-end encryption, meaning messages sent on the platform cannot be read by anyone but the senders and receivers. That encryption is not impenetrable, however.",
      "The Google Threat Intelligence Group warned just last month of \"increasing efforts from several Russia state-aligned threat actors to compromise Signal Messenger accounts used by individuals of interest to Russia's intelligence services.\"",
      "Ukraine's top cyber defense agency warned just last week about targeted attacks prompting compromised Signal accounts to send malware to employees of defense industry firms and members of Ukraine's armed forces. The bulletin issued by Ukraine's Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-UA) on March 18 indicates that attacks started this month, with Signal messages containing links to archived messages, masquerading as meeting reports. According to the memo, some of the messages were sent from existing contacts, increasing the likelihood of the\u00a0 phishing links being opened.",
      "Some methods of hijacking smartphones don't even require direct access to the device, Jake Moore, a global cybersecurity advisor at the software and cybersecurity firm ESET, told CBS News.",
      "One of the most well-known cyber threats to emerge in the last decade has been Pegasus, spyware developed by the Israeli firm NSO Group and purportedly used to target journalists and activists. Pegasus was designed to be remotely installed on mobile devices and can then take control of the camera, messaging apps, microphones, or even the screen itself without the user even knowing it has been installed, Moore explained.",
      "While secure government communications channels exist for sensitive communications, Moore said in practice, the method chosen for such communication, \"often comes down to the balance of convenience versus security.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and CIA Director John Ratcliffe defended their participation in a group chat on the encrypted messaging app Signal that included sensitive details about military strikes in Yemen after\u00a0more text messages came to light\u00a0and revealed new details about what was shared.",
      "The spy chiefs were on Capitol Hill on Wednesday to testify before the House Intelligence Committee alongside FBI Director Kash Patel, National Security Agency Director Gen. Timothy Haugh and Defense Intelligence Agency Director Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Kruse at a hearing ostensibly focused on the global security threats facing the U.S. But the Signal leak and its fallout dominated much of the questioning, especially from Democrats.",
      "Gabbard and Ratcliffe continued to insist that no classified information was sent in the group chat, baffling Democrats who cited executive orders and internal government guidance to argue that the operational details should have been considered highly classified.",
      "Shortly before the hearing began, The Atlantic\u00a0published\u00a0additional messages showing Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth provided detailed information to the group of senior Trump officials about the strikes targeting Houthi rebels earlier this month, including a timeline of when fighter jets would take off and what kind of weapons would be used.",
      "White House national security adviser Mike Waltz inadvertently added Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor in chief of The Atlantic, to the chat, and Goldberg revealed the first batch of texts earlier this week. He initially declined to publish the most sensitive texts because, he wrote, the information \"could conceivably have been used to harm American military and intelligence personnel.\" The magazine decided to unveil the withheld messages after Gabbard, Ratcliffe and other officials publicly asserted that the information wasn't classified.",
      "At Wednesday's hearing, Rep. Jim Himes of Connecticut, the top Democrat on the committee, chastised the intelligence leaders at the start of the hearing, saying they put the lives of troops at risk.",
      "\"Everyone here knows that the Russians or the Chinese could have gotten all of that information, and they could have passed it on to the Houthis, who easily could have repositioned weapons and altered their plans to knock down planes or sink ships,\" Himes said.",
      "Gabbard acknowledged that the conversation was \"sensitive\" but denied that classified information was shared in the chat.",
      "\"There were no sources, methods, locations or war plans that were shared,\" she told lawmakers, echoing the defense from the White House that \"war plans\" were not discussed, despite the detailed guidance for an impending attack. Hegseth and other administration officials attacked The Atlantic and Goldberg in the wake of the latest texts' release, accusing them and the media at large of blowing the situation out of proportion.",
      "Himes told Gabbard that, under the ODNI's own guidance, \"information providing indication or advance warning that the U.S. or its allies are preparing an attack\" should be classified as top secret. Gabbard said the information Hegseth disclosed in the chat would fall under the Defense Department's classification guidance and she was unfamiliar with the department's specific guidance for classification.",
      "Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, an Illinois Democrat, pointed out that the Defense Department's manual on classification says that \"information shall be classified if its unauthorized disclosure could reasonably be expected to cause describable damage to national security.\" Krishnamoorthi also cited an executive order issued by President Barack Obama and retained by President Trump that says information should be classified if \"its unauthorized disclosure could reasonably be expected to cause damage to national security, including military plans, weapons systems or operations.\"",
      "\"Applying the executive order as well as the DOD manual to this fact pattern, we clearly have weapon systems that have been identified. That is classified information,\" Krishnamoorthi said after reading Hegseth's texts.",
      "Ratcliffe defended his participation in the chat, saying that a CIA official whose name he sent to the group was his chief of staff and is not undercover. He accused Goldberg of insinuating that Ratcliffe improperly disclosed the name to the group and said Signal is an acceptable means of communication for the CIA.",
      "\"My answers haven't changed. I used an appropriate channel to communicate sensitive information. It was permissible to do so. I didn't transfer any classified information, and at the end of the day, what is most important is that the mission was a remarkable success,\" Ratcliffe said.",
      "Rep. Joaquin Castro, a Texas Democrat, accused the officials of misleading the public about the information's classification, arguing there has been \"much less sensitive\" information presented to lawmakers that has \"high classification.\"",
      "\"The idea that this information, if it was presented to our committee would not be classified, y'all know, is a lie. That's ridiculous,\" he said.",
      "Castro asked Haugh, the NSA director, whether such details would be classified if intercepted by his agency. Haugh said it would be classified to protect sources and methods, \"not necessarily based off the content.\"",
      "Republicans on the committee had a muted response to the scandal during the hearing, with most focusing their questions on other areas of national security. Rep. Rick Crawford of Arkansas, the Republican chairman of the committee, said at the top of the hearing that he wanted members to discuss \"the real and existential threats that face our nation\" after the Senate Intelligence Committee was consumed with questions about the group chat.",
      "One of the feistiest moments during the hearing came when Democratic Rep. Jimmy Gomez of California asked about Hegseth's drinking habits and if the intelligence officials had any knowledge of the defense secretary being under the influence before the sending of texts about the strikes. Gabbard said she did not have any knowledge of Hegseth's personal activities. Ratcliffe shot back, \"I think that's an offensive line of questioning. The answer is no!\"",
      "\"Of course we want to know if his performance is compromised!\" Gomez said during the heated back and forth.",
      "Gabbard and Ratcliffe were both grilled by Democrats on the Senate panel on Tuesday about the security breach. Both acknowledged that they were part of the chat, but denied that classified information was shared.",
      "Sen. Mark Kelly, an Arizona Democrat, pressed both of them about whether targets, weapons systems or timing were discussed in the chat during Tuesday's hearing. They claimed they did not recall those details being discussed.",
      "\"In the Signal chain that we have been talking about, was there any mention of a target in Yemen?\" Kelly said.",
      "\"I don't remember mention of specific targets,\" Gabbard responded. Ratcliffe said that answer was \"consistent with my recollection.\"",
      "Gabbard also said she didn't recall \"specific names of systems or weapons being used or named,\" which Ratcliffe echoed. They also said they did not remember mentions of timing or military assets that were used.",
      "Mr. Trump said Tuesday that he would \"look into\" whether administration officials should continue using the encrypted messaging app to communicate, but largely dismissed the severity of the leak.",
      "Annual threat assessment",
      "This week's House and Senate hearings coincided with the release of the intelligence community's annual threat assessment. This year's 31-page report details threats posed by foreign illicit drug actors, such as drug cartels in Mexico, Islamic extremists, China, Russia, Iran and North Korea.",
      "\"Cooperation among China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea has been growing more rapidly in recent years, reinforcing threats from each of them individually while also posing new challenges to U.S. strength and power globally,\" the assessment says.",
      "According to the report, Russia's war in Ukraine has accelerated cooperation between the four nations and Russia has become increasingly reliant on the other countries to carry out its military objectives and mitigate economic consequences imposed by its adversaries.",
      "Despite the heavy costs associated with the Ukraine invasion, \"Russia has proven adaptable and resilient\" and its air forces are \"more modern and capable than at the start of the invasion,\" the assessment says.",
      "\"The war in Ukraine has afforded Moscow a wealth of lessons regarding combat against Western weapons and intelligence in a large-scale war,\" the report says. \"This experience probably will challenge future U.S. defense planning, including against other adversaries with whom Moscow is sharing those lessons learned.\"",
      "It added that the possibility that Russian President Vladimir Putin loses his grip on power \"probably is less likely now than at any point in his quarter-century rule.\"",
      "China is viewed as \"most capable\" of threatening U.S. interests abroad. The country poses \"the most comprehensive and robust\" military threat to U.S. national security and the \"most active and persistent\" cyber threat to government, private sector and critical infrastructure networks in the U.S., according to the report. But intelligence agencies assess China as being \"more cautious than Russia, Iran, and North Korea about risking its economic and diplomatic image in the world by being too aggressive and disruptive.\"",
      "The intelligence community expects Beijing to dial up pressure on Taiwan in 2025 as it seeks reunification with the self-ruled island.",
      "Meanwhile, Iran will continue to target former and current U.S. officials over the killing of Qassem Soleimani, who led the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, the report said. Mr. Trump, however, has revoked the security details for several former officials despite the ongoing threat posed by Iran.",
      "The report also says that Iran is not building a nuclear weapon and Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei has not reauthorized the program, \"though pressure has probably built on him to do so.\"",
      "In North Korea, leader Kim Jong Un is increasing his stockpile of nuclear warheads and has \"no intention of negotiating away his strategic weapons programs, which he perceives as a guarantor of regime security and national pride.\"",

      "The plans were criticized Monday by Greenland Prime Minister Mute Egede, who said Washington was interfering in Greenland's internal affairs, according to the French news agency AFP.",
      "\"It should be said clearly that our integrity and democracy must be respected without foreign interference,\" AFP quoted Egede as saying, adding that it \"cannot be seen as just a private visit.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration continues to insist it didn't defy a federal judge's order when it failed to turn around planes carrying Venezuelan migrants to El Salvador.",
      "U.S. District Judge James Boasberg is weighing whether the government defied his order blocking the deportations of alleged gang members who hadn't been afforded due process. It's a case that's become a flashpoint in the rising tension between the administration and federal courts.",
      "In a 14-page document\u00a0filed late Tuesday night, the Justice Department spelled out before Boasberg why it didn't turn around the two flights carrying alleged Tren de Aragua gang members despite his verbal order to do so.",
      "\"These removals both complied with the law and safeguarded Americans against members of a foreign terrorist organization. The Government will continue to defend the removals before this Court and, if necessary, on appeal challenging this Court's two injunctions issued on March 15,\" the filing reads. It's signed by Attorney General Pam Bondi and other senior DOJ officials.",
      "The government attempts to thread the needle regarding Boasberg's directive, arguing that it didn't \"remove\" any of the migrants after he entered his order and that it \"complied with the Court's injunction with respect to the two flights at issue\" because it didn't formally remove anyone after 7:25 p.m. Saturday, though acknowledging it \"did not order any removal flights to return to the United States.\"",
      "Boasberg asked Drew Ensign, the attorney for the Justice Department, if he understood the verbal orders to turn the plane around and if Ensign understood if the order was immediate. Ensign said he did. But in its appellate court filing, the DOJ continued to argue that Boasberg's order was unclear and insufficient to be binding, asserting it \"failed to satisfy the requirements for issuing a binding injunction\" because Boasberg and the court didn't state \"the reasons why it issued\" the injunction.",
      "\"It is well-settled (in law) that an oral directive is not enforceable as an injunction,\" the filing alleges.",
      "The DOJ later in the filing argues that once the flights were out of U.S. airspace, they were \"military matters\" and President Trump has the power to order military flights wherever he wants.",
      "\"DOJ cites state secrets privilege\"",
      "On Monday, the administration invoked a state secrets privilege\u00a0and refused to give Boasberg any additional information about the deportations.",
      "Boasberg, the chief judge of the federal district court in Washington, has\u00a0asked for details\u00a0about when the planes landed and who was on board, information the administration asserts would harm \"diplomatic and national security concerns.\"",
      "Government attorneys also asked an appeals court on Monday to lift\u00a0Boasberg's order\u00a0and allow deportations to continue, a push that appeared to divide the three-judge panel.",
      "Circuit Court Judge Patricia Millett said, \"Nazis got better treatment under the Alien Enemies Act than has happened here,\" referring to the way Nazis detained in the U.S.\u00a0during World World II were processed compared to the Venezuelan immigrants deported\u00a0to El Salvador this month under the same statute.",
      "\"We certainly dispute the Nazi analogy,\" government attorney Drew Ensign responded during a hearing of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.",
      "Millett noted that during World War II, Nazis were put before hearing boards under Franklin D. Roosevelt's administration, and the Trump administration has conceded the alleged\u00a0Tren de Aragua\u00a0gang members deported to El Salvador and detained in a maximum security prison didn't have the chance to appear in court.",
      "Millett is one of the three appellate judges who will decide whether to lift a March 15 order temporarily prohibiting deportations under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. They didn't rule from the bench Monday.",
      "Judge Justin Walker, who also sits on the appeals court, appeared open to the administration's argument that the migrants should be challenging their detention in Texas rather than the nation's capital. The third judge on the panel didn't ask any questions.",
      "The administration has transferred hundreds of Venezuelan immigrants to El Salvador, invoking the Alien Enemies Act for the first time since World War II. The law has only been invoked three times throughout American history: during the War of 1812, World War I and World War II.",
      "Also on Monday, attorneys representing the Venezuelan government filed a legal action in El Salvador to free 238 Venezuelans who are being held in a Salvadoran maximum-security prison after the U.S. deported them.",
      "The Alien Enemies Act allows noncitizens to be deported without the opportunity to go before an immigration or federal court judge. Mr. Trump issued a proclamation calling the Tren de Aragua gang an invading force.",
      "Ensign argued that Boasberg's ruling was an \"unprecedented and enormous intrusion upon the powers of the executive branch.\"",
      "\"The president has to comply with the Constitution and the laws like anyone else,\" said Millett, who was nominated by Democratic President Barack Obama in 2013.",
      "Judge Justin Walker, whom Mr. Trump nominated in 2020, seemed to be more receptive to the administration's arguments based on his line of questioning. Walker pointed to the government's assertions that the plaintiffs should have filed their lawsuit in Texas, where the immigrants were detained.",
      "\"You could have filed the exact same complaint you filed here in Texas district court,\" Walker told American Civil Liberties Union attorney Lee Gelernt.",
      "\"We have no idea if everyone is in Texas,\" Gelernt said.",
      "Walker also pressed the plaintiffs' lawyer to cite any prior case in which a judicial order blocking \"a national security operation with foreign implications\" survived appellate review.",
      "Gelernt accused the administration of trying to use the law to \"short circuit\" immigration proceedings. Plaintiffs' attorneys had no way to individually challenge all the deportations before planeloads of Venezuelans took off on March 15, he added.",
      "\"This has all been done in secret,\" Gelernt said.",
      "Judge Karen LeCraft Henderson, who was nominated by Republican President George H.W. Bush in 1990, was the third judge on the panel. She's the one who didn't ask any questions during a hearing that lasted roughly two hours.",
      "Boasberg, also an Obama nominee, ruled that immigrants facing deportation must get an opportunity to challenge their designations as alleged gang members. He said there is \"a strong public interest in preventing the mistaken deportation of people based on categories they have no right to challenge.\"",
      "\"The public also has a significant stake in the Government's compliance with the law,\"\u00a0the judge wrote.",
      "Mr. Trump and his allies have called for impeaching Boasberg.",
      "In a rare statement, Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts said \"impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision.\"",

      "Organizers said that after 40 years in the mountains, the festival had outgrown Park City, and lacked the necessary theaters or affordable housing to continue hosting what has become one of North America\u2019s most sprawling movie events. Sundance had narrowed down the options to Salt Lake City (with a smaller presence in Park City), Cincinnati and Boulder.",
      "'IMPORTANT LESSON': CONSERVATIVE ACTIVIST REVEALS 'FASCINATING' EXPERIENCE AT LIBERAL SUNDANCE FILM FESTIVAL",
      "Boulder emerged as their choice due to its close proximity to nature, its small-town charm and an engaged community that, organizer said, provides Sundance the ideal setting for its future.",
      "\"Boulder is a tech town, it\u2019s a college town, it\u2019s an arts town, and it\u2019s a mountain town,\" Amanda Kelso, acting chief executive of the Sundance Institute, said in an interview Thursday from Boulder. \"At 100,000 people, a larger town than Park City, it gives us the space to expand.\"",
      "Kelso, Sundance Institute board chair Ebs Burnough and Eugene Hernandez, director of the festival and head of programming, spoke shortly before announcing the festival\u2019s move in Boulder. Local officials, who helped lure Sundance with $34 million in tax credits over 10 years, applauded the decision.",
      "\"Here in our state we celebrate the arts and film industry as a key economic driver, job creator and important contributor to our thriving culture,\" Colorado Gov. Jared Polis (Dem.) said in a statement.",
      "Reacting to the decision, Utah Gov. Spencer Cox (Rep.) said Thursday that Sundance will come to regret leaving Utah.",
      "\"As I\u2019ve said from the beginning, we wanted Sundance to stay,\" Cox said in a statement. \"We made that clear to their leadership and put together a highly competitive package. Ultimately, this decision is theirs to make, but I believe it\u2019s a mistake and that, one day, they\u2019ll realize they left behind not just a place, but their heritage.\"",

      "A changed endorsed by Sundance founder Robert Redford",
      "A shift from Park City to Boulder means Sundance stays at altitude but gives up being located in an expensive ski town. The mile-high Colorado city set in the foothills of the Rockies also maintains a sense of surrounding nature \u2014 something organizers stressed as a factor in their decision. Boulder\u2019s four-block pedestrian mall on Pearl Street, with nearby theaters, could also provide a similar sense of central hub like Park City\u2019s Main Street. The Macky Auditorium, on the University of Colorado campus, is expected to be a central stage for Sundance.",
      "The Sundance Institute was founded in 1981 by Robert Redford, who sought a location far from Hollywood to foster independent voices in film. In 1984, the institute took over the Sundance Film Festival, but the nonprofit\u2019s mission of helping young filmmakers grow through labs and workshops \u2014 Redford\u2019s real passion \u2014 continued year-round away from the festival.",
      "The 88-year-old Redford, who attended the University of Colorado in Boulder in his youth, gave the move his blessing.",
      "\"Words cannot express the sincere gratitude I have for Park City, the state of Utah, and all those in the Utah community that have helped to build the organization,\" Redford said in a statement. \"What we\u2019ve created is remarkably special and defining. As change is inevitable, we must always evolve and grow, which has been at the core of our survival.\"",
      "How Sundance chose its new home",
      "The festival made \"ethos and equity values\" one of its criteria, prompting many to wonder how much local politics would influence the choice by Sundance, which emphasizes inclusivity. Gov. Cox is currently weighing a bill that would ban the flying of certain flags at schools and government buildings, including the LGBTQ pride flag.",
      "Organizers said Boulder\u2019s \"welcoming environment aligns with the ethos the Sundance Film Festival developed in Park City.\"",
      "\"This process started 18 months ago and we\u2019ve been in Utah for 40 years. So politics really didn\u2019t guide the process,\" Burnough said Thursday. \"It was really and truly about evolution. That\u2019s where it landed. We didn\u2019t constantly spend time examining what bill was going forward or may or may not be signed.\"",
      "With its current contract expiration date looming, the hunt for a new host city began in earnest in April 2024. The initial group of six contenders also included Atlanta, Louisville, Kentucky and Santa Fe, New Mexico.",
      "What Sundance has meant for Park City, and the film world",
      "Before packing up, Sundance will have one last edition in Park City in January 2026.",
      "\"The Sundance Film Festival will be the Sundance Film Festival wherever we go. What\u2019s consistent is our mission,\" said Hernandez. \"This is a festival of global discovery. What\u2019s exciting about Boulder is this is a place we can build.\"",
      "Over the years, Sundance in Park City swelled into a premier marketplace for American film, drawing studio executives and parka-wearing celebrities into the Wasatch mountains every January. It helped launch countless filmmakers over the years, from Steven Soderbergh (\"Sex, Lies and Videotape\") to Ryan Coogler (\"Fruitvale Station\"). Sundance scored its first best picture winner with \"CODA\" in 2022.",
      "Sundance meant big business for Utah and Park City. In 2024, the festival had some 72,840 in-person attendees, 24,200 of whom were coming from out of state. According to the festival\u2019s economic impact report, out-of-state visitors spent an estimated $106.4 million in Utah during the festival. Its total economic impact was estimated to be $132 million, with 1,730 jobs for Utah residents and $69.7 million in Utah wages.",
      "But the festival had also sparred with local ski resorts \u2014 Park City\u2019s other major money maker \u2014 as festivalgoers filled the hotels and left the slopes virtually empty for two weeks during peak ski season. The festival was a boon to some local businesses, but a hindrance to others. For visitors flying into the 10-day festival, ballooning rental costs increasingly factored into attending.",

      "All three top contenders budgeted millions to lure the lucrative festival to their city. Cincinnati set aside $2.5 million for Sundance and another $2.5 million to come if it was chosen. Salt Lake City offered Sundance $3.5 million to stay in Utah.",
      "Sundance's relocation puts two of the top U.S. film festivals in Colorado. The Telluride Film Festival, held further west in the state, runs in late August."

      "7 SIGNS YOU MIGHT HAVE ADHD AND WHAT STEPS TO TAKE",
      "To gather the data, researchers took blood samples from 307 Black women during their second trimester of pregnancy, then tested for markers of the fever-reducing medication.",

      "Researchers then followed up with the children at 8 to 10 years of age to determine how many had been diagnosed with ADHD, then determined whether prenatal exposure to acetaminophen was linked with a higher likelihood of the disorder.",

      "Another major limitation is the study design, as it cannot prove that acetaminophen use causes ADHD.",
      "\"We can never be 100% sure that an association is causal in an observational study like this, as there can always be unknown confounding factors,\" Baker told Fox News Digital.",
      "ADHD is a \"complex, multifactorial deficit in executive functioning\" that can manifest in a variety of ways, according to one expert. (iStock)",
      "\"We tried to control for as many factors as possible, including family history of mental health conditions, maternal use of antibiotics, maternal use of other drugs used for pain/fever, socioeconomic status of the family, and prenatal tobacco and alcohol exposure,\" he added.",
      "While the researchers may have identified a\u00a0possible risk for ADHD, the mental health condition is a \"complex, multifactorial deficit in executive functioning\" that can manifest in a variety of ways, according to Dr. Lama Bazzi, a psychiatrist in private practice in New York City.",

      "Why the difference between men and women?",
      "One potential reason for the gender discrepancy, according to the researchers, is that men are more likely to store fat viscerally (in the belly), while women generally accumulate more subcutaneous fat (under the skin) and peripheral fat (in the arms and legs).",

      "Minimizing risk",
      "To reduce cancer risk, Osborn recommends that men measure their waistlines to ensure they're in a healthy range. People can also track their visceral fat score on a medical-grade anthropometry scale, he said.",

Clicking the \"I\u2019m not a robot\" button triggers a set of instructions asking you to press specific keyboard shortcuts. First, you are told to press Windows + R, which opens the Windows Run dialog. Then you are instructed to press CTRL + V, which pastes a malicious script copied from the website\u2019s virtual clipboard.

Clicking on links in these emails directs you to a ClickFix trap. Healthcare workers have also been targeted, with malicious code embedded into the widely used physical therapy site HEP2go.",
      "Once ClickFix is on your PC, it installs various types of malware, including password stealers like XWorm, Lumma Stealer and DanaBot, which extract your login credentials and financial information.

      "2. Don\u2019t click links from unverified emails and use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Many ClickFix attacks start with phishing emails that impersonate trusted services like Booking.com or Google Meet. Always verify the sender before clicking on links. If an email seems urgent or unexpected, go directly to the company\u2019s official website instead of clicking any links inside the email.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",

      "3. Enable two-factor authentication:\u00a0Enable two-factor authentication whenever possible. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as a code sent to your phone, in addition to your password.",
      "4. Keep devices updated: Regularly\u00a0updating your operating system, browser and security software ensures you have the latest patches against known vulnerabilities. Cybercriminals exploit outdated systems, so enabling automatic updates is a simple but effective way to stay protected.",
      "5. Monitor your accounts for suspicious activity and change your passwords:\u00a0If you\u2019ve interacted with a suspicious website, phishing email or fake login page, check your online accounts for any unusual activity. Look for unexpected login attempts, unauthorized password resets or financial transactions that you don\u2019t recognize. If anything seems off, change your passwords immediately and report the activity to the relevant service provider. Also, consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "6. Invest in personal data removal service: Consider using a service that monitors your personal information and alerts you to potential breaches or unauthorized use of your data. These services can provide early warning signs of identity theft or other malicious activities resulting from ClickFix or similar attacks. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",

      "ClickFix is a reminder that malware doesn\u2019t always rely on complex exploits. It often just needs you to follow the wrong instructions. Attackers are refining their methods, making scams like fake CAPTCHAs, phishing emails and deceptive pop-ups more convincing than ever. The best way to stay ahead is to question anything that seems even slightly off. If a website asks you to run commands or paste something into PowerShell, it\u2019s a red flag.

      "Hackers worldwide are exploiting any type of free document converter or downloader tool to carry out this scheme. The scam may involve websites that promise to convert files, such as turning a .doc into a .pdf, or tools that claim to merge multiple images into a single document.

These programs let you convert files securely without exposing your data to potential threats.",
      "2. Check the website\u2019s reputation:\u00a0Before using an online converter, research the site. Look for reviews and see if cybersecurity forums or sources have flagged it as unsafe. If the site lacks basic security measures, avoid it.",
      "3. Avoid downloading executable files:\u00a0If an online document converter provides an .exe, .bat or .scr file instead of a standard document format, do not download or run it. Legitimate converters should only generate files like .pdf, .docx or .png, not executables that could contain malware.",
      "4. Scan files after conversion: Even if you use a trusted converter, always scan the converted file with up-to-date\u00a0strong antivirus software before opening it.",
      "5. Check file permissions: After conversion, verify that the new file doesn't have unexpected permissions or properties that could indicate malware.",
      "6. Create backups and enable ransomware protection:\u00a0Regularly\u00a0back up important documents on an external drive or a secure cloud service. Some security suites, like Microsoft Defender, offer ransomware protection features that prevent unauthorized changes to your files.",
      "7. Be cautious of browser extensions: Avoid installing browser extensions for file conversion, as these can often be browser hijackers or adware.",
      "8. Consider paid services: If you frequently need to convert files, invest in a reputable paid service that offers better security and privacy protection.",
      "9. Use cloud-based solutions: Consider using cloud-based productivity suites that offer built-in conversion tools, reducing the need for third-party converters.",

      "The real issue is not just malware-laced converters but the habit of trading security for convenience without a second thought. The internet is filled with services that appear free but come at the hidden cost of stolen data, financial fraud or compromised devices. Instead of trusting every tool that offers an easy solution, it is important to think critically about what we are giving away whenever we upload a file or click a download button.",

      "1) Opt out of arbitration: If you wish to retain your right to sue the company in case of future issues, opt out of arbitration agreements by emailing your notification to opt out of arbitration arbitrationoptout@23andme.com within 30 days of first use.",
      "2) Review privacy preferences: Regularly check your privacy and data-sharing settings to ensure they align with your comfort level.",
      "3) Limit research participation: Disable participation in research or product development initiatives if you\u2019re concerned about how your data might be used.",
      "4) Download and secure your data: Before considering account deletion, download your genetic record and store it securely on an encrypted device or cloud service.",
      "5) Request data deletion: If you no longer wish for your data to be stored by 23andMe, request its deletion through your account settings. Ensure you also ask for the destruction of any physical samples.",
      "6) Use strong passwords and multifactor authentication:\u00a0Creating unique, complex passwords for each of your accounts and devices is essential. Avoid reusing passwords across multiple accounts; this kind of password reuse was a factor in the recent\u00a023andMe data breach. Enable two-factor authentication wherever it\u2019s offered to add an extra layer of security that helps prevent unauthorized access even if your password is compromised.\u00a0Check out my best expert-reviewed password managers for 2025 here.",
      "7) Monitor for suspicious activity and use identity theft protection: Genetic data leaks can lead to identity theft or medical fraud. Consider signing up for an identity theft protection service that monitors personal information, such as your Social Security number, phone number and email, alerting you if this data is found on the dark web. Some identity theft services also include up to $1 million in identity theft insurance to cover losses and legal fees and a dedicated fraud resolution team with a U.S.-based case manager to help you recover any stolen assets or identity.\u00a0See my expert recommendations here: Best identity theft protection services for 2025 here.",

    "story": [
      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson urges you to use Apple\u2019s App Privacy Report to see what your apps are really up to.",
      "Do you remember Apple\u2019s\u00a0\"Privacy. That's iPhone\" marketing campaigns? If you\u2019re not aware, the company likes to portray its products as being synonymous with privacy. However, the recent wave of security vulnerabilities affecting iPhones and Macs suggest Apple\u2019s products may not be as secure as advertised.",
      "A recent security blunder only reinforces this point. Security researchers discovered that Apple\u2019s built-in password manager app, Passwords, was vulnerable to phishing attacks for nearly three months after launch. This meant an attacker on the same Wi-Fi network as you, like at an airport or coffee shop, could redirect your browser to a lookalike phishing site to steal your login credentials.",

      "Security researchers at\u00a0Mysk, noticed that Apple's Passwords app, introduced with iOS 18 in September 2024, had a significant security flaw that left users vulnerable to phishing attacks for nearly three months.",
      "The app used unencrypted HTTP connections instead of the more secure HTTPS to fetch logos and icons displayed alongside stored passwords. This allowed attackers on the same network, such as public Wi-Fi at a coffee shop or airport, to intercept these requests and potentially redirect users to phishing sites designed to steal login credentials.",
      "The issue remained unresolved from iOS 18\u2019s launch in September 2024 until Apple fixed it in December 2024, leaving users exposed for nearly three months. If someone opened the Passwords app and tapped a link, like \"Change Password,\" while connected to an insecure network, an attacker could intercept the request and redirect them to a fraudulent site mimicking a legitimate one, such as a fake Yelp login page. Since the app did not enforce HTTPS, users might not notice the switch, putting their sensitive information at risk.",

The iOS 18.2 update, released in December, patched the vulnerability by enforcing HTTPS for all network communications within the Passwords app, making it much harder for attackers to intercept or redirect traffic.",
      "If you\u2019re using an iPhone or iPad with the Passwords app, ensure your device is updated to iOS 18.2 or later. This ensures you\u2019re protected from this vulnerability. If you haven\u2019t updated yet and used the app on public Wi-Fi between September and December 2024, consider changing passwords for any accounts you accessed during that period, just to be safe.",

      "1) Use a reliable password manager:\u00a0Apple apps are generally more secure than third-party options, but the Passwords app clearly wasn\u2019t. The fact that the security vulnerability existed for three months before Apple fixed it proves that Apple needs to put more emphasis on keeping customer data secure. I\u2019d suggest opting for a reliable password manager instead of relying on Apple\u2019s offering. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "2) Enable two-factor authentication (2FA): It\u2019s good to have a password manager, but you know what\u2019s even better? 2FA.\u00a0Adding an extra layer of security with 2FA can prevent hackers from accessing your accounts, even if they steal your password. Use authentication apps like Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator or hardware security keys instead of SMS-based codes, which are vulnerable to SIM-swapping attacks.",
      "3) Avoid public Wi-Fi for sensitive activities and use a VPN:\u00a0Hackers can exploit unsecured public networks to intercept your login credentials. If you must access sensitive accounts on\u00a0public Wi-Fi, use a VPN to encrypt your internet traffic and prevent attackers from snooping on your data. VPNs will protect you from those who want to track and identify your potential location and the websites that you visit. A reliable VPN is essential for protecting your online privacy and ensuring a secure, high-speed connection.\u00a0For the best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "4) Beware of phishing attacks and install strong antivirus software:\u00a0You can have all the protection in the world but a phishing email or SMS can still cause havoc. Hackers often use fake login pages to trick you into entering your credentials. Always verify URLs before entering login details, avoid clicking on suspicious links in emails or messages. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "5) Keep your devices updated: Regularly\u00a0update your devices and software to ensure you have the latest security patches.",
      "6) Regularly monitor all your accounts:\u00a0Monitor your accounts for suspicious activity and report any unusual transactions or login attempts to Apple.",
      "APPLE RELEASES EMERGENCY SECURITY UPDATE FOR SERIOUS VULNERABILITY",
      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "Three months is a long time for a security flaw in a password manager to go unpatched, especially from a company that presents itself as a leader in privacy and security. This incident highlights a troubling reality. Apple\u2019s security measures are not infallible, and even built-in system apps can expose users to serious risks. While the fix eventually arrived, it should not have taken this long for such a fundamental issue to be addressed. If Apple wants to maintain its privacy-first image, it needs to do better by ensuring more rigorous security testing before launch.",

      "Most of us have at least one young woman in our lives that we cherish \u2014 a daughter, niece or goddaughter, for example. Well, this International Women\u2019s Day, I learned something that should be concerning to us all. Fully\u00a096% of all deepfakes \u2014 artificial intelligence-generated images and videos that use someone\u2019s likeness \u2014 are pornographic and target women without their consent.",
      "One well-known case involved an Australian law student who discovered that manipulated pornographic images of her were being shared online when she was just 18. But this isn\u2019t an isolated incident. According to a\u00a0recent survey of women in the U.S., AI deepfakes are among the types of online abuse that a significant number of women face despite being a relatively new technology.",
      "But this isn\u2019t the only type of online abuse women face.",
      "According to the same survey, one in four women in the U.S. say they\u2019ve experienced online abuse, including cyberbullying, doxxing, sexual harassment, trolling and AI deepfakes. And young women between the ages of 18 and 34 appear to experience much higher rates of online abuse than older generations.",

      "Why are younger women at higher risk?",
      "It probably has a lot to do with how much time younger people spend online.\u00a0Research shows, to no one\u2019s surprise, that younger generations use social media twice as much as older generations (80% versus 42%, respectively). However, it also indicates that women use it more than men.",
      "Data privacy also plays a role. A recent study showed younger generations are generally less concerned about keeping their personal information private compared to older generations. Growing up in a digital-first world, many younger people appear to be desensitized to data collection and are more willing to share personal information online. That, in turn, puts them at higher risk of cybercrimes and abuse.",

    "story": [
      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth attempts to set the record straight on the Atlantic article.",
      "European leaders were notably silent on Tuesday following the text exchange between Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and Vice President JD Vance, who noted their \"loathing\" of their long-standing allies.",
      "\"I fully share your loathing of European free-loading. It's PATHETIC,\" Hegseth said in response to Vance, who questioned U.S. leadership in advancing security policies in the Red Sea to counter Houthi aggression and reopen shipping lanes.",
      "Vance broke from President Donald Trump, who directed the U.S. to ramp up strikes against the Houthi terrorist group in Yemen which, backed by Iran, began escalating attacks on merchant ships along the major trade route following the Oct. 7, 2023 Hamas attacks on Israel.",
      "\"President Donald Trump is taking action against the Houthis to defend U.S. shipping assets and deter terrorist threats,\" the White House posted on X on March 15, 2025. (The White House)",
      "US-UK COALITION STRIKE IRAN-BACKED HOUTHI TARGETS IN YEMEN AFTER SPATE OF SHIP ATTACKS IN RED SEA",
      "Following the offensive push earlier this month, Vance, in a Signal group chat, texted the U.S.\u2019s top security officials, including Hegseth, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, National Security Advisor Mike Waltz and CIA Director John Ratcliff, among others, that only \"3 percent of U.S. trade runs through the [Suez Canal]. 40 percent of European trade does.\"",
      "\"There is a real risk that the public doesn't understand this,\" he added in reference to the route that connects the Mediterranean Sea to the Red Sea, and which is vital in connecting shipping from Europe, the Middle East and Asia. \"I am not sure the president is aware how inconsistent this is with his message on Europe right now.\"",
      "\"If you think we should do it let's go. I just hate bailing Europe out again,\" he added.",

      "However, despite the degrading comments regarding the U.S. top allies, European leaders were noticeably tight-lipped in their response when Fox News Digital reached out for comment, and public statements were nearly non-existent.",
      "The lack of public retort could suggest Europe is biting its tongue while it evaluates how to maintain a relationship with an administration that routinely argues against the value of its long-standing European allies.",
      "\"Reality is that there is certainly an element of European freeloading on relying on America as the one country that has the capability to really take on the Houthis in a major way and drive them out,\" Alan Mendoza, executive director of the Henry Jackson Society, an international affairs think tank based in London told Fox News Digital. \"The Houthis are a desert dwelling ragtag bunch of terrorists, and most European countries do not have the capabilities to deal with that sort of situation.",
      "President Donald Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth participate in a meeting in the Oval Office of the White House on Feb 7, 2025. (Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)",

      "TRUMP MEETS FRANCE'S MACRON AT WHITE HOUSE, SAYS 'LOT OF PROGRESS' MADE TOWARD ENDING WAR IN UKRAINE",
      "Ultimately, Mendoza argued, there would be an \"element of hypocrisy\" if Europe were to try and push back on the comment.",
      "\"So I think a lot of Europeans, while not liking the way this conversation has unfolded\u2026can't actually dispute the substance, even if we don't like the methodology for this conversation,\" he added. \"And therefore, it is probably better to say little about it than to risk this sort of bigger argument about burden sharing, once again, coming to the fore.\"",
      "In the Signal text exchange, the administration officials said that \"further economic gain\" would need to be \"extracted in return\" for the U.S. taking the operational lead \u2013 which some British lawmakers took issue with, noting the Trump administration\u2019s renewed attempt to \"extort\" money from its allies.",
      "Additionally, the leader of the U.K.'s Liberal-Democrats, typically a more centrist party to Prime Minister Keir Starmer\u2019s Labour Party, took to X to say the text exchange showed, \"JD Vance and his mates clearly aren\u2019t fit to run a group chat, let alone the world\u2019s strongest military force. It has to make our security services nervous about the intelligence we\u2019re sharing with them.\"",
      "Though the official responses from nations looking to make inroads with Trump, like the U.K. and France, maintained they will continue to pursue \"cooperation\" with Washington.",
      "The U.K. \u2013 whose navy and air force have been heavily involved in countering Houthi aggression in the Red Sea alongside the U.S. \u2013 told Fox News Digital, \"The U.S. is our primary ally, and we cooperate more closely than any other two nations on defense, intelligence, and security.\"",

      "The Justice Department has submitted multiple filings with the Supreme Court that accuse federal judges of abusing their constitutional powers, while lower courts criticized the Trump administration\u2019s expansive view of presidential power.",
      "The administration asked the high court to intervene in three cases it argues are hampering President Donald Trump\u2019s agenda, including one where it\u2019s been ordered to rehire thousands of dismissed federal workers.",
      "The latest filing, on Friday, focuses on the administration's complaints about a judge who temporarily halted deportations under Trump\u2019s invocation of the Alien Enemies Act, a rarely used 18th-century wartime law. Attorneys argued that the judge overstepped his authority, and complained about the overall number of temporary restraining orders imposed by federal judges as a result of legal challenges to Trump\u2019s sweeping agenda.",
      "The third case where the administration sought Supreme Court intervention involves millions of dollars in education grants that were abruptly canceled by Trump officials. After a federal judge in Massachusetts ordered the Education Department to temporarily make the payments while the plaintiffs\u2019 lawsuit proceeds, the administration petitioned the Supreme Court in a filing that argued the justices should \u201cput a swift end to federal district courts\u2019 unconstitutional reign as self-appointed managers of Executive Branch funding and grant-disbursement decisions.\u201d",
      "Trump setbacks extend to appeals courts",
      "After numerous rulings against the Trump administration at the district court level, the Justice Department hasn\u2019t had much success with the appeals courts either.",
      "The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for D.C. rejected Trump\u2019s assertion that judges don\u2019t have the power to review his use of the 1798 Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan immigrants whom officials allege are members of a gang. The three-judge panel ruled that a judge\u2019s ban temporarily barring such deportations could remain in place.",
      "At a hearing in the case on Monday, one of the appeals court judges, Patricia Millett, also raised due process concerns, noting that the administration hadn\u2019t allowed deportees to challenge accusations that they\u2019re affiliated with the gang before being shipped off to a prison in El Salvador.",
      "\u201cNazis got better treatment under the Alien Enemy Act\u201d the last time it was invoked, which was during World War II, Millett said.",
      "At the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Wednesday, judges declined to block a preliminary injunction ordering thousands of fired probationary workers to be reinstated.",
      "Both rulings were 2-1 decisions, and the dissenting judge in each case was a Trump appointee from his first term.",
      "Meanwhile, the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals denied the administration\u2019s bid to block a court order halting a partial federal funding freeze it had tried to implement. The ruling was unanimous, 3-0. The administration had sought to block a preliminary injunction barring the freeze from going into effect during the appeals process.",
      "The week did end with a win for the administration. The D.C. appeals court temporarily paused two lower court rulings that had reinstated Cathy Harris to the Merit Systems Protection Board and Gwynne Wilcox to the National Labor Relations Board. Trump had directed that both should be fired.",
      "Transgender military ban blocked \u2014 twice",
      "Federal judges in two different states issued rulings preventing the Defense Department from implementing new guidance that would effectively bar transgender service members from serving in the military.",
      "In a stinging ruling, U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes denied the administration\u2019s request to vacate her earlier preliminary injunction. It contended that guidance from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth barred people with \u201cgender dysphoria \u2014 a medical condition \u2014 and does not discriminate against trans-identifying persons as a class.\u201d",
      "The judge said she didn\u2019t buy that argument.",
      "\u201cDefendants cannot evade discriminating against transgender people simply by labeling the policy as addressing gender dysphoria,\u201d she wrote.",
      "\u201cA medical condition has not given its country decades of military service. Or deployed into combat zones throughout the globe. Or earned countless commendations. People have. A medical condition has not fought terrorism. Or analyzed intelligence. Or commanded platoons. People have. A medical condition has not been accused of lacking warrior ethos. Or been branded dishonorable, dishonest, and undisciplined. Or been threatened with the loss of livelihood. People have,\u201d she writes. \u201cTransgender people.\u201d",
      "Reyes\u2019 sentiments were echoed in a preliminary injunction issued in Washington state in another case brought on behalf of transgender service members who are facing the possibility of being discharged.",
      "The newly issued \u201cHegseth Policy scrupulously avoids using the word \u2018transgender\u2019 \u2014 the word does not appear in the Hegseth Policy. But common sense and binding authority defeat the government\u2019s claim that it does not discriminate against transgender people,\u201d U.S. District Judge Benjamin Settle wrote.",
      "The administration is appealing both decisions.",
      "Signal chat debacle enters the courts",
      "U.S. District Judge James Boasberg, who has been presiding over the Alien Enemies Act case, heard arguments in another hot-button case this week: the administration\u2019s use of the messaging app Signal to discuss the details of a U.S. military strike in Yemen before it occurred. The group chat came to light when the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic was accidentally included in the chat, which appeared to include Hegseth, Vice President JD Vance, national security adviser Mike Waltz, CIA Director John Ratcliffe, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.",
      "Boasberg issued an order directing the federal agencies involved in the chat to \u201cpreserve all Signal communications between March 11 and March 15,\u201d around the time of the strike.",
      "The order came in response to a lawsuit filed by the watchdog group American Oversight, which said it\u2019s seeking to ensure the communications are preserved in compliance with the Federal Records Act.",
      "The Treasury Department said it already located some of the messages, and the Defense Department indicated it was already working on complying.",
      "The judge directed the administration to file a status report by Monday."

      "A federal judge in Massachusetts on Friday blocked the government from deporting a Tufts University graduate student who was arrested this week by immigration officers and had her visa revoked.",
      "Rumeysa Ozturk's deportation has been blocked while U.S. District Judge Denise Casper determines whether she has jurisdiction over the case, according to the order.",
      "\"This is a first step in getting Rumeysa released and back home to Boston so she can continue her studies,\" Ozturk's attorney, Mahsa Khanbabai, said in a statement Friday. \"But we never should have gotten here in the first place: Rumeysa\u2019s experience is shocking, cruel, and unconstitutional.\"",
      "Khanbabai filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in Massachusetts federal court Tuesday to release Ozturk.",
      "Ozturk, a 30-year-old Turkish national with a valid F-1 student visa as a doctoral student at the Massachusetts school, was on her way to meet friends for iftar, a meal that breaks the day-time fast observed by Muslims during Ramadan, when she was detained on Tuesday evening, Khanbabai said in a statement Thursday.",
      "Khanbabai alleged in the statement that federal officers are intentionally targeting Muslim students during the holy month of Ramadan.",
      "\u201cThis appears to be a pattern \u2014 ICE stalking Muslim students as they are heading to or from iftar to break their fast,\u201d Khanbabai said. She  added that Ozturk was being unlawfully targeted because she co-authored a March 2024 op-ed article about Palestine.",
      "Khanbabai said the video of her client's arrest \u2014 which was published and seen around the world on Wednesday \u2014 shows the moment Department of Homeland Security agents \"grabbed at her clothes, her hands, and her backpack before detaining her and taking her to an unknown location, in an unmarked car.\"",
      "\u201cNothing in this video indicates that these are law enforcement agents and from which agency. This video should shake everyone to their core,\" she added. \"We should all be horrified at the way DHS spirited away Rumeysa in broad daylight.\"",
      "Khanbabai also said that Ozturk was sent to an ICE processing center in Louisiana \u2014 just like high-profile Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil, who remains there \u2014 \"despite a federal court order that she not be removed from Massachusetts.\"",
      "Khanbabai said Friday that she was unable to locate her client for \u201cnearly 24 hours\u201d even though a court order was in place preventing the government from moving Ozturk out of Massachusetts. She said they later learned the government had moved Ozturk to Louisiana.",
      "Jessie Rossman, a legal director at the ACLU-Massachusetts called the decision halting Ozturk's deportation a \u201ccritical next step\u201d to ensure she is returned to her home.",
      "According to her LinkedIn profile, Ozturk is a PhD student in child study and human development and a Fulbright scholar. She also holds a master\u2019s degree from Teachers College at Columbia University.",
      "Since her arrest, a group of lawmakers has been calling for Ozturk's immediate release. These include 10 senators and 18 House members, who released a joint letter Friday morning.",
      "The letter, sent to Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and ICE Acting Director Todd Lyons, asked why Ozturk and many others have been targeted.",
      "\"We are calling for full due process in this case and are seeking answers about this case and about ICE\u2019s policy that has led to the identification and arrest of university students with valid legal status,\" the letter said.",
      "Referring to a string of similar incidents in recent weeks \u2014 some 300 visas have been revoked including that of many students linked to political activism \u2014 the lawmakers said: \"These are deeply troubling incidents. The Administration should not summarily detain and deport legal residents of this country merely for expressing their political views.\"",
      "The letter asks Noem and ICE a series of questions, including why Ozturk was arrested and under what authority her visa was revoked.",
      "\"DHS and ICE investigations found Ozturk engaged in activities in support of Hamas, a foreign terrorist organization that relishes the killing of Americans,\" a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said in a statement to NBC News.",
      "The statement continued: \"A visa is a privilege not a right.\u00a0Glorifying and supporting terrorists who kill Americans is grounds for visa issuance to be terminated.\u00a0This is commonsense security.\"",
      "CORRECTION (March 28, 2025, 9:10 p.m. ET): A previous version of this article used incorrect pronouns for Mahsa Khanbabai. They are she and her, not he and him."

    "published": "Fri, 28 Mar 2025 13:31:45 GMT",
    "summary": "Duke's star freshman Cooper Flagg has been the consensus top pick in the upcoming NBA Draft since before the season started.",
    "story": [
      "Duke's star freshman Cooper Flagg has been the consensus top pick in the upcoming NBA Draft since before the season started. During the NCAA men\u2019s basketball tournament this month, the 6-foot-9 wing from Maine\u00a0has done nothing to tamp down the sky-high expectations.",
      "In the NBA, \u201che may be your third-best scorer, yet your most valuable player in the sense of everything he does,\u201d said a college scout for an NBA team, who asked not to be identified because his team, like every other in the league, does not allow scouts to comment publicly on prospects.",
      "After scoring 14 points in Duke\u2019s opening victory of the tournament, and 18 in the second round, Flagg produced such a bravura 30-point performance Thursday in Newark, New Jersey, that it pushed the top-seeded Blue Devils past Arizona and left his coach talking in superlatives.",
      "Flagg appeared comfortably in command during the high-stakes, single-elimination tournament while adding a season-high seven assists, plus six rebounds and three blocks.",
      "\u201cThat was one of the best tournament performances I\u2019ve ever coached or been a part of,\u201d Duke coach Jon Scheyer, who notably played on a Blue Devils team in 2010 that won the NCAA championship, said during his postgame news conference.",
      "Arizona forward Henri Veesaar said: \u201cHe\u2019s a freak athlete.\u201d",
      "Halfway through the tournament, Flagg has averaged 20.7 points, 7.3 rebounds and 6.0 assists, shooting 47% from the field while turning the ball over just four times in 88 minutes. Given the ankle injury Flagg suffered less than a week before the tournament began hasn\u2019t stopped him, the next, logical question is whether anything, or anybody, will be able to.",
      "\u201cThe biggest thing that stands out is he can impact the game without scoring,\u201d the scout said. \u201cThat\u2019s not his main thing. It\u2019s the defense, playmaking. Without dominating the ball and without scoring he has a huge impact on the game.\u201d",
      "Flagg\u2019s tournament performances have confirmed the potential that NBA evaluators have expected to see since July 2024, when Flagg arrived in Las Vegas to play with a select group of the best young U.S. basketball players.",
      "This wasn\u2019t your typical offseason pickup game, because their opponent was USA Basketball\u2019s senior men\u2019s team as it practiced ahead of the Paris Olympics.",
      "In front of a private practice watched by a crowd of a few hundred agents, coaches, and team and league executives, Flagg, who was only 17 at the time, held his own. He swished a pull-up 3-pointer in front of NBA All-Star Anthony Davis and soared past another top defender, Bam Adebayo, for a put-back basket.",
      "\u201cHell of a player,\u201d future Hall of Fame star Kevin Durant said during a\u00a0news conference\u00a0after the scrimmage. \u201cSeventeen years old, coming in here and playing like he\u2019s a vet almost.\u201d",
      "The NBA has attempted to disincentivize teams from intentionally weakening themselves, and thus the league\u2019s product. Until 2018, the team with the worst record was awarded a 25% chance of landing the No. 1 draft pick. Since 2019, however, the league has flattened the top-pick odds, awarding the three worst teams the same 14% chance. Atlanta won the No. 1 pick last year despite ending the 2024 season with a 3% chance of doing so.",
      "That hasn\u2019t kept teams from flailing for Flagg, the ACC\u2019s player of the year and a candidate for national player of the year. Not since Carmelo Anthony led Syracuse to the 2003 NCAA championship in his lone college season has a freshman acted as the engine of a national title contender to this degree.\u00a0After shooting 32% on 3-pointers through his first 20 games, he has shot 41% in his last 14, showing the ability to stretch the floor that NBA teams covet.\u00a0Over the same 14-game span since Feb. 1, Flagg has produced more steals (20) and blocks (19) than turnovers (18).",
      "\u201cHis shooting has gotten so much better,\u201d Arizona coach Tommy Lloyd said in his postgame news conference Thursday. \u201cHe makes 3 of 5 from three today, 9 of 10 from the free-throw line. And just his ability to playmake.\u201d",
      "The combination has led fans to salivate about what Flagg might do next. By early April, Duke could stand as college basketball\u2019s champion. By June\u2019s NBA Draft, the league\u2019s biggest losers in the standings hope it will be their turn to celebrate."

    "summary": "Dave Portnoy, a Trump supporter and the founder of Barstool Sports, went viral for his blistering critique of the administration\u2019s group chat debacle",
    "story": [
      "One of the most viral responses to the Trump administration\u2019s Signal chat debacle this week came not from a lawmaker or military expert, but from a man who rates pizza slices after taking a single bite.",
      "\u201cWe are lucky it didn\u2019t cause the death of American military members,\u201d Dave Portnoy, the founder of Barstool Sports, said Wednesday in a video on X in which he called for the firing of national security adviser Michael Waltz. \u201cSomebody has to go down for this.\u201d",
      "Portnoy interviewed President Donald Trump ahead of the 2020 election and publicly supported him in last year\u2019s campaign. Portnoy\u2019s irreverent persona and knack for connecting with sports fans, gamblers and other \u201cbros\u201d allowed him to serve as a conduit for Trump\u2019s message to reach a key segment of the electorate he was laser-focused on.",
      "But Portnoy\u2019s six-minute, direct-to-camera video on X eviscerated Trump officials for inadvertently adding a prominent journalist, The Atlantic\u2019s Jeffrey Goldberg, to a Signal app group chat in which they discussed plans to attack Houthi rebels in Yemen in the hours before launching strikes on March 16.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s surreal that these guys added Jeffrey Goldberg to this group,\u201d Portnoy said, adding: \u201cAnd if this information somehow got out to the Houthis, and I assume in situations like this, things move at the speed of light, lots of American soldiers could have died, lives in jeopardy. So to me, a major, major, major glitch in intelligence and just a huge mistake.\u201d",
      "The video, which had been viewed more than 11.5 million times as of Friday afternoon, according to the social media site\u2019s analytics, spread as widely as it did not only because of the content of Portnoy\u2019s message, but also because of the platform and audience he wields.",
      "Portnoy, who did not respond to a request for comment, is the dominant figure on one of the leading media and podcasting platforms favored by young men who have drifted rightward in recent years \u2014 an demographic that Trump and then-Vice President Kamala Harris fought for in the closing weeks of the 2024 election.",
      "Leaders in both parties are watching this demographic closely ahead of the next election as they present new policy positions aimed at young men or are increasing engagement with the mostly apolitical podcasts they consume.",
      "Given Portnoy\u2019s credibility with those voters, Democrats were quick to promote his commentary while the White House declined to hit him back when given the chance.",
      "\u201cDave is right on this,\u201d former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, a potential 2028 Democratic presidential contender, posted on X. \u201cIt\u2019s not a left or right thing. This was a massive screwup and a real security failure. So why is the President, who used to fire people for fun on reality TV, not firing the people who made this mess?\u201d",
      "\u201cYeah, mistakes happen; this one can\u2019t,\u201d Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., posted to the platform. \u201cDave Portnoy knows you can\u2019t share classified war plans in a Signal chat \u2014 yet somehow, the Trump administration\u2019s top national security leaders don\u2019t.\u201d",
      "Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., told NBC News in a message that Portnoy was \u201c100% right.\u201d",
      "And he \u201chas credibility because he\u2019s a calls-it-like-he-sees-it guy,\u201d Swalwell, who similarly shared Portnoy\u2019s post, added. \u201cThe case he made for firing these morons is the simplest but most pulverizing case I\u2019ve heard yet. I think it\u2019s a clear message of we are not all gaslightable.\u201d",
      "That Democrats would be promoting any commentary from Portnoy might be surprising. Left-leaning critics have called him sexist and misogynist, and he has denied sexual misconduct allegations against him.",
      "After Trump won in November, Portnoy said he believed \u201cDemocrats gave us no choice\u201d and that their campaign was centered on \u201cpure arrogance\u201d and \u201cmoral superiority.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s performance with young men offered him a huge boost in several swing states as the campaign focused heavily on targeting low-propensity voters, the kind of less politically active voters who might be warm to Trump\u2019s cultural arguments and consume Barstool content.",
      "\u201cAnother moment of clarity from El Pres,\u201d Tim Miller, a former spokesperson for 2016 GOP presidential candidate Jeb Bush who has since become a leading figure at the anti-Trump publication The Bulwark, wrote on X. \u201cBy the way these barstool \u2018bros\u2019 are gettable for Dems if they don\u2019t continue to perpetuate the impression that they hate them. worth a try!\u201d",
      "An NBC News poll this month found that 53% of men between 18 and 49 view Trump favorably, an increase from the 47% who said so in NBC News\u2019 November survey.",
      "\u201cI certainly don\u2019t agree with some of the things he has said on various issues, or his approach or tact sometimes, but Dave has a very commonsense, straightforward way of looking at things that doesn\u2019t fit into a partisan box and that many people share,\u201d Chris Meagher, a former White House and Pentagon spokesperson during President Joe Biden\u2019s administration, said. \u201cOur national security and the safety of our troops should be a nonpartisan issue and more people from both political parties, and people from no party at all, should be speaking out about it.\u201d",
      "Portnoy\u2019s commentary was notable enough that a reporter asked White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt about it during Wednesday\u2019s press briefing. She said she has \u201cgreat respect\u201d for the media personality and businessman before deferring to a previous answer she gave on the administration\u2019s handling of the Signal chat fallout.",
      "\u201cNo concerns!\u201d Leavitt told NBC News on Thursday when asked if the White House was worried by Portnoy\u2019s pushback. She added that she was unaware of anyone at the White House contacting Portnoy either in recent weeks or following his criticism.",
      "One Trump ally, meanwhile, talked up the importance of Portnoy\u2019s remarks.",
      "\u201cOh, I think it matters a lot,\u201d this person said, pointing to Portnoy\u2019s audience and platform. \u201cNot to Trump, but to his staff and people around him.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s also in no small part because of how Portnoy\u2019s own brand of populism, and that of Barstool, has been credited with helping reorient the GOP away from the \u201cMoral Majority\u201d of the Reagan era and into the more new-age conservative movement that Trump has fostered. The National Review, New York Times, Politico and other publications have all written extensively on what has been broadly described as \u201cBarstool conservatism.\u201d",
      "Adding to the intrigue, Portnoy\u2019s comments on Wednesday were not the first critical remarks he\u2019s made of Trump\u2019s administration, while other content creators on his platform have similarly taken issue with elements of Trump\u2019s agenda.",
      "During an appearance on Fox Business last month, Portnoy criticized billionaire executive Elon Musk, who is overseeing Trump\u2019s reorganization of the federal government and heads Tesla, X and SpaceX, as Tesla\u2019s stock slid.",
      "\u201cSo I\u2019m a big stockholder of Tesla and I certainly raise my eyebrows,\u201d Portnoy said. \u201cI like DOGE. I like what they\u2019re doing. But let me tell you this. If you\u2019re going to send out \u2014 and you got to call it both ways \u2014 if you\u2019re going to send emails to federal workers and say, \u2018What have you done for the last five days?\u2019 I think Tesla shareholders are entitled to ask their CEO, Elon Musk, \u2018What have you done for Tesla the last five days?\u2019 I mean, it\u2019s seemingly all he cares about right now is DOGE.\u201d",
      "In that interview, Portnoy said he was offered a job in Trump\u2019s Commerce Department but would have had to hand over the reins at Barstool Sports if he accepted. The Commerce Department did not respond to a request for comment seeking clarity on the job offer Portnoy mentioned.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m a very simple man,\u201d Portnoy said in the Fox Business interview. \u201cI like a lot of things. I like when my stocks are going up and my wallet\u2019s getting fatter. Right now it\u2019s going the reverse way. So you start raising an eye. But overall, I\u2019m happy. \u2026 [Trump is] doing exactly what he said he was going to do.\u201d",
      "Speaking Thursday on Barstool\u2019s \u201cUnnamed\u201d podcast, Portnoy said his father messaged him to say Portnoy \u201cgained a lot of credibility\u201d with his take on the Signal chat fallout. He was later confronted with Leavitt\u2019s comment from Wednesday\u2019s press briefing.",
      "\u201cGreat respect,\u201d Portnoy said. \u201cYou know they like me when they won\u2019t trash me.\u201d"

      "\u2014 Adam Wollner",
      "Inside Trump's shock decision to pull the plug on Elise Stefanik's nomination",
      "At a White House event honoring Women\u2019s History Month on Wednesday afternoon, President Donald Trump took six minutes out of his speech to personally recognize many of the Republican women who were gathered in the audience.",
      "But one person in attendance that he did not mention was Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., who was, at the time, Trump\u2019s nominee to be the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.",
      "The omission, which several GOP lawmakers took notice of at the time, was all the more conspicuous given that Stefanik\u2019s name was included on the list of women in Trump\u2019s prepared remarks, according to a White House official.",
      "While it\u2019s unclear whether Trump purposely chose to skip Stefanik\u2019s name, less than 24 hours later, the president delivered another public blow to the congresswoman. He announced that he was withdrawing Stefanik\u2019s nomination for the ambassadorship, citing concerns over Republicans\u2019 razor-thin House majority and the prospect of a special election to fill her seat.",
      "The sudden implosion of Stefanik\u2019s nomination came as a surprise to many Republicans on Capitol Hill, especially given that she sailed out of the committee process earlier this year and would have likely garnered bipartisan support on the Senate floor. Plus, the trickiness of the House GOP\u2019s narrow margins is hardly a new dynamic, with Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., warning Trump almost immediately after the November election against plucking members from the House for the new administration.",
      "But over the last few months, there had been growing anxiety inside the GOP and the White House about the difficulties of governing as they try to pass Trump\u2019s sweeping domestic policy agenda \u2014 a sentiment that was only further compounded by a special House election next week in Florida.",
      "Trump and Stefanik have spoken multiple times since the announcement, according to a Republican source familiar with the conversations, and the president heaped praise on her from the Oval Office Friday.",

      "Thanks to everyone who emailed us this week! One reader wrote in to ask about the early voting numbers in Florida ahead of next week\u2019s special House elections. (As Bridget Bowman reported, Republicans are nervous about early turnout among Democrats in two solidly red districts.)",
      "\u201cHow usual is it to have election authorities to release reports of parties\u2019 early returns? And is it meaningful, as in, predictive?\u201d",
      "To answer that, we turned to senior politics editor Scott Bland. Here\u2019s his response:",
      "Data on who votes is public record, and keeping track of early turnout by party (in states where voters register with a party) has become a big part of campaigns in recent years. Campaigns and outside groups use this data to make sure, among other things, that they\u2019re targeting their appeals to people who haven\u2019t already voted.",
      "So the release of this data is very normal. (In fact, NBC News had a tracker in 2024 looking at the early vote before the general election.) The key question is how predictive this data can be, and the unsatisfying answer is that it\u2019s very hard to glean predictive insights from early vote data. Currently, Republicans and Republican-leaning voters tend to turn out more heavily on Election Day, while Democrats and Democratic leaning voters tend to turn out more heavily in early voting. But since we can never know exactly how many people will turn out on Election Day before it happens, it\u2019s hard to know what early turnout means ahead of time.",

      "Elon Musk said Friday that his artificial intelligence startup, xAI, had acquired his social media platform, X.",
      "He said that the deal was an all-stock transaction that valued X at $33 billion.",
      "\"xAI and X\u2019s futures are intertwined. Today, we officially take the step to combine the data, models, compute, distribution and talent,\" Musk wrote in a post on X.",
      "The deal combines two of Musk's most high-profile companies, but because they are not publicly traded, no details about the deal were made public outside of Musk's post. It's unclear if the deal included any immediate windfall for Musk.",
      "X recently raised $1 billion from investors, valuing it at $44 billion, according to Bloomberg. Musk took X (then Twitter) private in 2022 at nearly the same valuation.\u00a0Musk was recently served with an SEC summons in the long-running lawsuit over Musk's alleged failure to disclose his ownership in Twitter before bidding to buy it entirely.",
      "Linda Yaccarino, the CEO of X, reposted Musk's message adding: \"The future could not be brighter.\"",
      "Musk launched xAI in 2023 and rolled out Grok, an AI-powered chatbot similar to those from OpenAI, Google, Microsoft and many other AI companies. Since then, Grok has been infused into X, with many users now often asking it to respond to posts and weigh in on arguments.",
      "Musk has billed Grok as an anti-\"woke\" AI that is \"truth-seeking,\" though it has been found to disagree with him on many issues.",
      "\"This combination will unlock immense potential by blending xAI\u2019s advanced AI capability and expertise with X\u2019s massive reach,\" Must wrote. \"The combined company will deliver smarter, more meaningful experiences to billions of people while staying true to our core mission of seeking truth and advancing knowledge. This will allow us to build a platform that doesn\u2019t just reflect the world but actively accelerates human progress.\"",
      "Amid the broader boom in AI companies, Musk's xAI has found interest from investors. Major Wall Street firms Blackrock, Fidelity, Morgan Stanley, Sequoia Capital, and the top chip companies Nvidia and AMD invested in xAI in December. That funding took the AI company\u2019s value to $45 billion. As recently as last month, reports said xAI was considering another fundraising round that would value the company at $75 billion.",
      "The rush to develop \u2014 and invest in \u2014 advanced AI has included billions of dollars in plans to build out the computing power, electricity infrastructure and human capital necessary to develop increasingly powerful models capable of performing complex tasks. Money has poured into AI startups while tech giants including Google, Amazon and Meta have announced plans for significant spending on all things AI.",
      "Meanwhile, both AI and Musk have grown more political. Musk has emerged as among the most high-profile of President Donald Trump's advisers, and Trump made AI a campaign issue, promising to rein in regulation. Just days into his second term, Trump signed an executive order aimed at undoing Biden administration efforts to put some safeguards on AI development while encouraging its growth.",
      "Many AI and tech executives as well as technologists and industry watchdogs have warned about the implications of an all-out AI arms race, particularly as other countries including China are pushing to lead on the technology."

For the person who is searching and searching and has not found it yet. This room is full of people who can and will, if they choose, and I hope they will, because I do, to be lanterns to light up your journey and your path on your way to showing the world who you are.",

We are all visible. We can be seen. We see each other. I see you, you see me.

I ask every single one of you in this room, with the spaces that you\u2019re in, and the lights that you hold, to point it in the direction of someone who just needs a little guidance.",

    "summary": "Ariana Grande appears as an older version of herself in her new short film \"Brighter Days Ahead.\"",
    "story": [
      "Ariana Grande looks great for an elderly woman!",
      "And if you're wondering how we can possibly know that \u2014 Grande is actually only 31 \u2014 just check out her new 26-minute science fiction short film/music video, \"Brighter Days Ahead.\"",
      "In the video, an elderly-appearing Grande is wheeled into a futuristic facility where she's allowed to view four stored memories for the last and final time. If that premise sounds a little like the 2004 film \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,\" you're spot-on. She's playing Peaches again, a character she originally portrayed in last year's \"We Can't Be Friends (Wait for Your Love),\" only this is a much older version.",
      "The \"Spotless\" connection is a natural; \"Brighter Days\" is a companion piece of art connected to her \"Eternal Sunshine Deluxe: Brighter Days Ahead\" album, which came out in March. The short film is directed by Grande and Christian Breslauer (who also directed videos for \"We Can't Be Friends\" and \"The Boy Is Mine,\" which also released in 2024, as Rolling Stone reports).",
      "In the video, memories are released like clear lottery balls down a ramp.  Viewers then see everything from old family home movies (it's hard to determine how much, if any, of them are actually Grande's real-life home movies) to a modern day Grande singing \"Eternal Sunshine.\" She also gives young-Grande takes on recent songs \"Dandelion,\" \"Twilight Zone,\" \"Supernatural,\" and \"Hampstead,\" all of which tell different pieces of her history.",
      "The description in the YouTube video notes that it's been 70 years since Peaches was last seen (in her previous video), and she's returned to Brighter Days for her memory visit.",
      "\"As Peaches embarks on this immersive journey, we watch her confront and heal certain wounds (personal and professional alike) that have made her who she is today,\" the description reads.",
      "\"She reconnects with her younger self who had been patiently in the wings for over a decade, as she works her way through the challenges of fame (she is the daughter of the very famous Brighter Days Inc. founder/doctor), personal sensationalism (resulting in being torn apart by stray cats), and generational trauma,\" the description continues. \"In the end, with the help of her loved ones and art, she is able to come home to herself. She would do anything to experience it all again. However, there\u2019s one catch: once a memory is relived, it is erased forever.\"",
      "And stay tuned until after the fourth memory is destroyed in the short film for a delightful last comment.",
      "But why riff so hard on the Jim Carrey/Kate Winslet movie? As Grande told Apple Music in a 2024 interview, the mix of romance and memory was extremely powerful for her.",
      "\"I think the movie is so beloved because so many people can relate to knowing that something isn't right, but loving so much, and wanting to stay, and wanting to figure it out, and that cycle that can happen in the film,\" she said. \"I think that's why the film is so beloved. It's because so many people can relate to it, and I think it kind of fell into place that these songs had little tidbits of that theme. I just felt really inspired by it.\"",
      "Grande is on quite a roll, thanks in part not just to the \u201cEternal Sunshine\u201d release (and the \u201cDeluxe\u201d addition), but she was also nominated for an Academy Award in early 2025 for her work in \u201cWicked.\u201d"

      "\"Draco Malfoy and the Mortifying Ordeal of Being In Love\" has become a staple \"Harry Potter\" fan fiction recommendation after consistently going viral on TikTok in the last few years.",
      "And its author, Brigitte Knightley, had no idea \u2014 at first.",
      "Knightley started posting the eventual 199,000-word story in October 2021 under the username \"isthisselfcare.\" The final chapter was published in April 2022. After, she wrote a goodbye message to readers and signed out.",
      "A few months later, Knightley logged into her email linked to her account on Archive of Our Own, a fan fiction website.",
      "\"I had like thousands of emails,\" Knightley tells TODAY.com. \"I start looking through them, and there are literary agents writing me emails, and there are publishing houses writing me emails.\"",
      "She ended up signing with book agent Thao Le, who also represents Ali Hazelwood, another fan fiction to traditional publication success story. Knightley has been writing fan fiction for about 25 years, she says.",
      "\"I would be watching shows or media or something, and I'd be like, 'You know what? I don't think those two characters should have ended up together. And I think I could write something better, pairing them with someone else,'\" she says. \"It was this urge to sort of, maybe, 'fix' things, or explore things that the canon hadn't quite done for me.\"",
      "One example? The first \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" film. Knightley says it \"annoyed (her) to no end\" that heroine Elizabeth Swann ended up with Will Turner.",
      "\"She should have ended up with a pirate,\" Knightley says.",
      "For Knightley, the best romances have a bit of \"antagonism.\" So when she re-read the \"Harry Potter\" series over the winter of 2020, she saw the potential for the characters of Draco Malfoy, one of the main villains in the series, and Hermione Granger, Harry Potter's brave, know-it-all best friend, to have a \"quintessential enemies-to-lovers dynamic.\"",
      "\"Draco Malfoy and the Mortifying Ordeal of Being in Love\" was the first \"Harry Potter\" fan fiction she wrote. (Across fandoms, \"I think I've written about 2 million words of fan fic over the past 20 years,\" she notes.) The story strikes the tone of a romantic comedy and imagines Hermione as a valuable healer and Draco, her former nemesis from their time at Hogwarts, as an Auror (essentially a magical law enforcement official) assigned to protect her.",
      "When she finished the story, Knightley recalls feeling happy with it. But she was left with an \"itch,\" she says.",
      "\"That was an enemies-to-lovers story of two people who had a really rough history,\" she says. \"I wanted enemies to lovers that were like systemically enemies to lovers. I wanted them to hate each other just by virtue of what they were.\"",
      "The result is \"The Irresistible Urge to Fall in Love,\" which she describes not as an adaptation of her fan fiction but an original work that is \"Dramione-coded\" or has \"Dramione vibes.\"",
      "\u201cI wrote it because I came off a fan fic, and I was like, 'OK, I did that dynamic, but I'm looking for this other one.' And I didn\u2019t have, for once in my life, some sort of IP in mind,\u201d she says. \"So it really was written as an original work.\"",
      "\"The Irresistible Urge to Fall for Your Enemy\" is a slow burn romantic fantasy that follows an ailing assassin, Osric, who has to seek help from a healer named Aurienne, even though their respective orders \u2014\u00a0the Fyren and Haelan, respectively \u2014 are opposites in every way.",
      "The book, which comes out July 8, will kick off the \"Dearly Beloathed\" duology.",
      "The romance is a true slow burn \u2014\u00a0\"They think about killing each other like for the first 10 chapters,\" Knightley says \u2014\u00a0and is set in a version of 19th century England with a form of magic called seith.",
      "Fans of \"Draco Malfoy and the Mortifying Ordeal of Being in Love,\" never fear: Knightley's original fan fiction will stay up on Archive of Our Own.",
      "While having a markedly different plot, \"The Irresistible Urge to Fall For Your Enemy\" will hit all her signature \"beats,\" Knightley says.",
      "\"I always have these steps of like denial and yearning and will they/ won't they ... It's similar to all of my slow burns, not specifically 'Mortifying,'\" Knightley says.",
      "\"When I get to write a stupid idiot who's in denial about his feelings, I am so happy,\" she adds.",
      "Read an excerpt of \u2018The Irresistible Urge to Fall For Your Enemy\u2019",
      "In the following excerpt, Osric (a member of the Fyren Order of assassins) goes to meet Aurienne (a member of the Haelan Order of scholar-healers). She has \u2014 tersely \u2014 ordered him to join her at a clinic so she can assess his illness. He is furious to have been abruptly summoned, especially in daylight. She is aggravated to have to work with a morally bankrupt assassin. The\u00a0ensuing conversation goes as well as you\u2019d imagine... - Brigitte Knightley",
      "Osric, provoked, took the nearest waystone to the designated pub. First, he was at nobody\u2019s beck and call, least of all this priggish Haelan\u2019s. Second, it was broad daylight, and he hated operating in broad day- light. Third, between the name of the pub and the signs for a clinic for spotty bums that he was now following through this gods-forsaken little hamlet, he rather felt that she was taking the piss.",
      "The villagers puttering about gave Osric startled looks as he stalked through the hamlet\u2019s streets, his hood up, his greatcoat flaring behind him.",
      "What part of my condition mustn\u2019t be discovered hadn\u2019t this idiot understood?",
      "He found the final spotty-bum sign and knocked upon the clinic door.",
      "The idiot opened the door.",
      "Fairhrim\u2019s greeting consisted of a look. There was a lot in it; she looked at Osric as though he were a wart that had acquired sufficient sentience to knock on doors.",
      "\u201cAre you bloody serious?\u201d asked Osric.",
      "Fairhrim, taken aback by the wart\u2019s rudeness, straightened. \u201cExcuse me?\u201d",
      "\u201cSummoning me? In broad daylight? In a public place? I told you that my condition mustn\u2019t be discovered.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt hasn\u2019t been discovered,\u201d said Fairhrim. \u201cYou\u2019re hooded up like death personified. And anyone who did see you will think you\u2019re suffer- ing from folliculitis.\u201d",
      "Osric pointed at one of the overly detailed posters that had haunted his walk. \u201cYou had to choose arse acne?\u201d",
      "\u201cTo guarantee us privacy,\u201d said Fairhrim. She held the door open. \u201cGet in.\u201d",
      "Osric stepped into the tired little consultation room. The place was lit with new electric lights far too bright for his liking. There was an examination table against the wall. Miscellaneous medical parapherna- lia was scattered about, looking both curative and foreboding, rather like Fairhrim herself.",
      "Her travelling cloak was clasped shut with a silver wing. She re- moved it to reveal her stiff Haelan dress, high about the neck and impec- cably white, save for the sharp silver epaulettes.",
      "\u201cAlso,\u201d said Osric, removing his own cloak, \u201cI\u2019m not at your beck and call. Don\u2019t summon me like this again.\u201d",
      "Fairhrim grew rigid. She turned to him and spoke with a false sort of brightness. \u201cOh? And I\u2019m at yours, am I? You can impose meetings on me, in abandoned barns, at midnight, without offering me any kind of alternative, but meeting during perfectly normal hours under a per- fectly well-thought-out pretext in a perfectly suitable location presents difficulties, does it? I showed your schedule the same respect you showed mine; didn\u2019t you like it?\u201d",
      "She fixed him with a Look. Osric developed a new understanding of what gimlet-eyed meant.",
      "Osric decided not to die on this particular hill. \u201cPerhaps we can each make improvements to our scheduling habits when it comes to the other\u2019s calendar.\u201d",
      "\u201cA compromise?\u201d asked Fairhrim.",
      "\u201cYes,\u201d said Osric, assuming that this was a positive thing.",
      "It was not. Fairhrim sniffed in Osric\u2019s direction, as though manure from the barn still wafted from him. \u201cI\u2019ve compromised enough just being here today. But, nevertheless, we can compromise. Now, disrobe.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2014what?\u201d",
      "\u201cDisrobe,\u201d repeated Fairhrim. Then, slower: \u201cRemove your clothes.",
      "There are gowns in the cupboard. I\u2019ll be back in a minute.\u201d",
      "She left the room before Osric could make an argument. Nudity in the face of her ongoing animosity felt unwise. But refusal felt\u2014well, pathetic. She was only a Haelan and she was by herself.",
      "Was she by herself? What if she came back with a Warden when he was stark bollock naked? She reeked of hostility.",
      "He would keep his weapons close at hand.",
      "Osric began to undress. This was no small task. After much unclip- ping, unbelting, and unstrapping, he removed the following inventory from his person: twelve throwing knives, his blaecblade, two back- swords, one amputator, and, finally, a dozen syringes and vials contain- ing substances as nasty as they were illegal.",
      "These items he placed upon the examination table with care.",
      "He was less precious about his clothes: waistcoat, shirt, collar, cra- vat, trousers, underthings, and boots were all tossed towards a chair.",
      "Osric opened the cupboard to discover that the gowns were, judging by their colour and size, intended for little girls, rather than men who liked to cultivate an air of sinister elegance.",
      "He pulled a faded pink thing on, which, when placed over his head, left his dangly bits exposed.",
      "He decided to wrap the gown around his hips like some sort of kilt.",
      "Thus attired, he leaned against a cabinet, looking as suave as one could in a strip of puce-coloured linen, to await Fairhrim\u2019s return.",
      "He felt, once again, that Fairhrim was taking the piss. No one took the piss out of Osric Mordaunt with this level of frequency and noncha- lance. She was lucky that she was necessary to him at this moment; he would\u2019ve murdered her for the cheek otherwise.",
      "The Means to an End knocked, and her crisp voice asked, \u201cReady?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d said Osric. Should the Haelan have brought company to at- tack him while he was naked, he had throwing knives threaded between his fingers.",
      "Fairhrim swept into the room. Her hard eyes passed over Osric and rested on his knife-bristling fists.",
      "\u201cReally?\u201d was her unimpressed comment. \u201cI can assure you that if I\u2019d planned any harm to you, it would\u2019ve happened already.\u201d",
      "Well. That was cocky.",
      "\u201cYou\u2019ve got a high opinion of yourself,\u201d said Osric.",
      "\u201cDeserved, I assure you,\u201d said Fairhrim. She jutted her chin towards his gown. \u201cThat is quite the ensemble.\u201d",
      "\u201cFetching, isn\u2019t it?\u201d",
      "\u201cDid you try the adult cupboard?\u201d asked Fairhrim. \u201cWhat adult cupboard?\u201d asked Osric.",
      "\u201cThe one you\u2019re sitting on.\u201d \u201cOh,\u201d said Osric.",
      "(He had not tried the adult cupboard.)",
      "Fairhrim advanced into the room with a critical air that made Osric feel like he was back in the barracks as a young Fyren, awaiting his warchief\u2019s inspection.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to need the examination table, if you wouldn\u2019t mind moving this\u201d \u2014 Fairhrim made an impatient gesture towards Osric\u2019s weapons \u2014 \u201cmess of an arsenal.\u201d",
      "Osric moved his things under Fairhrim\u2019s watchful eye.",
      "\u201cIs there a single inch of you that isn\u2019t covered in scar tissue?\u201d she asked.",
      "Osric looked down at himself \u2014 at his chest, decorated by reminders of various blades; at his forearms, ridged by burns; at his shins, scat- tered with memories of a long-ago explosion.",
      "\u201cThere is,\u201d said Osric. \u201cA few inches, actually. Under the kilt.\u201d"

      "At the start of the movie, it\u2019s clear Alex Rose (Sofia Carson) is the black sheep of her family. But she\u2019s always been able to count on the love and support of her mother, Elizabeth (Connie Britton). So when she dies of a cancer recurrence, Alex is absolutely devastated.",
      "Even more, when it comes time for her family to divvy up her mother\u2019s assets, it seems like Alex has been cast aside. Her mother left her successful cosmetics company to her daughter-in-law, rather than her actual daughter.",
      "Her mother even fires Alex from beyond the grave, writing in her will that the first change to her company following her death should be to appoint a new head of marketing, replacing Alex.",
      "Her mom, it turns out, has other plans for her. Using a series of prerecorded DVDs, Elizabeth sends Alex on a journey through \u2014 well, life.",
      "\u201cI just felt like I had been Alex Rose, and more so that we\u2019ve all been Alex Rose at one point in our lives,\u201d Sofia Carson said on TODAY on March 24.",
      "\u201cLike, alive, but not living. And she awakened something in me. And I think that\u2019s what we hope this film will do to you when you watch it. It kind of awakens us to life again in a really simple but powerful way.\u201d",
      "What is the \u2018Life List\u2019?",
      "To receive any sort of trust, Alex must complete the bucket list she made as a child. According to her mother, completing this list will help her come back to her true self. In other words, if she doesn\u2019t fix the list by New Year\u2019s, Alex can kiss any inheritance goodbye.",
      "The items on the list range from mending her relationship with her father to playing basketball with a New York Knicks player. The item that proves to be the most difficult? Falling in love.",
      "At the start of the movie, her friend tells her that you know a guy a right for you if you can answer \u201cyes\u201d to all four of these questions:",
      "Is he kind? Can I tell him everything in my heart? Does he help me become the best version of myself? And can you imagine him as the father of your kids?",
      "Is he kind?",
      "Can I tell him everything in my heart?",
      "Does he help me become the best version of myself?",
      "And can you imagine him as the father of your kids?",
      "Realizing her current boyfriend checks off none of these boxes, Alex breaks up with him and embarks on the adventure of a lifetime. Her mom is there through every milestone in the form of a pre-taped message.",
      "Alex, in the course of completing the life list, uncovers secrets about her mother. Most notably, she learns that the man who raised her wasn\u2019t actually her biological father. Alex is the product of her mom\u2019s affair with a musician (Jordi Moll\u00e0).",
      "This explains why Alex felt alienated from her two brothers (half-brothers, it turns out), and why her father iced her out growing up. Meanwhile, her brothers reveal that they had felt pushed aside, too, in their own way.",
      "\u201cYour bond. Your little secrets and your private jokes. Like a club the rest of us weren\u2019t allowed into,\u201d one of her brothers says in the movie. \u201cMaybe for a moment think about what that was like for Dad. For Lucas and me.\u201d",
      "She goes on a road trip to Vermont with Brad (Kyle Allen), a lawyer executing her mom's will, and Nina, his girlfriend, to meet her father. The meeting is ultimately a disappointment: After having dinner together, her dad doesn't show up to meet her.",
      "She does find a spark with a newly single Brad, however, and reconnects with the man who raised her.",
      "Does Alex complete her 'life list' in time?",
      "No, but it turns out her mom didn\u2019t really expect her to.",
      "Alex may have played a one-on-one match with Knicks legend Patrick Ewing and learned to drive, but she wasn\u2019t able to check off the most difficult item on the list: falling in love.",
      "In her mother\u2019s final DVD, she admits that putting a timer on Alex\u2019s love life was never her intention. If she\u2019s being honest, she was never able to figure out the love thing herself.",
      "While Alex has a few love interests in the movie, it takes until the very end for her to seize on her connection with Brad.",
      "Does Alex get her inheritance?",
      "Even without checking off that final item, Alex finally receives her inheritance.",
      "Her mom leaves her the family home in Brooklyn, which Alex was initially worried her brothers would sell, plus a trust left to Alex to help cover taxes and maintenance.",
      "She also receives one last DVD from her mother, where she hears her say, \u201cBeing your mom has been the joy of my life.\u201d",
      "In the sweet video, Alex gives her mom a cup of tea unbeknownst to the fact that she\u2019s recording a video for her in the future. Here, Alex is able to relive an embrace with her mom one last time as she watches herself curled up with her mom. At the end of the video, the two give their final goodbyes \u2014 her mom to the camera and Alex to her screen.",
      "What happens in the end?",
      "The film ends with a New Year\u2019s Eve celebration at Alex\u2019s home. The scene bookends the start of the movie, where Alex felt out of place and jduged in the same space.",
      "Now, she\u2019s a whole new person. From finding love with Brad, to her entire family happy together at the event, Alex\u2019s role as host in the end signifies her newfound power.",
      "Her mother was right. What she really needed was to get back to herself. She just needed a little push."

      "Kiana Moore is forging her own path as a filmmaker.",
      "After winning the 2022 best feature film Tribeca X Award for \u201cThe Beauty of Blackness,\u201d with co-director Tiffany Johnson, Moore set her sights on sitting in the director\u2019s chair solo for her next big project.",
      "Similar to her previous works, like \u201cA Woman\u2019s Place,\u201d a documentary short about the gender biases women face in the culinary industry, and \u201cInto the Mix,\u201d a podcast created to inspire the next generation of activists, Moore continues to focus on underrepresented groups in her new film, \u201cSensory Overload.\u201d",
      "In this project, Moore, who serves as the vice president of content production and head of Epic Stories at Vox Creative, hopes to shine a light on sensory sensitive and neurodivergent communities in an effort to educate the masses about them, while also debunking stigmas.",
      "For some, the doc will be a first look at the day-to-day life of someone in the neurodivergent and sensory sensitive (communities). It shows how people who are neurodivergent, a nonmedical term to describe someone whose brain works differently, and sensory sensitive, or someone who has a heightened sensitivity to sensory input, aren\u2019t that much different than those who are not.",
      "Someone who is neurodivergent may be seen as having different strengths and challenges in comparison to others, according to Cleveland Clinic. Those possible strengths can include \u201cbetter memory\u201d and an ability to \u201csolve complex mathematical calculations,\u201d while potential differences can include \u201cmedical disorders, learning disabilities and other conditions,\u201d per the clinic.",
      "Moore tells TODAY.com that regardless of how these communities process information, they should be regarded as capable and included versus being judged and marginalized.",
      "\u201cBoth communities have so much to contribute, and they just need us to be open to the way in which they can contribute,\u201d Moore says.",
      "Now, with her project available to watch on Hulu, Moore is sharing more about her story and why she\u2019s not putting a limit on the stories she wants to tell.",
      "Read on to learn more about Moore and the vision behind \u201cSensory Overload.\u201d",
      "The following Q&A has been condensed for clarity.",
      "A: When we first started working on this campaign over a year ago, we were still trying to figure out what we were going to create, so we started with a story hunt \u2014 which is a process that (we use) to find nonfiction stories that we want to tell. ... Once we decided on the stories that we wanted to focus on in a feature length documentary, my team and I worked on crafting those stories into one cohesive film.",
      "Because we were working so closely together \u2014 and because I was working so closely with the cast \u2014 I felt like I should direct this documentary because I was there from the beginning. I knew the characters, I knew what they wanted to say, and I was very adamant about making sure that we told the story the right way.",
      "As someone who is dyslexic \u2026 I had a connection with some of the characters, and I do have sensory sensitivities. Now, I also, from this documentary, realize that I have a lot of sensory-seeking traits. I only realized that after talking to these amazing people. I really felt connected to them. I felt protective of them. I wanted to make sure that their stories were told correctly and resonated with anyone who watched the film, and that is why I decided to direct.",
      "A: I do have experience with the neurodivergent community. My godson is neurodivergent, and he means the world to me. One of my nephews is also neurodivergent, and I have had other situations where I have worked with neurodivergent people. The neurodivergent community is common to me. It is like a second skin. I am used to being around them, being an accomplice, and an ally for what they may need or making sure that the spaces they are in are more inclusive.",
      "But I didn\u2019t have experience nor know the language of sensory sensitivity until this documentary. Now that I have been a part of this piece, know the language and how to engage, and know how to actually be supportive, I feel that much better of a person \u2014 a better human so that I can also be an ally. We all need someone in the room who will speak up for us, especially when we are not there, but to also speak for us when we are there but we feel voiceless.",
      "To that point, experts and industry leaders are critical voices in this conversation \u2014 those who can speak on behalf of individuals. That\u2019s why, in tandem with the film, the Sensodyne Sensory\u00a0Inclusion Initiative launched in partnership with American Dental Association and sensory accessibility nonprofit KultureCity.",
      "We all need someone in the room who will speak up for us, especially when we are not there, but to also speak for us when we are there but we feel voiceless.\u201d",
      "kiana moore",
      "A: I think the biggest misconception is that they are a hindrance, they are an annoyance, they take up space that they don\u2019t need to take up, and that we have to somehow tolerate them. That is not true at all.",
      "Both communities have so much to contribute, and they just need us to be open to the way in which they can contribute. All of us have special skills. Someone who is an amazing pianist needs a piano to play. If they do not have one, or if they are playing the bass or the violin, they would not be able to express their skill fully, even though they have the ability and willingness to be great. We need to realize that there is greatness in all people. If we give people the tools, society will get to see them flourish.",
      "Making a space sensory friendly does not impact society negatively at all. But more importantly, it now allows people with sensory sensitivities to also thrive.",
      "A: I will be selfish and hope to win an Oscar for the best documentary. In all seriousness, professionally, I am content and blessed with where my career is going, and I just hope that people see this and trust me and my team to create more amazing content. I hope this film achieves understanding and engagement with (these communities). I hope that people watch this film and realize that if they need to speak up, that if they feel a part of this, they have the right to speak up, ask questions, and make situations more accommodating and inclusive. And, if a person doesn\u2019t have sensory sensitivities and they see someone struggling, maybe they will have a little bit more empathy and understanding, and then maybe help make a situation more inclusive."

      "\u201cBased on a True Story\" is Smith's first full-length solo music project in 20 years, but it's not the first time he addressed what happened at the Oscars.",

    "summary": "ABC's \"9-1-1\" showrunner Tim Minear breaks down Season Eight, Episode 12, from Eddie and Christopher's reunion to Maddie losing \u2014 and regaining \u2014 her voice.",
    "story": [
      "\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8Warning: Spoilers ahead for Season Eight, Episode 12, of \"9-1-1.\"",
      "After 11 episodes apart, Eddie Diaz has finally reunited with his son, Christopher, on \"9-1-1.\"",
      "Season Eight, Episode 12, of the ABC drama picked up three weeks after Episode 10, when Eddie (Ryan Guzman) moved back home to El Paso, Texas, to reunite with Chris (Gavin McHugh), who left Los Angeles at the end of Season Seven.",
      "The episode, titled \"Disconnected,\" also saw dispatcher Maddie Han (Jennifer Love Hewitt) deal with the aftermath of her kidnapping.",
      "At the end of the midseason premiere, Maddie was taken from her home by police detective Amber Braeburn (Abigail Spencer), who turned out to be the serial killer Maddie and Sgt. Athena Grant (Angela Bassett) had been looking for all along.",
      "Once firefighter husband Howie \"Chimney\" Han (Kenneth Choi) set out to try and rescue Maddie, and put himself in harm's way, she gave up trying to talk down Amber and fought back, starting a clash that resulted with her throat being slashed.",
      "\"I've got to put my characters through hell,\" showrunner Tim Minear tells TODAY.com. \"It was her turn. You know what? I spun that wheel. Her number came up.\"",
      "In Episode 12, Maddie tries to go back to work but on her first call, loses her voice, which turns out to be a psychological response to the trauma she faced.",
      "As she reels from being separated from her job, Eddie similarly struggles to find his footing in Texas. His house is proving to be a major fixer-upper, and he isn't able to join a local fire station in El Paso amid a hiring freeze. So, he trades in his tricked-out truck for a sedan with better gas mileage to become an Uber driver \u2014 a development he keeps from his parents and Chris.",
      "That is, until his son is the one hopping in the back of his car for a ride.",
      "After the awkward moment of truth, Eddie recaps the encounter over FaceTime to his best friend and former co-worker, Evan \"Buck\" Buckley (Oliver Stark), who encourages him to talk to Chris directly.",
      "While Eddie's texts to his son go unanswered, Chris surprises his dad by showing up at his house unannounced. The 14-year-old says he wants Eddie to stay in El Paso. Eddie then apologizes for lying about his current profession, telling Chris, \u201cI just wanted you to be proud of me.\u201d",
      "\u201cI am proud of you,\u201d Chris responds, and the father and son share a long-awaited hug.",
      "Maddie also ends the episode reconnecting with her daughter \u2014\u00a0verbally that is. After briefly losing track of Jee-Yun at a playground, Maddie struggles to shout her child's name, until her voice comes roaring back.",
      "Below, Minear breaks down Maddie's and Eddie\u2019s big breakthroughs in Episode 12 and previews what's ahead.",
      "This interview has been lightly edited for clarity.",
      "To remind her where her power is, really.",
      "I just thought it was interesting. By being attacked the way she was, having her throat cut, that does sort of temporarily take away her voice, but then it becomes, like a psychological version of that. I sort of like the metaphor that Maddie's voice \u2014 I mean, it\u2019s the thing that people hear over that phone, and it\u2019s a tether to hope or death. So that voice is really her superpower.",
      "So we had several different versions of how her voice came back, and pretty much all of them were predicated on her child. But we did have what I felt were, like, sort of convoluted ways that it happened.",
      "And then I think it may have been (writer) Molly Green\u2019s idea to have her just be out in a public place. And a thing that any parent can actually really relate to is you turn around for a split second and you look back and you have that moment of panic, because it\u2019s like, \"Wait, where\u2019d my kid go?\"",
      "So, when she really needed her voice, it came back. And it\u2019s really because of the things that Athena was saying to her in a previous scene. That she has to wrestle with her own fear on her job, but then she thinks about the people that need her, and she muscles through. And that\u2019s exactly what happens to Maddie in that moment.",
      "I think Eddie feels like a bit of an outsider in his life. So I think what it would have looked like is kind of what you're seeing, where Eddie is going over to his parents' house for family dinners. His mother in particular is sort of taking on the role of parent, and so she's almost treating Eddie and Christopher like they were both her sons \u2014 almost treating Eddie like he's Christopher's brother, as opposed to his father.",
      "But the first thing Eddie needs to do is kind of like lay down some roots and get his house ready so that Christopher can move in.",
      "But his whole story so far has been that he doesn\u2019t want to spook his kid. He\u2019s approaching this in \u2014 I\u2019m not even advocating that he\u2019s made the right choice here \u2014 but he\u2019s approaching this in a very circumspect way. And he just, he wants to make sure that it\u2019s Chris\u2019 choice to come back. I think his mother in particular is kind of leveraging that against him a little bit.",
      "I think he is learning Father Brian\u2019s lesson.",
      "But I think this instance is very different than what happened with him in LA. He was lying to everybody by omission. He\u2019s kind of doing that again.",
      "Eddie seems to have some patterns here. I think Eddie needs to work on that. Now that I think about it, he sort of lets people believe what they believe.",
      "It's a little bit different here because he was withholding something intentionally in the Kim storyline. Here, it's more that he didn't mean to give the wrong impression, but he's too afraid to correct that mistake.",
      "It means everything. The door is now open for Eddie. Now he just needs to walk through it.",
      "Well it's the very next episode, so I don't necessarily want to spoil it, but Eddie needs to dad up, and that is the story that we tell in the next episode.",
      "Eddie and his relationship with his parents vis-\u00e0-vis Christopher is very much the focus of Eddie's story in the next episode.",
      "The episode is called \"Invisible.\" And the characters feel invisible, and even Hen feels invisible, which is unusual for Hen. But there\u2019s just a really nice story of Hen doing what she does best, which is bonding on a human level with a patient, with a character who's feeling unseen, and she helps him to feel more seen, and it doesn\u2019t quite go as she expects.",
      "I don\u2019t think their dynamic really has changed. As I\u2019ve said repeatedly, I\u2019ve been writing these characters the same since Eddie\u2019s introduction, since the beginning of Season Two. And I think they were on good, solid ground when they parted at the end of Episode 10.",
      "What I would say is, there\u2019s a thing that happens in tonight's episode, where Buck has the opportunity to encourage Eddie to come back to LA. Eddie, in a weak moment, or in a vulnerable moment, I should say, when his job situation is not panning out the way he had hoped, suggests that maybe he should just come back and do his old job, because he\u2019s not living with his kid anyway, and he needs to provide for him. And it\u2019s Buck who says, \"You can\u2019t come back.\"",
      "So I think what you see, and it's subtle, is a little growth for Buck. Like this time, he didn\u2019t have to hem and haw, he didn\u2019t have to go adopt an animal. He just said the thing that Eddie needed to hear. And it was at a, you know, not a huge price for Buck, but he really was just thinking about the other person in this instance, and I think that's growth.",
      "It's always a trick, when you're in Season Eight of something, and you're continuously putting your characters in peril, that you do want to feel like there's fallout, that there are stakes, that the things that happen to them matter.",
      "The stakes are very high going forward for the rest of the season. And not just for one character.",
      "I mean I think it would be revisited should the need for the reading of a will arrive.",
      "But you know I'm quite sure Eddie doesn't share every move he makes with his parents. And so I would not assume that they know that at all.",
      "Family, faith and loyalty, I think for both of them."

      "\u201cFull disclosure, I put on a smile a lot of those times because I was struggling a lot in my personal life,\u201d she said at the time. \u201cI\u2019ve learned a lot about what I\u2019m capable of handling, and also what you should not handle. That was me saying \u2018bye\u2019 to \u2018The Voice\u2019 and having this big move. I love that family, but I was like, \u2018I\u2019m struggling. I can\u2019t smile anymore.

      "Netflix recently released the new documentary \u201cGold & Greed: The Hunt for Fenn\u2019s Treasure,\u201d which details the real-life treasure hunt set up by adventure enthusiast Forrest Fenn.",
      "In 2010, Fenn, an art and antiquities dealer, buried a treasure worth approximately $2 million and left clues in his memoir. Fenn sparked a national treasure hunt, leading to a sense of purpose and danger among devotees.",
      "One of the most dedicated treasure hunters, Texas-based software engineer Justin Posey, appeared on TODAY in a March 27 segment to discuss his experience hunting for Fenn\u2019s treasure \u2014 and to discuss the creation of his own treasure hunt in Fenn\u2019s honor.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just a way of paying it forward, what Fenn created for thousands of us,\u201d Posey said.",
      "While filming the documentary, Posey told the filmmakers that he had hidden clues throughout the set of his interviews, which took place in his house. NBC News correspondent Joe Fryer asked Posey if he knew if all the clues he hid had made it onto \u201cGold and Greed.\u201d",
      "\u201cI feel confident that they are,\u201d Posey told Fryer with a smile.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about \u201cGold & Greed\u201d and the new sequel treasure hunt created by Posey.",
      "Who was Forrest Fenn and what was his treasure?",
      "Forrest Fenn was an art dealer and Vietnam War veteran who became inspired to create a treasure hunt after being diagnosed with kidney cancer in 1988.",
      "Inspired to leave behind a legacy, Fenn created an elaborate treasure hunt by hiding a chest filled with gold in jewels in a hidden location Rocky Mountains. His memoir, \u201cThe Thrill of the Chase,\u201d containing a poem filled with subtle clues revealing the location of Fenn\u2019s valuable chest.",
      "While the treasure hunt created lasting memories for many dedicated adventurers, it came with with trouble \u2014 at least five people died in the search.",
      "The search ended in 2020, when a then 32-year-old medical student named Jack Stuef found the treasure, which sold at auction for $1.3 million.",
      "Fenn died three months after Stuef found his treasure from natural causes.",
      "Who is Justin Posey?",
      "Justin Posey, a software engineer based in Texas, was one of Fenn\u2019s dedicated treasure hunters and is featured in the documentary.",
      "Posey said his friends and family would categorize him as \u201ceccentric\u201d due to his unique hobbies, including his love for artifacts and treasure. Posey\u2019s grandfather was a Montana fish and game warden who inspired Posey to be adventurous and explore the outdoors.",
      "\u201cI became the family\u2019s resident treasure hunter,\u201d Posey said in the documentary.",
      "The release of Fenn\u2019s memoir reignited a spark from Posey\u2019s childhood, he said in \u201cGold & Greed,\u201d which caused him to start his own search for the treasure. He trained his dog to be able to locate bronze and ventured to multiple states.",
      "In the documentary, Posey visits the location in Yellowstone where he, and many others, believe Stuef found the treasure.",
      "What did Justin Posey say about his new treasure?At the beginning of the first episode of \"Gold & Greed,\" Posey goes off-camera to tell filmmakers that he had hidden clues on the set in his house throughout the interview.",
      "Neither Netflix nor the director of the film knows if any of the clues hinted at actually made it onto the documentary's final cut, but Justin Posey said he feels \u201cconfident\u201d that they are there.",
      "\u201cNo one working on the production or distribution of this program has any knowledge of any purported buried or abandoned property or any supposed related clues, and does not encourage you to search for any hidden treasure(s),\u201d a disclaimer in the documentary reads.",
      "In tandem with the quest announcement, Justin Posey created the website \"Beyond the Map's Edge\" for news and information related to his treasure hunt. The website also includes instructions on how to begin the treasure hunt. The steps include:",

      "A powerful moment between two \"Survivor\" contestants on rival tribes brought Jeff Probst to tears, which he said has \"never happened\" in his 25 years of hosting the show.",
      "Eva Erickson, 24, who has autism, was \"extremely overwhelmed\" during the March 26 episode of Season 48, which led to her crying uncontrollably as her four tribe mates tried to console her.",
      "Probst noticed a competitor from a rival tribe, Joe Hunter, 45, showing concern for Erickson in the emotional moment. Hunter and Erickson started the game on the same tribe but were separated in Episode 4. Usually contestants from competing tribes are not allowed to physically interact, but Probst broke with protocol.",
      "\"Joe, you want to give her a hug?\" he asked Hunter in the episode.",
      "Hunter walked over and embraced Erickson, telling her, \"You're good. Deep breath, remember.\"",
      "He took Erickson's hand and continued to calm her. She thanked him, and then he asked if she wanted another \"big hug.\"",
      "\"Yeah, you're amazing,\" she replied.",
      "\"Ease you out of it,\" he said as he embraced her. \"Come back down out of it. Easy, slow your breath.\"",
      "He then clasped her hands as she stopped crying and once again thanked him.",
      "Erickson had only told Hunter early in the competition that she had autism, but then shared it with the group after their moment together. Probst spoke about why he allowed Hunter to break with the usual rules of no contact with an opposing tribe.",
      "\"Normally, when a challenge ends, we keep the tribes separated, but I think everybody here saw that something really powerful was happening,\" Probst said. \"Eva was struggling, emotionally struggling. Clearly there was a connection with a former tribe mate in Joe. I felt it was OK for me to suggest they hug, and I could see everybody agreed.\"",
      "Probst then asked Hunter why he would risk potentially losing the \"Survivor\" competition by helping someone from a rival tribe.",
      "\"I want my kids watching me,\" the fire captain from California said. \"I'm going to be the man I want them to be and the people I want them to be, regardless of the game, and that's what you do. That's who I am. So if it exposes, it exposes, but she was in need, and I would want someone to treat my daughter that way if they were playing this game.\"",
      "Erickson then told the other competitors that she was diagnosed with autism when she was very young.",
      "\"I've never viewed my autism as a roadblock to success,\" she said. \"It's not something to work around, it's just part of who I am. It's nothing bad about it.\"",
      "Her fellow \"Survivor\" players clapped in the background as Erickson told her story.",
      "\"Please let\u2019s take a step away from the game and understand that this is something that I deal with with my autism, and everyone who has autism should not be ashamed to ask for help and ashamed to receive it,\" she said.",
      "Probst then became emotional as he summed up the moment.",
      "\"Eva, it takes so much courage to play \u2018Survivor\u2019 for anybody, but for you to come out here knowing something like this might happen, and then be brave enough to share your story,\" he said.",
      "\"Because there is a young girl or boy just like you watching right now going, \u2018Hey Mom, hey Dad...\"",
      "Probst paused as he fought back tears.",
      "\"Now you got me. I\u2019m a parent, too, and I do see it. Wow, this has never happened. But I see it, too, and it\u2019s why I love \u2018Survivor.\u2019\"",
      "Erickson told People in an interview that it was \"crazy seeing Jeff cry.\"",
      "\"Seeing Jeff get so emotional about the situation and thinking about his own family and his kids, that was the moment when it hit me, that this is a moment that is going to be remembered,\" she said. \"He\u2019s seen so many people and been through so much through all of years of 'Survivor,' and now seeing that this moment broke him, I was like, OK, this is bigger than I can imagine.\u201d",
      "On the show, Erickson described experiencing \"episodes\" where she gets extremely overstimulated and \"ungrounded,\" which causes her to \"lose control\" of herself.",
      "The Ph.D. candidate from Brown University told People she kept falling during a challenge, which caused her to become overwhelmed. She was grateful for Hunter stepping in to help calm her.",
      "\u201cI want to tell Joe that he\u2019s my superhero,\" she told People. \"He is an amazing man, and I am so thankful I got to meet him through 'Survivor,' and that this is someone who, regardless of what happens in the rest of the game, he will always have a place in my heart. He saw me in this hard situation \u2014 and he had the tools and knew what to do \u2014 and he acted on that.\u201d"

      "The earthquake occurred around 1:30 p.m. local time (2:30 a.m. ET) at a depth of 6 miles near Mandalay, the second-largest city in Myanmar, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. It was followed 11 minutes later by a 6.7-magnitude aftershock, which the USGS initially reported as a 6.4-magnitude.",

    "summary": "Vice President JD Vance is set to land in Greenland to a chorus of anger and anxiety at White House plans to seize the Arctic territory by any means necessary.",
    "story": [
      "Vice President JD Vance sharply criticized Denmark and other European allies during his visit to Greenland on Friday, as the Trump administration continues to push U.S. ownership of the semi-autonomous territory.",
      "Speaking to servicemembers at Pituffik Space Base, a U.S. Space Force base on the northwestern coast of Greenland, Vance argued that Greenlanders would be better off being under the protection of the U.S. than under Denmark.",
      "\u201cOur message to Denmark is very simple \u2014 you have not done a good job by the people of Greenland,\" Vance said. \"You have under-invested in the people of Greenland and you have under-invested in the security architecture of this incredible, beautiful land mass.\"",
      "Days after President Donald Trump said that the U.S. \u201cwould\u00a0go as far as we have to\u201d to take ownership of territory, Vance made a pitch to the people of Greenland: \"I think that you\u2019d be a lot better coming under the United States security umbrella than you have been under Denmark's security umbrella.\"",
      "Asked if the Trump administration had plans to expand the U.S. military's presence in Greenland, Vance said there aren't, but said they do plan to invest more resources such as ice breakers and additional naval ships in the area. He argues it's part of an effort to put an end to ignoring encroachment from other countries, which he said the U.S. has done for the last 40 years.",
      "\"We can\u2019t just bury our head in the sand \u2014\u00a0or in Greenland, bury our head in the snow \u2014 and pretend that the Chinese are not interested in this very large land mass. We know that they are,\" he said.",
      "Vance was asked by reporters several times whether the U.S. would ever use military force to acquire Greenland and he said he doesn't think that will ever be necessary. The vice president said he envisions that Greenlanders will become independent from Denmark and then he said the U.S. will discuss their future with them.",
      "Vance is traveling with his wife, second lady Usha Vance, Energy Secretary Chris Wright and national security adviser Michael Waltz.",
      "After landing in Greenland on Air Force Two, the vice president and his wife were greeted by personnel at the Space Force base.",
      "\"It's cold as s--- here! Nobody told me!\" Vance said in a mess hall on the base as he sat down to eat with servicemembers. Weather websites showed single-digit subzero temperatures at the time.",
      "Vance said he's the first vice president to visit Greenland and remarked he had had a \"beautiful flight.\" The vice president said he and his team would speak to officials on base to understand how their work contributes to U.S. national security \u2014 which has been President Donald Trump's stated reasons for his interest in the U.S. taking control of the Danish territory.",
      "\"We\u2019re gonna get a briefing, of course, about, you know, what you guys do every day, and then we\u2019re gonna talk just about, as you\u2019ve heard, we have some interest in Greenland from the Trump administration,\" Vance said. He added that the administration and the president specifically were interested in \"Arctic security.\"",
      "Trump reiterated his desire to acquire Greenland while speaking to reporters in the Oval Office Friday. \"We need Greenland, very importantly, for international security. We have to have Greenland. It\u2019s not a question of, 'Do you think we can do without it?' We can\u2019t.\"",
      "Hours before Vance and his wife took off from Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, Russian President Vladimir Putin said Thursday night that he had no problem with Trump's proposed land grab of the world's largest island.",
      "Trump\u2019s desire to take Greenland has \u201clong historical roots,\u201d Putin said Thursday at Russia\u2019s Arctic Forum in Murmansk, the largest city north of the Arctic Circle. \u201cThis is an issue that concerns two specific nations and has nothing to do with us.\u201d",
      "Trump has for years stated his desire to take over the territory, two-thirds of which sits above the Arctic Circle, and whose melting ice hides a bonanza of rare-earth elements, oil and natural gas.",
      "Denmark fully controlled the island for 300 years until it became a semi-autonomous territory in 1953. Although Greenland gained home rule in 1979, Copenhagen still controls its foreign and defense policy and contributes just under $1 billion to its economy.",
      "It is a vast, sparse land \u2014 around the size of Alaska and California combined but with only 56,000 people.",
      "NBC News traveled there this week ahead of Vance's visit and locals said they felt betrayed by their giant North American neighbor.",
      "Patrick Abrahamsen, 45, a search-and-rescue hoist operator for Air Greenland, told NBC News that his opinion of his country\u2019s relationship with America has changed since Trump took office.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s been said some stuff from the administration of Trump, and some of that hasn\u2019t been that polite, I would say,\u201d he said. \u201cThe way that they\u2019ve just invited themselves, for example, and the way that they\u2019ve spoken about Greenland has changed the sentiment up here about how Americans are portrayed and how we look at them.\u201d",
      "Abrahamsen added that he used to view the U.S.-Greenland relationship as \u201calways close,\u201d but said, \u201cNow, it\u2019s a different story.\u201d",
      "Anders Laursen, 41, owner of a local water taxi company, had a similar take.",
      "\u201cWe have always looked at America like the nice big brother to help you out and now it\u2019s like the big brother is bullying you,\u201d Laursen said.",
      "That anger saw the U.S. delegation's visit vastly downscaled, albeit with the addition of the vice president. Originally intended to encompass a visit to the capital, Nuuk, and with cultural elements such as a dog-sled race, it will now only last one day and be confined to U.S. Pituffik Space Base, which is hundreds of miles from the capital \u2014 and likely any dissenting locals.",
      "One person not raising objections is Putin.",
      "He used his speech in Murmansk to detail past U.S. attempts to annex Greenland dating to the 1860s. The Russian leader has often used his own reading of Ukrainian history \u2014 which experts say is replete with ahistorical inaccuracies \u2014 to justify his invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.",
      "On the eve of the visit, Greenland's political parties banded together to form a coalition government following elections there last month, according to local media reports.",
      "Jens-Frederik Nielsen, leader of Demokraatit, the largest party in the  legislature, had urged his rivals to put aside their domestic differences and form the broadest possible coalition to resist the prospect of a hostile Trump takeover.",
      "That appears to have come to pass, with four of the five parties in the legislature involved in the new coalition, local media reported.",
      "During the Greenlandic election, Nielsen, the eventual winner, told\u00a0NBC News international partner Sky News that \u201cwe don\u2019t want to be Americans. No, we don\u2019t want to be Danes. We want to be Greenlanders.\u201d"

      "On Tuesday, Ballal \u2014 his face bruised and clothes still spotted with blood \u2014 recounted to The Associated Press how he was heavily beaten by an Israeli settler and soldiers the night before. The settler, he said, kicked his head \u201clike a football\u201d during a settler attack on his village.",
      "The soldiers then detained him and two other Palestinians. Ballal said he was kept blindfolded for more than 20 hours, sitting on the floor under a blasting air conditioner. The soldiers kicked, punched or hit him with a stick whenever they came on their guard shifts, he said. Ballal doesn\u2019t speak Hebrew, but he said he heard them saying his name and the word \u201cOscar.\u201d",
      "\u201cI realized they were attacking me specifically,\u201d he said in an interview at a West Bank hospital after his release Tuesday. \u201cWhen they say \u2018Oscar\u2019, you understand. When they say your name, you understand.\u201d",
      "The Israeli military did not immediately respond to the claims that Ballal was beaten by soldiers. The settler whom Ballal identified as his attacker, Shem Tov Luski \u2014 who has threatened Ballal in the past \u2014 denied he or the soldiers beat him and told the AP that he and other Palestinians in the village had thrown stones at his car. He said he didn\u2019t know Ballal was an Oscar winner.",
      "The Israeli military said Monday it had detained three Palestinians suspected of hurling rocks as well as one Israeli civilian, who was soon released. Ballal denied throwing stones.",
      "\u2018I\u2019m dying\u2019",
      "The attack took place Monday night in the southern West Bank village of Susiya. It\u2019s part of the Masafer Yatta region featured in \u201cNo Other Land,\u201d which depicts the Palestinian residents\u2019 attempts to fend off settler attacks and the military\u2019s plans to demolish their homes.",
      "At around sunset, as residents were ending their daylong Ramadan fast, roughly two dozen Jewish settlers along with police entered the village, throwing stones at houses and breaking property, witnesses say. Around 30 soldiers arrived soon after. Jewish Israelis in an activist group supporting the villagers showed video of themselves also being attacked, with settlers hitting their car with sticks and stones.",
      "Ballal said he filmed some of the damage caused by the settlers. Then he went to his own home and locked it, with his wife and three young children inside.",
      "\u201cI told myself if they will attack me, if they kill me, I will protect my family,\u201d he said.",
      "Ballal said Luski approached with two soldiers. He said Luski hit him on the head, knocked him to the ground and kept kicking and punching him in the head. At the same time, one soldier hit him on the legs with his gun butt, while the other pointed his weapon at him, he said.",
      "Lamia Ballal, the director\u2019s wife, said she was huddling inside with their children and heard him screaming, \u201cI\u2019m dying!\u201d",
      "Luski told the AP that he and other settlers had come to the village to help a fellow settler who said he was being attacked by Palestinian stone-throwers. He said dozens of masked Palestinians attacked his car with stones, including Ballal. \u201cHe broke my window, threw a stone at my chest,\u201d he said.",
      "He said when soldiers arrived, he led them to Ballal\u2019s house to identify him as one of the attackers but denied that he hit him or that settlers attacked any property in the village. Luski said he had footage of the night\u2019s events but when asked to show it to the AP, he responded with a string of expletives.",
      "On Tuesday, a small bloodstain could be seen outside Ballal\u2019s home, and the family car\u2019s windows were shattered. Neighbors pointed to a nearby water tank with a hole in the side that they said had been punched by the settlers.",
      "Under detention",
      "Lea Tsemel, the attorney representing Ballal and the two other Palestinians detained with him, said they were taken to an army base, where they only received minimal care for their injuries from the attack. She said they had no access to them for several hours after their arrest.",
      "Ballal said he had no idea where he was being held, could see nothing and was \u201cfreezing\u201d from the hours spent blindfolded under the air conditioner.",
      "The three were transferred to an Israeli police station at the West Bank settlement of Kiryat Arba and were released Tuesday afternoon.",
      "\u201cAll my body is pain,\u201d he told the AP immediately after his release as he walked, limping, toward a hospital in the nearby Palestinian city of Hebron.",
      "Doctors at the hospital said Ballal had bruises and scratches all over his body, abrasions under his eye and a cut on his chin but no internal injuries. The two other detained Palestinians also had minor injuries.",
      "Confrontations with settlers",
      "In a widely circulated video from August, Luski and several other masked settlers are seen arguing with Ballal. Luski shouts profanity at him and tries to provoke him into a fight.",
      "\u201cThis is my land, I was given it by God,\u201d Luski says. \u201cNext time it won\u2019t be nice.\u201d He taunts Ballal with the prospect of being sent to\u00a0Sde Teiman, a notorious military prison holding Palestinians detained from Gaza, where five soldiers have been charged with raping a detainee with a knife.",
      "\u201cRape for a higher cause,\u201d he says in Hebrew, then blows Ballal a kiss.",
      "The film \u201cNo Other Land,\u201d a\u00a0joint Israeli-Palestinian production, chronicles the situation in Masafer Yatta, which the Israeli military designated as a live-fire training zone in the 1980s and ordered the expulsion of the residents, mostly Arab Bedouin. Around 1,000 residents have largely remained in place, but soldiers regularly come in to demolish homes, tents, water tanks and olive orchards.",

      "In the suit, Stern claims Tate\u2019s behavior \u201cgrew more aggressive over time,\u201d and \u201cthe last incident was the worst.\u201d On March 10, the suit says, the couple checked into a room at the Beverly Hills Hotel, where they were having consensual sex early the following morning. Tate then began to choke her, and she \u201cbegan crying and begging for him to stop. He would not,\u201d according to the complaint.",
      "Tate continued to choke and beat her repeatedly on her face and the top of her head, and days later she was diagnosed with a concussion after seeking medical attention while in New York, according to the complaint.",

      "The ban had been in place in the wake of their arrest in Romania in late 2022 on charges of human trafficking and forming a criminal gang to exploit women. The brothers have denied all allegations. The timing of the ban\u2019s lifting led to speculation that the State Department or the White House helped the brothers, who are supporters of President Donald Trump, but the administration declined to comment and McBride also declined to comment last month.",
      "Upon their arrival in the U.S., the brothers received a cold reception from officials in Florida.",
      "Gov. Ron DeSantis immediately said the brothers were not welcome in the state, and Attorney General James Uthmeier said he would open a criminal investigation into the men, although he did not outline specific allegations.",
      "After leaving the U.S., the Tate brothers returned to Romania, where they have resided since 2017.",
      "On Monday, the brothers appeared at a police station to register as part of the judicial requirements in their criminal case.",

      "Tate is the focus of other ongoing lawsuits, including one in Britain filed by four women accusing him of rape and abuse, and a countersuit in the U.S. filed last month in Florida by a woman claiming the Tate brothers coerced her into sex work in Romania.

      "A steady stream of\u00a0illegal weapons\u00a0smuggled into Haiti is fueling an increase in\u00a0gang violence\u00a0and leading to severe human rights abuses, according to a U.N. report released Thursday.",
      "More than 4,200 people were killed from July to February, and another 1,356 were injured, the report found. It was issued after William O\u2019Neill, the U.N. human rights commissioner\u2019s expert on Haiti, recently visited the troubled Caribbean country.",
      "While much of the violence has been unleashed by gangs who formed a coalition last year known as \u201c\u00a0Viv Ansamn,\u201d a growing number of people are being killed by\u00a0self-defense groups\u00a0and mobs, including at least 77 suspected gang members slain in November after gunmen tried to attack a community in the Port-au-Prince capital, the report stated.",
      "It also found that the number of people killed and injured by authorities fighting gangs \u201cremained extremely high.\u201d",
      "More than 2,000 people were killed during police operations from July to February, a 60% increase compared with the 1,253 killings reported from February to July of 2024.",
      "Some 73% of victims killed by law enforcement were reportedly gang members, but 27% \u201cwere not associated with gangs and were often struck by stray bullets while in the streets or at home,\u201d the report said. It noted that in some cases, police opened fire from armored vehicles \u201cwhere people were walking or selling goods on the streets.\u201d",
      "It also said police have been reportedly involved in summary executions of suspected gang members, their families, \u201cor individuals who, when intercepted, were unable to provide identification or offer a sufficient explanation for their presence in the area.\u201d",
      "The report stated that nearly 1,000 firearms belonging to Haiti\u2019s National Police have been diverted in the past four years, and that credible sources have said officers are selling some weapons on the black market.",
      "A police spokesperson did not immediately return a message requesting comment.",
      "The report said gangs also obtain illegal weapons from private security companies that use them.",
      "Overall, an estimated 270,000 to 500,000 illegal weapons are circulating across Haiti.",
      "\u201cThe use of these firearms has fueled a destructive cycle of violence in Haiti, leading to severe human rights abuses,\u201d the report stated.",
      "Detecting and seizing illegal weapons remains a challenge given what the report said was severe underfunding and understaffing at Haiti\u2019s customs and police departments, as well as a lack of resources and technology coupled with corruption and lack of oversight.",
      "It noted that a U.N.-backed mission led\u00a0by Kenyan police to help fight gangs in Haiti\u00a0has only about 40% of the 2,500 personnel envisioned.",
      "One Kenyan officer, Samuel Tompoi Kaetuai,\u00a0was killed in February\u00a0in Haiti\u2019s central Artibonite region.

      "With the United Nations, the United States and European nations, \"we could discuss the possibility of introduction of temporary governance in Ukraine,\u201d Putin said, while Ukraine holds \u201cdemocratic elections, to bring to power a capable government that enjoys the trust of the people.\u201d",

      "Zelenskyy on Wednesday also accused the Trump administration of \"constantly changing\" the terms of a minerals deal it is negotiating with Ukraine, which would see the U.S. get a 50% stake in Ukraine's mineral wealth and oil and gas reserves in exchange for military aid.",

    "story": [
      "JERUSALEM \u2014 European far-right leaders were in Jerusalem on Thursday for a conference organized by the Israeli government aimed at combating antisemitism, which was shunned by mainstream Jewish leaders because of the divisive guest list.",
      "The event illustrates a growing alliance between Israel \u2014 a country founded on the ashes of the Holocaust \u2014 and a European far-right that some critics say has not shed its links to\u00a0antisemitism\u00a0and Naziism during World War II.",
      "Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who leads an ultranationalist government, has cultivated close ties in recent years with far-right populist leaders in countries like Hungary, Brazil and Argentina. Many of these leaders, including Netanyahu, have been greatly influenced by the policies and demeanor of U.S. President Donald Trump.",
      "In a speech to the conference, Netanyahu commended Trump for his \u201cdecisive actions against antisemitism\u201d and blamed U.S. campus protests against Israel\u2019s war in Gaza on \u201ca systemic alliance between ultra-progressive left and radical Islam.\u201d",
      "\u201cAntisemitism is a disease carried by barbarians\u201d in \u201call civilized societies,\u201d said Netanyahu.",
      "Thursday\u2019s conference illuminated the increasingly strained relationship between Israel and its traditional allies in the West, which have grown uneasy with Israeli politics and the direction of the country\u2019s devastating\u00a0war in Gaza. Israel broke the ceasefire with Hamas and resumed the war earlier this month, and Netanyahu is wanted by the International Criminal Court for alleged crimes against humanity in Gaza.",
      "Jewish communities around the world have reported increases in antisemitic violence since the start of the war.",
      "Also attending the event was Bosnian Serb President\u00a0Milorad Dodik, even after a Bosnian court requested an international\u00a0arrest warrant\u00a0for him for his\u00a0separatist policies.",
      "During the conference, Dodik spoke out defiantly against the warrant.",
      "\u201cThe Muslims from Sarajevo they want to punish me because I came here to Israel supporting Israel,\u201d Dodik told The Associated Press through a translator. \u201cThey are misusing the judiciary and the prosecutor office because they are in charge for that.\u201d",
      "Most speakers at the conference railed against antisemitism on the political left and in Muslim societies, with only brief mention of antisemitism on the right. Panels of speakers were set to focus on \u201cHow Progressivism Fell Captive to Antisemitism\u201d and \u201cHow Radical Islam Fuels Antisemitism in the West.\u201d",
      "Jordan Bardella, president of the far-right French National Rally party, gave a keynote address in which he blamed rising antisemitism in Europe on migration and Islamism.",
      "\u201cIslamism is the totalitarianism of the 21st century. It threatens to destroy everything that is not like it,\u201d he said.",
      "David Friedman, the U.S. ambassador to Israel during Trump\u2019s first term, also attended. Asked by the moderator about Trump\u2019s plan to\u00a0remove Palestinians\u00a0from Gaza, Friedman said: \u201cI love it! I love it. And I think it\u2019s doable.\u201d",
      "Other far-right Europeans are attending from the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and Hungary.",
      "The European far-right\u2019s anti-immigrant platform has focused heavily on immigration from Muslim countries, finding common ground in what Israel describes as a shared battle against Islamic extremism. Critics say this alliance often veers into Islamophobia.",
      "Many mainstream Jewish leaders dropped out of the event after initially agreeing to attend, including Jonathan Greenblatt, chief executive of the Anti-Defamation League, a leading U.S. nonprofit that battles antisemitism.",
      "French philosopher Bernard-Henri Levy, German antisemitism czar Felix Klein and German politician Volker Beck also canceled their participation, while Israel\u2019s president, Isaac Herzog, also pulled out of the conference in favor of hosting a separate meeting of Jewish leaders who had originally come to the country for the conference, his office said."

    "story": [
      "SEOUL, South Korea \u2014 Rain and cooler temperatures helped South Korean fire crews as they battled the country\u2019s worst-ever wildfires on Friday, as the governor of the hardest-hit region called for overhauling the response to the climate crisis that he says worsened the disaster.",
      "The wildfires, which have killed 28 people and razed vast swaths of land in the southeast in the last week, were 85% contained as of Friday morning, Korea Forest Service chief Lim Sang-seop told a televised briefing. He said authorities would launch \u201call-out efforts\u201d to extinguish the remaining blazes by bringing more helicopters and firefighters to the areas.",
      "The raging inferno has also destroyed thousands of houses, factories, vehicles and other structures, while mountains and hills were stripped of anything but a carpet of smoldering ashes.",
      "\u201cHazes have been diminished because of the rain last night, so that\u2019s favorable for securing visibility. Also temperatures are now lower than the last few days, so things are very favorable to put out the wildfires,\u201d Lim said.",
      "Firefighters \u2014 many in their 60s, a reflection of one of the world\u2019s fastest-aging populations \u2014 navigated forests in yellow helmets and red protective suits, spraying suppressants at flames that flickered near their feet. Helicopters dropped buckets of water over hills that glowed red in the night.",
      "Residents hunkered down in temporary shelters in places like schools and gyms, but the fire crept dangerously close to some of them too. A video shared by one evacuee shows blazes approaching a school soccer field under a sky choked with smoke.",
      "\u201cI just kept crying this morning,\u201d said 79-year-old Seo Jae Tak, an evacuee at a gym in Andong city, on Thursday. \u201cWhen I went back yesterday, the entire mountain had turned to ashes. It\u2019s just unbelievable, I can\u2019t even put it into words. All I can do is cry.\u201d",
      "Authorities were mobilizing about 9,000 people, 125 helicopters and hundreds of other vehicles to battle the wildfires, the government\u2019s disaster response center said.",
      "The wildfires have burned 118,265 acres of land, forced more than 30,000 people to flee their homes and injured 37 others since last Friday. Officials said Friday that 8,000 residents remained at temporary shelters. The fires have been driven by strong winds and dry weather.",
      "While it is difficult to link any one event to climate change, officials and experts say that it is making wildfires more likely and more severe. Scientists have already warned that the warming atmosphere around the world is driving ever more extreme weather events, including wildfires, flooding, droughts, hurricanes and heat waves that are killing people and causing billions of dollars in damage every year.",
      "\u201cWe must completely overhaul our wildfire response strategy in the face of extreme climate conditions,\u201d Lee Cheol-woo, governor of North Gyeongsang Province, said at a news conference.",
      "Lee noted that the past week has shown how wildfires, fueled by dry and windy conditions, can quickly overwhelm the country\u2019s resources. He said he would request that the government establish better evacuation guidelines, adopt more powerful firefighting tools including aircraft equipped with water cannons, and adopt other approaches to improve firefighting efforts during nighttime hours.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t have the equipment for firefighting at night,\u201d Lee said. \u201cIn the night, firefighting is done solely with manual efforts, but with the increased density of our forests compared to the past, it\u2019s difficult to manage with just that.\u201d",
      "On Thursday, Lee Han-kyung, deputy head of the disaster response center, told a meeting that the wildfires showed \u201cthe reality of climate crisis that we have yet experienced,\u201d according to the Yonhap news agency.",
      "The people killed were mostly in their 60s or older. They include a pilot whose helicopter crashed during efforts to contain a fire Wednesday and four firefighters and other workers who died earlier after being trapped by fast-moving flames. Officials say older people found it difficult to evacuate quickly but have not provided details of the civilian dead.",
      "In Uiseong, about 20 of the 30 structures at the Gounsa temple complex, which is said to have been originally built in the 7th century, have burned. Among them were two state-designated \u201ctreasures\u201d: a pavilion overlooking a stream that dates to 1668, and a Joseon dynasty structure built in 1904 to mark the longevity of a king."

      "No details were provided on the length of the observation period nor what the king's side effects entailed. He has since returned to Clarence House, one of the royal residences in London.",
      "The monarch's engagements for Friday have been postponed as a result. Charles was scheduled to have four events in Birmingham that he is \"greatly disappointed\" to have to miss, according to the palace.",

      "North Korea sent an additional 3,000 troops to aid Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine this year, South Korea said Thursday, as Pyongyang\u2019s support appears to continue even as Moscow moves toward negotiations to end the conflict.",
      "The troop reinforcements were sent between January and February, bringing the total number of North Korean troops deployed to fight alongside the Russians to an estimated 11,000, South Korea\u2019s Joint Chiefs of Staff said in an assessment Thursday.",
      "Around 4,000 of them are \u201cbelieved to have been killed or injured,\u201d it said.",
      "Seoul\u2019s update came as Russia\u2019s security council chief Sergei Shoigu met with the North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Pyongyang last week, where he forwarded a message from Russian President Vladimir Putin. According to Russian state news agency TASS, Shoigu said they discussed security issues \u201cin different regions and on the Korean Peninsula in particular.\u201d",
      "Cooperation with North Korea continued even as Moscow and Kyiv agreed on a limited and temporary ceasefire, as the White House made shaky attempts in Saudi Arabia this week to broker a long-term deal. Both sides have already accused each other of violating the agreed-upon deal, which prohibits targeting energy infrastructure.",
      "The Ukraine military on Thursday said it shot down 42 drones launched by Russia toward various regions, including in the southern regions around Russian-annexed Crimea.",
      "It did not say if the drones targeted energy infrastructure.",
      "Separately, the Ukrainian emergency service said that at least 12 people were injured from a drone strike in Kharkiv on Wednesday.",
      "Meanwhile, European allies are expected to meet in Paris on Thursday to discuss aid for Ukraine and long-term peace, as U.S. support for Ukraine recedes under President Donald Trump.",
      "Beyond troops, Pyongyang has also continued to provide Moscow with munitions, Seoul has said. \u201cTo date, it is estimated that North Korea has supplied a substantial quantity of [short-range ballistic missiles], 170mm self-propelled guns, and about 220 240mm multiple rocket launchers,\u201d the Joint Chiefs of Staff said in the assessment.",
      "The volume of those weapons is also \u201cexpected to increase depending on battlefield developments,\u201d it added.",
      "North Korea\u2019s troops, widely considered disciplined and trained, nevertheless lack battlefield experience, which experts say is why they have suffered relatively high casualties from drone and artillery attacks.",
      "Still, Pyongyang\u2019s contribution is a further sign of deepening ties with the Kremlin, with which it signed a mutual defense treaty last year, elevating their status to that of formal allies. North Korea has receievd technical assistance from Russia for its satellite program, according to Seoul.",
      "U.S. officials and others say that North Korea may also be receiving support for its growing nuclear ambitions in return for its military support.",
      "It\u2019s against this backdrop that Kim is considering a visit to Moscow, and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov to Pyongyang.",
      "\u201cThe plans are big,\u201d Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Andrei Rudenko was quoted as saying Thursday by the Russian news agency Interfax, reflected in the high-level delegation Russia is considering sending to North Korea. \u201cWe will implement them.\u201d"
