      "The documentary \u201cJohn Candy: I Like Me,\u201d directed by Colin Hanks and produced by Ryan Reynolds, is a tribute not just to Candy the actor, but Candy, the man",
      "TORONTO -- TORONTO (AP) \u2014 \u201cI wish I had more bad things to say about him,\u201d Bill Murray says in the opening moments of the documentary \u201cJohn Candy: I Like Me.\u201d",
      "It has always been hard to find a negative word about Candy. The great Canadian comedian and actor not only radiated a warm, down-to-earth friendliness in movies like \u201cPlanes, Trains and Automobiles,\u201d \u201cUncle Buck\u201d and \u201cThe Great Outdoors,\u201d he was that way off screen, too. As Mel Brooks says in the film, \u201cHe was a total actor because he was a total person.\u201d",
      "\u201cJohn Candy: I Like Me,\u201d directed by Colin Hanks and produced by Ryan Reynolds, is a tribute not just to Candy the actor, but Candy, the man. On Thursday night, it premieres as the opening night film of the Toronto International Film Festival. For a beloved Canadian icon like Candy, whose nickname was \u201cJohnny Toronto,\u201d the setting could hardly be more fitting. To reference Candy\u2019s cameo in \u201cThe Blues Brothers,\u201d it\u2019s an occasion that calls for orange whips, all around.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t tell you the amount of meetings we had about when the movie can be made, and maybe we can do this festival or that,\u201d Hanks says. \u201cAnd I just kept thinking in the back of my mind: Well, this is a gigantic waste of time. It should just be at Toronto. Period. The End.\u201d",
      "\u201cJohn Candy: I Like Me,\u201d which will debut on Prime Video on Oct. 10, is a kind of cinematic eulogy for Candy, who died of heart failure at the age of 43 in 1994. Long ago as that was, \u201cI Like Me\u201d is the first feature documentary to tackle Candy, who might be even more popular three decades after his death.",
      "\u201cPart of me hates the fact that John maybe never really saw how beloved he was,\u201d Reynolds says. \u201cHe left something really lasting. He died of a heart failure and ironically the thing he left behind was his heart. That\u2019s the thing that stays.\u201d",
      "Hanks, Reynolds and Candy\u2019s children, Jennifer and Chris Candy, spoke in interviews before the TIFF opening about the making of \u201cJohn Candy: I Like Me,\u201d the title of which comes from one of Candy\u2019s most memorable lines from \u201cTrains, Planes and Automobiles.\u201d But it also serves as a guiding ethos to the documentary.",
      "Candy, who grew up in working-class Ontario and whose father also died young, had his own long-range struggles with that loss. He also, through a people-pleasing smile, dealt with the sometimes insensitive way his size was discussed in the media. Says Reynolds: \u201cHe was self-effacing his work, but not self-loathing. He didn\u2019t make a sport of punching down, not even on himself.\u201d",
      "\u201cHe left, but he did leave us some tools to get through this,\u201d says Chris Candy, 40, speaking alongside his 45-year-old sister. \u201cThat would be through the way he raised us and also saying it\u2019s OK to talk to someone if you have heavy feelings.\u201d",
      "For the Candys, \u201cI Like Me\u201d is an extremely emotional experience but one they\u2019re grateful for. They have each navigated their own way through an upbringing marked by their father\u2019s loss. It was years before Chris could visit his father\u2019s grave site or rewatch his movies. Once he did, he was astonished at his father\u2019s talent.",
      "For Jennifer, her father's movies helped carry her through grief.",
      "\u201cI jumped in and watched everything. All through college, I made sure I had the whole DVD collection,\u201d she says. \u201cFor me that was a constant reminder to hear his voice. We had cassette tapes of his \u2018Radio Kandy\u2019 show that I would just listen to all the time in the car during high school.\u201d",

      "Hanks, whose directorial work includes the 2015 documentary \u201cAll Things Must Pass: The Rise and Fall of Tower Records,\u201d wanted to find a thread for the film that went beyond tribute. To him, the movie is about drilling down on what gave Candy such an everyman quality. What made him, to millions, like their Uncle Buck. Hanks experienced Candy's effect firsthand as a child visiting his father, Tom Hanks, on the set of \u201cSplash.\u201d",
      "\u201cI have vivid memories of visiting on set. He was just one of my parents\u2019 friends, someone they worked with,\u201d says Hanks. \u201cHe had a way, even as a kid, of making you feel incredibly important.\u201d",

      "Reynolds, born and raised in Vancouver, has been a fan of Candy\u2019s since growing up watching \u201cSCTV\u201d reruns. His fondness for Candy, in many ways, has been an influence throughout his career.",
      "\u201cI feel like in the bigger movies I\u2019m always either Del Griffith or Neil Page, from \u201cPlanes, Trains,\u201d says Reynolds. \u201cI tend to really fluctuate back and forth between those guys.\u201d",
      "As his own fame grew, alongside with his ability to take some authorship of his films, Reynolds has populated his movies with references to Candy. Easter eggs adorn the \u201cDeadpool\u201d films. In one moment, he utters the \u201cI like me,\u201d albeit in a much different context. Reynolds had the prop department make a mug with the same quote. A Chrysler LeBaron appears in the background of another scene. He even licensed the book \u201cThe Canadian Mounted: A Trivia Guide to Planes, Trains\u201d so it could make a cameo in all the \u201cDeadpool\u201d movies.",

      "\u201cJohn was a good person when nobody was watching, and I think that\u2019s an increasingly scarce resource these days, in an age where everything is not only seen, it\u2019s perfection,\u201d Reynolds adds. \u201cIt\u2019s like an epidemic. All we see is perfection and curation. Nobody wants to try anything new because nobody\u2019s willing to suck at anything.\u201d",
      "For Jennifer and Chris, \u201cJohn Candy: I Like Me,\u201d awash in memories of their father,\u201d is a kind of time capsule that, like their dad's other movies and radio show recordings, will be long treasured.",

      "SAO PAULO -- Taylor Swift is very likely not aware of it, but she's considered a good luck charm for the Brazilian soccer team hosting Friday's game between the Kansas City Chiefs and Los Angeles Chargers.",
      "The unlikely connection between the pop superstar \u2014 whose fianc\u00e9 is Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce \u2014 and one of the most popular clubs in soccer-mad Brazil lies in the release date of her albums dating to 2006. Corinthians has gone unbeaten in all but one game played right before each album release since then and all but one right after.",
      "It all started as a joke about five years ago, but it has developed into a superstition for local fans.",
      "Until last year, Corinthians won 13 matches and drew seven in such instances. Some were against bitter rival Palmeiras and Brazilian social media was flooded with memes and montages of Swift wearing black and white \u2014 Corinthians' colors.",
      "Many Corinthians fans could have tossed their expectations after their team lost both the match prior to the release of \u201cThe Tortured Poets Department\u201d and the one following. But the NFL game in Sao Paulo, which could draw Swift to NeoQuimica Arena, has kept the Swiftie vibe alive among many local supporters.",
      "\u201cI laughed at first, but there\u2019s more coincidences. Taylor\u2019s first contract was signed on Sept. 1, that\u2019s the same day Corinthians was founded in 1910,\u201d said Rebeca Gois, 32, a marketing writer who lives near the stadium and is a Swift fan. \u201cIt has become a thing. Whenever there\u2019s a new album, we have a double joy; new Taylor songs and Corinthians unbeaten before and after that.\u201d",
      "That long run has encouraged Corinthians fans to think of the singer as an honorary supporter. Some have worn Swift costumes during games.",
      "Gavioes da Fiel, a Corinthians-linked samba school that parades in Sao Paulo's Carnival, jokingly invited Swift to join them in the festivities in 2022.",
      "Swift was in Brazil in 2012 to promote her album \u201cRed\u201d and then in 2023 with six concerts in Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo during the Eras Tour. She has yet to appear at Corinthians stadium.",
      "Nataly Nascimento, a hardcore Corinthians Swiftie, said the trend got a boost after Swift had all her three concerts in Sao Paulo at the Allianz Parque, the stadium of their archrival Palmeiras.",
      "\u201cPeople started to look for that connection to tease Palmeiras fans. And then Corinthians fans started finding those links,\u201d said Nascimento, a 25-year-old teacher who lives in Brazil's Northeast and won't attend. \u201cBut there's something bigger. In the same way that Corinthians fans are much more passionate about their club, Swifties feel that about Taylor. It is mystical.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- Patrick Hemingway, the last surviving child of Ernest Hemingway who was inspired by his father to spend years in Africa and later oversaw numerous posthumous works by the Nobel laureate, died Tuesday at age 97.",
      "Hemingway, the second of the author's three sons, died at his home in Bozeman, Montana, his grandson, Patrick Hemingway Adams, confirmed in a statement.",
      "\u201cMy grandfather was the real thing: a larger than life paradox from the old world; a consummate dreamer saddled with a scientific brain. He spoke half a dozen languages and solved complicated mathematical problems for fun, but his heart truly belonged to the written and visual arts,\u201d Adams said.",
      "While brother Gregory Hemingway had a deeply troubled relationship with his famous parent, Patrick Hemingway spoke proudly of his background and welcomed the chance to bring up the family name or get behind a project he thought could sell or attract critical attention. In the 2022 book \u201cDear Papa: The Letters of Patrick and Ernest Hemingway,\u201d father and son share stories of hunting and fishing and express mutual affection, with the author telling Patrick that \u201cI would rather fish with you and shoot with you than anybody that I have ever known since I was a boy and this is not because we are related.\u201d",
      "As an executor of his father's estate, Patrick Hemingway approved reissues of such classics as \"A Farewell to Arms\" and \"A Moveable Feast,\" featuring revised texts and additional commentary from the author\u2019s son and others. The estate also unsettled Hemingway admirers by expanding beyond books and offering a line of products that included clothing, eyewear, rugs and \"Papa's Pilar Rum.\"",
      "Patrick's most ambitious undertaking was the editing of \"True at First Light,\" a fictionalized account of Ernest Hemingway's time in Africa in the mid-1950s that the author left unfinished at the time of his death. Patrick assembled the 1999 release from some 800 pages of manuscripts, cutting the length by more than half. \"True at First Light\" was highly anticipated, but ended up disappointing readers and critics, some of whom faulted Patrick for exploiting the family name.",
      "Asked by NPR if he read his father's work, Patrick replied: \"Pretty often, because I have a commercial interest. ... I have to read it in order to be competent in the marketing of it and the management of it.\"",
      "Hemingway managed a long life in a family haunted by suicide and mental illness: Ernest Hemingway's father, Clarence, killed himself in 1928, and the author did the same in 1961. Gregory Hemingway suffered from alcoholism and depression and died in a jail cell in 2001 after being arrested for indecent exposure. Patrick's half-niece, the actor and model Margaux Hemingway, died from an overdose of phenobarbital in 1996. (Jack Hemingway, the eldest son, died in 2000).",
      "Inheriting his father\u2019s round face and stocky build, Patrick Hemingway was born in Kansas City, Missouri, to Ernest Hemingway and the second of his four wives, Pauline Pfeiffer. Because the author rarely stayed in one place for an extended time, the Hemingways lived everywhere from Cuba and Spain to Wyoming and Key West, Florida during Patrick\u2019s childhood (Ernest and Pauline divorced in 1940). Patrick Hemingway would recall his father\u2019s various \u201ctrophy mounts\u201d of animals hunted down on safari and how they were \u201ctastefully distributed throughout every room\u201d of their Key West house, including a wildebeest that hung in the bedroom of Patrick and Gregory.",

      "New York -- When songs top the charts, they become inescapable: Cross-genre hits are heard on the radio, on streaming, in lobbies and grocery stores. The artists who perform them become famous. But the people who wrote those earworms? Many do not.",
      "At least, that used to be the case.",
      "In the last few years, a new generation of songwriters has begun stepping into the spotlight. Muni Long has a successful R&B career; songwriter HARDY has done the same in the country music space. Julia Michaels writes big pop hits and records her own. Victoria Mon\u00e9t went from Grammy nominations as a songwriter and producer to taking home trophies as a solo artist. Amy Allen has become a household name following the ubiquity of her work with Sabrina Carpenter. The same could be said about \u00c9dgar Barrera, who has dominated Latin music as both a songwriter and producer.",
      "On Netflix, a new reality show, \u201cHitmakers,\u201d follows a group of songwriters as they ship off to writing camps to work on songs for John Legend, Shaboozey, Usher and Blackpink\u2019s Lisa.",
      "The industry has taken note, too. For the 2023 Grammys, a \u201csongwriter of the year\u201d award was created to spotlight the talents of those who write for others. That year\u2019s award went to Tobias Jesso Jr., for his songs for Harry Stiles, Adele, FKA Twigs and others. Theron Thomas won in 2024 and Allen in 2025.",
      "Here\u2019s how it happened.",
      "Why is there a buzz around songwriters now? The answer is challenging to pinpoint. Allen says she\u2019s noticed a shift in \u201cthe past six years,\u201d she told The Associated Press.",
      "\u201cI am so grateful that the general public is starting to take interest in the people behind the curtain of how music is made,\u201d Allen said. \u201cBut I think songwriters have kind of long gone without any type of visibility or recognition.\u201d",
      "She credits fans \u2013 modern music listeners \u2013 for driving attention to her and her colleagues and social media platforms like TikTok for some of this newfound interest. Online, dedicated fans are curious about the names behind their favorite songs, what Allen describes as a desire to \u201cconnect the dots \u2026 like they\u2019re trying to solve a murder mystery.\u201d",
      "PYNK BEARD, an emerging country music artist and a Grammy-award winning R&B songwriter under the moniker Sebastian Kole, agrees, but says that crate-digging behavior is reserved for \u201csuper fans.\u201d Algorithms, too, must be credited here: The exposure to other artists \u2014 including songwriters \u2014 emerges from listening to a playlist or online radio.",
      "Michaels says some of the credit goes to the artists they write for, who are making their collaborators known by name.",
      "\u201cI sometimes think songwriters are sort of the dishwater of the music industry. We get the short end of the stick a lot of the time. And so, it really comes down to artists\u2019 recognition of songwriters,\u201d she says. \u201cFor that to happen is really special. And I see it happen more and more nowadays. It\u2019s really great that songwriters are getting their flowers.\u201d",

      "But ultimately, it\u2019s not just a financial reality. Songwriters choosing to record their own music is just another expression of creative autonomy.",

      "Kim Novak has made an emotional return to the spotlight at 92",
      "VENICE, Italy -- VENICE, Italy (AP) \u2014 Kim Novak was worried she\u2019d made a mistake. The 92-year-old star of Alfred Hitchcock\u2019s \u201cVertigo\u201d had made the long trek from Oregon to Venice, Italy, for the film festival. There she\u2019d be receiving a lifetime achievement award and supporting the world premiere of a documentary about her life and career, \u201cKim Novak\u2019s Vertigo.\u201d",
      "But on that first day, she wasn\u2019t feeling strong or up to the task.",
      "\u201cI thought I could handle it, then I thought, no I can\u2019t, I\u2019m not physically strong enough,\u201d Novak told The Associated Press this week. \u201cThen I heard my mother\u2019s voice from heaven and she said \u2018just have fun and enjoy it.\u2019\u201d",
      "Novak listened to that voice and was glad she did. Being bipolar, she said, she\u2019s used to going through a lot of emotions. But the experience in Venice has been a dream.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s one of the very first events that I\u2019ve really had fun, really fun,\u201d she said.",
      "Earlier in the week, she was presented with a Golden Lion lifetime achievement award. Filmmaker Guillermo del Toro, who presented the honor, listed off many of her most famous credits, including \u201cVertigo,\u201d Otto Preminger\u2019s \u201cThe Man with the Golden Arm,\u201d Joshua Logan\u2019s \u201cPicnic,\u201d \u201cPal Joey\u201d and \u201cBell, Book and Candle.\u201d Novak was the top box-office star in the world from 1958 through 1960 and became the first woman to start her own production company before leaving Hollywood behind in 1966 to live a private life devoted to painting.",
      "\u201cMost impressive is the fact that she was capable of projecting frailty, power, mystery. To appear, endearing, dynamic, mythical and phenomenal,\u201d del Toro said. \u201cAnd with all those wonderful arresting performances, she always carried a little bit of warmth, a little bit of heartbreak and a little bit of mystery.\u201d",
      "Novak reflects on her extraordinary life in Alexandre O. Philippe\u2019s documentary, which premiered out of competition in Venice. She said it was fate that Philippe came into her life and wanted to make the film.",
      "\u201cI was at the point where I wanted to talk about my life, because I\u2019m at the end of my life,\u201d Novak said. \u201cIt was meant to be. And I can\u2019t think of anyone it was better to do it with.\u201d",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t even know my phone had voice memos,\u201d she laughed. \u201cIt\u2019s not always easy for me to open up and discuss the intimate things, but it was wonderful because it was like I was talking to myself. Once you open the door, it all comes flooding out.\u201d",
      "Coming to the festival was brave of Novak, Philippe said. Just over a decade ago, Novak stepped back in the public eye to present at the 2014 Oscars, which led many online, including Donald Trump, to insult her appearance.",
      "\u201cThe easy thing would have been to stay in Oregon and keep painting,\u201d he said. \u201cAt this point in her life the hard thing is to come back into the spotlight and show herself again. But she did the hard thing. And she came on stage, not as an icon, not as a movie star, but she came on stage and said \u2018I am you and you are me.\u2019\u201d",

      "\u201cIt\u2019s time at the end of your life to put the puzzle pieces together and make them fit,\u201d Novak said. \u201cIt\u2019s an incredible experience to see them all falling in place and somehow coming to this festival is like putting some of the other pieces that you couldn\u2019t put together that now come together and make a whole beautiful, beautiful, picture.\u201d",
      "Even the \u201cVertigo\u201d suit she once hated so much as taken on a different light. In the film, she gets to see the costume for the first time since making the film. The fabric that she remembered having been so rough and hard had softened with time, which seemed like an apt metaphor.",
      "\u201cThe opportunity to see it when you have all this life behind you, it makes you think that what you thought was right when you were young is not necessarily so. It could be wrong, and vice versa,\u201d she said. \u201cBut all this you gain over time. And so becoming old is a beautiful thing, you know? And this festival, being able to experience it through Hollywood eyes, it\u2019s just incredible. I loved it, I love it. I\u2019m experiencing great joy.\u201d",

      "\u201cWhat is sweeter in the world than appreciation,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel appreciated and you can\u2019t know how much that means.\u201d",
      "She\u2019s also looking forward to getting home and painting again. Every night at the festival she\u2019s found herself sketching and dreaming up ideas for more works.",
      "\u201cMy legacy is my art,\u201d she said. \u201cYou have my old movies, but you also have my new perspective on life. I do it all in my work and I want that to be my legacy. I want to get in a whole lot more paintings before I pass. So I can\u2019t wait to get back.\u201d",

      "TOKYO -- A three-hour film about the esoteric world of Kabuki is defying the odds at the Japanese box office, with tickets selling out at some cinemas.",
      "\u201cKokuho,\u201d which means \u201cnational treasure,\u201d has already grossed more than 10 billion yen ($68 million), making it the second-highest grossing Japanese live-action film of all time, and the first to achieve that in more than two decades.",
      "It stars heartthrobs Ryo Yoshizawa and Ryusei Yokohama who portray longtime rivals and soulmates. They are both Kabuki \u201connagata\u201d actors, meaning they specialize in women roles, from gorgeous princesses to damsels in distress.",
      "They look stunning, and convincing, having gone through months of training with a real Kabuki actor.",
      "Japan has submitted the film for the international feature category at the Academy Awards. The short list of the 15 films from which the final nominations come will be announced Dec. 16.",
      "\u201cKohuko\u201d got a favorable reception at the Cannes Film Festival. And it's been seen 7.4 million times in the first 73 days in Japanese theaters, many of them repeat viewers.",
      "The plot of \u201cKokuho\u201d \u2014 pronounced Koh-koo-hoe \u2014 explores perennial themes of family and the grueling hardships of being an artist, set to the backdrop of the intense but dreamlike life of the Kabuki actor.",
      "It also pays homage to old-style yakuza movies, as well as obliquely to Western gangster films, like \u201cThe Godfather,\u201d because one of the heroes is the son of a gangster.",
      "In short, it\u2019s not the kind of material that usually makes a hit movie in Japan, where action-packed blockbusters or animation based on popular manga comics or spectacular special effects have drawn audiences in the past.",
      "But the movie\u2019s theme explores something intrinsically Japanese and hit a raw nerve in a country where soul-searching about national pride is on the rise amid a widespread perception that economic and political clout is on the decline.",
      "Being an outsider was the theme that jumped out for tourism science scholar Yosuke Kon.",
      "\u201cThe Kabuki world seems very special, but a Kabuki kind of mentality exists in many places in Japan,\u201d he told The Associated Press, noting a closed mentality is prevalent in the village, as well as local governments he has worked with.",
      "\u201cMany people can relate to the film,\u201d he added.",
      "The film is dominated by stage scenes from Kabuki, an art form dating to the 17th century, which combines stylized dance and acting to live music. It\u2019s been stereotyped as catering to old people, as younger generations turn to Western and modern forms of entertainment like boys\u2019 bands, baseball games and streaming services.",
      "In Kabuki, all the roles are played by men, wearing thick makeup and elaborate kimono, delivering sing-song lines in tales of intrigue and violence set in the samurai era.",
      "The film shows the dazzling esoteric elements of Kabuki, such as the backstage where actors apply makeup with their fingertips, or the flutter of paper snowflakes or flower petals on the stage.",

      "Hiroyuki Okada, a teacher in the traditional \u201cikebana\u201d flower arrangement, said the film gave him a sense of satisfaction as though he had seen high quality theater, and that the characters seemed to represent light and darkness, or the Asian duality of \u201cyin and yang.\u201d",
      "\u201cI felt the work depicted a tasteful pursuit of madness,\u201d he said.",
      "The success of the film has sparked interest in the two-volume best-selling book by Shuichi Yoshida it is based on. Yoshida worked as a stagehand for several years to learn the workings of Kabuki.",

      "Lee was deeply moved to see people watching his film, glued to the screen. The scene was straight out of the movies, he recalled",
      "\u201cThere the barriers of generations were gone, living proof that everyone is searching for the moment that truly touches our emotions, knowing how beautiful those tears that flow for no reason can be,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cFilms are so wonderful.

      "The law would be the first of its kind in the U.S. and add another layer of abortion restrictions in Texas, which has some of the toughest in the country and already bans nearly all abortions.",
      "The bill now goes to Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, an abortion opponent who is expected to sign it into law. It would take effect in December, though it is nearly certain to spark legal challenges from abortion rights supporters.",
      "Supporters of the proposal, which passed a final vote in the GOP-controlled Texas Senate, call it a key tool to enforce the state's ban and protect women and fetuses. Opponents see it as not only another way to rein in abortion but intimidate providers outside Texas who are complying with the laws in their states. They also say it would encourage a form of vigilantism.",
      "Under the measure, Texas residents could sue those who manufacture, transport or provide abortion-inducing drugs to anyone in Texas for up to $100,000. Women who receive the pills for their own use would not be liable.",
      "Under the bill, providers could be ordered to pay $100,000. But only the pregnant woman, the man who impregnated her or other close relatives could collect the entire amount. Anyone else who sues could receive only $10,000, with the remaining $90,000 going to charity.",
      "Lawmakers also added language to address worries that women would be turned in for seeking to end pregnancies by men who raped them or abusive partners. For instance, a man who impregnated a woman through sexual assault would not be eligible.",
      "The measure has provisions that bar making public the identity or medical details about a woman who receives the pills.",

      "In the earlier law, citizens could collect $10,000 for bringing a successful lawsuit against a provider or anyone who helps someone obtain an abortion. But that measure didn\u2019t explicitly seek to go after out-of-state providers.",

      "The nonprofit APOPO has worked in Morogoro, Tanzania, for more than two decades to train African giant pouched rats for lifesaving missions",
      "MOROGORO, Tanzania -- A man lies unmoving, slumped in the rubble of a simulated earthquake, as an unlikely rescuer approaches: a rat with a backpack. Whiskers waving, the rat breezes past garbage, toppled furniture and scattered clothes to find him and pull a trigger on its pack, alerting searchers above.",
      "Then a resounding click. A survivor has been found. The search in Morogoro in Tanzania\u2019s Uluguru Mountains is over and the rat scurries out of the abandoned building to be rewarded with a banana. A successful mission is complete for this African giant pouched rat being trained for search and rescue operations.",
      "\u201cTheir sense of smell is incredible,\u201d said Fabrizio Dell\u2019Anna, an animal behaviorist at APOPO, a Tanzania-based nongovernmental organization that trains the rats for lifesaving applications. \u201cThese rats are able to detect explosives, tuberculosis \u2014 even tiny amounts of the bacteria \u2014 and in this project, they are able to correctly identify and indicate humans.\u201d",
      "In a field nearby, more rats walk on leashes held between handlers, pacing a grid filled with land mines as part of an initiative by APOPO, which works alongside Sokoine University of Agriculture. When they pause, it indicates that explosives are beneath. These rats are readying for their next deployment, perhaps Angola or Cambodia, where APOPO has helped clear more than 50,000 land mines since 2014.",
      "From detecting land mines to sniffing out tuberculosis, these \u201chero rats\u201d have become unlikely, and sometimes unrecognized, front-line responders in Tanzania and beyond.",
      "For decades APOPO has trained these \u201chero rats,\u201d which have one of the most sensitive noses in the animal kingdom. Since 2003, the rats have been finding land mines and, more recently, have been turned on to trafficked wildlife and earthquake survivors.",
      "The rats begin training shortly after birth for specific missions and, with a longer-than-average rodent life span of almost a decade, can spend years carrying out their work. The cost of training each rat runs around 6,000 euros ($6,990).",
      "It is all done with classical conditioning and positive reinforcement, explained Dell\u2019Anna, who oversees the search and rescue program. The first cohort of this group of specialized rats are already in Turkey with a partner search and rescue organization.",
      "While the rats focused on explosives or survivors buried in rubble get all the glory, it is a group of rats inside a lab that are arguably the most impactful lifesavers. These are not typical lab rats, but rather, as their proponents would argue, one of the world\u2019s most effective detectors of tuberculosis.",
      "\u201cEvery day as many people die from TB as from land mines in a whole year,\u201d said Christophe Cox, the CEO of APOPO. \u201cIt\u2019s more spectacular to be on the minefield \u2026 but for TB \u2026 in terms of social impact, it\u2019s tremendous.\u201d",
      "Tuberculosis is an ancient respiratory disease that continues to run rampant despite centuries of research and treatment. The World Health Organization said last October in its most recent TB report that the disease had resurged as the top infectious disease killer, with 1.25 million deaths and a record 8.2 million infections in 2023.",
      "In sub-Saharan Africa, only about half of TB patients receive a diagnosis, according to a study by researchers in the UK and Gambia published in the National Library of Medicine, and this leaves them liable to spread the disease. Tanzania struggles with one of the highest global TB burdens, according to the WHO.",
      "APOPO expanded into TB detection in 2007 and its rats have been deployed in Tanzania, Ethiopia and Mozambique. The group works with 80 hospitals in Tanzania, collecting samples daily and bringing them to the lab rats.",
      "With their sensitive noses, the rats sniff out samples of sputum from patients, looking for positive TB cases that had been marked as negative. Research suggests the rats are picking up on six unique volatile organic compounds in positive TB samples, said Cox.",
      "False negatives remain a persistent issue in TB detection and suppression because each infected person can spread the disease to 10 to 15 more people each year.",
      "\u201cThe benefits of using rats are significant,\u201d said Felista Stanesloaus, a doctor at a TB clinic in Morogoro. \u201cThey help us detect cases that might otherwise be missed, which prevents people from unknowingly spreading infections.\u201d",

      "TB detection has made significant advances in recent years, including using artificial intelligence tools in conjunction with lung scans. However, many areas that are burdened most by TB, such as rural villages or low-income urban communities, do not have access to these tools.",
      "While the use of molecular detection devices, such as one called GeneXpert, have become more widespread, a clinic may only have one of these devices and it can take two hours to process a sample. Overburdened clinics turn to the centuries-old technique of microscopy, or investigation of sputum under a microscope, which is both fallible and time-consuming.",
      "\u201cHuman error may result in a person being told they are disease-free when they are not,\u201d said Stanesloaus. \u201cUsing rats is a very effective initiative.\u201d",
      "APOPO\u2019s rats can scan 100 samples in 20 minutes, and since the program's inception, the rats have been able to identify more than 30,000 patients who had been sent home with a clean bill of health but were actually carrying TB, said Cox. The NGO is able to do with one lab what 55 hospitals do in a day, he adds.",
      "Yet using live animals in the place of medical devices poses challenges, especially when it comes to scale. Samples have to be brought directly to a lab with enough trained rats to conduct the detection, with some samples brought to Morogoro by motorbike each day. Operations are most effective in dense urban centers, like Dar es Salaam, Cox said.",
      "The more existential challenge for these \u201chero rats\u201d comes from regulators and a wider health community who doubt this unconventional method of disease detection.",
      "APOPO\u2019s rats are not classified as primary diagnostic tools by the WHO. Instead, they are a second line of defense. Any positive samples detected by the rats must be confirmed with human microscopy in APOPO\u2019s labs before treatment can be administered.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a big challenge,\u201d said Cox. \u201cNot being recognized by the WHO means that the mainstream funding for TB \u2026 never reaches us.\u201d",
      "Cox has given up on the prospect of getting approval from the WHO, though APOPO has faced pressure from donors to go through this process, which would be extensive and rigorous with no guarantee of success.",

      "KOSTIANTYNIVKA, Ukraine -- For many residents of Ukraine\u2019s eastern Donetsk region, evacuation begins with one defining blast \u2014 the explosion that makes it impossible to stay. For 69-year-old Tetiana Zaichikova, it came when a strike reduced her home to rubble.",
      "The region has been the epicenter of heavy fighting for years and evacuations there have continued as long as Russia\u2019s invasion \u2014 more than three years. Town after town in the region, larger than Slovenia or roughly the size of Massachusetts, is emptying amid the fighting as Russian forces now control around 70% of the area.",
      "Some are staying in shattered cities, clinging to the hope that the war will end any day \u2014 a hope fueled by ongoing peace efforts, largely led by U.S. President Donald Trump, that so far yielded no breakthroughs. They hold on until it becomes too dangerous even for the military and police to drive into the city.",
      "\u201cWe kept hoping. We waited for every round of negotiations. We thought somehow they would reach an agreement in our favor, and we could stay in our homes,\u201d said Zaichikova, who still bears bruises and hematomas across her face.",
      "If Zaichikova had taken even one step into the kitchen that night, she is convinced she would not have survived.",
      "In Kostiantynivka \u2014 a city that once had a population of approximately 67,000 \u2014 conditions in recent months have become apocalyptic: There is no reliable electricity, water or gas, and nightly barrages grow heavier with each passing hour. Russian forces fire all types of weapons while Ukrainian troops answer back, and the former industrial hub has become a proving ground crowded with drones overhead.",
      "Zaichikova knew the city was barely livable, but she clung to the hope she would not lose the place where she had lived all her life and taught music at a kindergarten.",
      "On the night of Aug. 28, after months of rarely leaving her home, she wanted only to make tea before bed. She switched on a night lamp and walked toward the kitchen. As she reached for the light switch, the blast hit.",
      "A wooden beam and shelves collapsed on her. When she came to, the rubble rose as high as she stood. The entrance to her building was blocked.",
      "Emergency services no longer operated in the city, too dangerous even for soldiers. \u201cIf we had been burning, we would have just burned,\u201d she said.",
      "Her neighbor swung a sledgehammer through the night until midday, finally breaking a hole for her to crawl through. Outside, she saw what she believed was the crater of a glide bomb.",
      "A few days later, she left the city.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t want to leave until the last moment, but that was the last straw. When I was driven through the city, I saw what it had become. It was black and destroyed,\u201d she said.",

      "India\u2019s clean energy appetite is helping the country\u2019s solar power industry wean itself off imported Chinese parts and continue growing even as it faces a tougher sell to its biggest foreign customer, the United States",
      "JAIPUR, India -- On the edge of Jaipur, an Indian city known for its colorful bazaars and palaces, a bustling industrial complex is the epicenter of the country's push to compete with China in making components for solar technology.",
      "India, the world's most populous nation, is jockeying for market share against the global leader in solar in part by selling to its own citizens, which helps the country with its other goal: meeting growing domestic demand for electricity.",
      "In the government-subsidized zone that provides tax breaks, solar manufacturer ReNew's sprawling factory makes enough modules to produce 4 gigawatts of power each year \u2014 equivalent to the energy needed for approximately 2.5 million Indian homes. The 2-year-old facility that employs nearly 1,000 people serves as a symbol of the solar industry\u2019s momentum. India\u2019s capacity to build key solar components more than doubled in the fiscal year ending in March.",
      "\u201cWhen I got this opportunity, I was really happy that I was directly contributing to the clean energy transition,\u201d said Monisha, an engineer at ReNew who goes by one name. She said the work has helped her become independent and assist her family with their finances.",
      "The country still faces a steep climb in its efforts to develop solar manufacturing that could one day rival China, which makes more than 80% of all solar components in the world and supplies key materials to Indian manufacturers.",
      "India's solar industry must also contend with a tougher sell to its biggest foreign customer, the United States. President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs of 50% on Indian goods took effect last month, while Trump\u2019s administration and Republican lawmakers have taken other steps to hinder U.S. adoption of solar and other clean energy.",
      "Still, India's clean energy appetite is helping its solar manufacturers deal with the external pressures. Energy analysts said India's domestic demand for solar power will likely reduce disruption from tariffs imposed by the U.S., where about a third of the solar panels produced by India were sold in a recent fiscal year. Proceeds from selling in the lucrative U.S. market have helped Indian solar manufacturers update their supply chains in recent years so they were less dependent on imported Chinese parts and materials.",
      "While Indian solar manufacturers can sell at higher prices abroad, ambitious domestic clean energy targets and domestic demand will help them find buyers within India if sales in the U.S. slow, analysts said.",
      "\u201cThis is a huge industry that can absorb these modules and cells that are being produced. We are not necessarily as export dependent as other countries are,\u201d said Charith Konda, an energy analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.",
      "India's domestic solar market has already helped Hyderabad-based Vega Solar shift its customer base for off-grid solar modules for RVs, electric fences and other uses to customers in India in the years since the COVID-19 pandemic, said Vinay Keesara, a company director.",
      "\u201cBefore the pandemic, 90% of my business was exports and 10% used to be domestic supply, now this has just flipped the other way around,\u201d he said.",
      "One of the most carbon-polluting countries, India is making huge efforts to harness the power of the sun and other clean energy sources. The cost of solar power \u2014 now half that of new coal-powered plants \u2014 and India's many sunny days are reasons that experts said installed solar power increased 30 times in the last decade.",
      "Before the U.S. tariffs were announced, researchers with IEEFA and Gurugram, India-based JMK Research wrote that India's demand for solar modules during the next two years could exceed what its manufacturers are selling within the country because so many are being exported. India has also been importing solar modules from China.",
      "Konda said it was too early to determine how the U.S. tariffs will affect Indian solar manufacturers, but that the impact won\u2019t be felt for at least another year because solar component orders are placed well in advance. And uncertainty remains over the fate of all of Trump's tariffs. Despite a U.S. court ruling against Trump\u2019s tariffs, they remain in place until at least October while his administration files appeals.",
      "India has nearly 170 gigawatts of renewable energy projects in the pipeline \u2014 most of which are solar \u2014 and are expected to be completed in the next few years. The country also has an ambitious clean energy target of 500 gigawatts by 2030.",
      "Government policies restricting imports of solar components, incentives for solar manufacturers and mandates for solar power producers to purchase material from government-approved sources gave Indian companies the right signals to ramp up solar manufacturing, said Sanjay Verghese, ReNew\u2019s group president for solar manufacturing and solar projects.",

Government data showed India imported $1.3 billion worth of solar cells and modules from China in the first quarter of the year, down by more than one-third from the same period a year earlier.

      "The Ukrainian government has declared that a branch of the Orthodox Church has failed to sever its longstanding ties with Moscow \u2014 and could soon be banned.",
      "The looming ban affects one of the two rival branches of Orthodoxy in the country and further underscores the turbulent role of religion as Ukraine fends off the Russian invasion. Orthodoxy is the majority religion in both Russia and Ukraine and has served as a cultural and spiritual battleground in tandem with the wider war.",
      "The action comes a year after the Ukrainian Parliament passed a law banning the Moscow-based Russian Orthodox Church due to its strong support of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.",
      "The law also authorized banning any organization tied to the Russian church. A government investigation into the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, with its centuries-old ties to Moscow, soon followed.",
      "The UOC denounced the full-blown Russian invasion from the start in 2022. It declared its independence from the Moscow church the same year and reiterated that stance in 2025.",
      "Even so, the government says the UOC has refused to take necessary steps, such as revising its governing documents, to complete that separation.",
      "The Aug. 27 government action, while long in the works, still requires more legal processes to take full effect.",
      "The government has petitioned a court to ban the activities of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church itself. The church, if it loses, would have the right to one appeal to a higher court before the case is finalized \u2014 a process that could be completed in months, its lawyer said.",
      "The finding that the UOC is Moscow-linked was published by the State Service of Ukraine on Ethnopolitics and Freedom of Conscience, a government entity known by its Ukrainian-language acronym DESS.",
      "Under the law, some UOC congregations could also find themselves barred from using property they don\u2019t own \u2014 a significant issue in a country where the state owns and leases out many historic church sites.",
      "The order specifically targets the \u201cKyiv Metropolis\u201d of the UOC \u2014 which is essentially the governing center. It is led by Metropolitan Onufry, a bishop whose citizenship Ukraine has already revoked. Under the law, UOC-related entities such as monasteries and regional eparchies (comparable to dioceses) could face similar sanctions.",
      "The UOC declared in 2022 that it was independent from Moscow and began taking ritually potent steps to underscore that split, such as refusing to commemorate Moscow Patriarch Kirill in its liturgies. Kirill is an avid supporter of the Russian invasion. He presided over a 2024 council that called it a holy war.",
      "Earlier this year, the DESS called on the UOC to take further steps to show its complete separation from Moscow. That included any documentation that it objected to the Russian church taking control of the UOC\u2019s churches in Russian-occupied territories.",

      "Pope Leo XIV will preside over his first canonization ceremony Sunday to create the first millennial saint",
      "CHICAGO -- At a Catholic school in Pope Leo XIV\u2019s hometown, fifth graders read comic books about Carlo Acutis' life entitled \u201cDigital Disciple.\u201d They draw pictures of what the teenage Italian computer whiz might have had as his cellphone wallpaper. They discuss the miracles that allegedly occurred thanks to Acutis' intercession.",
      "In the run-up to Acutis' canonization Sunday, it is all Acutis, all the time at the Blessed Carlo Acutis Parish and school in Chicago. The parish was the first in the United States to take its name from Acutis, who died in 2006 at age 15 and is about to become history's first millennial saint.",
      "In recent years, Acutis has shot to near rockstar-like fame among many young Catholics, generating a global following the likes of which the Catholic Church hasn\u2019t seen in ages. Much of that popularity is thanks to a concerted campaign by the Vatican to give the next generation of faithful a relatable, modern-day role model, who used his technological talents to spread the faith.",
      "He\u2019s not a world figure like Mother Teresa or St. John Paul II, but rather a \u201csaint next door,\u201d said the Rev. Ed Howe, the pastor at Blessed Carlo Acutis Parish in Chicago\u2019s Northwest Side. \u201cHe\u2019s someone who I think a lot of young people today say, \u2018I could be the saint next door.'\"",
      "Leo, a Chicago native, will declare Acutis a saint Sunday in his first canonization ceremony, alongside another popular Italian, Pier Giorgio Frassati. Both ceremonies had been scheduled for earlier this year but were postponed following the death in April of Pope Francis.",
      "It was Francis who had fervently willed the Acutis sainthood case forward, convinced that the church needed someone like him to attract young Catholics to church while addressing the promises and perils of the digital age.",
      "Acutis was precociously savvy with computers before the social media era, reading college-level textbooks on programming and coding as a youngster. But he limited himself to an hour of video games a week, apparently deciding long before TikTok that human relationships were far more important than virtual ones.",
      "\u201cCarlo was well aware that the whole apparatus of communications, advertising and social networking can be used to lull us, to make us addicted to consumerism and buying the latest thing on the market,\u201d Francis wrote in a 2019 document. \u201cYet he knew how to use the new communications technology to transmit the Gospel, to communicate values and beauty.\u201d",
      "Leo inherited the Acutis cause, but he too has pointed to technology \u2014 especially artificial intelligence \u2014 as one of the main challenges facing humanity.",
      "For his admirers, Acutis was an ordinary kid who did extraordinary things, a typical Milan teen who went to school, played soccer and loved animals. But he also brought food to the poor, attended Mass daily and got his less-than-devout parents back to church.",
      "\u201cWhen I read his story for the first time, it was just like shocking to me because from a very early age he was just really drawn to Jesus Christ and he would go to Mass all the time,\u201d said Sona Harrison, an 8th grader at the St. John Berchmans\u2019 school, which is part of the Acutis parish. \u201cI feel like he\u2019s a lot more relatable and I definitely feel like I\u2019m closer to God when I read about him.\u201d",
      "Acutis earned the nickname \u201cGod\u2019s Influencer\u201d because he used technology to spread the faith. His most well-known tech legacy is the website he created about so-called Eucharistic miracles, available in nearly 20 different languages. The site compiles information about the 196 seemingly inexplicable events over the history of the church related to the Eucharist, which the faithful believe is the body of Christ.",
      "Acutis was known to spend hours in prayer before the Eucharist each day, a practice known as Eucharistic adoration.",
      "\u201cThis was the fixed appointment of his day,\u201d his mother, Antonia Salzano, said in a documentary that was airing Friday night at the U.S. seminary in Rome.",
      "Acutis was born on May 3, 1991, in London to Salzano and Andrea Acutis \u2014 a wealthy but not particularly observant Catholic family. They moved back to Milan soon after he was born and he enjoyed a typical, happy childhood, albeit marked by his increasingly intense religious devotion.",
      "In October 2006, at age 15, he fell ill with what was quickly diagnosed as acute leukemia. Within days he was dead. He was entombed in Assisi, which known for its association with another popular saint, St. Francis.",

Those who can\u2019t make it in person can watch the comings and goings on a webcam pointed at his tomb, a level of Internet accessibility not afforded to even popes buried in St. Peter\u2019s Basilica.",
      "Kathleen Sprows Cummings, a history professor at the University of Notre Dame, said Acutis\u2019 enormous popularity was clearly the result of a concerted church campaign, pushed strongly by his grief-stricken mother. But she said that is nothing new, and that in the 2,000-year history of the church, saints have very often been pushed ahead to respond to a particular need at a particular time.",
      "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t detract from the holiness of the person being honored to say that there are choices that are made,\u201d about which cases move forward, she said in a telephone interview.",
      "Sprows Cummings said the Acutis phenomenon caught on because he is attractive to both young people and the institutional church, because he used technology in a positive way to spread his profound belief in Eucharistic miracles at a time when many Catholics don\u2019t believe that Christ is truly present in the Eucharist.",
      "\u201cCanonization is about marketing,\u201d said Sprows Cummings, author of \u201cA Saint of Our Own: How the Quest for a Holy Hero Helped Catholics become American.\u201d \u201cWhich stories are going to get told? Who is going to get remembered through this amazingly efficient way of remembering holy people?\u201d",
      "Acutis and his story are ever-present here. During Mass this week ahead of the canonization, students processed into the chapel under an Acutis banner carrying things he might have had: a soccer ball, laptop and knapsack. Howe, the parish pastor and priest of the Congregation of the Resurrection, pulled items out of the knapsack to explain Acutis' story to the youngest students seated up front: A can of food he might have given to a homeless person, a set of Rosary beads he might have prayed with.",
      "The message landed.",
      "\u201cHe fed the poor, he cared for the poor,\u201d said 9-year-old David Cameron, who called Acutis \u201ca great man.\u201d Cameron, a fan of Sonic, Minecraft and Halo, also found inspiration in Acutis' love of video games, and awe at his restraint.",

      "The analysis by World Weather Attribution, or WWA, said the weather conditions were about 30% more intense compared to the preindustrial era, when heavy reliance on fossil fuels began.",
      "Hundreds of wildfires in the Iberian Peninsula broke out in July and August. They spread rapidly thanks to temperatures that pushed above 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) and strong winds.",

The stone Hajar Mountains separate it from neighboring Oman. Along the southern borders of the peninsula, monsoon rains can hit seaside areas of Oman and Yemen. But the vast desert stretch of the peninsula, known as the Empty Quarter, has a weather pattern that keeps the clouds out.",
      "That means little to no rain, sometimes for years at a time in some areas. For the Emirates, that has meant relying heavily on some 70 water desalination plants to supply drinking water, as well as drip irrigation for plants that can rely on recycled wastewater. Dams have also been built in recent years to catch and store water runoff.",
      "Even then, the UAE ranks seventh worldwide for being at risk for water scarcity, according to the World Resources Institute. Groundwater reservoirs have been known to be under pressure for years. The UAE also has been \u201ccloud seeding\u201d for years, flying aircraft to release chemicals into clouds to try to induce rains.",
      "\u201cWater is more important than oil,\u201d Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the leader of the UAE and ruler of Abu Dhabi, reportedly said back in 2011.",
      "That's particularly true in Dubai, where its booming population strains its roadways. The government-owned utility, the Dubai Electricity and Water Authority, reported producing 683.7 billion liters (180.6 billion gallons) of water last year alone through desalination, with water demand continuing to grow alongside the city-state.",
      "Yet Emirati government statistics suggest residents use around 550 liters (145 gallons) of water per day, which is among some of the highest usage around the world.",
      "But for all the fascination with rain, there's fear now as well for many after the April 2024 floods that swept across Dubai. In one day, more rain fell than ever recorded since 1949, when the officials in what became the UAE first began taking statistics.",
      "More than 142 millimeters (5.59 inches) of rainfall had soaked Dubai over 24 hours. An average year sees 94.7 millimeters (3.73 inches) of rain at Dubai International Airport, the world's busiest for international travel.",

      "The eastern Mediterranean and Middle East are in the grips of one of their worst droughts in decades, which is drying rivers and lakes, shriveling crops and even leading to water cutoffs in major cities",
      "DAMASCUS, Syria -- The worst drought in decades is gripping much of the Eastern Mediterranean and Middle East, drying out rivers and lakes, shriveling crops and leading to dayslong tap water cutoffs in major cities.",
      "The situation is particularly dire in Syria, where experts say rainfall has been declining for decades and where the fledgling government is trying to stitch the country back together following a 14-year civil war that left millions impoverished and reliant on foreign aid.",
      "Small-farmer Mansour Mahmoud al-Khatib said that during the war, he couldn't reach his fields in the Damascus suburb of Sayyida Zeinab some days because militants from the Lebanese Hezbollah militia allied with then-President Bashar Assad would block the roads. That problem vanished when Hezbollah withdrew after Assad fell in a December rebel offensive, but the drought has devastated his farm, drying up the wells that irrigate it.",
      "\u201cThe land is missing the water,\u201d al-Khatib told The Associated Press recently as he watched workers feed the wheat he did manage to harvest into a threshing machine. \u201cThis season is weak \u2014 you could call it half a season. Some years are better and some years are worse, but this year is harsh.\u201d",
      "In a good year, his land could produce as much as 800 to 900 kilograms (1,764 to 1,984 pounds) of wheat per dunam, an area equal to 0.1 hectares and 0.25 acres. This year, it yielded about a quarter that much, he said. He hired only six or seven workers this harvest season instead of last year\u2019s 15.",
      "Because the drought followed a prolonged war, farmers who were already financially stretched have had little ability to cope with its effects, said Jalal Al Hamoud, national food security officer for the U.N.\u2019s Food and Agriculture Organization in Syria.",
      "Before the uprising-turned-civil war that began in 2011, Syrian farmers produced an average of 3.5 million to 4.5 million tons of wheat per year, which was enough to meet the country\u2019s domestic needs, according to Saeed Ibrahim, director of agricultural planning and economics in Syria\u2019s Agriculture Ministry.",
      "That annual yield dropped to 2.2 million to 2.6 million tons during the war, and in recent years, the government has had to import 60% to 70% of its wheat to feed its roughly 23 million people. This year's harvest is expected to yield only 1 million tons, forcing the country to spend even more of its strained resources on imports.",
      "Mudar Dayoub, a spokesperson for Syria's Ministry of Internal Trade and Consumer Protection, said this year\u2019s wheat crop will only last for two or three months and that the government is \"currently relying on signing contracts to import wheat from abroad\u201d and on donations, including from neighboring Iraq.",
      "But in a country where the World Food Program estimates that half the population is food-insecure, Ibrahim warned that \u201ctotal reliance on imports and aid threatens food security\u201d and is \u201cunsustainable.\u201d",
      "The drought isn't the only major issue facing Syria, where postwar reconstruction is projected to cost hundreds of billions of dollars. Since Assad fled, the country has been rattled by outbreaks of sectarian violence, and there's growing doubt about whether the new authorities will be able to hold it together. Without jobs or stability, millions of refugees who fled during the war are unlikely to come home.",
      "A dam on the Litani River in neighboring Lebanon's fertile Bekaa Valley forms Lake Qaraoun, a reservoir that spans about 12 square kilometers (4.6 square miles).",

      "This summer, after an unusually dry winter left Lebanon without the water reserves its usually banks through snow and rainfall, it has shrunk to the size of a pond, surrounded by a vast expanse of parched land.",
      "Although an average of 350 million cubic meters (12.4 billion cubic feet) of water flows into the lake during the rainy season each year, meeting about one-third of Lebanon's annual demand, this year the incoming water didn't exceed 45 million cubic meters (1.6 billion cubic feet), he said.",

      "\u201cThere is no compensation for the loss of crops,\" Haj Salah said. \"And you know the farmers make just enough to get by.\"",
      "Mostafa Summaq, director of water resources in Idlib province, said the groundwater dropped by more than 10 meters (33 feet) in three months in some monitoring wells, which he attributed to farmers overpumping due to a lack of rain. Local officials are considering installing metered irrigation systems, but it would be too expensive to do without assistance, he said.",
      "Most experts agree that Syria and the broader region appear headed toward worse climate shocks, which they aren't prepared to absorb.",
      "Climate change makes some regions wetter and others drier, and the Middle East and Mediterranean are among those that are drying out, said Matti Kummu, a professor at Aalto University in Finland who specializes in global food and water issues. Syria, specifically, has shown a trend of reduced rainfall over the past 40 years, while it has been using water at an unsustainable rate.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s not enough water from rainfall or from snowmelt in the mountains to recharge the groundwater,\u201d Kummu said. Due to increasing irrigation needs, he said, \"the groundwater table is going lower and lower, which means that it\u2019s less accessible and requires more energy (to pump).\" At some point, the groundwater might run out.",

      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- Ned is a perfectly nice snail. If he had a dating profile, it might read: good listener, stable home, likes broccoli, seeks love.",
      "But he\u2019s already exhausted his local options and it\u2019s not because he\u2019s picky or unappealing. Instead, he\u2019s a common garden snail with an uncommon anatomical problem that\u2019s ruining his love life.",

      "That dire prospect prompted a New Zealand nature lover who found the snail in her garden in August to launch a campaign to find his perfect match. But Ned\u2019s quest for true love, perhaps predictably, is slow.",
      "Giselle Clarkson was weeding her home vegetable patch in Wairarapa on the North Island when a snail tumbling out of the leafy greens caught her eye. Clarkson, the author and illustrator of a nature book, \u201cThe Observologist,\u201d has an affection for snails and had long been on the lookout for a sinistral, or left-coiled shell.",
      "\u201cI knew immediately that I couldn\u2019t just toss the snail back into the weeds with the others,\u201d she said. Instead, she sent a photo of the snail, pictured alongside a right-coiled gastropod as proof, to her colleagues at New Zealand Geographic.",
      "The magazine launched a nationwide campaign to find a mate for Ned, named for the left-handed character Ned Flanders in \u201cThe Simpsons,\u201d who once opened a store called The Leftorium. That explains the male pronouns some use for Ned, although snails are hermaphrodites with sex organs on their necks and the capacity for both eggs and sperm.",
      "\u201cWhen you have a right-coiling snail and a left-coiling snail, they can\u2019t slide up and get their pieces meeting in the right position,\u201d Clarkson said. \u201cSo a lefty can only mate with another lefty.\u201d",
      "The fact that romantic hopefuls need not be a sex match should have boosted Ned\u2019s prospects. But his inbox has remained empty except for photos of \u201coptimistically misidentified right-coiling snails,\" Clarkson said.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve had lots of enthusiasm and encouragement for Ned, a lot of people who can relate and really want the best for them, as a symbol of hope for everyone who\u2019s looking for love,\u201d she said. \u201cBut as yet, no lefties have been forthcoming.\u201d",
      "Ned\u2019s relatable romantic woes have attracted global news coverage, but New Zealand\u2019s strict biosecurity controls mean long-distance love probably isn\u2019t on the cards. Other left-coiled snails have gotten lucky through public campaigns to find mates before, however, so Clarkson remains optimistic.",

      "It was a fascinating chance for scientists to investigate what produces left-coiled snails, with the cause most likely a rare genetic mutation. Studies of snail farms in Europe prompted researchers to estimate about 1 in every 40,000 snails is a lefty.",

      "The presiding judge ruled late Wednesday night that Ibtissam Lachgar was guilty of violating part of Morocco\u2019s criminal code that outlaws offending the monarchy or Islam because of messages on a T-shirt she wore in a selfie posted online, her attorney Na\u00efma El Guellaf told The Associated Press. Lachgar was charged with blasphemy and with disseminating the image online.",
      "One of the attorneys told AP they plan to appeal the conviction.",
      "\u201cNot only is this verdict unjust, but it also threatens the freedom of speech and opinion,\u2033 Hamid Sikouk of the Moroccan Association of Human Rights told the AP.",
      "At Wednesday\u2019s hearing, Lachgar, wearing a headscarf and appearing fatigued, told the judge she had no intention of offending Islam. She argued that the T-shirt she wore reflected a political message and bore a slogan long used against sexist ideologies and violence toward women.",
      "Her defense team argued that the online post did not constitute an offense to Islam.",
      "\u201cGod is not only for Muslims, but also for Christians and Jews. I don\u2019t see any offense to Islam in that publication,\u201d lawyer El Guellaf told the court. \u2018\u2019I am Muslim myself, and I don\u2019t feel offended by it.''",

      "Long known for provocative activism, Lachgar, 50, is a psychologist and co-founder of the Alternative Movement for Individuals Freedoms, known by its French acronym MALI. She is an outspoken and vocal defender of rights for women and LGBTQ communities in Morocco.",
      "Her arrest polarized public opinion across Morocco. Some see it as a valid response to provocation and others view it as a violation of democracy and freedom of speech. Though the country is politically moderate compared to others in the Middle East and North Africa, same-sex relations are illegal and certain kinds of speech can bring criminal charges.",
      "Lachgar has called for decriminalizing sex outside of marriage, which remains illegal. She also made headlines more than a decade ago when she organized a demonstration outside Morocco\u2019s parliament, where couples kissed to support two teenagers facing indecency charges after posting a photo of themselves kissing on Facebook.",

      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit left the tariffs in place for now, but the administration nevertheless called on the high court to intervene quickly in a petition filed electronically late Wednesday and provided to The Associated Press.

      "But the stakes are also high for small businesses battered by tariffs and uncertainty, said Jeffrey Schwab, senior counsel and director of litigation at the Liberty Justice Center.",
      "\u201cThese unlawful tariffs are inflicting serious harm on small businesses and jeopardizing their survival. We hope for a prompt resolution of this case for our clients,\u201d he said.",
      "The businesses have twice prevailed, once at a federal court focused on trade and again with the appeals court's 7-4 ruling.",
      "Their lawsuit is one of several challenging the tariffs and erratic rollout that have shaken global markets, alienated U.S. trading partners and allies and raised fears of higher prices and slower economic growth.",
      "But Trump has also used the levies to pressure the European Union, Japan and other countries into accepting new trade deals. Revenue from tariffs totaled $159 billion by late August, more than double what it was at the same point the year before.",

      "Colford, who retired from the AP in 2017, died Aug. 26 after a fall the previous month turned a long struggle with Parkinson's disease into a rapid decline, said his wife, Anne LaBate. Despite his health problems, he was working even in recent months on his third book, about a notorious figure from his hometown of Jersey City, New Jersey.",
      "During a decade as AP's director and ultimately vice president of media relations, Colford was known for his sage, unflappable handling of the news cooperative's dealings with other media outlets, from requests for interviews with its journalists to inquiries about its practices.",
      "\u201cPaul was both graceful and tough and believed completely in the AP\u2019s journalists and their mission. That was important during some pretty tough moments, particularly when an AP journalist was hurt or worse,\" said Kathleen Carroll, who was the news service's executive editor from 2002 to 2016. She recalled Colford as \u201ca talented and classy colleague\u201d who loved journalism.",
      "Colford knew the media ecosystem from the inside out and the outside in, having been a media reporter and columnist for the Daily News of New York, Newsday and the former New York Newsday. He covered magazines, book publishing, newspapers' digital evolution and the new media of the dot-com era. Reporting on the radio landscape as conservative talk rose to prominence, Colford penned unauthorized biographies of Rush Limbaugh and shock jock Howard Stern.",
      "\u201cHe just was indefatigable,\u201d said longtime Newsday TV writer and critic Verne Gay, a colleague and friend of Colford's. \u201cHe vacuumed everything up. He knew everything and everybody. And he constantly broke stories on the beat.... I was just in awe of him.\"",
      "Born Sept. 24, 1953, in Jersey City, Colford grew up there with seven siblings and graduated in 1975 from St. Peter's University. He spent part of his college years studying in Turin, Italy, and still spoke Italian in phone calls with friends from that time, his wife said.",

      "The relationship fizzled, Colford went on to New York Newsday and later the Daily News, and he married the late Jane Colford and had two children, Catherine and Liam. He and LaBate still had ties through friends and family, and they got back together after he was widowed.",
      "\u201cWe certainly both had lived whole lives\u201d in the meantime, she said, but \u201cit was probably even a clearer connection.\u201d They married in 2022.",

      "The job, in a 24/7 global news operation, is not easy. Tom Kent, who was AP's standards editor during much of Colford's tenure, recalled him as invaluable in responding to public controversies that erupted at times over its reports.",
      "As editors debated, readers and viewers complained and other news outlets called for comment, Colford kept his cool and gave smart guidance about how best to react, said Kent, now a consultant. He said editors and executives ended up taking Colford's advice, which came with \u201ca journalistic sensitivity and ethical integrity that won the confidence and respect of journalists and editors across the AP.\u201d",

      "The new LSD study, published by the Journal of the American Medical Association, addresses some of those problems.",
      "MDMA, like many other psychedelics, was tested in combination with hours of talk therapy by trained health professionals. That approach proved problematic for FDA reviewers, who said it was difficult to separate the benefits of the drug from those of therapy.",
      "The LSD study took a simpler approach: Patients got a single dose of LSD \u2014 under professional supervision, but without therapy \u2014 and then were followed for about three months.",
      "The paper does not detail how patients were prepared for the experience or what sort of follow-up they received, which is crucial to understanding the research, Barrett noted.",
      "\u201cIn many cases people can have such powerful, subjective experiences that they may need to talk to a therapist to help them make sense of it,\u201d he said.",
      "For the study, researchers measured anxiety symptoms in nearly 200 patients who randomly received one of four doses of LSD or a placebo. The main aim was to find the optimal dose of the drug, which can cause intense visual hallucinations and occasionally feelings of panic or paranoia.",
      "At four weeks, patients receiving the two highest doses had significantly lower anxiety scores than those who received placebo or lower doses. After 12 weeks, 65% of patients taking the most effective LSD dose \u2014 100 milligrams \u2014 continued to show benefits and nearly 50% were deemed to be in remission. The most common side effects included hallucinations, nausea and headaches.",
      "Patients who got dummy pills also improved \u2014 a common phenomenon in psychedelic and psychiatric studies \u2014 but their changes were less than half the size those getting the real drug.",

      "In the 1950s and 1960s more than 1,000 papers were published documenting LSD's use treating alcohol addiction, depression and other conditions. But a federal backlash was in full swing by the late 1960s, when psychedelics became linked to counterculture figures like Timothy Leary, the ex-Harvard professor who famously promoted the drugs as a means to \u201cturn on, tune in and dropout.\u201d",

      "The trend of ditching traditional office space to work from living rooms and hotels accelerated when the coronavirus hit in 2020",
      "NEW YORK -- When Kate Smith worked a 9-to-5 office job, she was burned-out, suffering from daily migraines and thinking, \u201cI can't do this for the rest of my life.\u201d",
      "She didn't have to. For her next role, Smith landed a remote, full-time marketing job that enabled her to travel the world.",
      "Her laptop lifestyle took her to Bali, where she lived and worked for a year-and-a-half. \u201cEvery day, I was riding my scooter through the rice fields and thinking, \u2018I love my life, this is amazing,'\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that feeling never fades. ... I feel so grateful for the freedom and flexibility.\u201d",
      "While Smith, 36, has worked remotely for more than a decade, the trend of ditching traditional office spaces to work from living rooms or beachfront shacks accelerated in 2020, when the coronavirus hit and workers who could began performing their jobs from home.",
      "Many people grew accustomed to the lifestyle change once they tasted the freedom and flexibility a home office afforded. Working parents enjoyed meeting children at the school bus. Others found more time for exercise, socializing and basking in nature once their jobs did not include long commutes.",
      "But after the pandemic subsided, many large companies began calling employees back into the office, creating fierce competition for jobs that could be done from anywhere. Many positions advertised as remote attract hundreds, if not more than a thousand, of applications, experts said.",
      "\u201cFully remote is very rare now in the U.S.,\u201d said Mark Ma, associate professor of business administration at the University of Pittsburgh. \u201cIt is getting much more difficult and you need to look for the smaller firms or medium-sized firms ... and those firms do not provide as competitive financial packages as the big firms, but they try to attract talent by providing more flexibility.\u201d",
      "About 9% of paid U.S. job postings on social networking platform LinkedIn in July offered remote work, while those types of roles attracted 37% of applications, according to the company.",
      "Below, employers and people who haven't returned to an office offer advice on how to land remote jobs in a competitive climate.",
      "The biggest concern for an employer hiring remote workers is ensuring they will do their work, said Carla Rover, co-founder of Strategy and Content, a startup that leverages artificial intelligence.",
      "\u201cI have approached people with a schedule, saying, \u2018This is how much I create each day. This is how much I\u2019ve built in a period of time,\u2019\u201d said Rover, who mostly has worked remotely since 2010. Assembling a strong portfolio showcases what you can do while working outside an office, Rover advised.",
      "\u201cTime management and independence, being self-motivated, are really critical,\u201d said Toni Frana, career expert at FlexJobs, a platform dedicated to helping people find remote or flexible work.",
      "If you've worked remotely before, highlight that on your resume. List communication tools you've used, such as Slack or Microsoft Teams, said Dawn Fay, operational president at staffing firm Robert Half International. \u201cCall out that you have worked remotely, independently, for X amount of time successfully,\" Fay added. \"You really want to stress that.\u201d",
      "After moving on from the office job that made her miserable, Smith created a side hustle coaching other professionals who longed for a nomadic lifestyle. Her coaching eventually grew into a full-time job.",
      "When looking to transition into remote work, find a job that's similar to your current role instead of competing with better-qualified candidates for jobs that require more experience, she advised. \u201cGet your foot in the door ... and then from there work your way to the long-term goal,\u201d Smith said.",
      "You can also try to convert your current job into a remote role. That's what Courtney Sandifer attempted after her husband, 60, had a heart attack and underwent cancer treatment within the same year. He retired early and they bought a small property in Mexico near the beach, hoping to reduce stress. \u201cWe just got tired of the rat race,\u201d Sandifer said.",

In the U.S., education, administrative and social media positions are the fastest-growing full-time remote jobs, while nursing, telehealth and licensed therapists are among the top titles for part-time remote work, according to Frana at FlexJobs.",

      "PJ Hruschak, 54, has been looking for remote work in web design, writing or editing since he was downsized from a full-time job two years ago. He lives outside Cincinnati, Ohio, and wants to avoid commuting and be able to work from home when his 9-year-old son is sick.",
      "But often when he finds jobs advertised as remote, he reads further into the description to learn the employer wants candidates to live in a particular city or be available to work in the office several days per week. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely frustrating,\" Hruschak said. \"It almost feels like it\u2019s a waste of time.\u201d",

They can\u2019t be made remotely,\u201d Conti said. \u201cRemote opportunities are very unique in nature, so just be even more aggressive in the search and understand that it might take a little bit more time, but my experience has been highly worth it.\u201d",

      "RIO FRIO, Portugal -- U.S. winemakers have something to celebrate: the corks they\u2019re popping aren\u2019t subject to tariffs.",
      "Cork comes from the spongy bark of the cork oak tree, which is primarily grown and harvested in the Mediterranean basin. The framework trade agreement between the United States and the European Union singled out the material as an \u201cunavailable natural product.\u201d So as of Sept. 1, cork joined a handful of other items, including airplanes and generic pharmaceuticals, that are exempt from a 15% U.S. tariff on most EU products.",
      "The cork carve-out was vital for Portugal. The European country is the world\u2019s largest cork producer, accounting for about half of global production.",
      "Portuguese diplomats lobbied for the exemption on both sides of the Atlantic. Patrick Spencer, the executive director of the U.S.-based Natural Cork Council, raced from Salem, Oregon, to Washington in June to explain cork\u2019s origins to U.S. trade officials and to seek a tariff reprieve. The Wine Institute, which represents California vintners, said it also pushed for the special dispensation.",
      "Spencer said he was thrilled when a summary of the U.S.-EU agreement released in August mentioned cork.",
      "\u201cIt was a great day in our neighborhood,\u201d said Spencer, a self-described \u201ccork dork.\"",
      "It\u2019s unclear if cork is unique or if other natural products will be exempt from U.S. tariffs in future trade agreements. The U.S. Department of Commerce and the White House did not respond when The Associated Press asked about tariff exemptions.",
      "It\u2019s not even clear if the tariffs President Donald Trump put on imports from the EU's 27 member nations and almost every country will remain. Late last month, a U.S. appeals court ruled that Trump had no right to impose his sweeping tariffs, although it left them in place while his administration appeals to the U.S. Supreme Court.",
      "But if the tariffs stay in place, cork may signal other exemptions to come. U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick indicated during a July interview with CNBC that natural products like mangoes or cocoa may be free from tariffs",
      "The U.S. is the second-largest market for Portuguese cork after France. In 2023, the U.S. imported $241 million worth of cork from Portugal; just over 70% of it came in the form of stoppers for wine, spirits, olive oil, honey and other liquids, according to the Natural Cork Council, a trade group.",
      "Cork has other applications, too. NASA and SpaceX have used it for thermal protection on rockets. Cork crumbles are also used as infill for sports fields and inserted into concrete on airport runways to help absorb the shock of plane landings.",
      "Even though California has a similar climate to the Mediterranean, the U.S. has never developed a cork industry. There was an attempt to start one during World War II, and around 500 cork oaks from that period remain on the campus of the University of California, Davis.",
      "But the effort evaporated when the war ended. The problem: it takes 25 years for a cork tree to produce its first bark for harvesting, and the initial yield typically isn\u2019t high quality. After that, it takes the tree about nine years to grow new bark.",
      "\u201cAmericans are not patient enough to wait for a tree that takes 25 years to give its first harvest,\u201d said Antonio Amorim, the chairman and CEO of Portugal\u2019s Corticeira Amorim, one of the world\u2019s largest cork companies.",

      "Cork harvesting is also an extremely specialized skill, since cutting into a tree the wrong way could kill it. Cork harvesters are the highest paid agricultural workers in Europe, Spencer said.",
      "Amorim, which exports cork to more than 100 countries, has more than 20 million cork trees spread over 700,000 hectares (1.7 million acres) of woodland.",
      "On a recent day at Amorim\u2019s Herdade de Rio Frio, a farm 40 kilometers (25 miles) southeast of Lisbon, crews zig-zagged across the thin, pale grass between scattered cork trees, kicking up dust.",
      "The quiet woodland echoed with the gentle thud of the workers\u2019 axes. They gently pierced the bark, feeling for the thickness of cork that could be peeled off without harming the trunk. The Portuguese have harvested cork this way for more than 200 years.",
      "The tree bark came off in featherweight slabs that the workers, their hands black from the oaks' natural tannins, tossed onto a flatbed truck. It would go to factories to be cut into strips and fed into a machine that punches out stoppers.",
      "Once the trees were bare, a woman painted a white \u201c5\u201d on the orange-colored trunks, signaling they were stripped in 2025. Herdade de Rio Frio's cork oaks, which are native to Portugal and can resist frequent droughts and scorching summer temperatures, were planted more than 100 years ago.",
      "Cork\u2019s sustainable harvesting process and its biodegradability are two reasons many U.S. winemakers have returned to plugging bottles with it after experimenting with closures made of aluminum, plastic and glass. In 2010, 53% of premium U.S. wines used cork stoppers; by 2022, that had risen to 64.5%, according to the Natural Cork Council.",
      "Cork taint, which gives wine a funky taste and is caused by a fungus in natural corks, was a big problem in the 1990s, and it pushed many vintners into aluminum screw caps and other closures, said Andrew Waterhouse, a chemist and director of the Robert Mondavi Institute of Wine and Food Science at the University of California, Davis.",
      "The cork industry has largely solved that problem, Waterhouse said. In the meantime, the wine industry came up with new technology, like screw caps that can mimic cork in the amount of oxygen they let into a bottle over time.",
      "Many wineries, including Trump Winery in Virginia, now use both screw caps and natural corks. Waterhouse said screw caps generally make more sense for a wine like ros\u00e9, which isn\u2019t intended to age, while cork is the standard for aging wines.",
      "\u201cIf you say, \u2018Has this wine aged properly?,\u2019 what you mean is, \u2018Was it in a glass bottle with a cork seal in a cool cellar?\u2019 Under any other conditions, it didn\u2019t age the same,\u201d Waterhouse said. \u201cWe\u2019re always trapped by history.\u201d",

      "Between the staggering payment to bypass a defamation trial and revelations about the lengths to which Fox went to avoid telling its audience what it didn't want to hear about Donald Trump's defeat, many wondered if its actions in November 2020 would damage Fox News or compel it to change directions.",
      "Not so much, it turns out.",
      "Fox News Channel has defied gravity with its ratings, and is more popular with viewers this summer than ABC, CBS or NBC. Its top personalities resolutely support Trump, who has filled his second administration with former Fox stars like Pete Hegseth and Jeanine Pirro. Time after time, the White House turns to Fox to make news; shortly after meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Trump was sitting with Sean Hannity.",
      "Reached by The Associated Press, Fox declined to make anyone available to speak for this story.",
      "An ethos many at Fox share with the president \u2014 no expressed regrets, no apologies \u2014 has also shown signs of spreading, given Newsmax's swagger following the Aug. 11 settlement announcement.",
      "Fox News averaged 2.63 million viewers in weekday prime-time for the second quarter of 2025, up 56% from the same period in 2023, the Nielsen company said. While the increase is somewhat inflated since Fox took a hit in the ratings two years ago following the firing of Tucker Carlson, the advance of cord-cutting means that any network gaining viewers now is unusual.",
      "MSNBC's prime-time audience of 1 million this spring was down 21% in two years, and CNN's viewership of 538,000 was down 6%, Nielsen said. Forty-five percent of people watching one of the top three cable news networks at any given time two years ago were tuned to Fox. This year, that audience share jumped to 62%.",
      "Clearly, Fox's audience is more interested in following a Trump administration than it was for a Joe Biden administration. Just as clearly, the Dominion case had little appreciable impact on viewership.",
      "\u201cFox's audience didn't really look at that verdict and say, \u2018Oh, I can\u2019t watch them anymore,'\u201d said Tim Graham, director of media analysis at the conservative Media Research Center. \u201cI think Fox's audience looked at that and said, \u2018oh, the left is coming after them.\u2019\u201d",
      "Financially, the Dominion settlement was stiff enough that Newsmax is spreading its payments out over three years. The much larger Fox had a greater ability to absorb its hit. Fox confirmed at the time that it could deduct the settlement from its income taxes, and insurance could make the payment lower. Meanwhile, Fox News is a profit engine and becoming even more so; Axios reported earlier this year that the company expected to make half a billion dollars on non-TV products like books, podcasts and streaming.",
      "Carlson was the face of the network before he was fired shortly after the settlement was announced, but Fox has always been able to generate new stars. Carlson took over from Bill O'Reilly when he was fired in 2017. Fox started \u201cThe Five,\u201d arguably its centerpiece show, when Glenn Beck was shown the door in 2011. Jesse Watters now owns Carlson and O'Reilly's old time slot.",
      "Yet, it's hard to understate the worry many at Fox had about losing audience immediately following the 2020 election. Trump, and many of his fans, were angry that the network declared Biden the winner in Arizona before most news outlets, a pivotal moment in the vote-counting.",
      "Internal messages and deposition interviews revealed in court papers tied to Smartmatic's lawsuit reveal much of that drama. Management criticized anchor Neil Cavuto for ordering his show to cut away from Trump press secretary Kayleigh McEnany when she began talking about election fraud. News reporters were disciplined for fact-checking some of Trump's claims. Many in Fox's audience expressed anger at hearing Trump corrected and wanted to hear conspiracy theories.",
      "Cavuto left Fox after 28 years last December. McEnany is now a co-host of Fox's midday show, \u201cOutnumbered.\u201d Trump's daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, hosts a weekend show at Fox.",

      "Fox has also maintained its dominance by playing a form of hardball that Newsmax alleged, in a lawsuit filed this week, violates antitrust laws. Newsmax said Fox has tried to block television distributors from carrying its rival, hired private detectives to investigate Newsmax executives and pressured guests not to appear on the network.",
      "In response, Fox said, \u201cNewsmax cannot sue their way out of their own competitive failures in the marketplace to chase headlines simply because they can't attract viewers.\u201d",

Fox, which would not make an executive available for this story, said fraud charges made by a president or his representatives were newsworthy, and the network is defending itself on free speech grounds.",
      "Newsmax has twice publicly expressed some regrets about its postelection coverage. The network settled a lawsuit with Smartmatic in 2024.",
      "In a statement aired on Newsmax in December 2020, the network said that \u201cno evidence has been offered that Dominion or Smartmatic used software or reprogrammed software that manipulated votes in the 2020 election.\u201d The following April, Newsmax apologized for airing false allegations that a Dominion employee, Eric Coomer, manipulated voting machines or tallies to the detriment of Trump in 2020. Coomer, in turn, dropped Newsmax from a defamation lawsuit.",
      "According to court papers in the case, Newsmax executive Gary Kanofsky wrote about conspiracy theorists to a colleague shortly after the election: \u201cSimply giving them a microphone to spew more anti-election rhetoric and advance their claims without being properly equipped to question the legitimacy or factual accuracy of their assertions may be fun, but it\u2019s terrible journalism.\u201d",
      "But Newsmax offered no apology in making the Dominion settlement, announced Aug. 11. The network's CEO, Chris Ruddy, attacked the judge, saying he \u201ceffectively entered a confiscation of our property because our reporting was not always sympathetic to Joe Biden.\u201d",
      "The network said on the air: \u201cNewsmax believed it was critically important for the American people to hear both sides of the election disputes that arose in 2020. We stand by our coverage as fair, balanced and conducted within professional standards of journalism.\u201d",
      "What has changed? Newsmax has grown, and two months after Trump took office again, it went public. It invites members of its audience \u2014 dominated by Trump fans \u2014 to invest in the network.",
      "\u201cIf you're paying attention to your audience at Newsmax,\u201d Graham said, \u201cyou don't want to give the impression that you're knuckling under.\u201d",

      "India\u2019s clean energy appetite is helping the country\u2019s solar power industry wean itself off imported Chinese parts and continue growing even as it faces a tougher sell to its biggest foreign customer, the United States",
      "JAIPUR, India -- On the edge of Jaipur, an Indian city known for its colorful bazaars and palaces, a bustling industrial complex is the epicenter of the country's push to compete with China in making components for solar technology.",
      "India, the world's most populous nation, is jockeying for market share against the global leader in solar in part by selling to its own citizens, which helps the country with its other goal: meeting growing domestic demand for electricity.",
      "In the government-subsidized zone that provides tax breaks, solar manufacturer ReNew's sprawling factory makes enough modules to produce 4 gigawatts of power each year \u2014 equivalent to the energy needed for approximately 2.5 million Indian homes. The 2-year-old facility that employs nearly 1,000 people serves as a symbol of the solar industry\u2019s momentum. India\u2019s capacity to build key solar components more than doubled in the fiscal year ending in March.",
      "\u201cWhen I got this opportunity, I was really happy that I was directly contributing to the clean energy transition,\u201d said Monisha, an engineer at ReNew who goes by one name. She said the work has helped her become independent and assist her family with their finances.",
      "The country still faces a steep climb in its efforts to develop solar manufacturing that could one day rival China, which makes more than 80% of all solar components in the world and supplies key materials to Indian manufacturers.",
      "India's solar industry must also contend with a tougher sell to its biggest foreign customer, the United States. President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs of 50% on Indian goods took effect last month, while Trump\u2019s administration and Republican lawmakers have taken other steps to hinder U.S. adoption of solar and other clean energy.",
      "Still, India's clean energy appetite is helping its solar manufacturers deal with the external pressures. Energy analysts said India's domestic demand for solar power will likely reduce disruption from tariffs imposed by the U.S., where about a third of the solar panels produced by India were sold in a recent fiscal year. Proceeds from selling in the lucrative U.S. market have helped Indian solar manufacturers update their supply chains in recent years so they were less dependent on imported Chinese parts and materials.",
      "While Indian solar manufacturers can sell at higher prices abroad, ambitious domestic clean energy targets and domestic demand will help them find buyers within India if sales in the U.S. slow, analysts said.",
      "\u201cThis is a huge industry that can absorb these modules and cells that are being produced. We are not necessarily as export dependent as other countries are,\u201d said Charith Konda, an energy analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.",
      "India's domestic solar market has already helped Hyderabad-based Vega Solar shift its customer base for off-grid solar modules for RVs, electric fences and other uses to customers in India in the years since the COVID-19 pandemic, said Vinay Keesara, a company director.",
      "\u201cBefore the pandemic, 90% of my business was exports and 10% used to be domestic supply, now this has just flipped the other way around,\u201d he said.",
      "One of the most carbon-polluting countries, India is making huge efforts to harness the power of the sun and other clean energy sources. The cost of solar power \u2014 now half that of new coal-powered plants \u2014 and India's many sunny days are reasons that experts said installed solar power increased 30 times in the last decade.",
      "Before the U.S. tariffs were announced, researchers with IEEFA and Gurugram, India-based JMK Research wrote that India's demand for solar modules during the next two years could exceed what its manufacturers are selling within the country because so many are being exported. India has also been importing solar modules from China.",
      "Konda said it was too early to determine how the U.S. tariffs will affect Indian solar manufacturers, but that the impact won\u2019t be felt for at least another year because solar component orders are placed well in advance. And uncertainty remains over the fate of all of Trump's tariffs. Despite a U.S. court ruling against Trump\u2019s tariffs, they remain in place until at least October while his administration files appeals.",
      "India has nearly 170 gigawatts of renewable energy projects in the pipeline \u2014 most of which are solar \u2014 and are expected to be completed in the next few years. The country also has an ambitious clean energy target of 500 gigawatts by 2030.",
      "Government policies restricting imports of solar components, incentives for solar manufacturers and mandates for solar power producers to purchase material from government-approved sources gave Indian companies the right signals to ramp up solar manufacturing, said Sanjay Verghese, ReNew\u2019s group president for solar manufacturing and solar projects.",

Government data showed India imported $1.3 billion worth of solar cells and modules from China in the first quarter of the year, down by more than one-third from the same period a year earlier. Cells are individual units that convert sunlight into energy, while modules are made up of multiple cells.",
      "Neshwin Rodrigues, an analyst at climate energy think tank Ember, predicted that by 2030, India might be in a position of needing to import only the raw material polysilicon while producing other solar panel ingredients in the country.",

      "President Donald Trump's appearances on podcasts were a pivotal media strategy in his successful 2024 Republican campaign. Moving forward, mastering a personal podcast could replace soft-focus biographies or wonky books as a way for politicians to increase their profiles.",
      "Beshear said on NBC's \u201cMeet the Press\u201d this summer that he will \u201ctake a look\u201d at running for president in 2028. California Gov. Gavin Newsom, also in the circle of potential presidential nominees, started his own podcast earlier this year.",

      "\u201cThat's how Americans feel,\u201d he said. \u201cThey feel like the news hits them minute after minute after minute. And it can feel like chaos. It can feel like the world is out of control. With this podcast, we're trying to help Americans process what we're going through.\u201d",
      "He's already done nearly two dozen podcasts, with his audience heavily weighted toward Kentucky residents. His guests have included some potential Democratic presidential rivals, including Maryland Gov. Wes Moore and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar. Entrepreneur Mark Cuban, former Kentucky basketball coach John Calipari and Kentucky-born actor and comic Steve Zahn have also appeared.",

      "While the Fed doesn\u2019t set mortgage rates, its actions can influence bond investors\u2019 appetite for long-term U.S. government bonds, like 10-year Treasury notes. Lenders use the yield on 10-year Treasurys as a guide to pricing home loans.",

      "As the cost of electricity outpaces inflation, consumer advocates are sounding alarms about the risks to low-income people who can't afford consistent air conditioning in deadly heat",
      "NEW YORK -- As the cost of electricity outpaces inflation and summers grow deadlier, consumer advocates are sounding alarms about the risks to low-income people who can\u2019t afford consistent air conditioning in dangerous temperatures.",
      "While about half of U.S. states offer protections from utility shutoffs during extreme heat, the rest do not. In contrast, 41 states have \u201ccold weather rules,\u201d which forbid utility companies from shutting off household heat during extreme cold. The Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) provides funds for vulnerable groups who have trouble affording heating bills in the winter, but the program has less funding available to meet consumers' increasing needs in the summer months.",
      "Shylee Johnson, 27, based in Wichita, Kansas, saw firsthand the protection that the local Low Income Energy Assistance Program (LIEAP) brought to her community during the three years she worked as a case manager for families who were behind on utility bills.",
      "\u201cIt was amazing at keeping people's electricity on in the winter,\u201d she said of the program, which subsidizes costs for households who can't afford utility expenses. \u201cFamilies would be deciding between paying their heating bill or another bill, and this took that decision away.\u201d",
      "In the summer, though, Johnson said she's seen how late or missed utility payments can result in the shutoff of electricity and the removal of vital services, despite air conditioning becoming increasingly essential to families' health and well-being.",
      "\u201cIt's terrifying,\u201d she said. \u201cThere's a \u2018cold weather rule\u2019 \u2014 in freezing temperatures, your heat can't be turned off. But there isn't an equivalent for summer in Kansas.\"",
      "The clients Johnson served were often the most vulnerable, including families with young children, pregnant people, and those with sick or disabled family members, including some who need electricity to operate essential medical equipment in their homes. LIHEAP also sometimes provides air conditioning units in the summer for households that can't afford to purchase their own units.",
      "Recent studies show that extreme heat in the summer is now the leading cause of weather-related deaths, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). That's ahead of deaths due to extreme cold in the winter or other weather emergencies, like hurricanes or tornadoes. The frequency, duration and intensity of extreme heat waves has significantly increased over the past several decades, according to the EPA, and insignificant support for low-income households contributes to the danger.",
      "In 2023, the death certificates of more than 2,300 people who died in the summer mention the effects of excessive heat, the highest number in 45 years of records, according to an Associated Press analysis of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data. And that figure is only a fraction of the real death toll, according to coroner, hospital, and ambulance records, also analyzed by the AP.",
      "Nationally, the cost of electricity has risen at twice the pace of the average cost of living, exacerbating the problem.",
      "According to the National Energy Assistance Directors Association (NEADA), which represents state program managers of LIHEAP, almost 20% of very low-income families lack consistent access to cooling. Currently, 26 states and the District of Columbia offer assistance with summer energy bills, while 21 states plus D.C. have policies protecting low-income families from utility disconnections during summer months.",
      "Still, roughly 85% of LIHEAP resources are used for heating in the winter, leaving little support for households seeking cooling, according to Mark Wolfe, executive director of NEADA.",

      "Karen Lusson, senior attorney at the National Consumer Law Center who focuses on energy and utility affordability, said that many deaths from extreme heat in the summer months are preventable.",
      "\u201cThe impression we\u2019ve all had is that weather is most dangerous in the wintertime,\u201d she said. \u201cNot any more.\u201d",
      "While the Trump administration fired the entire staff of the LIHEAP program in April, Wolfe and Lusson are hopeful Congress will approve slightly more funding for the program in the fall compared to the previous fiscal year, they said.",
      "To protect households during increasingly hotter summers, Lusson recommends individuals seek information about their rights when it comes to utility shutoffs. State utility commissions, which regulate public utilities, dictate local rules. To find your relevant commission, consult the government site operated by the national association of regulatory commissions, which has a state-by-state look-up tool.",
      "Lusson also encourages people to look into whether their state protections are calendar- or temperature-based, which can make a difference in planning. While some states forbid shut-offs during certain months of the year, others base the protections on the temperature of a given day or the presence of a heat advisory. This LIHEAP site has a break-down of every state's policies.",
      "Some state attorney generals' offices also have public utility bureaus that advocate on behalf of consumers, Lusson said.",
      "Lastly, it can be helpful to determine if your utility company offers discount rates or percentage-of-income payment plans to help with electricity bills. Both commission and utility websites have specific information about how to access LIHEAP assistance and whether or not the utility company itself offers assistance.",

      "Missouri coach Eli Drinkwitz and Kansas coach Lance Leipold have been teaching their players about the history behind their rivalry, known as the Border War",
      "KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Missouri coach Eli Drinkwitz and Kansas counterpart Lance Leipold spent some time this week not as football coaches teaching the X's and O's but as history professors delivering to their teams the story of free states and slave states.",
      "After all, therein lies the foundation of the Border War.",
      "One of the most bitter rivalries in college sports, the once-annual showdown between Tigers and Jayhawks has been on hiatus since 2011, when Missouri jumped from the Big 12 Conference to the Southeastern Conference. But it will be renewed on Saturday, when Kansas makes the short trip across the state line to face Missouri in a nonconference matchup that can trace its roots to literal warfare.",
      "In the 1850s and '60s, guerilla fighting in western Missouri and eastern Kansas erupted over whether slavery would be legal in the proposed state of Kansas. The anti-slavery \u201cJayhawkers\u201d would pillage pro-slavery communities in Missouri, which led in part to the formation of the \u201cTigers,\u201d a militia unit whose responsibility it became to protect Columbia from attacks.",
      "For the last 134 years, the Tigers and Jayhawks have waged their own sort of battle on the football field.",
      "\u201cWe gave them a little background history,\u201d Leipold said of his team this week, \u201call the way back to the border, and what the border stood for, and free states and slave states, and kind of went through the whole history of where these two states have been competitive, and not always agreed. And then we went through when the first game was played, and all the things that have gone on from there, and where the series is. Touched on why it hasn't been played in a while.\u201d",
      "That decision by Missouri to bolt from its longtime conference home to the SEC only added to the animosity.",
      "As if there wasn't enough already.",
      "Longtime Missouri basketball coach Norm Stewart famously refused to let his team stay in Kansas hotels, or even refuel the bus across the state line, lest he inject a single dollar into its economy. Kansas football coach Don Fambrough once said he'd rather die than seek medical attention from a physician in Missouri. And over the years, the notorious Mizzou student section, known as the Antlers, would spend the night before games calling up Kansas coaches and players at all hours.",
      "Pretty innocent stuff, really, compared with William Quantrill's band of vigilantes ransacking Lawrence way back in 1863.",
      "Then again, folks haven't forgotten about that, either.",
      "\u201cMy wife and I were at church and somebody wanted to talk about it,\" Leipold said of the rivalry. \"I didn't know that was the right time to, really. Somebody said, you know, \u2018Kick their butt.\u2019 But they didn't say butt. And it was in church.",

But in true Missouri-Kansas fashion, they can't even agree on the record: The outcome of the 1960 game is disputed. Missouri claims to have an a 57-54-9 advantage. Kansas believes it is 55-56-9.",
      "There have been some doozies, too.",
      "In the early years, old Civil War soldiers would stand on the sidelines and stare across the field at each other. The 1911 game is recognized by the NCAA as the birth of \u201chomecoming.\" And in 2007, Kansas was ranked No. 2 and Missouri was No. 3 for an epic showdown at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Missouri, which the Tigers won 36-28 to reach the Big 12 title game.",
      "\u201cTwo big games were \u201807 and \u201908, and I remember watching those games on TV, to be honest,\u201d Drinkwitz said. \u201cI wasn't in college coaching at that point. I was a high school school. ... Taking the job, I understood the importance of this.\u201d",
      "Two decades of conference realignment have rendered many longtime rivalries a rarity. But as more financial pressure is placed on athletic departments, the argument can be made that the importance of winning them has never been greater.",
      "\u201cAnything that stirs the passion of your fanbase is important,\u201d Drinkwitz said, \u201cespecially when you're asking fans to do so much. We ask our fans to do so much from a financial contribution, a time contribution, an engagement contribution. So any time you get a chance to stir their passion for bragging rights and whatever other rights might be on the line with this game, it's important that your team is ready to play.\u201d",
      "To that point, Drinkwitz and Leipold have had to walk a fine line. They may have brought in former players to talk to their teams about the rivalry this week, and the history lessons have been important. But none of that matters at kickoff on Saturday.",
      "\u201cCoach showed us a video about the rivalry and how it goes back hundreds of years,\u201d Kansas safety Taylor Davis said. \u201cThere's obviously a lot of emotions for both sides. We're just going to try to keep it neutral and play football.\u201d",

      "For decades, U.S. Open women's singles champions received a replica trophy that was much smaller than the ones the men's title winners were allowed to take home",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Coco Gauff was surprised at how much tinier the replica trophy she got to keep after winning this year's French Open was than the trophy she posed with on court at Roland-Garros for all the world to see. She even did a TikTok about the discrepancy, drawing more than 2 million views.",
      "Why was Gauff so taken aback by what she called the \u201c miniature version \u201d?",
      "\u201cI honestly did not know the size it was going to be. ... I know you never really take the original, but when I won the U.S. Open, they gave me the same size (trophy), with my name engraved on it,\u201d Gauff told The Associated Press. \u201cSo I just assumed that Roland Garros would be the same.\u201d",
      "Actually, it turns out Gauff's 2023 championship at the U.S. Open marked the first time the women's singles winner in New York was given a silver cup significantly larger than the one that is used in the postmatch ceremony. Her replica hardware is 19 1/2 inches tall, the same as both the original and keepsake men's trophies \u2014 and 7 1/2 inches bigger than the original women's trophy.",
      "That one, like the original men's, is displayed during the tournament in a locked glass box near where players enter the event's main arena and will be briefly handed to, then taken away from, whoever wins the women's final in Arthur Ashe Stadium this Saturday.",
      "From 1987, when the tradition of providing keepsakes at Flushing Meadows began, until two years ago, the female champion took home a 12-inch-tall copy. But the U.S. Tennis Association asked Tiffany & Co. to create replicas for the women to match the size of what the men are allowed to keep. That change coincided with the 50th anniversary of the tournament's 1973 move to pay equal prize money to women and men at then-player Billie Jean King's urging.",
      "\u201cEquality is in our DNA here at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center. Everything we do, we\u2019re very intentional about equality ... and we wanted to do the same as it relates to the champion\u2019s trophies,\u201d U.S. Open tournament director Stacey Allaster said in an interview.",

When somebody does the work and they improve and they get to that level, you just have to tip your hat,\u201d said the 25-year-old from Canada, who lost his only previous Grand Slam semifinal at the 2021 U.S. Open. \u201cPhysicality, movement got much better. Stronger physically. The serve, the forehand more precise. The backhand was always consistent. The return was always good, deep. Yeah, those are the main things.\u201d",
      "That's all, huh?",
      "There's certainly quite a lot Sinner that does well, as he demonstrated by overwhelming his last two opponents. In a performance Sinner described as \u201cvery solid,\u201d he dismissed No. 10 Lorenzo Musetti in the quarterfinals 6-1, 6-4, 6-2 in just 2 hours on Wednesday, two nights after an even more lopsided win, 6-1, 6-1, 6-1 against No. 23 Alexander Bublik in 1 hour, 21 minutes in the fourth round.",
      "That's less than 3 1/2 hours combined over two matches. Auger-Aliassime needed 4 hours, 10 minutes just to get past No. 8 Alex de Minaur in his quarterfinal.",

      "Scientists conducting a first-of-its-kind drilling operation have extracted samples of fresh water hiding in massive reservoirs deep under the ocean",
      "ABOARD LIFTBOAT ROBERT, North Atlantic -- Deep in Earth's past, an icy landscape became a seascape as the ice melted and the oceans rose off what is now the northeastern United States. Nearly 50 years ago, a U.S. government ship searching for minerals and hydrocarbons in the area drilled into the seafloor to see what it could find.",
      "It found, of all things, drops to drink under the briny deeps \u2014 fresh water.",
      "This summer, a first-of-its-kind global research expedition followed up on that surprise. Drilling for fresh water under the salt water off Cape Cod, Expedition 501 extracted thousands of samples from what is now thought to be a massive, hidden aquifer stretching from New Jersey as far north as Maine.",
      "It's just one of many depositories of \u201csecret fresh water\u201d known to exist in shallow salt waters around the world that might some day be tapped to slake the planet\u2019s intensifying thirst, said Brandon Dugan, the expedition's co-chief scientist.",
      "\u201cWe need to look for every possibility we have to find more water for society,\u201d Dugan, a geophysicist and hydrologist at the Colorado School of Mines, told Associated Press journalists who recently spent 12 hours on the drilling platform. The research teams looked in \u201cone of the last places you would probably look for fresh water on Earth.\u201d",
      "They found it, and will be analyzing nearly 50,000 liters (13,209 gallons) of it back in their labs around the world in the coming months. They're out to solve the mystery of its origins \u2014 whether the water is from glaciers, connected groundwater systems on land or some combination.",
      "The potential is enormous. So are the hurdles of getting the water out and puzzling over who owns it, who uses it and how to extract it without undue harm to nature. It's bound to take years to bring that water ashore for public use in a big way, if it's even feasible.",
      "Why try? In just five years, the U.N. says, the global demand for fresh water will exceed supplies by 40%. Rising sea levels from the warming climate are souring coastal freshwater sources while data centers that power AI and cloud computing are consuming water at an insatiable rate.",
      "The fabled Ancient Mariner\u2019s lament, \u201cWater, water, every where, nor any drop to drink,\u201d looms as a warning to landlubbers as well as to sailors on salty seas.",
      "In Virginia alone, a quarter of all power produced in the state goes to data centers, a share expected to nearly double in five years. By some estimates, each midsize data center consumes as much water as 1,000 households. Each of the Great Lakes states has experienced groundwater shortages.",
      "Cape Town, South Africa, came perilously close to running out of fresh water for its nearly 5 million people in 2018 during an epic, three-year drought. South Africa is thought to have a coastal undersea freshwater bonanza, too, and there is at least anecdotal evidence that every continent may have the same.",
      "Canada's Prince Edward Island, Hawaii and Jakarta, Indonesia, are among places where stressed freshwater supplies coexist with prospective aquifers under the ocean.",
      "Enter Expedition 501, a $25 million scientific collaboration of more than a dozen countries backed by the U.S. government's National Science Foundation and the European Consortium for Ocean Research Drilling (U.S. money for it was secured before budget cuts sought by the Trump administration).",
      "Scientists went into the project believing the undersea aquifer they were sampling might be sufficient to meet the needs of a metropolis the size of New York City for 800 years. They found fresh or nearly fresh water at both higher and lower depths below the seafloor than they anticipated, suggesting a larger supply even than that.",
      "Their work at sea unfolded over three months from Liftboat Robert, an oceangoing vessel that, once on site, lowers three enormous pillars to the seafloor and squats above the waves. Normally it services offshore petroleum sites and wind farms. This drill-baby-drill mission was different.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s known that this phenomena exists both here and elsewhere around the world,\u201d Expedition 501 project manager Jez Everest, a scientist who came from the British Geological Survey in Edinburgh, Scotland, said of undersea water. \u201cBut it\u2019s a subject that\u2019s never been directly investigated by any research project in the past.\u201d",
      "By that, he means no one globally had drilled systematically into the seabed on a mission to find freshwater. Expedition 501 was quite literally groundbreaking \u2014 it penetrated Earth below the sea by as many as 1,289 feet or nearly 400 meters.",
      "But it followed a 2015 research project that mapped contours of an aquifer remotely, using electromagnetic technology, and roughly estimated salinity of the water underneath.",
      "That mission, by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University, reported evidence of a \u201cmassive offshore aquifer system\u201d in this area, possibly rivalling the size of America\u2019s largest \u2014 the Ogallala aquifer, which supplies water to parts of eight Great Plains states.",
      "Two developments in 1976 had stirred interest in searching for undersea freshwater.",
      "In the middle of Nantucket island, the U.S. Geological Survey drilled a test well to see how far down the groundwater went. It extracted fresh water from such great depths that it made scientists wonder if the water came from the sea, not the sky.",
      "The same year, that federal agency mounted a 60-day expedition aboard the drilling vessel Glomar Conception along a vast stretch of the Continental Shelf from Georgia to Georges Bank off New England. It drilled cores in search of the sub-seabed's resources, like methane.",

      "\u201cFour parts per thousand was a eureka moment,\" Dugan said, because the finding suggested that the water must have been connected to a terrestrial system in the past, or still is.",
      "As the weeks wore on and Robert moved from site to site 20 to 30 miles (30 to 50 kilometers) off the coast, the process of drilling into the waterlogged subsea sediment yielded a collection of samples down to 1 part per thousand salt content. Some were even lower.",
      "Bingo. That's what you find in many bodies of fresh water on land. That's water you can drink, in theory. No one did.",
      "In months of analysis ahead, the scientists will investigate a range of properties of the water, including what microbes were living in the depths, what they used for nutrients and energy sources and what byproducts they might generate; in other words, whether the water is safe to consume or otherwise use.",
      "\u201cThis is a new environment that has never been studied before,\u201d said Jocelyne DiRuggiero, a Johns Hopkins University biologist in Baltimore who studies the microbial ecology of extreme environments and is not involved in the expedition.",
      "\u201cThe water may contain minerals detrimental to human health since it percolated through layers of sediments,\u201d she said. \u201cHowever, a similar process forms the terrestrial aquifers that we use for freshwater, and those typically have very high quality.\u201d",
      "By sequencing DNA extracted from their samples, she said, the researchers can determine which microorganisms are there and \u201clearn how they potentially make a living.\u201d",
      "Techniques will also be used to determine whether it came from glacial ice melt thousands of years ago or is still coming via labyrinthian geologic formations from land.",
      "Researchers will date the water back in the lab, and that will be key in determining whether it is a renewable resource that could be used responsibly. Primordial water is trapped and finite; newer water suggests the aquifer is still connected to a terrestrial source and being refreshed, however slowly.",
      "\u201cYounger means it was a raindrop 100 years ago, 200 years ago,\u201d Dugan said. \u201cIf young, it\u2019s recharging.\u201d",
      "Those questions are for basic science. For society, all sorts of complex questions arise if the basic science affirms the conditions necessary for exploiting the water. Who will manage it? Can it be taken without an unacceptable risk of contaminating the supply from the ocean above? Will it be cheaper or environmentally friendlier than today's energy-hungry desalination plants?",
      "Dugan said if governments decide to get the water, local communities could turn to the aquifers in time of need, such as drought, or when extreme storms flood coastal freshwater reserves and ruin them. The notion of actually using this old buried water is so new that it has not been on the radar of many policymakers or conservationists.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a lesson in how long it can take sometimes to make these things happen and the perseverance that\u2019s needed to get there,\" said Woods Hole geophysicist Rob Evans, whose 2015 expedition helped point the way for 501. \u201cThere\u2019s a ton of excitement that finally they\u2019ve got samples.\"",
      "Still, he sees some red flags. One is that tapping undersea aquifers could draw water away from onshore reserves. Another is that undersea groundwater that seeps out to the seafloor may supply nutrients vital to the ecosystem, and that could be upset.",
      "\"If we were to go out and start pumping these waters, there would almost certainly be unforeseen consequences,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of balance we would need to consider before we started diving in and drilling and exploiting these kinds of things.\u201d",
      "For most in the project, getting to and from Liftboat Robert meant a voyage of seven hours or more from Fall River, Massachusetts, on a supply boat that made round trips every 10 days or so to replenish stocks and rotate people.",
      "On the platform, around the clock, the racket of metal bore pipes and machinery, the drilling grime and the speckled mud mingled with the quieter, cleaner work of scientists in trailers converted to pristine labs and processing posts.",
      "There, samples were treated according to the varying needs of the expedition\u2019s geologists, geochemists, hydrologists, microbiologists, sedimentologists and more.",
      "Passing through clear plastic tubes, muck was sliced into disks like hockey pucks. Machines squeezed water out. Some samples were kept sealed to enable study of ancient gases dissolved in the water. Other samples were frozen, filtered or left as is, depending on the purpose.",

      "A congressional investigation finds the Pentagon has funded research involving collaboration with Chinese entities linked to China's defense sector",
      "WASHINGTON -- Over a recent two-year period, the Pentagon funded hundreds of projects done in collaboration with universities in China and institutes linked to that nation's defense industry, including many blacklisted by the U.S. government for working with the Chinese military, a congressional investigation has found.",
      "The report, released Friday by House Republicans on the Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, argues the projects have allowed China to exploit U.S. research partnerships for military gains while the two countries are locked in a tech and arms rivalry.",
      "\u201cAmerican taxpayer dollars should be used to defend the nation \u2014 not strengthen its foremost strategic competitor,\u201d Republicans wrote in the report.",
      "\u201cFailing to safeguard American research from hostile foreign exploitation will continue to erode U.S. technological dominance and place our national defense capabilities at risk,\" it said.",
      "The Pentagon didn't immediately respond to an Associated Press request for comment. Beijing has in the past said science and technological cooperation between the two countries is mutually beneficial and helps the two sides cope with global challenges.",
      "The congressional report said some officials at the Defense Department argued research should remain open as long as it is \u201cneither controlled nor classified.\u201d",
      "The report makes several recommendations to scale back U.S. research collaboration with China. It also backs new legislation proposed by the committee's chairman, Rep. John Moolenaar, R-Michigan. The bill would prohibit any Defense Department funding from going to projects done in collaboration with researchers affiliated with Chinese entities that the U.S. government identifies as safety risks.",
      "The 80-page report builds on the committee's findings last year that partnerships between U.S. and Chinese universities over the past decade allowed hundreds of millions of dollars in federal funding to help Beijing develop critical technology. Amid pressure from Republicans, several U.S. universities have ended their joint programs with Chinese schools in recent years.",
      "The new report focuses more narrowly on the Defense Department and its billions of dollars in annual research funding.",
      "The committee's investigation identified 1,400 research papers published between June 2023 and June 2025 that acknowledged support from the Pentagon and were done in collaboration with Chinese partners. The publications were funded by some 700 defense grants worth more than $2.5 billion. Of the 1,400 publications, more than half involved organizations affiliated with China's defense research and industrial base.",
      "Dozens of those organizations were flagged for potential security concerns on U.S. government lists, though federal law does not prohibit research collaborations with them. The Defense Department money supported research in fields including hypersonic technology, semiconductors, artificial intelligence, advanced materials and next-generation propulsion.",

      "Released Thursday, the pictures taken by the Gemini South telescope in Chile late last month are the most detailed yet of the recently discovered comet. They show a wide coma of dust and gas around the ice ball as it speeds toward the sun, and also a tail that\u2019s more extended than it was in previous shots.",
      "These new images confirm that the comet is becoming more active as it plows harmlessly through our solar system, according to the National Space Foundation's NoirLab, which operates the telescope. It\u2019s only the third known interstellar object to venture our way.",
      "As of Thursday, the comet known as 3I-Atlas was 238 million miles (384 million kilometers) from Earth and growing ever nearer, according to NASA. It will make its closest approach to the sun at the end of October and then pass closest to Earth in December from 167 million miles (269 million kilometers) away \u2014 farther from Earth than the sun.",

      "That dire prospect prompted a New Zealand nature lover who found the snail in her garden in August to launch a campaign to find his perfect match. But Ned\u2019s quest for true love, perhaps predictably, is slow.",
      "Giselle Clarkson was weeding her home vegetable patch in Wairarapa on the North Island when a snail tumbling out of the leafy greens caught her eye.

      "The magazine launched a nationwide campaign to find a mate for Ned, named for the left-handed character Ned Flanders in \u201cThe Simpsons,\u201d who once opened a store called The Leftorium. That explains the male pronouns some use for Ned, although snails are hermaphrodites with sex organs on their necks and the capacity for both eggs and sperm.",

      "Ned\u2019s relatable romantic woes have attracted global news coverage, but New Zealand\u2019s strict biosecurity controls mean long-distance love probably isn\u2019t on the cards.

      "IRVING, Texas -- Crowded around a workshop table, four girls at de Zavala Middle School puzzled over a Lego machine they had built. As they flashed a purple card in front of a light sensor, nothing happened.",
      "The teacher at the Dallas-area school had emphasized that in the building process, there is no such thing as mistakes. Only iterations. So the girls dug back into the box of blocks and pulled out an orange card. They held it over the sensor and the machine kicked into motion.",
      "\u201cOh! Oh, it reacts differently to different colors,\u201d said sixth grader Sofia Cruz.",
      "In de Zavala\u2019s first year as a choice school focused on science, technology, engineering and math, the school recruited a sixth grade class that\u2019s half girls. School leaders are hoping the girls will stick with STEM fields. In de Zavala\u2019s higher grades \u2014 whose students joined before it was a STEM school \u2014 some elective STEM classes have just one girl enrolled.",
      "Efforts to close the gap between boys and girls in STEM classes are picking up after losing steam nationwide during the chaos of the COVID-19 pandemic. Schools have extensive work ahead to make up for the ground girls lost, in both interest and performance.",
      "In the years leading up to the pandemic, the gender gap nearly closed. But within a few years, girls lost all the ground they had gained in math test scores over the previous decade, according to an Associated Press analysis. While boys' scores also suffered during COVID, they have recovered faster than girls, widening the gender gap.",
      "As learning went online, special programs to engage girls lapsed \u2014 and schools were slow to restart them. Zoom school also emphasized rote learning, a technique based on repetition that some experts believe may favor boys, instead of teaching students to solve problems in different ways, which may benefit girls.",
      "Old practices and biases likely reemerged during the pandemic, said Michelle Stie, a vice president at the National Math and Science Initiative.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s just call it what it is,\u201d Stie said. \u201cWhen society is disrupted, you fall back into bad patterns.\u201d",
      "In most school districts in the 2008-2009 school year, boys had higher average math scores on standardized tests than girls, according to AP's analysis, which looked at scores across 15 years in over 5,000 school districts. It was based on average test scores for third through eighth graders in 33 states, compiled by the Educational Opportunity Project at Stanford University.",
      "A decade later, girls had not only caught up, they were ahead: Slightly more than half of districts had higher math averages for girls.",
      "Within a few years of the pandemic, the parity disappeared. In 2023-2024, boys on average outscored girls in math in nearly nine out of 10 districts.",
      "A separate study by NWEA, an education research company, found gaps between boys and girls in science and math on national assessments went from being practically non-existent in 2019 to favoring boys around 2022.",
      "Studies have indicated girls reported higher levels of anxiety and depression during the pandemic, plus more caretaking burdens than boys, but the dip in academic performance did not appear outside STEM. Girls outperformed boys in reading in nearly every district nationwide before the pandemic and continued to do so afterward.",
      "\u201cIt wasn\u2019t something like COVID happened and girls just fell apart,\u201d said Megan Kuhfeld, one of the authors of the NWEA study.",
      "In the years leading up to the pandemic, teaching practices shifted to deemphasize speed, competition and rote memorization. Through new curriculum standards, schools moved toward research-backed methods that emphasized how to think flexibly to solve problems and how to tackle numeric problems conceptually.",
      "Educators also promoted participation in STEM subjects and programs that boosted girls\u2019 confidence, including extracurriculars that emphasized hands-on learning and connected abstract concepts to real-life applications.",
      "When STEM courses had large male enrollment, Superintendent Kenny Rodrequez noticed girls losing interest as boys dominated classroom discussions at his schools in Grandview C-4 District outside Kansas City.

      "SAN FRANCISCO -- A federal judge on Tuesday ordered a shake-up of Google\u2019s search engine in an attempt to curb the corrosive power of an illegal monopoly while rebuffing the U.S. government's attempt to break up the company and impose other restraints.",
      "The 226-page decision made by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta in Washington, D.C., will likely ripple across the technological landscape at a time when the industry is being reshaped by breakthroughs in artificial intelligence \u2014 including conversational \u201canswer engines\u201d as companies like ChatGPT and Perplexity try to upend Google\u2019s long-held position as the internet\u2019s main gateway.",
      "The innovations and competition being unleashed by AI also reshaped the judge\u2019s approach to the remedies in the nearly five-year-old antitrust case brought by the U.S. Justice Department during President Donald Trump\u2019s first administration and carried onward by President Joe Biden's administration.",
      "\u201cUnlike the typical case where the court\u2019s job is to resolve a dispute based on historic facts, here the court is asked to gaze into a crystal ball and look to the future. Not exactly a judge\u2019s forte,\u201d Mehta wrote.",
      "The judge is trying to rein in Google by prohibiting some of the tactics the company deployed to drive traffic to its search engine and other services. The ruling also will pry open some of the prized databases of closely guarded information about search that have provided Google with a seemingly insurmountable advantage.",
      "The handcuffs being slapped on Google will preclude contracts that give its search engine, Gemini AI app, Play Store for Android and virtual assistant an exclusive position on smartphone, personal computers and other devices.",
      "But Mehta stopped short of banning the multi-billion dollar deals that Google has been making for years to lock in its search engine as the default on smartphones, personal computers and other devices. Those deals, involving payments of more than $26 billion annually, were one of the main issues that prompted the judge to conclude Google\u2019s search engine was an illegal monopoly, but he decided banning them in the future would do more harm than good.",
      "The judge also rejected the U.S. Justice Department\u2019s effort to force Google to sell its popular Chrome browser, concluding it was an unwarranted step that \u201cwould be incredibly messy and highly risky.\u201d",
      "Partially because he is allowing the default deals to continue, Mehta is ordering Google to give its current and would-be rivals access to some of its search engine\u2019s secret sauce \u2014 the data stockpiled from trillions of queries that it used to help improve the quality of its search results. That is a measure that Google had also fiercely opposed, contending it was unfair and would raise privacy and security risk for the billions of people who have posed questions to its search engine \u2014 sometimes delving into sensitive issues.",
      "The Justice Department's antitrust chief, Gail Slater, hailed the decision as a \u201cmajor win for the American people,\u201d even though the agency didn't get everything it sought. \u201cWe are now weighing our options and thinking through whether the ordered relief goes far enough,\u201d Slater wrote in a post.",
      "In its own post, Google framed Mehta's ruling as a vindication of its long-held position that the case never should have been brought. The decision \u201crecognizes how much the industry has changed through the advent of AI, which is giving people so many more ways to find information,\u201d wrote Lee-Anne Mulholland, Google's vice president of regulatory affairs. \u201cThis underlines what we\u2019ve been saying since this case was filed in 2020: Competition is intense and people can easily choose the services they want.\u201d",

      "Investors seemed to interpret the ruling as a relatively light slap on the wrist for Google, as the stock price of its corporate parent, Alphabet Inc., surged more than 7% in extended trading. That would translate into a nearly $200 billion increase in Alphabet's market value, if the shares follow a similar trajectory in Wednesday's regular trading session.",
      "Allowing the default search deals to continue is more than just a victory for Google. It\u2019s also a win for Apple, which receives more than $20 billion annually from Google, and other recipients of the payments.",
      "In hearings earlier this year, Apple warned the judge that banning the contracts would deprive the company of money that it funnels into its own innovative research. The Cupertino, California, company also cautioned that the ban could have the unintended consequence of making Google even more powerful by pocketing the money it had been spending on deals while most consumers will still end up flocking to Google\u2019s search engine anyway.",
      "Others, such as the owners of the Firefox search engine, asserted that losing the Google contracts would threaten their future survival by depriving them of essential revenue.",
      "Apple's shares rose 3% in extended trading after the ruling came out.",
      "Mehta refrained from ordering a sale of Chrome because he decided there wasn't adequate proof the browser served as an essential ingredient in Google's search monopoly, making a divestiture \u201ca poor fit for this case.\u201d",
      "Chrome would have been a hot commodity had the judge forced Google to put it on the auction block. Perplexity submitted an unsolicited $34.5 billion offer to buy Chrome last month. And during court testimony earlier this year, a ChatGPT executive left no doubt that service\u2019s owner, OpenAI, would be interested in be interested in buying Chrome, too.",
      "But the judge decided forcing Google to open up parts of its search data to rivals such as DuckDuckGo, Bing, and others will offer he best and fairest way to foster more compelling competition. In doing so, Mehta still narrowed the scope of the Justice Department's request and will limit the access to Google's search index and query histories.",
      "While the wrangling over Mehta's ruling continues, Google is facing another potentially debilitating threat in another antitrust case brought by the Justice Department targeting the digital ad empire that was built up around its search engine. After different federal judge in Virginia declared that some of the technology underlying the ad network to be an illegal monopoly earlier this year, the Justice Department plans to make its case for another proposed breakup  in a trial scheduled to begin later this month.",

      "It turns out Mars has a solid core just like Earth",
      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- Scientists revealed Wednesday that Mars\u2019 innermost core appears to be a solid hunk of metal just like Earth\u2019s.",
      "The Chinese-led research team based their findings on seismic readings from NASA\u2019s InSight lander on Mars, which recorded more than 1,300 marsquakes before shutting down in 2022. The spacecraft landed on a broad plain near Mars\u2019 equator in 2018.",
      "Previous studies pointed to liquid at the heart of the red planet. The latest findings indicate the inner core, while small, is indeed solid and surrounded by molten metal \u2014 a liquid outer core.",
      "The Martian inner core extends from the planet\u2019s center out to a radius of approximately 380 miles (613 kilometers), according to the scientists whose findings appeared in the journal Nature.",
      "It\u2019s likely composed of iron and nickel, the same ingredients as Earth\u2019s core, but quite possibly also enriched with lighter elements like oxygen.",
      "Mars\u2019 liquid outer core is bigger, stretching from 380 miles (613 kilometers) to as much as 1,100 miles (1,800 kilometers) from the planet\u2019s center.",
      "Crystallization of Mars\u2019 inner core may have occurred in the past and still be occurring today, one of the lead investigators, Daoyuan Sun of the University of Science and Technology of China, said in an email.",
      "Mars\u2019 core initially would have been entirely liquid. It\u2019s unclear whether the liquid outer core contains any solid material like droplets or whether there might be \u201ca mushy zone\u201d near the boundary between the inner and outer cores, he added.",
      "For their study, Sun and his team relied primarily on 23 marsquakes recorded by InSight, all of them relatively weak. The epicenters were 740 miles to 1,465 miles (1,200 kilometers to 2,360 kilometers) away from the lander.",

      "While praising the results, the University of Maryland\u2019s Nicholas Schmerr, who was not involved in the study, said questions regarding Mars\u2019 core are far from settled. With InSight out of action, there will be no new recordings of marsquakes to further reveal the red planet\u2019s insides, he noted.",
      "\u201cThere are a lot of details about the exact shape of the inner core and composition of the inner and outer core of Mars that will require a network of InSight like seismometer stations to resolve,\u201d Schmerr said in an email.",
      "More detailed modeling is necessary to develop a clearer picture of how the inner core formed and \"what it reveals about the history of Mars' magnetic field,\u201d said Sun.",
      "At present, Mars lacks a magnetic field, possibly because of the slow crystallization of the planet's solid core, Schmerr added.",

      "The site \u201cis one of the places that I can express myself,\u201d Fattah said, noting he's mostly contributed art dedicated to his favorite video games and placed atop his home country.",
      "Users from around the world also team up to bring larger projects to life \u2014 like \u201cThe Neighborhood,\u201d which sits in a corner of Yuma County, Arizona. Real-life resident Krista Rider, 25, started by drawing two homes. It now has over 50, connected by paths, patches of grass and rivers.",

      "Bulgarian authorities aren't investigating a suspected Russian interference operation involving a plane carrying European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen because they say the interference is now common",
      "LONDON -- Bulgaria will not investigate suspected Russian electronic interference with a top European official's plane, officials said Monday \u2014 because this kind of GPS jamming is now so common.",
      "European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen was flying to Plovdiv, Bulgaria on Sunday when her plane was hit by GPS jamming. It landed safely but the disruption was the latest in a string of almost 80 incidents tracked by The Associated Press and blamed on Russia by Western officials since Moscow invaded Ukraine in 2022.",
      "This year, Nordic and Baltic nations \u2014 including Finland, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia \u2014 have repeatedly warned about greater electronic interference from Russia disrupting communications with planes, ships and drones.",
      "While Russian authorities suggest the jamming is defensive \u2014 to protect key cities and military infrastructure from Ukrainian drone attacks \u2014 Baltic officials say the depth of electronic interference has increased, causing navigation failures far from Russia's borders.",
      "In 2024, a plane carrying the British defense secretary had its satellite signal jammed as it flew near Russian territory, while a Finnish airline temporarily suspended flights to the Estonian city of Tartu.",
      "NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte said the interference experienced by von der Leyen's plane was part of a complex campaign by Russia against Europe which could have \u201cpotentially disastrous effects.\u201d",
      "Satellite communications systems \u2014 known collectively as the Global Navigation Satellite System or GNSS \u2014 receive precise time signals from satellites around 20,000 kilometers (12,400 miles) away in space. A smartphone, car, marine or aircraft navigation system compares how long it takes to receive signals from several different satellites to calculate an exact location.",
      "But the signals can be interfered with \u2014 commonly known as jamming or spoofing.",
      "Jamming means a receiver is overwhelmed by a strong radio signal transmitted in the same range where GNSS and other satellite navigation signals operate, leaving the receiver unable to fix a location or time. Spoofing involves transmitting fake signals which imitate a real GNSS satellite signal \u2014 commonly known as GPS \u2014 to mislead a phone, ship or aircraft into thinking it is in a different place.",
      "In a military context, jamming could be used to stop an incoming missile or drone attack, whereas the idea behind spoofing is to \u201ccreate deception,\u201d said Thomas Withington, an expert in electronic warfare at the Royal United Services Institute in London.",
      "It's possible that Israel used spoofing technology to fly into Iranian airspace in June, when it killed top generals and struck nuclear sites, Withington suggested. Spoofing, he said, could have helped Israel deceive Iranian radar.",
      "Long before the invasion of Ukraine, Russian authorities deployed spoofing technology around the Kremlin in Moscow, causing chaos for taxi drivers or other motorists using GPS.",
      "Russia \u201cdoes not mind\u201d if its own infrastructure is affected, as long as enemy activity is deterred, said Withington.",
      "In August, Latvia\u2019s Electronic Communications Office said it had identified at least three hot spots for electronic interference along borders with Russia in the Kaliningrad, Leningrad and Pskov regions. All three regions host important Russian military bases.",
      "In April 2024, Finland's national carrier Finnair temporarily suspended flights to Tartu, Estonia after it said two of its planes were prevented from landing because of GPS disruptions. At that time, Tartu airport required approaching planes to use GPS to land, although planes have \u2014 and use \u2014 other forms of navigation.",

      "Oliver McCann, a British AI music creator, uses AI to produce songs across various genres",
      "LONDON -- When pop groups and rock bands practice or perform, they rely on their guitars, keyboards and drumsticks to make music. Oliver McCann, a British AI music creator who goes by the stage name imoliver, fires up his chatbot.",
      "McCann's songs span a range of genres, from indie-pop to electro-soul to country-rap. There\u2019s just one crucial difference between McCann and traditional musicians.",
      "\u201cI have no musical talent at all,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t sing, I can\u2019t play instruments, and I have no musical background at all.\"",
      "McCann, 37, who has a background as a visual designer, started experimenting with AI to see if it could boost his creativity and \"bring some of my lyrics to life.\u201d Last month, he signed with independent record label Hallwood Media after one of his tracks racked up 3 million streams, in what's billed as the first time a music label has inked a contract with an AI music creator.",
      "McCann is an example of how ChatGPT-style AI song generation tools like Suno and Udio have spawned a wave of synthetic music. A movement most notably highlighted by a fictitious group, Velvet Sundown, that went viral even though all its songs, lyrics and album art were created by AI.",
      "It fueled debate about AI's role in music while raising fears about \"AI slop\" \u2014 automatically generated low quality mass produced content. It also cast a spotlight on AI song generators that are democratizing song making but threaten to disrupt the music industry.",
      "Experts say generative AI is set to transform the music world. However, there are scant details, so far, on how it's impacting the $29.6 billion global recorded music market, which includes about $20 billion from streaming.",
      "The most reliable figures come from music streaming service Deezer, which estimates that 18% of songs uploaded to its platform every day are purely AI generated, though they only account for a tiny amount of total streams, hinting that few people are actually listening. Other, bigger streaming platforms like Spotify haven't released any figures on AI music.",
      "Udio declined to comment on how many users it has and how many songs it has generated. Suno did not respond to a request for comment. Both have free basic levels as well as pro and premium tiers that come with access to more advanced AI models.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a total boom. It\u2019s a tsunami,\u201d said Josh Antonuccio, director of Ohio University's School of Media Arts and Studies. The amount of AI generated music \u201cis just going to only exponentially increase\u201d as young people grow up with AI and become more comfortable with it, he said.",
      "Yet generative AI, with its ability to spit out seemingly unique content, has divided the music world, with musicians and industry groups complaining that recorded works are being exploited to train AI models that power song generation tools.",
      "Record labels are trying to fend off the threat that AI music startups pose to their revenue streams even as they hope to tap into it for new earnings, while recording artists worry that it will devalue their creativity.",
      "Three major record companies, Sony Music Entertainment, Universal Music Group and Warner Records, filed lawsuits last year against Suno and Udio for copyright infringement. In June, the two sides also reportedly entered negotiations that could go beyond settling the lawsuits and set rules for how artists are paid when AI is used to remix their songs.",
      "GEMA, a German royalty collection society, has sued Suno, accusing it of generating music similar to songs like \u201cMambo No. 5\u201d by Lou Bega and \u201cForever Young\u201d by Alphaville.",
      "More than 1,000 musicians, including Kate Bush, Annie Lennox and Damon Albarn, released a silent album to protest proposed changes to U.K. laws on AI they fear would erode their creative control. Meanwhile, other artists, such as will.i.am, Timbaland and Imogen Heap, have embraced the technology.",
      "Some users say the debate is just a rehash of old arguments about once-new technology that eventually became widely used, such as AutoTune, drum machines and synthesizers.",

I see it as any other tool that we have,\u201d said Scott Smith, whose AI band, Pulse Empire, was inspired by 1980s British synthesizer-driven groups like New Order and Depeche Mode.",
      "Smith, 56 and a semi-retired former U.S. Navy public affairs officer in Portland, Oregon, said \u201cmusic producers have lots of tools in their arsenal\u201d to enhance recordings that listeners aren't aware of.",
      "Like McCann, Smith never mastered a musical instrument. Both say they put lots of time and effort into crafting their music.",
      "Once Smith gets inspiration, it takes him just 10 minutes to write the lyrics. But then he'll spend as much as eight to nine hours generating different versions until the song \u201cmatches my vision.\u201d",
      "McCann said he'll often create up to 100 different versions of a song by prompting and re-prompting the AI system before he\u2019s satisfied.",
      "AI song generators can churn out lyrics as well as music, but many experienced users prefer to write their own words.",
      "\u201cAI lyrics tend to come out quite cliche and quite boring,\u201d McCann said.",
      "Lukas Rams, a Philadelphia-area resident who makes songs for his AI band Sleeping With Wolves, said AI lyrics tend to be \u201cextra corny\u201d and not as creative as a human, but can help get the writing process started.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019ll do very basic rhyme schemes, and it\u2019ll keep repeating the same structure,\u201d said Rams, who writes his own words, sometimes while putting his kids to bed and waiting for them to fall asleep. \u201cAnd then you\u2019ll get words in there that are very telling of AI-generated lyrics, like \u2018neon,\u2019 anything with \u2018shadows\u2019.\u201d",
      "Rams used to play drums in high school bands and collaborated with his brother on their own songs, but work and family life started taking up more of his time.",
      "Then he discovered AI, which he used to create three albums for Sleeping With Wolves. He's been taking it seriously, making a CD jewel case with album art. He plans to post his songs, which combine metalcore and EDM, more widely online.",
      "\u201cI do want to start putting this up on YouTube or socials or distribution or whatever, just to have it out there,\u201d Rams said. \u201cI might as well, otherwise I\u2019m literally the only person that hears this stuff.\u201d",
      "Experts say AI's potential to let anyone come up with a hit song is poised to shake up the music industry's production pipeline.",
      "\"Just think about what it used to cost to make a hit or make something that breaks,\" Antonuccio said. \"And that just keeps winnowing down from a major studio to a laptop to a bedroom. And now it\u2019s like a text prompt \u2014 several text prompts.\u201d",
      "But he added that AI music is still in a \u201cWild West\u201d phase because of the lack of legal clarity over copyright. He compared it to the legal battles more than two decades ago over file-sharing sites like Napster that heralded the transition from CDs to digital media and eventually paved the way for today's music streaming services.",
      "Creators hope AI, too, will eventually become a part of the mainstream music world.",
      "\u201cI think we\u2019re entering a world where anyone, anywhere could make the next big hit,\u201d said McCann. \u201cAs AI becomes more widely accepted among people as a musical art form, I think it opens up the possibility for AI music to be featured in charts.\u201d",

      "For decades, U.S. Open women's singles champions received a replica trophy that was much smaller than the ones the men's title winners were allowed to take home",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Coco Gauff was surprised at how much tinier the replica trophy she got to keep after winning this year's French Open was than the trophy she posed with on court at Roland-Garros for all the world to see. She even did a TikTok about the discrepancy, drawing more than 2 million views.",
      "Why was Gauff so taken aback by what she called the \u201c miniature version \u201d?",
      "\u201cI honestly did not know the size it was going to be. ... I know you never really take the original, but when I won the U.S. Open, they gave me the same size (trophy), with my name engraved on it,\u201d Gauff told The Associated Press. \u201cSo I just assumed that Roland Garros would be the same.\u201d",
      "Actually, it turns out Gauff's 2023 championship at the U.S. Open marked the first time the women's singles winner in New York was given a silver cup significantly larger than the one that is used in the postmatch ceremony. Her replica hardware is 19 1/2 inches tall, the same as both the original and keepsake men's trophies \u2014 and 7 1/2 inches bigger than the original women's trophy.",
      "That one, like the original men's, is displayed during the tournament in a locked glass box near where players enter the event's main arena and will be briefly handed to, then taken away from, whoever wins the women's final in Arthur Ashe Stadium this Saturday.",
      "From 1987, when the tradition of providing keepsakes at Flushing Meadows began, until two years ago, the female champion took home a 12-inch-tall copy. But the U.S. Tennis Association asked Tiffany & Co. to create replicas for the women to match the size of what the men are allowed to keep. That change coincided with the 50th anniversary of the tournament's 1973 move to pay equal prize money to women and men at then-player Billie Jean King's urging.",
      "\u201cEquality is in our DNA here at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center. Everything we do, we\u2019re very intentional about equality ... and we wanted to do the same as it relates to the champion\u2019s trophies,\u201d U.S. Open tournament director Stacey Allaster said in an interview.",

(we wanted) to be able to award the singles champions the same sizes.\u201d",
      "King wasn't aware of the switch until the AP asked her about it.",

      "Lila was one of 27 Camp Mystic campers and counselors swept to their deaths when fast-rising floodwaters of the Guadalupe River roared through the girls\u2019 summer camp. All told, the destructive flooding in Texas on the Fourth of July killed at least 136 people and washed away homes and vehicles.",

      "Gov. Greg Abbott has scheduled a bill signing ceremony on Friday with legislative leaders and some of the Camp Mystic parents.",

One allocates $240 million from the state's rainy day fund for disaster relief, along with money for warning sirens and improved weather forecasting.",

      "When Abbott announced plans to address flooding disaster relief as part of a special session, Childress said, some parents raised concerns that camp safety might get overlooked. Parents started becoming more organized and discussed what their priorities would be for lawmakers to consider.",

      "PORTLAND, Ore. -- A former Alaska Airlines pilot accused of trying to cut the engines of a passenger flight in 2023 while riding off-duty in the cockpit has reached plea agreements with state and federal prosecutors, his attorney said Thursday.",
      "Attorney Noah Horst declined to discuss details of the agreements ahead of change-of-plea hearings his client, Joseph Emerson, faces Friday in state and federal court in Oregon. He said that Emerson reached the plea agreements because he wants to take responsibility for his actions and hopes to avoid further time behind bars.",
      "Emerson was subdued by the flight crew after trying to cut the engines of a Horizon Air flight from Everett, Washington, to San Francisco on Oct. 22, 2023, while he was riding in an extra seat in the cockpit. The plane was diverted to Portland, where it landed safely with more than 80 people on board.",
      "Emerson told police he was despondent over a friend\u2019s recent death, had taken psychedelic mushrooms about two days earlier, and hadn\u2019t slept in over 40 hours. He has said he believed he was dreaming at the time and that he was trying to wake himself up by grabbing two red handles that would have activated the plane\u2019s fire suppression system and cut off fuel to its engines.",
      "He was charged in federal court with interfering with a flight crew. A state indictment in Oregon separately charged him with 83 counts of endangering another person and one count of endangering an aircraft.",
      "He previously pleaded not guilty to all the charges, but on Friday was expected to plead guilty to the federal charge and no-contest to the state charge, which carries the same legal effect as a guilty plea.",

      "HAMPTON, N.H. -- A New Hampshire teenager on a deep-sea fishing trip this week hauled in a 177-pound (80 kilogram) Atlantic halibut, a fish so big that it weighed more than him and could be a world record.",
      "Jackson Denio, a 13-year-old from Hampton, New Hampshire, was fishing about 100 miles (161 kilometers) off the New England Coast on Cashes Ledge Monday morning when he caught the fish.",

      "Denio had set out on Sunday with about 30 others on an overnight charter trip with Al Gauron\u2019s Deep Sea Fishing and Whale Watching. After everyone had caught plenty of pollock and other fish, Denio told the crew he wanted to catch a shark. They told him to fish at the bottom.",
      "Minutes after he dropped his hook with pollock on it, Denio got a hit and knew he had something big.",
      "Denio fought the fish for about 30 minutes, bringing it near the boat only to have it dive back down. He was eventually able to get the fish to the surface, guided by the crew and cheered on by fellow passengers who uttered plenty of oohs and ahhs spiced with profanity as the size of the fish became clear. One person even yelled out \u201cJackson, you are an angel of a man.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m standing there watching him. Then all of a sudden the fish took off it, bit it and started pounding away,\u201d said Jim Walsh, the captain of the vessel that Denio was on. \u201cI looked at him and I said, were you on the bottom?

      "ST. LOUIS PARK, Minn. -- The shooter who killed two schoolchildren and injured 21 other people at a Catholic church in Minneapolis was caught on video visiting a suburban gun shop the weekend before the attack, but the owner of the store said Thursday that his staff saw no warning signs in his conduct.",
      "The video shows that Robin Westman spent around 40 minutes at Frontiersman Sports in St. Louis Park on Aug. 23. Westman examined several guns and ultimately bought a revolver, owner Kory Krause told The Associated Press. Westman had already passed the required background checks and had a valid permit to purchase the gun, he said.",
      "But the revolver wasn't one of the guns Westman used in the shootings at the Church of the Annunciation on Aug. 27, when it was full of students from the affiliated Annunciation Catholic School who had gathered for their first Mass of the academic year. Investigators recovered a semiautomatic assault-style rifle, a shotgun and a different handgun at the scene, and said Westman was legally entitled to buy them. Krause said none came from his store.",
      "Westman, 23, attended the school for eighth grade and Westman's mother formerly worked for the parish, but investigators are still trying to determine a motive. Westman died by suicide after firing 116 rifle rounds through the church\u2019s stained-glass windows.",
      "As first reported by KSTP-TV, the security video shows Westman handling several firearms and talking with employees and other customers. Krause wasn't in the store at the time, but he said he promptly shared the video with investigators and is cooperating with them.",
      "Krause stressed that nothing in Westman's conduct raised any concerns among his staffers, who he said are trained to watch for warning signs.",
      "\u201cThis person said all the right things, they checked all the right boxes, asked all the questions, they were friendly, talkative, making jokes, laughing, knowledgeable about guns, handled a lot of guns that were not the type of guns you would think are of the interest of somebody looking to do a mass shooting,\u201d Krause told AP.",

      "The deadly strike on a boat U.S. officials say was carrying drugs from Venezuela may have marked a stunning shift, but escalating pressure on the South American country has defined much of Secretary of State Marco Rubio\u2019s quarter-century in politics",
      "FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. -- The deadly strike on a boat U.S. officials say was carrying drugs from Venezuela may have marked a stunning shift in the countries\u2019 relations, but escalating pressure on the South American nation has defined much of Secretary of State Marco Rubio's quarter-century in politics.",
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s top diplomat, a former Florida senator, has depicted Venezuela as a vestige of the communist ideology in the Western Hemisphere. Rubio has consistently pushed for the ouster of its leader, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, advocated for economic sanctions and even argued for American military intervention.",
      "\u201cI think that U.S. armed forces should only be used in cases of national security threats,\u201d he said in a 2018 interview with Univision. \u201cI think there is a strong argument that can be made right now that Venezuela and Maduro\u2019s regime have become a threat to the region and to the U.S.\u201d",
      "Before joining the administration, Rubio had represented a more interventionist wing of the Republican Party that at times seemed at odds with Trump's \u201cAmerica First\u201d ethos. While Trump has promised no more foreign wars, Rubio and other administration officials have warned of more operations against drug traffickers in Latin America, escalating pressure on an adversary Rubio has long sought to confront.",
      "\"The president has said he wants to wage war on these groups because they\u2019ve been waging war on us for 30 years and no one has responded,\u201d Rubio told reporters Thursday.",
      "Before being tapped as secretary of state and national security adviser, the Florida senator had already exerted influence over U.S. policy toward Latin America during Trump\u2019s first term.",
      "For Rubio, his interest in targeting leftist Latin American leaders has been personal. His parents are Cuban immigrants who arrived in Miami in 1956, a few years before Fidel Castro\u2019s 1959 communist revolution. He grew up in Miami, where many Cubans sought refuge after Castro's rise to power.",
      "His consistent criticism of communism has helped win him support from thousands of members of the Venezuelan diaspora who made Florida their new home to escape crime, economic deprivation and unrest under Maduro and his predecessor, the late Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, who took power in 1999 and began his self-described socialist revolution.",
      "While the U.S. has tried to move past its Cold War-era legacy of interfering and destabilizing governments in Latin America, Rubio frequently advocated for more action, going against Ch\u00e1vez and then Maduro. He tied the struggle of the opposition movement there to that of Cuban exiles.",
      "Now, \u201che sees an opportunity to move forward a much more aggressive U.S. policy toward Latin America,\u201d said Geoff Ramsey, a senior analyst on Venezuela at the Atlantic Council in Washington.",
      "Rubio shared some of the first details about the strike Tuesday despite it being a military operation, posting on social media as Trump briefly announced it in the Oval Office. The White House says 11 people were killed.",
      "A day later, he said \u201cit\u2019ll happen again\u201d and said Trump had authority \u201cunder exigent circumstances to eliminate imminent threats to the United States.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhat will stop them is when you blow them up, when you get rid of them,\u201d Rubio said Wednesday while visiting Mexico.",
      "The Defense Department said late Thursday that two Venezuelan military aircraft flew near a U.S. Navy vessel, calling it \u201ca highly provocative move\u201d and warning Maduro's government against further actions.",
      "The reaction within Trump\u2019s Make America Great Again base to the U.S. strike has been fairly muted, even supportive of it as a drug trafficking effort, unlike the divide that emerged over U.S. intervention in the Israel-Iran conflict.",
      "After Trump bested Rubio in the 2016 GOP primary and later took office in 2017, Rubio became a shadow adviser and was the main driver of sanctions against top-level Venezuelan officials for human rights abuses and ties to drug trafficking.",

She\u2019s accused of fatally shooting agent David Maland in Vermont on Jan. 20, the same day President Donald Trump was inaugurated and signed a sweeping executive order lifting the moratorium on federal executions.",
      "Youngblut initially was charged with using a deadly weapon against law enforcement and discharging a firearm during an assault with a deadly weapon, crimes that were not punishable by the death penalty. But the Trump administration signaled early on that more serious charges were coming as part of its push for more federal executions, and a new indictment released last month charged her with murder of a federal law enforcement agent, assaulting other agents with a deadly weapon and related firearms offenses.",
      "Youngblut is scheduled to be arraigned on the new charges Friday afternoon.",
      "At the time of the shooting, authorities had been watching Youngblut and her companion, Felix Bauckholt, for several days after a Vermont hotel employee reported seeing them carrying guns and wearing black tactical gear. She\u2019s accused of opening fire on border agents who pulled the car over on Interstate 91. An agent fired back, killing Bauckholt and wounding Youngblut.",
      "The pair were among the followers of Jack LaSota, a transgender woman also known as Ziz whose online writing attracted young, highly intelligent computer scientists who shared anarchist beliefs. Members of the group have been tied to the death of one of their own during an attack on a California landlord in 2022, the landlord\u2019s subsequent killing earlier this year, and the deaths of one of the members\u2019 parents in Pennsylvania.",

Another member of the group who is charged with killing the landlord in California had applied for a marriage license with Youngblut. Michelle Zajko, whose parents were killed in Pennsylvania, was arrested with LaSota in Maryland, and has been charged with providing weapons to Youngblut in Vermont.",
      "Vermont abolished its state death penalty in 1972. The last person sentenced to death in the state on federal charges was Donald Fell, who was convicted in 2005 of abducting and killing a supermarket worker five years earlier. But the conviction and sentence were later thrown out because of juror misconduct, and in 2018, he pleaded guilty and was sentenced to life in prison.",

      "Kennedy was killed on Nov. 22, 1963, as shots rang out from the Texas School Book Depository building as his motorcade was ending its parade route. Police arrested Oswald, who worked in the building and was believed to have positioned himself from a sniper's perch on the sixth floor.",

      "A man was released Thursday from a prison in Minnesota where he spent 27 years for a murder he did not commit",
      "A man wrongly convicted of murder who spent nearly three decades in prison after being falsely implicated by a woman who has since confessed to the crime was released Thursday from a Minnesota prison.",
      "The day before, state District Court Judge Marta Chou had vacated Bryan Hooper Sr.'s first-degree murder conviction. He was released Thursday morning from Stillwater Correctional Facility, a Great North Innocence Project spokesperson said.",
      "\u201cToday, the courts have affirmed what Bryan Hooper, his family, his loved ones, and his advocates have always known: Mr. Hooper is an innocent man,\u201d Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty said in a statement. \u201cIt is our duty as prosecutors to hold the correct individuals responsible for their actions, and that duty demands that we acknowledge our mistakes and make things right as quickly as we can.\"",
      "Hooper reunited with his children and planned to enjoy a meal with them and spend time with family, Project spokesperson Hayley Poxleitner said. He plans to make his home for now in the Twin Cities area, where his children live.",
      "In 1998, a jury convicted Hooper of premeditated murder, felony murder while committing burglary and felony murder while committing kidnapping in connection with the death of 77-year-old Ann Prazniak. His conviction hinged largely on testimony from a woman who authorities say has since confessed to the crime.",
      "Police found Prazniak\u2019s body in April 1998 in a cardboard box wrapped with Christmas lights in a closet in her Minneapolis apartment \u2014 her ankles, nose, mouth, wrists and head bound and her body wrapped in garbage bags, blankets and bedding. Her cause of death was ruled asphyxiation, and she died two weeks to a month before police found her body, according to court documents.",
      "Hooper received three life sentences with the possibility of release after 30 years. In 2020, a judge granted his request to vacate two of three first-degree murder charges after he argued he was wrongly convicted and sentenced for three counts of first-degree murder against the same person.",

      "The judge wrote, \u201cThe Court finds that Mr. Hooper\u2019s conviction was tainted by false evidence and that without this false testimony, the jury might have reached a different conclusion.\u201d",

      "Connetquot\u2019s school board voted Tuesday night to approve a proposed settlement in its lawsuit challenging the state regulation.",
      "In exchange, the district agrees to withdraw its appeal of a federal judge\u2019s decision in March that dismissed a lawsuit brought by Connetquot and other Long Island school districts over the state mascot regulation. The school system would, however, be allowed to revert back to the \u201cThunderbirds\u201d name if the state regulation is repealed or overturned, the proposal states.",
      "Joseph Pierce, director of Native American studies at Stony Brook University on Long Island, said it remains to be seen how much the proposed new nickname actually changes the way people describe Connetquot and its teams.",
      "\u201cIn my view, this is a case where nobody really wins,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a shame that people are litigating over this, rather than understanding that Native American people, imagery, and symbols, including the Thunderbird, are not theirs to use.\u201d",

General Assembly that begins Sept. 22, according to an internal State Department memo seen by The Associated Press.",

      "It's just one of many depositories of \u201csecret fresh water\u201d known to exist in shallow salt waters around the world that might some day be tapped to slake the planet\u2019s intensifying thirst, said Brandon Dugan, the expedition's co-chief scientist.",
      "\u201cWe need to look for every possibility we have to find more water for society,\u201d Dugan, a geophysicist and hydrologist at the Colorado School of Mines, told Associated Press journalists who recently spent 12 hours on the drilling platform. The research teams looked in \u201cone of the last places you would probably look for fresh water on Earth.\u201d",

They found fresh or nearly fresh water at both higher and lower depths below the seafloor than they anticipated, suggesting a larger supply even than that.",
      "Their work at sea unfolded over three months from Liftboat Robert, an oceangoing vessel that, once on site, lowers three enormous pillars to the seafloor and squats above the waves. Normally it services offshore petroleum sites and wind farms. This drill-baby-drill mission was different.",

      "\u201cThe water may contain minerals detrimental to human health since it percolated through layers of sediments,\u201d she said. \u201cHowever, a similar process forms the terrestrial aquifers that we use for freshwater, and those typically have very high quality.\u201d",
      "By sequencing DNA extracted from their samples, she said, the researchers can determine which microorganisms are there and \u201clearn how they potentially make a living.\u201d",
      "Techniques will also be used to determine whether it came from glacial ice melt thousands of years ago or is still coming via labyrinthian geologic formations from land.",
      "Researchers will date the water back in the lab, and that will be key in determining whether it is a renewable resource that could be used responsibly. Primordial water is trapped and finite; newer water suggests the aquifer is still connected to a terrestrial source and being refreshed, however slowly.",
      "\u201cYounger means it was a raindrop 100 years ago, 200 years ago,\u201d Dugan said. \u201cIf young, it\u2019s recharging.\u201d",
      "Those questions are for basic science. For society, all sorts of complex questions arise if the basic science affirms the conditions necessary for exploiting the water. Who will manage it? Can it be taken without an unacceptable risk of contaminating the supply from the ocean above? Will it be cheaper or environmentally friendlier than today's energy-hungry desalination plants?",
      "Dugan said if governments decide to get the water, local communities could turn to the aquifers in time of need, such as drought, or when extreme storms flood coastal freshwater reserves and ruin them. The notion of actually using this old buried water is so new that it has not been on the radar of many policymakers or conservationists.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a lesson in how long it can take sometimes to make these things happen and the perseverance that\u2019s needed to get there,\" said Woods Hole geophysicist Rob Evans, whose 2015 expedition helped point the way for 501. \u201cThere\u2019s a ton of excitement that finally they\u2019ve got samples.\"",
      "Still, he sees some red flags. One is that tapping undersea aquifers could draw water away from onshore reserves. Another is that undersea groundwater that seeps out to the seafloor may supply nutrients vital to the ecosystem, and that could be upset.",
      "\"If we were to go out and start pumping these waters, there would almost certainly be unforeseen consequences,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of balance we would need to consider before we started diving in and drilling and exploiting these kinds of things.\u201d",
      "For most in the project, getting to and from Liftboat Robert meant a voyage of seven hours or more from Fall River, Massachusetts, on a supply boat that made round trips every 10 days or so to replenish stocks and rotate people.",
      "On the platform, around the clock, the racket of metal bore pipes and machinery, the drilling grime and the speckled mud mingled with the quieter, cleaner work of scientists in trailers converted to pristine labs and processing posts.",
      "There, samples were treated according to the varying needs of the expedition\u2019s geologists, geochemists, hydrologists, microbiologists, sedimentologists and more.",
      "Passing through clear plastic tubes, muck was sliced into disks like hockey pucks. Machines squeezed water out. Some samples were kept sealed to enable study of ancient gases dissolved in the water. Other samples were frozen, filtered or left as is, depending on the purpose.",
      "After six months of lab analysis, all the science teams of Expedition 501 will meet again \u2014 this time in Germany for a month of collaborative research that is expected to produce initial findings that point to the age and origin of the water.",
      "On July 31, Liftboat Robert cranked up its legs from this place of hidden water to end a mission that lent credence to another passage from \u201cThe Rime of the Ancient Mariner,\" Samuel Taylor Coleridge's classic poem about life, death and mysteries at sea.",
      "In a prelude to the poem, in some editions, Coleridge wrote: \"I readily believe that there are more invisible than visible Natures in the universe.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Anthropic, which operates the Claude artificial intelligence app, has agreed to pay $1.5 billion to settle a class-action lawsuit by book authors who alleged the company took pirated copies of their works to train its chatbot.",
      "The company has agreed to pay authors about $3,000 for each of an estimated 500,000 books covered by the settlement. A trio of authors \u2014 thriller novelist Andrea Bartz and nonfiction writers Charles Graeber and Kirk Wallace Johnson \u2014 sued last year, and now represent a broader group of writers and publishers whose books Anthropic downloaded to train its chatbot Claude.",
      "The landmark settlement could mark a turning point in legal battles between AI companies and the writers, visual artists and other creative professionals who accuse them of copyright infringement. A judge could approve the settlement as soon as Monday.",
      "\"As best as we can tell, it's the largest copyright recovery ever,\" said Justin Nelson, a lawyer for the authors. \"It is the first of its kind in the AI era.\"",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Anthropic Aparna Sridhar deputy general counsel said the settlement \"will resolve the plaintiffs' remaining legacy claims.\"",
      "Sridhar added that the settlement comes after the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California in June ruled that Anthropic's use of legally purchased books to train Claude did not violate U.S. copyright law.",
      "\"We remain committed to developing safe AI systems that help people and organizations extend their capabilities, advance scientific discovery and solve complex problems,\" Sridhar said.",
      "Anthropic, which was founded by former executives with ChatGPT developer OpenAI,\u00a0introduced\u00a0Claude in 2023. Like other generative AI bots, the tool lets users ask natural language questions and then provides\u00a0summarized answers using AI trained on millions of books, articles and other material.",
      "Settlement terms",
      "If Anthropic had not settled, experts say losing the case after a scheduled December trial could have cost the San Francisco-based company even more money.",
      "\"We were looking at a strong possibility of multiple billions of dollars, enough to potentially cripple or even put Anthropic out of business,\" said William Long, a legal analyst for Wolters Kluwer.",
      "U.S. District Judge William Alsup of San Francisco has scheduled a Monday hearing to review the settlement terms.",
      "Books are known to be important sources of data \u2014 in essence, billions of words carefully strung together \u2014 that are needed to build the AI large language models behind chatbots like Anthropic's Claude and its chief rival, OpenAI's ChatGPT.",
      "Alsup's June ruling found that Anthropic had downloaded more than 7 million digitized books that it \"knew had been pirated.\" It started with nearly 200,000 from an online library called Books3, assembled by AI researchers outside of OpenAI to match the vast collections on which ChatGPT was trained.",
      "Debut thriller novel \"The Lost Night\" by Bartz, a lead plaintiff in the case, was among those found in the Books3 dataset.",
      "Anthropic later took at least 5 million copies from the pirate website Library Genesis, or LibGen, and at least 2 million copies from the Pirate Library Mirror, Alsup wrote.",
      "The Authors Guild told its thousands of members last month that it expected \"damages will be minimally $750 per work and could be much higher\" if Anthropic was found at trial to have willfully infringed their copyrights. The settlement's higher award \u2014 approximately $3,000 per work \u2014 likely reflects a smaller pool of affected books, after taking out duplicates and those without copyright.",
      "On Friday, Mary Rasenberger, CEO of the Authors Guild, called the settlement \"an excellent result for authors, publishers, and rightsholders generally, sending a strong message to the AI industry that there are serious consequences when they pirate authors' works to train their AI, robbing those least able to afford it.\"",

    "summary": "A Mike Tyson-Floyd Mayweather fight was announced Thursday. But there are multiple questions surrounding the bout.",
    "story": [
      "The boxing world was hit with a big announcement on Thursday night when former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson and former multi-division champion Floyd Mayweather said they\u00a0agreed to a bout to be held in the spring of 2026.",
      "Details on a date, location, television partner and any potential professional sanctioning of the bout were not immediately released, though both Hall-of-Fame boxers appeared excited about the fight in a press release distributed by CSI Sports.",
      "\"I still can't believe Floyd wants to really do this,\" Tyson said in the release. \"It's going to be detrimental to his health, but he wants to do it, so it's signed and it's happening!\"",
      "\"I've been doing this for 30 years and there hasn't been a single fighter that can tarnish my legacy,\" Mayweather said. \"You already know that if I am going to do something, it's going to be big and it's going to be legendary. I'm the best in the business of boxing. This exhibition will give the fans what they want.\"",
      "Coming Soon pic.twitter.com/lSeyrR0BKO",
      "While Mayweather noted that the bout would be an exhibition, meaning it wouldn't be sanctioned by an athletic commission or count toward either fighter's professional record, this was not confirmed by the fight promoters. But the sanctioning of the bout is just one of multiple outstanding questions surrounding this clash between two of the biggest names in boxing history. Below, we'll break down a few others.",
      "Will it be a professional, sanctioned bout?",
      "This is arguably the biggest question surrounding the bout but it's unlikely to be professionally sanctioned, despite the fact that Tyson just fought his first professional fight in 19 years when he lost to Jake Paul last November. Mayweather has had multiple exhibition bouts since retiring in 2017 following a knockout win against Conor McGregor. But he hasn't fought professionally since then, when he left the ring with a perfect 50-0 record. Mayweather indicated that the fight with Tyson will be an exhibition but he did not immediately respond to a CBS News request for further comment.",
      "What weight class would the fight be held in?",
      "This will largely depend on whether the bout is professional or an exhibition. If it's the former, then the boxers will need to agree on a weight limit that they would both be held to. But if it's an exhibition, which seems to be the case, it's likely that both boxers will enter the ring around the weight they last fought at. That means Mayweather would be around the middleweight limit, while Tyson is likely to be around the 220-pound range he often fought at as a champion in the 1980s and 1990s. Tyson tipped the scales at 230 pounds for his fight with Paul 10 months ago.",
      "Would the fight be held under non-standard rules?",
      "Whether it's a pro fight or an exhibition, there may be other, non-standardized rules in play here. Tyson is 59 years old. Mayweather is 48 years old. Boxers in that age range, when they do enter the ring, tend to perform under different rules and regulations. When Tyson fought Paul last fall, for example, the length of the rounds was reduced to two minutes from the standard three. And it was limited to an eight-round fight, when it normally would have been 10 for a non-championship affair. Both boxers also wore heavier gloves in the bout than is the norm, which is likely to be the case for a Tyson-Mayweather affair, too.",
      "Is this a new trend in boxing?",
      "Boxing exhibitions featuring retired champions is nothing new to the sport. Mayweather and former foe Manny Pacquiao have done so multiple times in recent years. While it may not be a boxing purist's preference, it's not unusual.",
      "What is a bit unique, however, is that this will be Tyson's third fight in approximately six years, after retiring from the sport in 2005. He fought an exhibition against former champion Roy Jones, Jr. in 2020 and Paul last November. Paul, meanwhile, who boxed Tyson as a heavyweight, appears to be moving on to his own exhibition fight against former lightweight champion Gervonta Davis, in an another match between boxers in wildly different weight classes. That fight was\u00a0announced for Nov. 14.",

      "\"I think our discipline wasn't in it early in the game,\" Hurts said. \"Great job by our defense being able to battle and respond. Guys stepped in and filled those roles. We came into this game talking about discipline and focus, and we'll leave it saying the same things.\"",
      "Hurts, Barkley and the rest of the Eagles spent a pregame ceremony where the team raised their 2024 championship banner inside the locker room, per the wishes of coach Nick Sirianni.",
      "\"It's a new team. It's a new journey. We got tested tonight,\" Hurts said. \"We know how they are when Dak is back and they've got their crew all together. We've played better football, but it's always good to say that and find a way to win.\"",
      "Jalen Carter headed right back inside only moments after the banner was raised.",
      "Prescott and Carter exchanged words after the opening kickoff, and Carter spit on Prescott's jersey before backing away. Prescott quickly motioned to a nearby official who threw the flag and sent Carter packing. Fans booed as Carter walked off slowly, the standout defensive tackle holding his helmet in his hands behind his back.",
      "Carter could be headed toward a hefty financial penalty, if not worse, in the first major test of the NFL's increased emphasis this season on sportsmanship.",
      "The ejection was the quickest in a game since 2005, when former Eagles linebacker Jeremiah Trotter Sr. was ejected from the game for a pregame altercation prior to Philadelphia's season opener, notes CBSSports.com's Garrett Podell and Jeff Kerr.",
      "Still one of the NFL's nastiest division rivalries, the game was full of skirmishes and a near-costly unnecessary roughness penalty late in the third against the Eagles that put the Cowboys in position to take the lead.",
      "Dallas running back Miles Sanders, though, fumbled the ball at the 10 and the Super Bowl champions recovered. Prescott made a touchdown-saving diving tackle on cornerback Quinyon Mitchell on the play.",
      "It would be a while until the Eagles got the ball back, thanks to the delay.",
      "The scores by Hurts and Barkley made the Eagles the first defending Super Bowl champions to score touchdown on the first three drives of the season since Green Bay in 2011. Jake Elliott put the finishing touches on the scoring with a 58-yard field goal.",
      "Javonte Williams had a pair of 1-yard touchdown runs - the first on the opening driving after Carter was ejected - and Brandon Aubrey kicked field goals of 41 and 53 yards.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/bill-belichick-college-coaching-debut-north-carolina-pummeled-tcu/",
    "published": "Tue, 02 Sep 2025 05:07:00 -0400",
    "summary": "North Carolina was pummeled by TCU, 48-14, in the college coaching debut of NFL coaching legend Bill Belichick.",
    "story": [
      "Chapel Hill, N.C. \u2014 North Carolina's high-point moment in its first game under coach Bill Belichick came early.",
      "A festive pregame atmosphere led to a roar from the crowd at kickoff. And a season-opening drive moved at a crisp pace to the end zone.",
      "After that, well, Monday night's hyped-up debut turned into a romp by TCU - along with a reminder that even an NFL icon with six Super Bowl titles as a head coach can't just magically turn the Tar Heels into winners after decades of also-ran status.",
      "\"We played competitively but then just couldn't sustain it,\" Belichick said in the familiar low tone from his NFL news conferences after the 48-14 loss. \"Obviously, we have a lot of work to do. We need to do a better job all the way around \u2014 coaching, playing, all three phases of the game.\"",
      "CBSSports.com's Shehan Jeyarajah points out\u00a0that, \"The NFL is generally a defensive league where teams are close to evenly matched. At the college level, Belichick will come to understand just how big the talent differentials are between the good and bad teams \u2014 and he was on the wrong end.\"",
      "The blowout put a major damper on a night buzzing with optimism for the 73-year-old Belichick's college debut, only to see the Horned Frogs dominate so thoroughly they drove UNC fans to the Kenan Stadium exits by midway through the third quarter.",
      "\"It was a great environment tonight,\" Belichick said. \"I mean, the fans were awesome. There was great energy in the stadium. We just didn't do enough to keep it going. We've got to play better for the energy to be sustainable.\"",
      "By the end of the game, Kenan was a ghost town and the Tar Heels had given up more points than in any previous opener in their history, according to Sportradar.",
      "It was a jarring result, even amid uncertainty as to exactly what to expect from UNC with roughly 70 new players between transfers and incoming recruits. There were few highlights after that opening drive beyond Kaleb Cost's athletic reeling in of a deflected ball for an interception and quarterback Max Johnson returning in relief from a serious leg injury sustained in last year's opener at Minnesota.",
      "\"We're just moving forward, just moving forward,\" said Cost, offering an unintentional callback to Belichick's famous \"We're on to Cincinnati\" response to reporters' questions after a blowout loss to the Kansas City Chiefs in 2014.",
      "UNC was picked to finish eighth in the 17-team Atlantic Coast Conference, though that seemed almost entirely predicated on Belichick's mere presence. This is a man, after all, who teamed with legendary quarterback Tom Brady to win six world titles in his 24-year run with the New England Patriots. Someone who won more regular-season and playoff games in the NFL (333) than anyone other than Don Shula.",
      "So there was spectacle to Belichick's debut as he took the field sporting a familiar look from the pro sideline with a gray hoodie - only this one bearing the name \"Carolina Football\" in that distinctive shade of light blue.",
      "An estimated 5,000 fans packed onto a main campus quad for a pregame concert and throngs lined the team's walk to Kenan, where UNC has sold out all its season tickets \u2014 at an elevated price with Belichick's arrival \u2014 and single-game seats for the season. The game attracted ESPN to hold a pregame studio show from the sideline with a crew that included former Alabama coach Nick Saban, with Belichick popping over briefly to say hello.",
      "There were notable former UNC athletes from years past, including NBA legend Michael Jordan \u2014 who won a national championship under Dean Smith here in 1982 \u2014 and former UNC star linebacker Lawrence Taylor, who played under Belichick when he was an assistant and eventually defensive coordinator with the New York Giants during the 1980s.",
      "And it wasn't hard to spot Jordon Hudson \u2014 Belichick's 24-year-old girlfriend who has generated her own tabloid-level curiosity \u2014 as she walked the pregame sideline sporting Carolina blue pants shimmering with sequins-like additions on the legs.",
      "Belichick roamed the field during pregame warmups for the better part of a half-hour. At one point, he stood on the UNC end of the field with general manager Michael Lombardi, then shared a quick handshake with ACC commissioner Jim Phillips as he made his way toward midfield.",
      "Once there, Belichick shook hands with members of the officiating crew and watched the Horned Frogs warm up.",
      "The Tar Heels got off to a sprint of a start with an 83-yard drive that ended with Caleb Hood scoring through the right side from 8 yards out, followed by forcing a quick punt. But things soon started getting away.",
      "TCU \u2014 which lost in a similar scenario as the \"other\" team in Deion Sanders' debut at Colorado two years ago \u2014 never looked rattled or thrown. Bud Clark provided a highlight by jumping Gio Lopez's sideline throw for an easy 25-yard pick-six as TCU took a 20-7 lead into the break.",
      "It quickly got worse after halftime. Kevorian Barnes sprinted through the right side and down the sideline for a 75-yard touchdown on the first snap. Trent Battle added his own big run, slipping through the left side untouched and going 28 yards for a TD.",
      "And finally, Devean Deal had a 37-yard scoop-and-score on Lopez's fumble to make it 41-7 and start the Kenan exodus.",
      "By the end, UNC had just 222 total yards, 320 fewer than TCU, and a short week to fix problems before visiting Charlotte on Saturday.",
      "\"They were clearly the better team tonight,\" Belichick said. \"They deserved to win and they did it decisively.\"",

      "Susan Monarez was fired from the position less than a month after her Senate confirmation. In an opinion piece\u00a0in the Wall Street Journal on Thursday, Monarez said that Kennedy \"pressured me to resign or face termination\" in an Aug. 25 meeting.",
      "\"One of the troubling directives from that meeting more than a week ago: I was told to preapprove the recommendations of a vaccine advisory panel newly filled with people who have publicly expressed antivaccine rhetoric,\" she wrote.",
      "The piece was published shortly before Kennedy testified before the Senate Finance Committee, where he faced tough questioning about his vaccine policies.",

      "\"So she's lying today to the American people in the Wall Street Journal?\" Wyden asked.",

      "\"I told her I didn't want her to have a rule that she's not going to sign onto it,\" Kennedy said when asked whether he told Monarez to accept the recommendations.",
      "At another point in the hearing, Kennedy claimed he asked Monarez to resign \"because I asked her, 'Are you a trustworthy person?' and she said no.\"",
      "In a statement Thursday afternoon, lawyers for Monarez said Kennedy's claims were \"false, and at times, patently ridiculous.\"",
      "\"Dr. Monarez stands by what she said in her op-ed in The Wall Street Journal, would repeat it all under oath and continues to support the vision she outlined at her confirmation hearing that science will control her decisions,\" attorneys Mark Zaid and Abbe Lowell said.",

    "story": [
      "More than 1,000 current and former Health and Human Services employees penned an open letter Wednesday calling for HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to either resign or be fired.",
      "The letter \u2014 whose signatories were not publicly named \u2014 was released at a tense time for the health agency. Last week, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Susan Monarez was fired, and several other top CDC officials resigned from their jobs in protest. Staff are also reeling from layoffs, changes to the vaccine approval system \u2014 led by Kennedy, a longtime vaccine skeptic \u2014 and a shooting outside the CDC headquarters last month.",
      "Wednesday's letter accused Kennedy of \"endangering the nation's health.\" It cited last week's upheaval at the CDC, the Food and Drug Administration's decision to rescind emergency approvals that made the COVID-19 vaccines available for young children, and the elevation of \"political ideologues who pose as scientific experts\" to key vaccine approval posts.",
      "It called for Kennedy to resign, and said that if he declines to leave his post voluntarily, President Trump should pick a new HHS secretary.",
      "\"We swore an oath to support and defend the United States Constitution and to serve the American people. Our oath requires us to speak out when the Constitution is violated and the American people are put at risk,\" the letter reads.",
      "The letter was released by a group called Save HHS, which penned a similar open letter last month urging Kennedy to \"stop spreading inaccurate health information.\"",
      "The group said the signatories for Wednesday's letter were provided to members of Congress, but weren't publicly listed due to security and privacy concerns.",
      "HHS Communications Director Andrew Nixon responded to the letter by defending Kennedy's record and arguing he is working to restore trust in a \"broken\" CDC.",
      "\"From his first day in office, he pledged to check his assumptions at the door \u2014 and he asked every HHS colleague to do the same,\" Nixon said. \"That commitment to evidence-based science is why, in just seven months, he and the HHS team have accomplished more than any health secretary in history in the fight to end the chronic disease epidemic and Make America Healthy Again.\"",
      "Separately, nine former CDC directors wrote a New York Times op-ed on Monday that castigated Kennedy for making decisions they said were \"unlike anything we had ever seen at the agency,\" and argued Monarez's firing \"adds considerable fuel to this raging fire.\"",
      "Kennedy is set to testify before the Senate Finance Committee on Thursday morning, where he's likely to face questions about the tumult at HHS.",
      "Last week, the White House confirmed that Monarez was fired. Her lawyers called the firing \"legally deficient\" and said she was \"targeted\" because she \"refused to rubber-stamp unscientific, reckless directives and fire dedicated public health experts.\"",
      "At least four other senior CDC leaders also stepped down last week, in some cases penning resignation letters that decried cuts to the CDC, accused the Trump administration of an \"ongoing weaponizing of public health\" and blasted \"misinformation\" about vaccines.",
      "Republican Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, a physician who chairs the Senate health committee, said the resignations will \"require oversight.\" He also sits on the Senate Finance Committee.",
      "Meanwhile, Kennedy ousted every member of a CDC panel responsible for making vaccine recommendations earlier this year, in some cases replacing them with people who have questioned the safety of vaccines.",

      "In his new book, \"It Doesn't Have to Hurt: Your Smart Guide to a Pain-Free Life\" (published September 2 by Simon & Schuster), Dr. Sanjay Gupta, a neurosurgeon and chief medical correspondent for CNN, writes about chronic pain, and the innovative techniques now being used to study and treat it.",
      "Read an excerpt below, and don't miss Jane Pauley's interview with Dr. Gupta on \"CBS Sunday Morning\" August 31!",

      "Prefer to listen?\u00a0Audible\u00a0has a 30-day free trial available right now.",
      "Over a hundred years ago, William Osler, the Canadian physician and founding influence on modern medicine and medical education, is said to have instructed his students to \"listen to the patient. Quite often he is telling you the diagnosis.\"",
      "Today, the urgent search for meaningful insights into chronic pain has given that idea a new relevance, with impressive results. Health care providers now encourage patients to engage as partners in the treatment process. Research programs now routinely include people with lived experience\u2014patients, family members, caregivers\u2014as members of committees that advise and direct pain studies.",
      "Pain scientists are calling for a dramatic change that puts greater emphasis on the studies that draw first from people's real-life pain experience, then follows up with lab-based research to develop targeted solutions for effective pain management. This reverse translational research flips the classic bench-to-bedside process that starts in a laboratory and ends with a clinical trial.",
      "Reverse translational research begins with the patient's real-world experience and then tries to decipher the mechanisms through brain imaging and blood tests, correlated with the patient's symptoms and self-reports. Instead of the bench to the bedside, which was taught when I was in medical school, this is bedside to the bench research. The bench scientists then work with the findings to learn more about the basic mechanisms.",
      "Prasad Shirvalkar, a pain physician, neuroscientist, and the director of the Shirvalkar Lab at the University of California at San Francisco, used such a hybrid approach a couple of years ago to find the unicorn in pain science: objective biomarkers of a subjective experience. He started by implanting electrodes in the brains of patients, to measure brain signals. He then followed the trial participants home and, with the use of continuous surveys and digital monitoring, tracked their pain through everyday life and correlated those results with direct readings from the brain. The combination of lab-based and home-based monitoring led to a groundbreaking series of clinical trials that made headlines around the world. In 2023, his team was able to directly map signals of chronic pain for the first time in history. In more recent trials, the team used electrodes implanted in the brain to map the unique neural signature of each participant's pain experience over thousands of hours. The result was the ability, for the first time, to create an objective measure of an individual patient's subjective pain experiences.",
      "In a more recent and ongoing trial, the maps and electrodes were used to predict a pain burst, which was followed by the delivery of a carefully calibrated electrical impulse\u2014deep brain stimulation (DBS) to interrupt the pain, reducing or even eliminating it altogether. Predicting when pain might occur, objectively measuring its severity, and then quickly inhibiting it is in many ways the ultimate achievement.",
      "Ed Mowery's story is about someone using this remarkable treatment approach, but first a caveat. It's not currently available, or even feasible, for general use, so it can't deliver on the dream of a cure for chronic pain. But it does deliver evidence that pain circuitry in the brain is measurable and malleable. It can be targeted and treated, and we'll likely see the emergence of a range of approaches that can do so without brain surgery.",

    "story": [
      "Ed Mowery, the founder and lead singer of a death metal band, suffered unfathomable pain for decades: \"It was 24/7, 365,\" he said, likening it to \"lightning bolt razor snakes in my legs and nerve pain in my arms.",
      "\"Have you ever had a really bad burn when you're cooking? Imagine that really bad burn, multiply it by, say, 20 to 30, and then apply it from the neck down. And on top of that burn was the lightning bolt razor snakes in my legs and the crazy nerve burn in my arms. So, it was several different kinds of pain at once.\"",
      "It's a rare condition affecting 200,000 people in the U.S., called complex regional pain syndrome, or CRPS. But doctors could find no cause for it.",
      "\"There was nothing to point to and says, 'This is why it's hurting.' It was just a sort of unrelenting pain,\" said Dr. Sanjay Gupta, best known as chief medical correspondent at CNN. A neurosurgeon and author, his latest book, \"It Doesn't Have to Hurt,\" explores the mystery of pain \u2013 mundane aches and pains, or excruciating pain like Mowery suffered.",
      "A lot of Americans are hurting; the CDC says approximately 20% are in pain. And while writing the book, Gupta found one of them was his mother \u2013 83-year-old Damyanti Gupta, who had a fall right outside her front door.",
      "\"I had osteoporosis,\" she said, \"and I think one of my bones must have given up, I think, because I didn't trip over anything.\"",
      "Imaging showed a compressed lumbar vertebra. But pain doesn't appear on X-rays and MRIs.\u00a0 \"You know how they ask you, doctors tell me, 'From a scale of one to 10, what is your pain?' I would've said 100,\" Damyanti said. \"You don't really realize 'til you have it. I never realized that pain can be that terrible. You don't want to even live anymore.\"",
      "\"I don't want to live anymore \u2013 coming from my mom, obviously it's really painful to hear,\" said Dr. Gupta. \"But also this was someone who'd never complained about anything. So, you had a sense of just how significant an impact this was on her.\"",
      "Spinal surgery successfully repaired the injured spine, and immediately Damyanti's pain went from 100 to about 3.",
      "The surprising source of pain",
      "As a brain surgeon, Gupta sees patients in pain every day, but he personally experienced serious pain when he was a kid who thought he could vault over a spiked fence. \"I don't know what I was thinking,\" he said. \"But I didn't make it. And this spike from the fence went right through the back of my skin on the side, and came right out the front. So, I was essentially pinned and impaled on top of this fence.\"",
      "As the shock wore off, the future doctor \u2013 still on the fence \u2013 took note: \"The pain started to come in waves. So it was there, felt like someone was sort of slapping my back, but then after a while it just didn't hurt that much anymore. And there was a couple of times when I had to reach back around and say, 'It's still there, right?' Even at the time, that struck me as a really surprising experience. Like, I had a hot poker thing going through my back, and yet I'm not feeling pain? Like, why would that be?\"",
      "Later, he learned the reason why. \"It took years to sort of understand this,\" he said. \"My body's endogenous opioid system \u2013 we have our own opioid system \u2013 it reacted, and it reacted in a big, big way. Because the body is just flooded with all these opioids and it improves my mood, it decreases my memory of the painful experience, and obviously it helps with the overall hurt.",
      "\"These are endorphins, and by the way, endorphins \u2013 endo, which means comes from your body, and phin, morphine\u2014so it's like your body's own natural morphine,\" he said.",
      "After years of suffering despite pain medication (including morphine), Ed Mowery joined a clinical trial at the University of California at San Francisco, which not only found the source of those \"lightning bolt razor snakes,\" but would make headlines around the world.",

      "Treating Chronic Pain Is Hard. An Experimental Approach Shows Promise (New York Times)",
      "The source of the pain, said Gupta, was \"the brain. It's hard to conceptualize, I realize this. But Ed is sort of this daredevil guy. He had a lot of injuries over his life. He had had a knee operation, and it was after that knee operation that, for some reason, his brain had taken the experience of his knee surgery and started to memorize it, and got it a little bit wrong. So instead of saying, 'Hey, your knee hurts,' it just went into this hyper-drive. The best metaphor would be something known as 'phantom pain.' That's when someone loses a limb and then they still hurt, even though that limb doesn't even exist anymore. How can that happen? The brain. The brain is creating that pain. Why that's happening exactly, we're not sure.\"",
      "\"Shutting off\" the pain",
      "Mowery had volunteered for a study in deep brain stimulation and pain, and three rounds of brain surgery. \"I had nodes sticking out of my head,\" Mowery said. \"And I had 144 wires going to two computers. And I had a turban on my head. And I also had a lot more hair!\"",
      "Gupta said, \"After weeks they were able to draw this link between Ed's pain and these changes in the brain. And what they found with Ed was not only could they start to predict that Ed was gonna have pain, they could quantify how bad that pain was likely to be, and they could even interrupt the pain by giving a little stimulation. So even before the pain would get to conscious awareness, the stimulator would go off and it would start to interrupt that pain cycle.\"",
      "Gupta predicts Mowery's story is just the beginning: \"What these doctors were able to do, they were essentially able to put these probes all over the brain and just leave these probes in sort of to listen to Ed's brain.\"",
      "Even now, a computer can recognize his pain coming on \u2013 and shut it off.",
      "It's been life-changing for Mowery, who spoke about the clinical trial at the National Institutes of Health: \"The last two days of testing, the signal started working, and killing my pain,\" he said. \"I was beside myself.\"",
      "Though a small study, the implications for managing all sorts of pain are far-reaching. \u00a0As Gupta explains, the brain is the source of every sensation of pain, from a paper cut, to a broken vertebra, to \"razor snakes.\"",
      "I asked Mowery, \"Did you know when you signed up for this, what you were signing up for?\"",
      "\"It's funny you ask that question, because when I first found out, I said, 'There's no way. I'm not doing three brain surgeries. You're not going into my brain. No way,\" Mowery said. \"And then a year-and-a-half later, I was in so much pain, I just didn't care anymore.\"",
      "\"You seem very comfortable when you describe this as your brain,\" I said.",
      "\"It took me a while to wrap my brain around the fact that this is a brain disease,\" Mowery replied. \"It took a long time for me to just say, oh, you know, this is actually all in my head. But it wasn't imaginary. It was real.\"",
      "Today, Mowery is playing his music again, and looking forward to touring internationally with his band. \"I never lost hope,\" he said, \"because I knew something would come along to help me. And I think that's part of what got me through all this, was my attitude towards the whole thing.\"",

    "published": "Fri, 05 Sep 2025 16:18:29 -0400",
    "summary": "Armani never relinquished control over the multibillion-dollar company he created, a key to his enormous success.",
    "story": [
      "Giorgio Armani leaves a legacy not only as a seminal figure in the history of fashion, but also as a visionary business leader who built a globally recognized brand and multibillion-dollar business empire, industry experts said after his death Thursday at age 91.",
      "\"Armani made certain that his vision was consistent and that it was always classy, even down to presentation in the Armani Exchange stores,\" Shawn Grain Carter, an associate professor at the Fashion Institute of Technology, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Armani, or \"Re Giorgio\" (King George) as the Italians call him,\u00a0famously created luxury looks for Hollywood starlets on the red carpet while also producing stylish accessories and clothing for everyday consumers at casual price points.",
      "While meticulously tailored clothing made from quality fabrics has always been at the heart of the Armani brand, the designer expanded his business over the years to include not just perfumes and accessories but home furnishings, cosmetics, books, flowers \u2014 and even chocolates. Connecting them all was sophisticated design, which Armani wove into all things he put his name on.",
      "\"He was masterful in sticking to his vision, but executing it in a way that would be accessible luxury, a quiet luxury, but still tasteful and elegantly crafted,\" said Grain Carter.",
      "Among Armani's most celebrated contributions and successful business maneuvers was the power suit, a softly tailored, ready-to-wear take on office attire that quickly rose in popularity among the American business class.",
      "Introduced in the '70s, the Armani suit was a bold deviation from the rigid, restrictive suits businessmen were accustomed to wearing. Armani's elegantly tailored suits quickly became a must in every well-heeled man's closet. Beth Dincuff, an associate professor at Parsons School of Design, said Armani manifested the idea of a \"sophisticated man who cared about how he looked, who was aware of his physique and who wanted to show it off in a new way.\"",
      "Armani soon brought that masculine sensibility to women's fashion with the pantsuit, a shoulder-padded jacket and tailored trousers. This gave women a refined and sophisticated option for the office that projected confidence and power.",
      "\"That's attributed to Giorgio Armani \u2014 making it okay for a woman to wear a pantsuit but still look like a woman in terms of a power aesthetic,\" said Grain Carter.",
      "Armani's design decisions also tapped into the cultural moment. The designer\u00a0told CBS News in 2006 that his new line of women's clothes was in response to the feminist movement. Women needed their own version of the traditional men's suit jacket, he thought.",
      "Celebrities and Armani",
      "Using celebrities to elevate the Armani brand was another decision that cemented the Italian designer's business success. He began by outfitting Richard Gere in the 1980 neo-noir crime drama \"American Gigolo.\" The Italian designer went on to design clothes for more than 150 films throughout his career.",
      "\"His idea to reach out to celebrities was very, very important,\" Dincuff said .",
      "Armani pivoted to dressing celebrities on the red carpet in the 1990s, where his\u00a0black tie outfits and glittering evening gowns often stole the show. The use of celebrities to showcase his fashion was novel at the time, said Dincuff.",
      "Some early looks that captured popular attention included the oversized Armani suit worn by Julia Roberts at the 1990s Golden Globes and a champagne-colored Armani suit that Jodie Foster wore at the 1992 Academy Awards.",
      "The list of celebrities that have\u00a0worn Armani on the red carpet is long and includes Beyonc\u00e9, Selena Gomez, \u00a0Anne Hathaway, Michelle Pfeiffer, Margot Robbie and Winona Ryder.",
      "His own boss",
      "Central to Armani's success was the fact that he never relinquished control of the multibillion company he created. Having never agreed to a merger or sale, the Italian fashion designer was always his own boss.",
      "This allowed Armani to maintain creative control and consistency over his expanding business empire, distinguishing him from other designers.",
      "While he did strike several licensing deals over his career with companies like EssilorLuxottica\u00a0and\u00a0L'Or\u00e9al, he kept the majority of his business portfolio in-house. That included everything from Armani Priv\u00e9, his haute couture fashion collection and fragrance line, to Armani Exchange \u2014 a more affordable fashion line geared toward younger generations, said Grain Carter. Armani also kept the collections Giorgio Armani and Emporio Armani under his purview.",
      "\"All of this was in-house and he controlled it from concept to production to distribution to marketing to how it is finance,\" Grain Carter said. \"He was active at every level, at every step.\"",
      "Today the Armani empire has more than 9,000 employees along with seven industrial hubs and over 600 stores worldwide, according to figures released in 2023.",
      "As for potential succession plans, the Giorgio Armani company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "\"I cannot really contemplate the next person, because there will be no other Giorgio Armani,\" Grain Carter said.",

    "story": [
      "The Department of Transportation is dropping a proposed rule that would have required airlines to offer cash to passengers whose flights were disrupted.",
      "The rule, which never went into effect, would have required carriers to provide compensation \"to mitigate passenger inconveniences\" for cancellations or delays that were within a carrier's control.",
      "Reuters was the first to report that the Transportation Department was shelving the proposal.",
      "The proposal was introduced under President Biden and then-Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. It would've required airlines to pay up to $300 for domestic delays of three to six hours and up to $775 for flight delays lasting at least nine hours.",
      "\"The ability of airlines to choose the services that they provide to mitigate passenger inconveniences resulting from flight disruptions under current U.S. law contrasts with consumer protection regimes in other jurisdiction,\" the proposed rule states.",
      "In a statement, a spokesperson for the Department of Transportation told CBS News: \"We will faithfully implement all aviation consumer protection requirements mandated by Congress, including the requirement to refund ticket prices to passengers in the case of airline canceled or substantially delayed flights when consumers choose not to travel. Some of the rules proposed or adopted by the previous administration, however, went beyond what Congress has required by statute, and we intend to reconsider those extra-statutory requirements.\"",
      "\"This action does not change the Department's commitment or intent to carry out the consumer protection mandates from Congress in the recent FAA Reauthorization Act, including provisions relating to refunds. Instead, the action is part of USDOT's effort to ensure the traveling public is treated fairly while also acknowledging the realities of carriers' operations and the impact of overly burdensome regulations on the American people,\" the DOT spokesperson said.",
      "Although airlines guarantee rebooking, plus meals and lodging vouchers, for customers affected by flight delays and cancellations, none guarantee cash compensation for such inconveniences.",
      "Airlines were opposed to the proposed regulation when it was announced in December. At the time, Airlines for America, a trade group representing the nation's carriers, said it would \"drive up ticket prices, make air travel less accessible for price-sensitive travelers and negatively impact carrier operations.\"",
      "The group on Thursday cheered the Transportation Department's decision to drop the compensation proposal.",
      "\"We are encouraged by this Department of Transportation reviewing unnecessary and burdensome regulations that exceed its authority and don't solve issues important to our customers,\" Airlines for America said in a statement. \"We look forward to working with DOT on implementing President Trump's deregulatory agenda.\"",
      "The DOT is also reviewing what types of flight cancellations trigger refunds for consumers, and is considering repealing a Biden-era rule that requires airlines to disclose ancillary fees upfront to help consumers avoid unexpected charges.",

    "summary": "The latest employment data could inform the Federal Reserve's next rate decision meeting, set for Sept. 17.",
    "story": [
      "Employers across the U.S. added 22,000 jobs in August, falling short of economists' muted expectations and signaling the labor market is facing sharp headwinds from mounting economic uncertainty amid the Trump administration's wide-ranging tariffs.",
      "The numbers",
      "Economists had forecast payroll gains of 80,000 last month, according to a poll by FactSet.",
      "The unemployment rate rose to 4.3% in August, up from 4.2% in July, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said.",
      "The latest data points to an ongoing slowdown in the labor market, with employers hiring an average of 29,000 each month from June through August, versus 168,000 workers each month in 2024. Revised data shows that employers shed 13,000 jobs in June rather than adding the 14,000 that had been reported a month earlier, marking the first decline since late 2020.",
      "Some companies are paring back hiring plans amid the on-again, off-again uncertainty of the Trump administration's tariffs, which are import duties paid by U.S. companies. Businesses in seven of the Fed's 12 regional districts canvassed in the latest so-called Beige Book, a survey of local economic conditions, said they were hesitant to hire because of weaker demand and uncertainty over the near-term outlook.",
      "\"August's employment report confirmed that the labor market has headed off a cliff-edge,\" Bradley Saunders, North America economist at Capital Economics, said in a Friday research report.",
      "Consumers are also dour, with a new CBS News poll finding that Americans are continuing to rate the U.S. economy negatively, with most respondents picking \"uncertain\" and \"struggling\" to describe its current state.",
      "The August jobs report marks the first since President Trump\u00a0fired former Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner Erika McEntarfer on Aug. 1 in the wake of a disappointing July jobs report, which included a significant downward revision of May and June hiring figures.",
      "Citing the large revisions, Mr. Trump questioned the validity of the government data, although the BLS typically revises its prior reports each month based on fresher responses from employers.",
      "The new revisions",
      "On Friday, the BLS revised the prior two months' data, showing that employers shed 13,000 jobs in June, revising the month's hiring downward by 27,000 fewer jobs. That marks the first monthly decline in hiring since December 2020, when the U.S. was in the midst of an economic crisis caused by the pandemic.",
      "The BLS also revised July's jobs numbers upward, showing that employers added 79,000 workers that month, rather than the 73,000 reported in August.",
      "The revisions show that the economy added 21,000 fewer jobs in June and July than had earlier been reported by the BLS.",
      "What economists say",
      "The labor market data is complicating the Federal Reserve's next rate cut decision, which set for Sept. 17. The central bank's dual mandate requires it to ensure that both inflation and unemployment remain low, but inflation has been edging upward, which economists say is partly due to Mr. Trump's tariffs.",
      "The Fed's most powerful weapon for battling inflation is to hike interest rates, yet its best option for helping the job market is to lower borrowing costs, making it cheaper for businesses to expand. With the combination of rising inflation and weaker hiring, the Fed is in a tough position, economists say.",
      "Last month, Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who has been under pressure from Mr. Trump to cut rates, signaled that the central bank is open to reducing rates at its September meeting, citing risks to the labor market.",
      "\"The labor market continues to show fatigue as businesses hold back on hiring amid uncertainty around the direction of inflation, tariffs and the strength of the underlying economy,\" said Joe Gaffoglio, CEO at Mutual of America Capital Management, in an email after the data was released.",
      "\"Recent labor data showed that more individuals are unemployed in the U.S. (7.24 million) than there are available jobs (7.18 million), which hasn't happened since April 2021,\" he added.",
      "The latest data is likely to ensure a rate cut at the Fed's next meeting, experts said on Friday. The lower-than-expected hiring, as well as June's negative revision, could also persuade the central bank to cut later in the year as well, they added.",
      "\"The Federal Reserve needs to cut interest rates in September and probably October and December, too. The 'no hiring' economy is turning to a layoff economy and if that worsens, it will lead to a recession. This needs to be stopped,\" Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, said in an email.",

      "Steven Schrank, the special agent in charge of Homeland Security Investigations in Georgia, told reporters Friday that the majority of those detained were Korean nationals but he didn't know exactly how many. They worked for a variety of different companies at the site, including subcontractors, he said.",
      "No criminal charges were announced during Friday's news conference. The sweep was conducted as part of a monthslong investigation into allegations of unlawful employment practices and other federal crimes, Schrank said. He described Thursday's raid as the largest enforcement operation at a single site in the history of Homeland Security Investigations, which is a unit of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.",
      "\"This operation underscores our commitment to protecting jobs for Georgians and Americans, ensuring a level playing field for businesses that comply with the law, safeguarding the integrity of our economy and protecting workers from exploitation,\" Schrank said.",
      "Some of those detained Thursday allegedly entered the U.S. illegally and others were accused of overstaying their visas or violating visa waivers by working, Schrank said. Most of the detainees were taken to an ICE facility in Folkston, Georgia, near the Florida-Georgia state line.",
      "\"They will be moved based on their individual circumstances beyond that,\" Schrank said.",

      "\"This raid is the latest in an ongoing campaign of harassment that has targeted immigrant Georgians as they try to earn an honest living,\" Yvonne Brooks said in a statement. \"Arresting and detaining workers, who are exploited every day and risk their lives every day on the job, creates an atmosphere of fear that terrorizes workers and their families and increases the workload burden on their coworkers.\"",
      "The operation involved law enforcement agents from multiple federal agencies, including ICE; the Border Patrol; the FBI; the Drug Enforcement Administration; the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives; and the IRS, underscoring the government-wide nature of the Trump administration's crackdown on illegal immigration.",

      "The sweep targeted one of Georgia's largest and most high-profile manufacturing sites, touted by Gov. Brian Kemp and other officials as the biggest economic development project in the state's history. Hyundai Motor Group, South Korea's biggest automaker, began manufacturing electric vehicles a year ago at the $7.6 billion plant, which employs about 1,200 people, and has partnered with LG Energy Solution to build an adjacent battery plant, slated to open next year. The search shut down construction on the battery plant.",
      "In a statement to The Associated Press, LG said it was \"closely monitoring the situation and gathering all relevant details.\" It said it couldn't immediately confirm how many of its employees or Hyundai workers had been detained.",
      "\"Our top priority is always ensuring the safety and well-being of our employees and partners. We will fully cooperate with the relevant authorities,\" the company said.",
      "ICE spokesman Lindsay Williams confirmed that federal authorities conducted an enforcement operation at the 3,000-acre site west of Savannah. He said agents were focused on the construction site for the battery plant.",
      "The South Korean Foreign Ministry said in a statement that it was dispatching officials to the site and urged the U.S. Embassy in Seoul \"to exercise extreme caution to ensure that the legitimate rights and interests of Korean citizens are not infringed upon.\"",
      "\"The economic activities of Korean investment companies and the rights and interests of Korean citizens must not be unfairly infringed upon during U.S. law enforcement operations,\" the Foreign Ministry said.",
      "Georgia State Patrol troopers blocked roads to the Hyundai site. The Georgia Department of Public Safety confirmed they were dispatched to assist federal authorities.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-tariffs-refunds-court-ruling-business-refunds/",
    "published": "Thu, 04 Sep 2025 15:01:21 -0400",
    "summary": "The U.S. government could have to refund domestic businesses billions in tariffs, should the Supreme Court uphold a recent federal appeals court ruling.",
    "story": [
      "American businesses could be owed tens of billions of dollars in refunds for tariffs they paid on foreign goods.",
      "U.S. Customs and Border Protection has collected more than $200 billion in tariff revenue from American businesses of all sizes from October through August 24, according to agency data. Of that, more than $70 billion comes from payments of country-based tariffs that\u00a0a federal appeals court recently ruled\u00a0President Trump lacked the authority to impose.",
      "Industry-specific tariffs, such as steel and aluminum levies, are unaffected by Friday's ruling.",
      "The court on Friday ruled that President Trump unlawfully invoked the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA, to impose sweeping tariffs of up to 145% on dozens of U.S. trade partners. Mr. Trump on Wednesday asked the Supreme Court to review the federal appeals court's decision before it takes effect on Oct. 14.",
      "Mr. Trump's appeal means that, for now, there's no guarantee businesses will receive refunds. That spells more uncertainty for enterprises struggling to balance raising prices to cover the cost of levies against potentially turning away customers, according to supply chain experts.",
      "\"From the supply chain perspective, we are seeing a lot of uncertainty, which has been the case since April 2,\" Scott Pruneau, CEO of ITS Logistics, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"No one knows how to price their goods, because you can't whipsaw your customers on pricing.\"",
      "If the court's decision stands, the U.S. government could have to return billions in tariff revenue it has collected from businesses.",
      "\"It'd be very challenging\"",
      "But even if the Supreme Court strikes down the tariffs, businesses could still face hurdles in collecting refunds for the levies they've already paid the U.S. government, experts told CBS MoneyWatch. For one, there is no guarantee that whatever kind of refund system the government sets up would be automatic or that the process will be simple.",
      "\"There's been speculation that if ultimately, the Supreme Court overturns the tariffs, then Customs could just issue refunds, but I don't know that it's going to happen that way,\" Felicia Pullam, former executive director of the Office of Trade Relations at U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and the current senior director for geo-commerce at APCO, a global advisory firm, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "\"The easiest way would be for Customs to put a process in place and issue refunds, rather than make companies go and apply,\" she added.",
      "Ultimately, however, if refunds are owed, it would be up to the Trump administration to decide how to administer them. \"It'd be very challenging, but I am confident CBP could handle it.\"",
      "U.S. Customs and Border Protection didn't immediately reply to a request for comment.",
      "Requests for refunds",
      "Ted Murphy, co-leader of Sidley Austin's global arbitration, trade and advocacy practice, told CBS MoneyWatch that if the Supreme Court affirms the federal circuit court's ruling that Trump's reliance on IEEPA to impose country-based tariffs was illegal, the government would have to cease collecting tariffs from companies.",
      "When it comes to recouping levies that have already been paid, there are three ways refunds could be administered, Murphy said.",
      "Most simply, the government could provide automatic refunds to businesses for levy amounts paid. \"The government has that information, so it could happen automatically,\" Murphy told CBS MoneyWatch. \"I don't think that's particularly likely, but it is an option.\"",
      "The government could instead decide that only the plaintiffs who filed suit against the tariffs are entitled to refunds, and require additional parties seeking refunds to bring similar legal actions. \"In that case, you'd see tens and tens of thousands of people filing complaints at the Court of International Trade,\" he said.",
      "But the most likely repayment option in Murphy's view would be that the government agrees to refund duties paid by parties who submit requests for reimbursement.",
      "Historical precedent for refunds",
      "There's precedent for the government reimbursing businesses for tariff payments that were later deemed unlawful. In 1998, the Supreme Court struck down a harbor maintenance tax assessed on exports, which had been imposed by the Reagan administration. The government then owed companies more than a billion dollars in refunds, which it required companies to apply for in order to receive.",
      "Dan Anthony, president of Trade Partnership Worldwide, a trade consultancy, echoed Murphy, saying that it is hard to predict how the government might choose to process refunds, should the Supreme Court determine they are owed.",
      "\"It's up to the administration to decide, and that's where it gets very complicated and speculative,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Technically speaking, issuing refunds wouldn't be hard. \"Theoretically, the government could quite quickly figure out who paid what, and refund it to the payer,\" he said. \"But the government could also make it very difficult and force people to make requests.\"",
      "That would create work for companies, but also for the government, which would then have to review requests for refunds from thousands of companies. \"That's infinitely more work for the government, but it's pretty clear the government does not want to give money back, so if you make it a difficult process, then a number of importers are probably not going to pursue it,\" Anthony said.",
      "Large refunds to businesses could weigh on the Treasury's finances, TD Securities analysts noted in a report Thursday. \"Treasury would likely step up bill supply even further to obtain the extra funds, creating little disruption in longer-dated yields, but potentially pressuring funding spreads,\" TD Securities analysts said.",
      "The Trump administration could also turn to other emergency powers to replace the IEEPA tariffs in order to maintain the U.S.' effective tariff rate, the analysts noted.",
      "Neither the White House nor the Treasury immediately responded to a request for comment.",

      "The Florida company confirmed to CBS News on Thursday that it would exit the following markets on Oct. 2: Albuquerque, New Mexico; Birmingham, Alabama; Boise, Idaho; Chattanooga, Tennessee; Oakland, California; Columbia, South Carolina; Portland, Oregon; Sacramento, California; Salt Lake City, Utah; San Diego, California; and San Jose, California. The airline also said it is nixing plans to launch service in Macon, Georgia, which was slated for Oct. 16.",
      "Spirit serves dozens of cities in North, Central and South America and the Caribbean, according to its route map.",
      "\"We apologize to our Guests for any inconvenience this may cause and will reach out to those with affected reservations to notify them of their options, including a refund,\" a Spirit spokesperson told CBS News in an email statement.",
      "The news comes at a financially tumultuous time for the budget carrier. Spirit initially filed for bankruptcy protection in November 2024 after years of of struggling with rising operation costs and mounting debt. Just months after emerging from Chapter 11 reorganization, the airline filed for bankruptcy protection again in August.",
      "At the time, Spirit said it intended to conduct business as usual during the restructuring process, signaling passengers would still be able to book flights and use tickets.",
      "Spirit is seeking to cut costs by eliminating money-losing routes. In its quarterly earnings report in August, the company said it had \"substantial doubt\" about its ability to stay in business, citing factors including weak demand for domestic leisure travel and \"adverse market conditions.\"",
      "Rival airlines swoop in",
      "Rival airlines reacted quickly by announcing new lineups of domestic flights and international flights as they sought to gain some of the market share left in Spirit's absence.",
      "United Airlines, the world's largest airline carrier, said in an email statement that it would add flights to 15 cities starting Jan. 6 including trips to and from Houston, Chicago, Los Angeles, Fort Lauderdale, Orlando and Las Vegas.",
      "\"If Spirit suddenly goes out of business it will be incredibly disruptive, so we're adding these flights to give their customers other options if they want or need them,\" Patrick Quayle, United's senior vice president of global network planning and alliances, said in the company's statement.",
      "In response to United's statement, a spokesperson for Spirit said, \"While we appreciate the obsession certain airline executives have with us, we're focused on competing and running a great operation.\" Spirit plans to continue offering low fares to customers \"for many years to come,\" the spokesperson added.",
      "Meanwhile, Frontier Airlines, a low-cost airline carrier based out of Denver, announced it was introducing 20 new routes from Detroit, Houston, Baltimore, Fort Lauderdale, Charlotte and Dallas. The flights range in price from $29 to $89.",

      "At $299, the pass costs less than what customers typically pay for a domestic ticket on other U.S. airlines, Frontier said, citing data from the U.S. Department of Transportation. On Friday, the pass's cost will rise to $599.",
      "This year's pass offers the most amount of travel time that Frontier has offered through the program, Frontier Airlines chief commercial officer Bobby Schroeter said in a statement Tuesday.",
      "It's a step that could help Frontier catapult past its competitors, industry experts said. Frontier is expanding the pass as low-cost competitor Spirit struggles with its second bankruptcy in less than a year, while rival Southwest's new policies, like ending its\u00a0free checked bag policy, have alienated some customers.",
      "\"They see all other budget airlines really struggling, and there is market share for travelers who are in the market for budget airline flights,\" Scott Keyes, founder of flight deals site Going.com, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"They smell opportunity, and Frontier has always been good at expanding.\"",

    "published": "Thu, 04 Sep 2025 09:41:14 -0400",
    "summary": "After President Trump expressed \"shock\" over the pace of hiring in July, much is riding on the employment data for August.",
    "story": [
      "When President Trump last month fired the head of the federal bureau that produces the government's monthly jobs report after the numbers pointed to a slump in U.S. hiring, he drew rebukes from critics who accused him of politicizing a technical \u2014 and nonpartisan \u2014 data collection process.",
      "On Friday, the Labor Department is set to release employment figures for August in what could emerge as another possible flashpoint.",
      "The new payroll report comes at a critical juncture for the economy. Recent data suggests the labor market is cooling, a particular concern as workers and businesses head into the crucial\u00a0holiday spending period. The Federal Reserve later this month is also expected to cut its benchmark interest rate for the first time since December 2024 as it swivels from fighting inflation to shoring up job growth.",
      "The August employment report will be the first since Mr. Trump ordered the dismissal of former Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner Erika McEntarfer and questioned the Labor Department's competence in tracking the rate of job-creation across the U.S.",
      "In the aftermath, economists expressed concern that Mr. Trump's move could undermine confidence in the accuracy of U.S. economic data \u2014 a benchmark for the global economy. Any further actions by the Trump administration to question the accuracy of the monthly jobs data could sow further doubt about its validity, Gregory Daco, chief economist at strategy consulting firm EY-Parthenon, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "What happened last month",
      "Employers added only 73,000 jobs in July, the government reported last month \u2014 a figure that fell far short of economist forecasts and that led Mr. Trump to express \"shock\"\u00a0over what appeared to be a sudden downturn in hiring. Also troubling was that the Labor Department sharply revised down how many jobs the economy added in May and June, a sign the economy was weaker than previously thought.",
      "Such revisions are common, according to economists. The U.S. has roughly 160 million workers, making it impossible for the Bureau of Labor Statistics to tally each job every month. Instead, Labor Department staff draws on available data to estimate hiring and layoffs, while also revising their estimates for seasonal factors.",
      "Still, the Labor Department's July recalculation of the pace of job growth was noteworthy for its scale, representing the largest two-month downward revision since 1968.",
      "\"The previous report was obviously shocking in the sense of the downward revisions for the previous two months, and really caused a reckoning in the sense of needing to view hiring in a new light \u2014 and obviously not in a positive light,\" Mark Hamrick, senior economic analyst at Bankrate, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Indeed, the disappointing numbers were the clearest sign to date this year that the job market could be starting to sputter as the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs and general economic uncertainty weigh on employers.",
      "What to expect from the August job numbers \u2014 and beyond",
      "The August jobs data will provide a crucial measure of whether the labor market is holding up or running out of steam, as recent data suggests. The year started off strong, with an average monthly payroll gain of 123,000 from January to April \u2014 well above the number required to keep the nation's unemployment rate, now at 4.2%, from rising.",
      "However, the job market has stalled in recent months, with an average payroll gain from May to July of only 35,000. For the first time since April of 2021, the U.S. now has more unemployed people, at 7.24 million, than the 7.18 million jobs open around the country, according to labor data released on Wednesday.",
      "\"This is yet another data point underscoring how this job market is frozen, and it's difficult for anyone to get a job right now,\" Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, said in an email. \"This is a turning point for the labor market. It's yet another crack.\"",
      "Economists polled by financial data firm FactSet projected that employers added 80,000 jobs in August, with the unemployment rate expected to hold steady at 4.2%. A figure around or exceeding that level would alleviate fears that the job market is cratering.",
      "Daco, who forecasts a much more moderate gain of 40,000 jobs in August, said in a research note this week that the employment report on Friday is \"likely to confirm that a marked slowdown in labor market conditions is underway.\"",
      "Another important marker to look for in the latest job figures will be whether the Labor Department revises the payroll gains for July, as it did for May and June.",
      "\"Since every month in 2025 has been revised lower so far, the risk is that July job growth will also be marked down,\" Shruti Mishra, a U.S. economist at Bank of America Global Research, said in a report. \"This could point to more sustained labor market weakness than we have been forecasting.\"",
      "Moving forward, Daco predicts payroll gains will average around 30,000 per month through the end of the year and for the nation's jobless rate to reach 4.7% by December.",
      "\"Looking ahead, the labor market slowdown is likely to persist,\" he said.",
      "What could the jobs report mean for a Fed rate cut?",
      "The Federal Reserve has held off on lowering interest rates as it tries to finish the job of extinguishing the raging inflation that scorched consumers during the pandemic and to assess the impact of steeper tariffs on the economy.",
      "Fed Chair Jerome Powell signaled last month that there might be an opening for a cut in September as downside risks to employment increase. Another month of weak or flat job growth would reinforce this outlook and likely keep the central bank on track for a cut at the Fed's next policy meeting on Sept. 16-17, according to many economists.",
      "\"The report would have to be significantly stronger than we are forecasting to dissuade the [Fed] from cutting rates,\" Oxford Economics said in a recent report.",

ConocoPhillips currently has a global headcount of about 13,000 \u2014 meaning that the cuts would impact between 2,600 and 3,250 workers.",
      "\"We are always looking at how we can be more efficient with the resources we have,\" a ConocoPhillips' spokesperson said via email, adding that the company expects the \"majority of these reductions\" to take place before the end of 2025.",
      "ConocoPhillips' shares fell 4.3% Wednesday. The Houston-based company's stock now sits at under $95 per share, down nearly 14% from a year ago.",
      "News of the coming layoffs was first reported\u00a0by Reuters, with anonymous sources telling the outlet that CEO Ryan Lance detailed the plans in a video message earlier Wednesday. In that video, Reuters reported, Lance said the company needed \"fewer roles\" while he cited rising costs.",
      "Last month, ConocoPhillips reported second-quarter earnings of $1.97 billion. That beat Wall Street expectations, but was down from the nearly $2.33 billion the company reported for the same period last year.",
      "In its latest earnings, reported on Aug. 7, ConocoPhillips continued to point to cost cutting efforts \u2014 noting that it had identified more than $1 billion in cost reductions and margin optimization. The company also said it had agreed to sell its Anadarko Basin assets for $1.3 billion."

    "summary": "A new survey predicts Americans will spend $1,552 per person on average, 5% less than they did in 2024.",
    "story": [
      "Americans are expected to rein in spending this holiday season by the most amount since the pandemic, as they continue to face pressure from high prices and tariffs.",
      "That's according to a new survey released by accounting firm PwC on Wednesday, which predicts Americans this year will reduce holiday spending to $1,552 a person on average, which is 5% less than in 2024. That includes spending on gifts, travel, food and entertainment.",
      "If the predictions come to pass, it would represent the most significant drop in holiday spending since 2020. While consumers are not cutting purchases entirely, they are getting smarter about how they stretch their dollars, according to Alison Furman, PwC's consumer markets industry leader.",
      "\"Inflation is kind of creeping in, and they're seeing it affect their wallets,\" Furman told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "For its report, PwC surveyed 4,000 Americans from Gen Zs to baby boomers over a two-week period from June to July, when tariff-related uncertainty was more pronounced. But any perceived changes in the economy over the next couple of months could alter consumers' attitude toward spending.",
      "\"Economic signals continue to shift and, between now and December, purchasing behavior could evolve in response,\" the report states.",
      "The generation expected to tighten their spending the most is Gen Z. Respondents from this cohort, ages 17 to 28, said they expect to reduce their holiday budgets by 23% \u2014 more than any other generation in the study. That's due in part to the\u00a0tough job market\u00a0facing young Americans, along with rising costs.",
      "Overall, 84% of consumers expect to cut back spending in general over the next six months, according to the report.",
      "A slowdown in spending could spell trouble for retailers who depend on holiday sales to shore up revenue toward the end of the year. Since 2019, holiday sales during the months of November and December have accounted for 19% of total retail revenue for the year, according to a National Retail Federation\u00a0report.",
      "Tariffs, high prices top of mind",
      "The projected pullback in consumer holiday spending underscores Americans' shaky confidence in the state of the economy. Worries over inflation and tariffs have already led shoppers to be more judicious with their spending.",
      "Discretionary spending on categories like indoor and outdoor dining were down in August, according to the U.S. Conference Board's latest consumer confidence index each month. Meanwhile, average 12-month inflation expectations among consumers increased to 6.2%, from 5.7% in July.",
      "Tighter spending",
      "PwC expects consumers to approach holiday shopping \"more deliberately,\" with an eye toward saving money, amid ongoing concerns over tariffs and high prices.",
      "Furman said the potential for tariff-related price increases has already made the consumers \"very conscious of trying to buy things at a discount.\"Case in point: Internet searches for \"discount\" and \"coupon code\" have climbed by 11% over the past year, according to the survey.",
      "With deals in mind, consumers are expected to do a large portion, or 39%, of their total planned holiday gift spending, during the time between Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday, according to the PwC report. With heightened traffic expected during that five-day stretch, Furman advises shoppers to start looking early for popular items.",
      "\"If you're interested in very hot items, knowing that they're going to likely be on shelves sooner, to guarantee that you'll get them, you may want to shop for them in those early promotional cycles, versus wait until the five-day frenzy,\" she said.",

    "published": "Wed, 03 Sep 2025 11:04:07 -0400",
    "summary": "Wasted energy is a hidden drain on household electricity but small steps can contribute significantly to lowering costs and emissions.",
    "story": [
      "The lights are off, the house is quiet and nothing seems to be running. But electricity is silently flowing through the plugs in your home. This hidden drain is known as phantom energy.",
      "Also called vampire energy, the wasted electricity comes from leaving devices plugged in when they're not in use. That could range from household items such as phone chargers and microwaves to TVs and gaming consoles.",
      "This wasted electricity accounts for about 5% to 10% of home energy use, depending on factors like the age of the equipment, according to Alexis Abramson, dean of the Columbia Climate School.",
      "\"Phantom energy depends on ... what kind of systems you have and how much they've improved over time,\" said Abramson.",
      "For example, televisions that are connected to the internet and have smart wake features that allow them to interact with phones and other devices can consume up to 40 watts of energy during the hours of the day that the TV would normally be off, according to Matt Malinowski, director of the buildings program at the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy. That's almost 40 times as much as a regular television.",
      "\"The good news is there have been new, renewed efforts to tackle this,\" said Malinowski.",
      "He said advocates and manufacturers have come up with a voluntary agreement seeking to reduce the amount of energy smart televisions use when they're in standby mode.",
      "Phantom energy contributes to climate change because power drawn by unused devices can increase demand for electricity from sources that release planet-warming emissions. Aidan Charron, associate director of Global Earth Day, said that while the amount may seem small when a person looks at their individual utility bill, the environmental toll of phantom energy is significant when multiplied over homes across the country.",
      "\"Just take a little step of unplugging the things that you're not using,\" said Charron. \"It will save you money and it'll save emissions in the long run.\"",
      "Some of the main culprits when it comes to draining energy are appliances that are constantly connected to electricity, such as those with a clock.",
      "\"Do you really need your microwave to tell you the time, or can you unplug your microwave when you're not using it?\" said Charron.",
      "While unplugging devices may seem burdensome, it significantly contributes to reducing emissions.",
      "Charron recommends starting with small steps like unplugging chargers for phones and other devices once the battery is fully charged. The next step is moving to other appliances such as unplugging an unused lamp.",
      "If unplugging sounds too hard, regularly checking your settings and disabling any extra feature you're not using that could be draining energy help, too. For example, smart televisions often have optional features that can be turned off so the television isn't listening for signals from other devices while in standby mode.",
      "\"If you're not using it, then you're getting no benefit, yet you're paying the price and increased the energy use,\" said Malinowski.",
      "Individuals also tend to take more sustainable actions, such as unplugging devices, once they learn what they can do to decrease their household emissions efficiently. Those actions could contribute to reducing U.S. emissions by about 20% per year, which equals about 450 tons (408 metric tons) of carbon dioxide, according to Jonathan Gilligan, a professor of earth and environmental science at Vanderbilt University.",
      "The choices individuals take in their daily lives all add up, Gilligan said, mainly because of how much the U.S. population contributes to direct greenhouse gas emissions.",
      "\"The question becomes, what can we do to try to address this?\" said Gilligan. \"Phantom power is one part of this.\"",
      "The more individuals decrease their footprint, the more likely it is that others will follow, too, and eventually, those actions may turn to societal norms, according to Gilligan, because individuals don't want to feel like they're being irresponsible.",
      "\"This is a place where psychologists find that this effect is real. If people see that other people are doing actions to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, they want to do that\" said Giligan.",
      "When it comes to daily choices, individuals may think what they're doing isn't really making a big difference. But what they tend to overlook is how they influence others around them by choosing to live a more sustainable life.",
      "The impact may be much stronger than a lot of people realize, Gilligan said.",

    "summary": "The judge rejected the Justice Department's effort to force Google to sell its popular Chrome browser, concluding the request was a bridge too far.",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge on Tuesday ordered a shake-up of Google's search engine in a crackdown aimed at curbing the corrosive power of an illegal monopoly while rebuffing the U.S. government's attempt to break up the company and impose other restraints.",
      "The 226-page decision made by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta in Washington, D.C., will likely ripple across the technological landscape at a time when the industry is being reshaped by breakthroughs in artificial intelligence \u2014 including conversational \"answer engines\" as companies like ChatGPT and Perplexity try to upend Google's long-held position as the internet's main gateway.",
      "The innovations and competition being unleashed by generative artificial intelligence, or \"GenAI,\" have reshaped the judge's approach to remedies in the nearly five-year-old antitrust case.",
      "\"Unlike the typical case where the court's job is to resolve a dispute based on historic facts, here the court is asked to gaze into a crystal ball and look to the future. Not exactly a judge's forte,\" Mehta wrote.",
      "Investors seemed to interpret the ruling as a relatively light slap on the wrist for Google, as the stock price of its corporate parent, Alphabet Inc., surged nearly 3% in extended trading.",
      "The judge is trying to rein in Google by prohibiting some of the tactics the company deployed to drive traffic to its search engine and other services.",
      "But Mehta stopped short of banning the multi-billion dollar deals that Google has been making for years to lock in its search engine as the default on smartphones, personal computers and other devices. Those deals, involving payments of more than $26 billion annually, were one of the main issues that prompted the judge to conclude Google's search engine was an illegal monopoly, but he decided banning them in the future would do more harm than good.",
      "Partially because he is allowing the default deals to continue, Mehta is ordering Google to give its current and would-be rivals access to some of its search engine's secret sauce \u2014 the data stockpiled from trillions of queries that it used to help improve the quality of its search results.",
      "The judge also rejected the U.S. Justice Department's effort to force Google to sell its popular Chrome browser, concluding it was an unwarranted step that \"would be incredibly messy and highly risky.\"",
      "\"Now the Court has imposed limits on how we distribute Google services, and will require us to share Search data with rivals,\" Google said in a statement provided to CBS News following the ruling. \"We have concerns about how these requirements will impact our users and their privacy, and we're reviewing the decision closely. The Court did recognize that divesting Chrome and Android would have gone beyond the case's focus on search distribution, and would have harmed consumers and our partners.\"",
      "\"We proved in court that competition had been frozen in place for two decades in internet search,\" Abigail Slater, assistant attorney general of the Justice Department's Antitrust Division, wrote in a social media post. \"Google's tactics have excluded competition, harming consumers and slowing innovation. Today's remedy order agreed with the need to restore competition to the long-monopolized search market, and we are now weighing our options and thinking through whether the ordered relief goes far enough in serving that goal.\"",
      "Allowing the default search deals to continue is more than just a victory for Google. It's also something that Apple, which receives more than $20 billion annually from Google, and the beneficiaries of the payments urged Mehta to maintain.",
      "In hearings earlier this year, Apple warned the judge that banning the contracts would deprive the company of money that it funnels into its own innovative research. The Cupertino, California, company also cautioned that the ban could have the unintended consequence of making Google even more powerful by pocketing the money it had been spending on deals while most consumers will still end up flocking to Google's search engine anyway.",
      "Others, such as the owners of the Firefox search engine, asserted that losing the Google contracts would threaten their future survival by depriving them of essential revenue.",

    "summary": "A digital token offered by the Trump family's World Liberty Financial has started trading. Here's what to know.",
    "story": [
      "A new cryptocurrency issued by the Trump family's World Liberty Financial\u00a0and that started trading this week has boosted the family's wealth on paper by roughly $5 billion despite the digital token sinking in its first two days of being listed on the exchange.",
      "The crypto, called WLFI, reached a high of about 40 cents after launching on Monday, according to data from CoinMarketCap. By Tuesday morning, the value of the token had fallen to as low as about 21 cents, down 48% from its peak, before recovering to about 23 cents in the afternoon.",
      "Even with the decline, the Trump family's stake in WLFI is worth about $5 billion based on its holdings of 22.5 billion WLFI tokens. Mr. Trump and his family aren't yet able to sell their holdings as its founders' tokens remained locked, according to World Liberty Financial.",
      "World Liberty Financial didn't immediately return a request for comment. Here's what to know about the company's token.",
      "Trump's support for crypto",
      "Once an avowed skeptic of cryptocurrency, Mr. Trump has championed the digital asset in his second term, vowing to make the U.S. the \"crypto capital of the world.\"",
      "World Liberty Financial and the Trump family's other private crypto ventures have raised concerns among some watchdog groups and Democratic lawmakers over potential conflicts of interest.",
      "\"The media's continued attempts to fabricate conflicts of interest are irresponsible and reinforce the public's distrust in what they read,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch. \"Neither the president nor his family have ever engaged, or will ever engage, in conflicts of interest.\"",
      "In July, Mr. Trump\u00a0signed the Genius Act, the first major federal law governing cryptocurrencies, into law. The act established federal regulations for \"stablecoins,\" which are viewed as a relatively safe type of cryptocurrency because their value is pegged to fixed assets, like the dollar.",
      "The surging value of World Liberty Financial, whose co-founders include Mr. Trump and his sons Eric, Donald Jr. and Barron, underscores the president's growing interest in cryptocurrency, a focus that spans both personal investments and policy moves during his presidency. Those efforts include\u00a0$TRUMP and $Melania meme coins, which are cryptos whose value is linked to internet trends and which began trading in January.",
      "What is WLFI?",
      "WLFI is a token, or a digital asset, that guarantees its holders the right to vote on governance issues for World Liberty Financial, according to the company.",
      "World Liberty Financial cautions token owners that WLFI isn't an investment, with its terms stating: \"You should not acquire $WLFI as an investment on a speculative basis or otherwise, for a financial purpose or with an expectation of resale for a profit or otherwise.\"",
      "The early swing in WLFI's price isn't unusual for tokens making their market debut, said Nic Puckrin, CEO of Coin Bureau, a provider of crypto and blockchain information.",
      "\"The price action from 40 cents to 21 cents is typical for new token launches,\" Puckrin told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Early hype usually drives initial spikes, followed by a wave of selling as early entrants take profits.\"",
      "He added, \"Compared to other major token debuts, WLFI's decline is relatively moderate, and early backers have still seen strong returns from private sales.\"",
      "World Liberty Financial also offers a stablecoin called USD1, which is pegged to the value of the U.S. dollar. Because stablecoins are linked to fixed assets, they are generally seen as less volatile to other cryptos.",
      "\"WLFI is carving out a unique position by offering token holders real governance rights over the direction of USD1, a dollar-backed stablecoin that is growing rapidly,\" Puckrin said.",
      "That's important because WLFI holders, through their governance votes, can help influence the future development and policies of USD1 and World Liberty Financial's policies, he added. That capacity \"sets it apart in a crowded market,\" he said.",
      "What about insider concentration risk?",
      "The Trump family and other insiders own more than 20% of the WLFI tokens, according to World Liberty Financial's site.",
      "But World Liberty Financial's terms note that no single digital wallet can exercise more than 5% of governance power, which should deter outsized insider influence, Puckrin said.",
      "What's happening with Mr. Trump's other crypto ventures?",
      "In May, the $TRUMP meme coin drew scrutiny when the venture offered its top holders the chance to join Mr. Trump for dinner. Investors spent about $140 million to snap up the coins and secure an invite to the event, data showed at the time.",
      "That sparked concerns from government watchdogs and some Democratic lawmakers that the Trump-branded asset was being linked to gain access to the president.",
      "As investors snapped up the meme coin, the asset's value almost doubled to about $15 in May. Since then, the coin has given up most of the gains and was trading at about $8.30 on Tuesday, according to CoinMarketCap.",
      "Trump Media & Technology Group \u2014 the owner of the Truth Social app \u2014 has expanded into crypto in recent months. In July, it bought about $2 billion in cryptocurrencies\u00a0to refashion the business as an investment firm.",
      "Shares of Trump Media & Technology group have shed about 50% of their value year to date and traded Tuesday at $17.05.",

      "On a company earnings call in May, CEO Chris Kempczinski said traffic among low-income customers was down \"nearly double digits.\" McDonald's has also seen sluggish breakfast sales, which Kempczinski has attributed to the financial pressures facing low-income consumers.",
      "In January, McDonald's introduced the McValue menu, which includes the $5 meal deal, along with a \"buy one, add one for $1\" deal. Earlier this summer, the company also said it would bring back the Snack Wrap, a white-flour tortilla filled with chicken, shredded lettuce and cheese. The item, now available for $2.99, returned to the McDonald's menu in July after a nine-year hiatus.",
      "Other companies are also feeling the sting of reduced consumer spending. Constellation Brands, which markets beer brands Corona and Modelo in the U.S., on Tuesday cited falling demand in trimming its profit outlook for the year.",
      "Constellation said in April that Hispanic customers in particular were reducing their beer consumption because of concerns about higher food costs, immigration and the job market.",
      "\"That has tended to mean that the consumer has pulled back on spending on a number of categories,\" CEO Bill Newlands said during a conference call with investors on Tuesday. \"Beer is quite a ways down the list, but it's certainly on the list because things like social gatherings, an area where the Hispanic consumer often consumes beer, are declining today as part of these overarching concerns that they have.\"",

    "story": [
      "Vogue has named Chloe Malle to lead its U.S. editorial content, selecting the 39-year-old to succeed Anna Wintour, who has led the magazine for more than three decades.",
      "Malle, the daughter of actor Candice Bergen and the late French director Louis Malle, joined Vogue 14 years ago and currently serves as the editor of Vogue.com and co-host of The Run-Through, a weekly fashion and culture podcast.",
      "\"I'm thrilled to announce that Chloe Malle will be the next Head of Editorial Content for our U.S. title, leading the American magazine and guiding its digital coverage,\" Wintour said in a\u00a0statement posted to Vogue.com.",
      "Wintour, who is widely considered to be the most powerful figure in the fashion industry,\u00a0announced in June she was taking a step back from her editorial duties. The 75-year-old has served as the magazine's editor-in-chief since 1988.",
      "Malle may be stepping into Wintour's low-heeled slingbacks, but she'll report to the original wearer while taking over day-to-day operations at the U.S. edition. In Vogue's online post, Wintour said she is excited to continue working with Malle as \"her mentor but also as her student.\"",
      "\"Fashion and media are both evolving at breakneck speed, and I am so thrilled \u2014 and awed \u2014 to be part of that,\" Malle said in an online\u00a0post\u00a0from Vogue. \"I also feel incredibly fortunate to still have Anna just down the hall as my mentor.\"",
      "Wintour remains at the top of the masthead as global editorial director and the chief content officer for Cond\u00e9 Nast.",
      "After Wintour announced in June that Vogue would recruit a new head of editorial content, speculation swirled about who would step into the leadership opening at the fashion magazine. Among the names that were circulated were Eva Chen, vice president of fashion partnerships at Meta; Nicole Phelps, global director of Vogue Runway and Vogue Business; and Sara Moonves, editor-in-chief of W magazine.",
      "Ultimately, Wintour selected Malle, who doubled\u00a0Vogue.com's traffic in two years, according to the magazine. Malle joined Vogue as social editor in 2011, leading wedding and social coverage. In 2016, she took a new role as contributing editor, writing features and overseeing special projects.

    "story": [
      "Kraft Heinz is splitting into two companies a decade after they joined in a massive merger that created one of the biggest food conglomerates on the planet.",
      "One of the companies, currently called Global Taste Elevation Co., will include shelf-stable meals and include brands such as Heinz, Philadelphia cream cheese and Kraft Mac & Cheese, Kraft Heinz said Tuesday. The other, currently called North American Grocery Co.,  will include brands such as Oscar Mayer, Kraft Singles and Lunchables. The names of the two companies will be released later.",
      "Kraft Heinz said in May that it was conducting a strategic review of the company, signaling a potential split.",
      "The company's board \"unanimously approved a plan to separate the company into two independent, publicly traded companies through a tax-free spin-off,\" Kraft Heinz said.",
      "In 2015, when they merged, the company wanted to capitalize on its massive scale, but shifting tastes complicated those plans, with households seeking to introduce healthier options at the table. Kraft Heinz and other food producers have shifted offerings to follow that trend.",
      "\"Kraft Heinz's brands are iconic and beloved, but the complexity of our current structure makes it challenging to allocate capital effectively, prioritize initiatives and drive scale in our most promising areas,\" Kraft Heinz Executive Chair Miguel Patricio said in a statement.",
      "Kraft Heinz CEO  Carlos Abrams-Rivera said, \"This move will unleash the power of our brands and unlock the potential of our business. This next step in our transformation is only possible because of the commitment of our 36,000 talented employees who deliver quality and value for consumers every day. We will continue to operate as 'one Kraft Heinz' throughout the separation process.\"",
      "The path to the merger of Kraft and Heinz began in 2013, when billionaire investor Warren Buffett teamed up with Brazilian investment firm 3G Capital to buy H.J. Heinz Co. At the time, the $23 billion deal was the most expensive ever in the food industry.",
      "3G was also behind the formation of Restaurant Brands International \u2014 a merger of Burger King, Tim Hortons and Popeyes \u2014 and Anheuser-Busch InBev. It's known for strict cost controls and so-called zero-based budgeting, which requires all expenses to be justified each quarter.",
      "The deal was intended to help Heinz, which was founded in 1869 in Pittsburgh, expand sales of its condiments and sauces on grocery store shelves. Heinz's new owners also set about cutting costs, laying off hundreds of workers within months.",
      "At the same time Kraft, based in Chicago, sought a partner after a 2011 split from its snack division, which became Mondelez International.",
      "In 2015, Buffett and 3G decided to merge Heinz with Kraft. The merger created the 5th largest food and beverage company in the world, with annual revenue of $28 billion. Buffett and 3G each contributed $5 billion for a special dividend for Kraft shareholders.",
      "But the combined company struggled, despite layoffs of thousands of employees and other cost-cutting measures. Even at the time of the merger, many consumers were shifting away from the kinds of highly processed packaged foods that Kraft sells, like Velveeta cheese and Kool-Aid.",
      "Kraft Heinz also had trouble distinguishing its products from cheaper store brands. At Walmart, a 14-ounce bottle of Heinz ketchup costs $2.98; the same size bottle of Walmart's Great Value brand is 98 cents.",
      "In 2019, Kraft Heinz slashed the value of its Oscar Meyer and Kraft brands by $15.4 billion, citing operational costs and supply chain problems. But many investors blamed the company's leadership, saying its zeal for cost-cutting was hurting brand innovation.",
      "In 2021, Kraft Heinz sold both its Planters nut business and its natural cheese business, vowing to reinvest the money into higher-growth brands like P3 protein snacks and Lunchables.",
      "But the company's net revenue has fallen every year since 2020, when it saw a pandemic-related bump in sales. In April, Kraft Heinz lowered its full-year sales and earnings guidance, citing weaker customer spending in the U.S. and the impact of President Trump's tariffs.",
      "Carlos Abrams-Rivera will continue to serve as CEO of Kraft Heinz and will become CEO of North American Grocery Co. once the separation is complete. Kraft Heinz said its board is working with an executive search firm to identify potential CEO candidates for Global Taste Elevation Co.",
      "Kraft Heinz says it has no plans to change its current headquarter locations in Chicago and Pittsburgh. It currently expects the transaction to close in the second half of 2026.",

      "Reuters was the first to report that the Transportation Department was shelving the proposal.",

      "Steven Schrank, the special agent in charge of Homeland Security Investigations in Georgia, told reporters Friday that the majority of those detained were Korean nationals but he didn't know exactly how many. They worked for a variety of different companies at the site, including subcontractors, he said.",
      "No criminal charges were announced during Friday's news conference. The sweep was conducted as part of a monthslong investigation into allegations of unlawful employment practices and other federal crimes, Schrank said. He described Thursday's raid as the largest enforcement operation at a single site in the history of Homeland Security Investigations, which is a unit of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.",
      "\"This operation underscores our commitment to protecting jobs for Georgians and Americans, ensuring a level playing field for businesses that comply with the law, safeguarding the integrity of our economy and protecting workers from exploitation,\" Schrank said.",
      "Some of those detained Thursday allegedly entered the U.S. illegally and others were accused of overstaying their visas or violating visa waivers by working, Schrank said. Most of the detainees were taken to an ICE facility in Folkston, Georgia, near the Florida-Georgia state line.",
      "\"They will be moved based on their individual circumstances beyond that,\" Schrank said.",
      "The president of Georgia's chapter of the AFL-CIO called the raid politically motivated and said ICE has been escalating its presence at workplaces across the state.",
      "\"This raid is the latest in an ongoing campaign of harassment that has targeted immigrant Georgians as they try to earn an honest living,\" Yvonne Brooks said in a statement. \"Arresting and detaining workers, who are exploited every day and risk their lives every day on the job, creates an atmosphere of fear that terrorizes workers and their families and increases the workload burden on their coworkers.\"",
      "The operation involved law enforcement agents from multiple federal agencies, including ICE; the Border Patrol; the FBI; the Drug Enforcement Administration; the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives; and the IRS, underscoring the government-wide nature of the Trump administration's crackdown on illegal immigration.",

      "The sweep targeted one of Georgia's largest and most high-profile manufacturing sites, touted by Gov. Brian Kemp and other officials as the biggest economic development project in the state's history. Hyundai Motor Group, South Korea's biggest automaker, began manufacturing electric vehicles a year ago at the $7.6 billion plant, which employs about 1,200 people, and has partnered with LG Energy Solution to build an adjacent battery plant, slated to open next year. The search shut down construction on the battery plant.",
      "In a statement to The Associated Press, LG said it was \"closely monitoring the situation and gathering all relevant details.\" It said it couldn't immediately confirm how many of its employees or Hyundai workers had been detained.",
      "\"Our top priority is always ensuring the safety and well-being of our employees and partners. We will fully cooperate with the relevant authorities,\" the company said.",
      "ICE spokesman Lindsay Williams confirmed that federal authorities conducted an enforcement operation at the 3,000-acre site west of Savannah. He said agents were focused on the construction site for the battery plant.",
      "The South Korean Foreign Ministry said in a statement that it was dispatching officials to the site and urged the U.S. Embassy in Seoul \"to exercise extreme caution to ensure that the legitimate rights and interests of Korean citizens are not infringed upon.\"",
      "\"The economic activities of Korean investment companies and the rights and interests of Korean citizens must not be unfairly infringed upon during U.S. law enforcement operations,\" the Foreign Ministry said.",
      "Georgia State Patrol troopers blocked roads to the Hyundai site. The Georgia Department of Public Safety confirmed they were dispatched to assist federal authorities.",

We have a search warrant for the whole site.\"",
      "\"We need construction to cease immediately,\" the man says. \"We need all work to end on the site right now.\"",

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is expected to issue an executive order as early as Friday establishing a designation for state sponsors of wrongful detention, CBS News has learned, in a move that would allow the U.S. to punish countries that illegally detain U.S. nationals or take them hostage.",
      "The effort is aimed at curbing the number of Americans who elect to travel to such countries, and encouraging the leaders of those countries to immediately free Americans currently held there.",
      "Modeled after the designation of state sponsors of terrorism, the measure would provide tools for the State Department to penalize nations that use detained Americans as political leverage and potentially issue geographic travel restrictions on where a U.S. passport can be used.",
      "The U.S. government does not publicize the number of Americans detained abroad. According to the Foley Foundation, an advocacy group, at least 54 Americans were held hostage or wrongfully detained in 17 countries during 2024.",
      "The State Department currently issues advisories with four levels of risk to advise Americans planning international travel, topped by \"Level 4: Do not travel.\" There are 21 countries on the \"Do Not Travel\" list, several of which list wrongful detention as a risk to travelers, including Iran, Afghanistan, Russia, Venezuela and North Korea.",
      "The State Department says most U.S. nationals who are arrested overseas are detained due to \"legitimate law enforcement and judicial processes.\"",
      "In President Trump's first term, Congress passed the Robert Levinson Act, which says the State Department can find that a U.S. national is being wrongfully detained based on multiple criteria, including the fairness of the country's judicial system, credible evidence of their innocence or reports that they are being held to extract concessions from the U.S. government.",
      "Levinson, a retired FBI and DEA agent, was kidnapped in Iran in 2007, and the U.S. maintained that he was held wrongfully by the Iranian government. In 2020, U.S. officials said intelligence suggested that he had died.",
      "His daughter, Sarah Levinson, in a statement to CBS News, thanked Mr. Trump, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, advisers Adam Boehler and Sebastian Gorka and FBI Director Kash Patel \"for sending such a powerful message to stop hostage taking.\"",
      "\"We have watched in horror as the practice of taking American citizens hostage as political leverage has not only escalated but run rampant by the acts of many rogue nations,\" Sarah Levinson wrote, adding, \"Our father, Robert Levinson, was wrongfully detained by the Iranian government and ultimately died in Iranian custody after years in captivity. This must never happen again.\"",
      "The State Department didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The planned executive order follows several high-profile cases in which foreign countries have arrested American citizens on what critics view as flimsy or unsubstantiated charges, before releasing them in exchange for prisoners held in the U.S.",
      "Russian authorities jailed journalist Evan Gershkovich and Marine veteran Paul Whelan for years on widely criticized espionage charges, and returned them to the U.S. in a complicated 2024 trade that involved the German government returning a convicted murderer to Russia.",
      "Whelan said in a statement that the president's executive order \"is a good start and would be a powerful deterrent if truly enforced against rogue regimes such as China and Russia.\" He thanked the CIA and State Department for their work on the cases of those who are wrongfully detained, and he urged Mr. Trump to secure \"compensation for those truly wrongfully detained and use frozen assets from the rogue regimes for that purpose.\"",
      "\"We need to deter the taking of hostages and ensure that once home hostages are taken care of properly. The US government could do much better in both regards,\" Whelan also said.",
      "In 2022, WNBA star Brittney Griner was released from a Russian prison on drug charges in exchange for the U.S. freeing notorious Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout. And earlier this year, American schoolteacher Marc Fogel was released from a Russian prison in exchange for\u00a0a Russian crypto fraudster.",

      "In a letter obtained by CBS News, the panel's Democrats are asking Attorney General Pam Bondi to hand over records about at least 20 Justice Department staff fired last month.",
      "The senators said they're seeking information regarding the justification \"for any of these draconian personnel actions,\" in reference to the terminations. They said of Justice Department leaders, \"Firing career administrative staff who lack decision-making authority because they were doing their jobs is a petty but pernicious abuse of power.\"",
      "In their letter to Bondi, they said that those who lost their jobs were not just prosecutors, but included \"paralegals, finance staff, administrative support staff, and United States Marshals.\"",
      "The fired Justice Department staffers were identified by the agency's so-called \"weaponization working group\" which Bondi established as one of her first priorities after she was confirmed earlier this year, a source told CBS News.",

      "The letter demands answers from the department by Friday, Sept. 12.",
      "The panel's Democrats also allege the fired employees were not given time to respond to accusations or to their terminations.",
      "\"Those dismissed since January are patriots and public servants,\" the letter reads. \"Your dismissal of their service without prior notice and without cause is a grave injustice that mocks the American ideal of nonpartisan government. Firing these public servants without cause is antidemocratic at best and likely unlawful.\"",
      "Sen.

      "The memo called for portions of the naval station to be used by Homeland Security agents as a command post and tactical operations center, citing the infrastructure at the base and its location near a highway. It also requested storage for medical supplies and less lethal munitions.",
      "The request was officially made last week, and Homeland Security personnel and equipment began arriving at the naval station earlier this week, a U.S. official familiar with the operation told CBS News. The naval station is located about 50 miles north of Chicago on Lake Michigan.",
      "CBS News and other news outlets reported late last month the Trump administration had made internal preparations to soon mount a major immigration enforcement campaign in the Chicago area, mirroring the operations that triggered massive protests in Southern California earlier this year. Officials said the operations could start as early as Friday.",

      "It's unclear where exactly in Chicago the immigration sweeps could take place, but the campaign is expected to be spearheaded by agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection.

      "Representatives for the Department of Defense did not respond to requests for comment on DHS' use of the Great Lakes naval station.",
      "Before President Trump took office for a second time, the military's role in supporting immigration enforcement was limited. Democratic and Republican administrations both deployed some troops to the U.S.-Mexico border, for example, to support Border Patrol agents.",
      "But the second Trump administration has used the American military in unprecedented ways to assist its mass deportation efforts, deploying thousands of additional troops to the southern border, using military planes for deportations and tasking National Guard units with supporting ICE detention centers. It has also converted parts of military installations \u2014 including the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base and Fort Bliss in Texas \u2014 into detention facilities for those awaiting deportation.",
      "In June, Mr. Trump deployed thousands of National Guardsmen and U.S. Marines to Los Angeles, citing instances of violence in protests against immigration sweeps in the area. He directed the guardsmen and marines to protect federal buildings and agents.",

Gavin Newsom, a Democrat \u2014 was recently ruled illegal by a federal judge who said the Trump administration had \"willfully\" violated federal law generally prohibiting the use of the military for civilian law enforcement.",

      "The Department of Homeland Security began moving detainees out of the site late last month. But the state has said Alligator Alcatraz will ramp back up if the lower court ruling is overturned.",
      "Last month, U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams ordered the state of Florida and federal government to immediately stop expanding the facility and to start dismantling its fences, lights and generators within 60 days. The judge sided with environmental groups and a Native American tribe who argued that Alligator Alcatraz \u2014 located in the middle of the sensitive Florida Everglades \u2014 should have been subject to federal environmental reviews.",
      "But on Thursday, the panel of appellate court judges froze that ruling. The court concluded that state and federal officials are likely to succeed in showing that the site isn't subject to the National Environmental Policy Act, because it is a state-operated facility and Florida has not yet received any federal reimbursement for the cost of running the site.",
      "The majority ruling was written by Judge Barbara Lagoa and joined by Judge Elizabeth Branch, both of whom were nominated in President Trump's first term. Judge Adalberto Jordan, an Obama nominee, dissented.",
      "DHS lauded the ruling, calling it a \"win for the American people, the rule of law and common sense.\"",

      "The deadly U.S. military strike in the Caribbean this week on a boat allegedly carrying drugs from Venezuela is the latest measure President Trump has taken to combat the threat he sees from the Tren de Aragua gang.",
      "The White House has offered few details on Tuesday's attack and insists the 11 people aboard were members of the gang. The criminal organization, which traces its roots to a Venezuelan prison, is not known for having a big role in global drug trafficking but for its involvement in contract killings, extortions and human smuggling.",
      "Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth warned Wednesday that the United States will keep assets positioned in the Caribbean and strike anyone \"trafficking in those waters who we know is a designated narco terrorist.\"",
      "U.S. officials have yet to explain how the military determined that those aboard the vessel were Tren de Aragua members. The strike represents a paradigm shift in how the U.S. is willing to combat drug trafficking in the Western Hemisphere and appears to send a combative message to governments in the region as well as drug traffickers.",
      "Tren de Aragua operations spread beyond Venezuela",
      "Tren de Aragua originated more than a decade ago at an infamously lawless prison with hardened criminals in Venezuela's central state of Aragua. The gang has expanded in recent years, recruiting from among the more than 7.7 million Venezuelans who have fled economic turmoil in their homeland and migrated to other Latin American countries or the U.S.",
      "Mr. Trump and administration officials have consistently blamed the gang for being at the root of the violence and illicit drug dealing that plague some U.S. cities. Mr. Trump has repeated his claim \u2014 contradicted by a declassified U.S. intelligence assessment \u2014 that Tren de Aragua is operating under Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro's control.",
      "During his 2024 presidential campaign, Mr. Trump described Aurora, Colorado, as a \"war zone\" overrun with members of the gang. Aurora Police Chief Todd Chamberlain rejected that characterization, explaining the gang was tied to organized violent crime concentrated in three apartment complexes in the city.",
      "Chamberlain said earlier this year his department had counted a total of nine confirmed Tren de Aragua members who passed through Aurora in the last two years.",
      "The size of the gang is unclear. Countries with large populations of Venezuelan migrants, including Peru and Colombia, have accused the group of being behind a spree of violence in the region.",
      "Authorities in Chile first identified the gang's operations in 2022. Prosecutors and investigators have said the group initially engaged primarily in human trafficking, organizing unauthorized border crossings and sexual exploitation, but over time, members have expanded their activities to more violent crimes, such as kidnapping, torture, extortion and became more involved in drug trafficking.",
      "While Tren de Argua has dominated ketamine trafficking in Chile, unlike other criminal organizations from Colombia, Central America and Brazil, it has no large-scale involvement in smuggling cocaine across international borders, according to InSight Crime, a think tank that last month published a 64-page report on the gang based on two years of research.",
      "\"We've found no direct participation of TdA in the transnational drug trade, although there are cases of them acting as subcontractors for other drug trafficking organizations,\" said Jeremy McDermott, a Colombia-based co-founder of InSight Crime.",
      "McDermott added that with affiliated cells spread across Latin America, it would not be a huge leap for the gang to one day delve into the drug trade.",
      "Landlocked Bolivia and Colombia, with access to the Pacific Ocean and Caribbean Sea and a border with Venezuela, are the world's top cocaine producers.",
      "Trump designated Tren de Aragua a foreign terrorist organization",
      "On his first day in office, Mr. Trump took steps to designate the gang a foreign terrorist organization alongside several Mexican drug cartels. The Biden administration had sanctioned the gang and offered $12 million in rewards for the arrest of three of its leaders.",
      "Mr. Trump's executive order accused the gang of working closely with top Maduro officials \u2014 most notably the former vice president and one-time governor of Aragua state, Tareck El Aissami \u2014 to infiltrate migration flows, flood the U.S. with cocaine and plot against the country. A U.S. intelligence assessment released earlier this year found minimal contact between the gang and low-level officials in the Venezuelan government but said there was no direct coordination between the gang and the government.",
      "In March, Mr. Trump also declared the group an invading force, invoking an 18th century wartime law that allows the U.S. to deport noncitizens without any legal recourse. Under the Alien Enemies Act, the administration sent more than 250 Venezuelan men to a maximum-security prison in El Salvador, where they remained incommunicado and without access to an attorney until their July deportation to Venezuela.",
      "A\u00a0U.S. appeals court panel this week ruled that Mr. Trump cannot use that law to speed deportations of people his administration accuses of being Tren de Aragua members. A final ruling on the matter, however, will be made by the Supreme Court.",
      "The Trump administration alleged the men deported to the prison were members of the Tren de Aragua gang, but provided little evidence. One justification officials used was that the men had certain kinds of tattoos allegedly signifying gang membership, including crowns, clocks and other symbols. But experts have said tattoos are not reliable markers of affiliation to the gang.",
      "Trump cites the gang in justifying the military strike",
      "The U.S. has not released the names and nationalities of the 11 people killed Tuesday. It also has not offered an estimate of the amount of drugs it says the boat was carrying.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Wednesday told reporters the U.S. military will continue lethal strikes on suspected drug trafficking vessels, but he dodged questions on details of the strike, including if the people in the boat were warned before the attack.",
      "But, he said, Mr. Trump \"has a right, under exigent circumstances, to eliminate imminent threats to the United States.\"",
      "\"If you're on a boat full of cocaine or fentanyl or whatever, headed to the United States, you're an immediate threat to the United States,\" he told reporters in Mexico City during a visit to Latin America.",
      "Venezuela's government, which has long minimized the presence of Tren de Aragua in the South American country, limited its reaction to the strike to questioning the veracity of a video showing the attack. Communications Minister Freddy \u00d1\u00e1\u00f1ez suggested it was created using artificial intelligence and described it as an \"almost cartoonish animation, rather than a realistic depiction of an explosion.\"",
      "Hegseth responded that the strike \"was definitely not artificial intelligence,\" adding he watched live footage from Washington as the strike was carried out.",
      "The strike shows that the U.S. government is \"quite literally deadly serious\" in its targeting of drug traffickers, said Ryan Berg, director of the Americas program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington-based think tank.",
      "But he questioned whether the link to Tren de Aragua has more to do with the \"familiarity\" that Americans now have with the gang.",

      "In a statement Thursday afternoon, lawyers for Monarez said Kennedy's claims were \"false, and at times, patently ridiculous.\"",
      "\"Dr. Monarez stands by what she said in her op-ed in The Wall Street Journal, would repeat it all under oath and continues to support the vision she outlined at her confirmation hearing that science will control her decisions,\" attorneys Mark Zaid and Abbe Lowell said.",
      "In June, Kennedy removed every member of the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices, a government panel that makes vaccine recommendations. At the time, he asserted that it \"has become little more than a rubber stamp for any vaccine.\" He then named several members to the panel, including vaccine skeptics, circumventing the usual CDC practice for selecting medical and public health experts.",
      "The newly constituted ACIP is set to meet later this month to consider vaccine recommendations. In her op-ed, Monarez wrote that \"[i]t is imperative that the panel's recommendations aren't rubber-stamped but instead are rigorously and scientifically reviewed before being accepted or rejected.\"",
      "After Monarez's firing, several other top CDC officials resigned, citing the Trump administration's stance on vaccines, which they found troubling, and budget cuts.",

    "summary": "New York's attorney general is appealing the ruling that slashed President Trump's half-billion-dollar penalty in his civil fraud case.",
    "story": [
      "New York's attorney general moved Thursday to have the state's highest court reinstate President Trump's staggering civil fraud penalty, appealing a lower-court decision that slashed the potential half-billion-dollar fine to $0.",
      "Attorney General Letitia James' office filed a notice of appeal with the state's Court of Appeals, seeking to reverse the mid-level Appellate Division's ruling last month that the penalty violated the U.S. Constitution's ban on excessive fines.",
      "James, a Democrat, had previously said she would appeal.",
      "Mr. Trump declared \"TOTAL VICTORY\" after the Appellate Division, First Department wiped away his fine, but the five-judge panel left other punishments in place and narrowly endorsed a trial court's finding that he committed fraud by padding his wealth on financial paperwork given to banks and insurers.",
      "The president filed his own appeal last week, asking the Court of Appeals to throw out those other punishments, which include a multiyear ban on him and his two eldest sons, Eric and Donald Trump Jr., from holding corporate leadership positions in New York.",
      "Those measures have been on hold during the appellate process and the Appellate Division judges said Mr. Trump can seek a court order to extend the pause pending further appeals. The Court of Appeals is the highest court in the Empire State.",
      "James' appeal is the latest twist in a lawsuit she filed against Mr. Trump in 2022, which alleged that he inflated his net worth by billions of dollars on his financial statements and habitually misled banks and others about the value of prized assets, including golf courses, hotels, Trump Tower and his Mar-a-Lago estate.",
      "After a trial that saw a sometimes testy Mr. Trump take the witness stand, Judge Arthur Engoron ruled last year that James had proven he engaged in a yearslong conspiracy with executives at his company to deceive banks and insurers about his wealth and assets.",
      "Engoron ordered Mr. Trump to pay $355 million \u2014 payback of what the judge deemed \"ill-gotten gains\" from his puffed-up financial statements. That amount soared to more than $527 million, including interest, by the time the Appellate Division ruled.",
      "The five-judge Appellate Division panel was sharply divided on many issues in Mr. Trump's appeal, but a majority said the monetary penalty was \"excessive.\"",
      "\"While harm certainly occurred, it was not the cataclysmic harm that can justify a nearly half billion-dollar award,\" two of the judges wrote.",

    "published": "Thu, 04 Sep 2025 13:56:03 -0400",
    "summary": "The announcement targeting Los Lobos and Los Choneros came after a lethal U.S. military strike\u200b against a similarly designated gang in Venezuela.",
    "story": [
      "U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Thursday that the United States is designating two Ecuadorian gangs as foreign terrorist organizations in the Trump administration's latest move against cartels.",
      "The announcement came as Rubio traveled to Ecuador to meet with its leaders in a trip to Latin America this week that has been overshadowed by a U.S. military strike against a similarly designated gang, Tren de Aragua. The strike has raised concerns in the region about whether the Trump administration will step up military activity to combat drug trafficking and illegal migration.",
      "The two new designees, Los Lobos and Los Choneros, are Ecuadorian gangs blamed for much of the violence that began since the COVID-19 pandemic. The designation, Rubio said, brings \"all sorts of options\" for the U.S. government to work in conjunction with the government of Ecuador to crack down on these groups.",
      "That includes the ability to kill them as well as take action against the properties and banking accounts in the U.S. for the group's members and people with ties to the criminal organizations, Rubio said, adding it would also help with intelligence sharing.",
      "Rubio called them \"vicious animals, these terrorists.\"",
      "Criminal gang violence continues unabated following the recapture in June of the country's biggest drug lord,\u00a0Adolfo Mac\u00edas, who leads Los Choneros, after his escape from a maximum-security prison in 2024. In July, the Ecuadoran government extradited Macias to the United States, where he faces multiple drug trafficking and firearms charges.",
      "Last year, the U.S. classified Los Choneros as one of the most violent gangs and affirmed its connection to powerful\u00a0Mexican drug cartels who threaten Ecuador and the surrounding region.",
      "Earlier this year, a leader of Los Lobos was\u00a0arrested at his home in the coastal city of Portoviejo. Carlos D, widely known by his alias El Chino, was the second-in-command of Los Lobos and \"considered a high-value target,\" the armed forces said in a statement.",
      "The U.S. last year declared Los Lobos to be the largest drug trafficking organization in Ecuador.",
      "\"Interdiction doesn't work\"",
      "Rubio's meetings in Quito on Thursday follow talks a day earlier with Mexican leaders that were overshadowed by the U.S. military strike on suspected Tren de Aragua drug runners in the southern Caribbean.",
      "The Trump administration asserts that it targeted a Venezuelan drug-running ship crewed by members of Tren de Aragua. U.S. officials say the vessel's cargo was intended for the United States and that the strike killed 11 people.",
      "Rubio defended the action and offered no justification other than to say the boat posed an \"immediate threat\" to the U.S. and that Trump opted to \"blow it up\" rather than follow what had been standard procedure to stop and board, arrest the crew and seize any contraband on board.",
      "\"Interdiction doesn't work,\" Rubio said Wednesday. \"Instead of interdicting it, on the president's orders, we blew it up. And it'll happen again. Maybe it's happening right now, I don't know, but the point is the president of the United States is going to wage war on narco-terrorist organizations.\"",
      "Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said on Wednesday that U.S. military assets will remain in the region, and that more strikes may be forthcoming.",
      "\"This is a deadly, serious mission for us and it won't stop with just this strike,\" Hegseth told Fox News. \"Anyone else trafficking in those waters who we know is a designated narco-terrorist will face the same fate.\"",
      "The strike got a mixed reaction from leaders around Latin America, where the U.S. history of military intervention and gunboat diplomacy is still fresh. Many, like officials in Mexico, were careful not to outright condemn the attack but stressed the importance of protecting national sovereignty and warning that expanded U.S. military involvement might actually backfire.",
      "Mexico Foreign Affairs Secretary Ram\u00f3n de la Fuente, speaking to reporters alongside Rubio, emphasized his country's preference for \"nonintervention, peaceful solution of conflicts.\"",
      "Ecuador has its own issues with narcotics trafficking and also has been looked to by the Trump administration as a possible destination to deport non-Ecuadorian migrants from the United States. U.S. officials have said they would like to secure an agreement with Ecuador that would have it accept such deportees, but the status of negotiations with Quito was not clear.",
      "Ecuador's president, Daniel Noboa, on Thursday thanked Rubio for the U.S. efforts to \"actually eliminate any terrorist threat.\" Before their meeting, Rubio had said on social media that the U.S. and Ecuador are \"aligned as key partners on ending illegal immigration and combatting transnational crime and terrorism.\"",
      "Surging violence since COVID-19 pandemic",
      "The latest U.N. World Drug Report says various countries in South America, including Colombia, Ecuador and Peru, reported larger cocaine seizures in 2022 than in 2021, but it does not give Venezuela the outsize role that the White House has in recent months.",
      "\"The impact of increased cocaine trafficking has been felt in Ecuador in particular, which has seen a wave of lethal violence in recent years linked to both local and transnational crime groups, most notably from Mexico and the Balkan countries,\" the report says.",
      "Violence has skyrocketed in Ecuador since the COVID-19 pandemic, as drug traffickers expanded operations in the country and took advantage of the nation's banana industry.",
      "The South American country is the world's largest exporter of bananas, shipping about 7.2 million tons a year by sea. Traffickers find containers filled with bananas the perfect vehicle to smuggle their product.",
      "In addition, cartels from Mexico, Colombia and the Balkans have settled in Ecuador because it uses the U.S. dollar and has weak laws and institutions, along with a network of long-established, ruthless gangs that are eager for work.",
      "Ecuador also gained prominence in the global cocaine trade after political changes in Colombia last decade. Coca bush fields in Colombia have been moving closer to the border with Ecuador due to the breakup of criminal groups after the 2016 demobilization of the rebel group Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, better known by its Spanish acronym FARC.",

    "summary": "The District of Columbia attorney general is arguing the National Guard troop patrols violates the Constitution and home rule.",
    "story": [
      "The attorney general for the District of Columbia announced Thursday that the nation's capital is suing the Trump administration over the deployment of National Guard troops within the city's boundaries, alleging the violation amounts to an unconstitutional, \"involuntary military occupation.\"",
      "The suit alleges that President Trump \"has run roughshod over a fundamental tenet of American democracy \u2014 that the military should not be involved in domestic law enforcement.\"",
      "The lawsuit comes as Mr. Trump has declared the use of National Guard troops in D.C. a success, and voiced an interest in expanding his use of military assets to tackle crime in some of the nation's largest cities, including Chicago, Baltimore and New Orleans.",
      "And, it comes on the heels of a similar legal challenge in California meant to blunt that effort. There, a federal judge earlier this week objected to the president's decision in June to deploy troops to Los Angeles, saying the move violated a law known as the Posse Comitatus Act, which sharply limits the use of the military for domestic purposes. The White House has appealed.",
      "\"Deploying the National Guard to engage in law enforcement is not only unnecessary and unwanted, but it is also dangerous and harmful to the District and its residents,\" said D.C. Attorney General Brian L. Schwalb in a statement sent to CBS News.",
      "\"No American city should have the US military \u2014 particularly out-of-state military who are not accountable to the residents and untrained in local law enforcement \u2014 policing its streets,\" Schwalb said. \"It's DC today but could be any other city tomorrow.\"",
      "White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said in a statement that Mr. Trump was \"well within his lawful authority to deploy the National Guard in Washington\" and said the lawsuit is an attempt to \"undermine\" the president's operation.",
      "Since mid-August, nearly 2,300 National Guard troops have joined the District's police force and an array of federal agencies in stepping up visible patrols around the city. The action has coincided with a noticeable impact on crime numbers. An analysis by CBS News found that crime was down by almost half during the first 19 days of troop deployments in comparison to the same dates the previous year.",
      "But the actions have come over vocal objections from District officials who said they are depriving them of local autonomy.",
      "\"More than 50 years ago, Congress granted the District the right to self-governance and control over local matters, including maintenance of public safety and order,\" Schwalb said in a statement. \"Congress did not give the President authority to participate in local D.C. law enforcement as he sees fit.\"",
      "The case, filed in federal court, echoes some aspects of the California legal challenge, arguing that law enforcement is not legally the domain of the military. It also argues that the D.C. National Guard troops deployed in the action fall under the command of city officials unless the president declares a genuine national emergency.",
      "Schwalb was elected to the attorney general post by District residents in 2022 and Axios reported this week that he would seek reelection in 2026. The lawsuit comes as the Washington Post reported that House Republicans are contemplating legislation to remove him\u00a0 and replace him with a presidential appointee.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Justice Amy Coney Barrett said that the Supreme Court \"should not be imposing its own values on the American people,\" as the high court faces a longshot bid to revisit its decade-old landmark ruling legalizing same-sex marriage.",
      "In her first television interview since joining the Supreme Court in October 2020, Barrett told CBS News senior correspondent Norah O'Donnell that she wants Americans to \"understand the law,\" which she said is \"not just an opinion poll\" based on the views of the court's nine justices.",
      "\"You know, what the court is trying to do is see what the American people have decided. And sometimes the American people have expressed themselves in the Constitution itself, which is our fundamental law. Sometimes in statutes,\" she said. \"But the court should not be imposing its own values on the American people. That's for the democratic process.\"",
      "Barrett spoke with O'Donnell ahead of the release of her book, \"Listening to the Law: Reflections on the Court and Constitution,\" which hits shelves Sept. 9. At 53, she is the youngest member of the Supreme Court and could serve for decades. Barrett was appointed to the high court by President Trump during his first term, filling the seat held by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg until her death in September 2020, just weeks before the presidential election.",
      "Months after Barrett was confirmed by the Senate and sworn in as a justice, the Supreme Court agreed to decide whether to reverse Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 decision that established the constitutional right to an abortion. The Supreme Court ultimately overturned that ruling in June 2022, leaving decisions about abortion access to the states. Since then, more than 20 states have restricted access to the procedure.",
      "Barrett was in the five-justice majority that voted to overturn Roe, and the decision raised concerns from critics that other precedents grounded in the 14th Amendment's Due Process Clause \u2014 namely those legalizing same-sex marriage and establishing the right to contraception \u2014 would be at risk of falling next.",
      "Bolstering those fears was a concurring opinion authored by Justice Clarence Thomas, which no other justice joined, in which he said the Supreme Court should reconsider those decisions.",
      "But Justice Brett Kavanaugh also addressed precedents involving contraception and gay marriage in his own solo concurring opinion, writing that \"overruling Roe does not mean the overruling of those precedents, and does not threaten or cast doubt on those precedents.\"",
      "Barrett wrote in her book \"the court has held that the rights to marry, engage in sexual intimacy, use birth control, and raise children are fundamental, but the rights to do business, commit suicide, and obtain abortion are not.\"",
      "The Supreme Court has been asked to overturn its 2015 ruling that recognized the constitutional right to same-sex marriage, Obergefell v. Hodges, in a case brought by Kim Davis, a former county clerk in Kentucky who stopped issuing marriage licenses on the heels of that decision 10 years ago.",
      "Davis's appeal faces long odds at the court. Whether to overturn Obergefell is one of three questions raised by Davis in her petition, and it's unclear whether there are four votes to reconsider the decision and five to overturn it.",
      "Still, some Democrats have suggested that the Supreme Court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, could dismantle the constitutional right to same-sex marriage.",
      "\"My prediction is they will do to gay marriage what they did to abortion \u2014 they will send it back to the states,\" former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said during a podcast interview with Jessica Tarlov, a co-host on Fox News' \"The Five.\"",
      "Barrett, though, rebuffed Clinton's prediction.",

Vaccines protecting against once-common and sometimes deadly childhood diseases like polio and measles have long been required for children at schools across the U.S.",
      "DeSantis also announced on Wednesday the creation of a state-level \"Make America Healthy Again\" commission modeled after similar initiatives pushed at the federal level by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.",
      "The vaccine announcement, which Ladapo said would allow people to make their own decisions, drew criticism from physician groups and other health leaders who stress that the vaccines are safe and the most effective way to stop the spread of communicable diseases, especially among schoolchildren.",
      "\"When everyone in a school is vaccinated, it is harder for diseases to spread and easier for everyone to continue learning and having fun,\" Dr. Rana Alissa, chair of the Florida Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said in an email. \"When children are sick and miss school, caregivers also miss work, which not only impacts those families but also the local economy.\"",

      "He noted it was similar for measles, which caused 48,000 hospitalizations and 450 to 500 deaths each year before the vaccine was introduced in the 1960s. Earlier this year, lower vaccination rates in some communities enabled the spread of the biggest measles outbreak in decades.",
      "\"it's so important to get those vaccination levels up so it protects everyone,\" Huang said.",
      "Ladapo likened vaccine mandates to \"slavery\"",
      "Ladapo, who has frequently\u00a0clashed with the medical establishment, cast current vaccine requirements in schools and elsewhere as an \"immoral\" intrusion on people's rights bordering on \"slavery,\" and said they hamper parents' ability to make health decisions for their children.",
      "\"People have a right to make their own decisions, informed decisions,\" Ladapo said at a news conference in Valrico, Florida, in the Tampa area. \"They don't have the right to tell you what to put in your body. Take it away from them.\"",
      "The state Health Department, Ladapo said, can scrap its own rules for some vaccine mandates, but others would require action by the Florida Legislature. He did not specify any particular vaccines but repeated several times the effort would end \"all of them. Every last one of them.\"",
      "Florida would be the first state to eliminate so many vaccine mandates, Ladapo added.",
      "Ladapo said his department will work with lawmakers to make it happen. But the idea received immediate pushback from some officials.",
      "Democratic state Rep. Anna Eskamani, who is running for Orlando mayor, said in a social media post that scrapping vaccines \"is reckless and dangerous\" and could cause outbreaks of preventable disease.",
      "\"This is a public health disaster in the making for the Sunshine State,\" she said on the social platform X.",
      "A prominent expert in the field, Dr. Michael Osterholm of the Vaccine Integrity Project, said the Florida proposal \"flies in the face of a mountain of evidence that clearly shows the benefits of vaccinating kids before they enter school, and it will make the state less safe to visit or live in.\u00a0 Every parent of a child who dies or who is hospitalized with a vaccine-preventable disease will know exactly why.\"",
      "Florida has required vaccines for kids attending school for decades",
      "In Florida, vaccine mandates for child day care facilities and public schools include shots for measles, chickenpox, hepatitis B, Diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis (DTaP), polio and other diseases, according to the state Health Department's website.",
      "Under DeSantis, Florida resisted imposing COVID vaccines on schoolchildren, requiring \"passports\" for places that draw crowds, school closures and mandates that workers get the shots to keep their jobs.",
      "\"I don't think there's another state that's done as much as Florida. We want to stay ahead of the curve,\" the governor said.",
      "The state \"MAHA\" commission would look into such things as allowing informed consent in medical matters, promoting safe and nutritious food, boosting parental rights regarding medical decisions about their children, and eliminating \"medical orthodoxy that is not supported by the data,\" DeSantis said. The commission will be chaired by Lt. Gov. Jay Collins and Florida first lady Casey DeSantis.",
      "\"We're getting government out of the way, getting government out of your lives,\" Collins said.",
      "The commission's work will help inform a large \"medical freedom package\" to be introduced in the Legislature next session, which would address the vaccine mandates required by state law and make permanent the recent state COVID decisions relaxing restrictions, DeSantis said.",
      "\"There will be a broad package,\" the governor said.",
      "Other states coordinating on vaccine planning",
      "Meanwhile, the Democratic governors of Washington, Oregon and California announced Wednesday that\u00a0they've created an alliance\u00a0to coordinate on health and vaccination guidelines,\u00a0 to counter what they call the Trump administration's politicizing of public health decisions.",

    "summary": "The United States will continue to conduct strikes on \"narco-terrorists\" in the Caribbean, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said.",
    "story": [
      "The United States will keep assets positioned in the Caribbean and strike anyone \"trafficking in those waters who we know is a designated narco terrorist,\" Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said Wednesday morning, a day after President Trump said the U.S. military had attacked and destroyed a drug-carrying vessel in the region.",
      "Mr. Trump said Tuesday that the U.S. had struck the boat\u00a0in international waters after it had departed from Venezuela. The president later\u00a0said on Truth Social\u00a0that 11 people were killed in the strike. He said the attack targeted members of\u00a0Tren de Aragua, a Venezuela-based organized crime group that has been\u00a0designated\u00a0as a foreign terrorist organization by the Trump administration.",
      "Mr. Trump also posted a video that appeared to show a military strike obliterating a small boat in the open sea.",
      "Hegseth told \"Fox & Friends\" on Wednesday morning that he watched the strike live. He said the video was \"definitely not artificial intelligence,\" as Venezuela's Communications Minister Freddy \u00d1\u00e1\u00f1ez claimed in a post on social media. Hegseth said that he could not elaborate on how the operation had been carried out, but said it was a \"precision\" attack.",
      "\"We knew exactly who was in that boat, we knew exactly what they were doing, and we knew exactly who they represented, and that was Tren de Aragua ... trying to poison our country with illicit drugs,\" Hegseth said.",
      "Hegseth did not say how the government identified the boat or those aboard it. Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters on Tuesday that he believed the drugs were headed toward Trinidad and Tobago or another country in the Caribbean. Kamla Persad-Bissessar, the prime minister of Trinidad and Tobago, praised the strike in a statement issued late Tuesday, The Associated Press reported.",
      "Hegseth said Wednesday that the strike shows that \"President Trump is willing to go on offense in ways that others have not been\" when dealing with drug smugglers.",
      "\"You want to try to traffic drugs, it's a new day,\" the defense secretary said. \"It's a different day, and so those 11 drug traffickers are no longer with us, sending a very clear signal that this is an activity the United States is not going to tolerate in our hemisphere.\"",
      "Hegseth said that assets will remain in the region, and that further strikes may be forthcoming.",
      "\"This is a deadly, serious mission for us and it won't stop with just this strike,\" he said. \"Anyone else trafficking in those waters who we know is a designated narco-terrorist will face the same fate.\"",
      "Mr. Trump\u00a0directed the military\u00a0to target drug cartels in Latin America last month. In August, the U.S. said the Navy would increase its presence near Venezuela and deploy multiple warships as part of an anti-drug cartel mission. Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u00a0called the move\u00a0an \"extravagant, unjustifiable, immoral and absolutely criminal and bloody threat.\" Maduro responded by deploying\u00a0warships and drones to Venezuela's coastline.",
      "The U.S. has not indicated it plans to strike Venezuela directly. When Hegseth was asked Wednesday by Fox News about the possibility of a regime change in the country, he said it was a \"presidential decision.\" The Trump administration has\u00a0accused Maduro's government\u00a0of working with drug cartels and groups like Tren de Aragua to bring illicit substances into the United States.",
      "A U.S. federal court charged Maduro\u00a0with narco-terrorism and drug trafficking\u00a0in 2020, allegations that Maduro has denied. The U.S. is offering a $50 million\u00a0reward for Maduro's arrest.",
      "\"What we have, there in the Caribbean, is clear demonstration of military might,\" Hegseth said in the \"Fox & Friends\" interview. \"President Trump has shown whether it is southwest border, Houthis, (Operation) Midnight Hammer in Iran, precise power could impact and reshape dynamics around the world and in the region. Nicolas Maduro, as he considers whether to be a narco-trafficker, has decisions to make.\"",

      "A new image shows the growing tail of a comet from another star system streaking across our solar system.",
      "The image of comet 3I/ATLAS was captured on Aug. 27 using one of the telescopes at the International Gemini Observatory in Chile during a public outreach event allowing students to work with astronomers.",
      "The comet is only the third-known interstellar object to pass through our solar system. It poses no threat to Earth, NASA previously said.",
      "Comet 3I/ATLAS has been photographed multiple times since its discovery in July. In early August, NASA and the European Space Agency released photos taken by the Hubble Space Telescope. It was about 277 million miles away from Earth when the telescope captured it.",
      "The new image from the Gemini Observatory shows the comet's broad coma, or a cloud of dust and gas that forms around its nucleus as it gets closer to the sun, astronomers said in a news release. The tail spans about 1/200th of a degree in the sky. One degree is about the width of a pinky finger, according to the news release. The tail also points away from the sun.",
      "The features are \"significantly more extended than they appeared in earlier images,\" according to astronomers. This means that the comet has become \"more active\" as it travels through the inner solar system.",
      "The main purpose of the observatory session, which allowed students and members of the public to remotely join astronomers in the control room, was to look at the wavelengths of light that emit from the comet. The wavelengths, also called a spectrum, can give scientists information about the comet's composition and chemistry, helping them understand how the comet changes while passing through the solar system, the news release said.",
      "NASA previously said the comet is expected to make its closest approach to the sun in late October and pass between the orbits of Mars and Earth. The comet is expected to remain visible through September, then get too close to the sun to observe until it reappears on the other side of the solar body in early December.",
      "Interstellar comets are very rare, astronomers said. Only two other examples have ever been confirmed:\u00a01I/'Oumuamu\u00a0in 2017 and\u00a02I/Borisov\u00a0in 2019.",

A trio of authors \u2014 thriller novelist Andrea Bartz and nonfiction writers Charles Graeber and Kirk Wallace Johnson \u2014 sued last year, and now represent a broader group of writers and publishers whose books Anthropic downloaded to train its chatbot Claude.",
      "The landmark settlement could mark a turning point in legal battles between AI companies and the writers, visual artists and other creative professionals who accuse them of copyright infringement. A judge could approve the settlement as soon as Monday.",
      "\"As best as we can tell, it's the largest copyright recovery ever,\" said Justin Nelson, a lawyer for the authors. \"It is the first of its kind in the AI era.\"",
      "In a statement to CBS News, Anthropic Aparna Sridhar deputy general counsel said the settlement \"will resolve the plaintiffs' remaining legacy claims.\"",

      "Books are known to be important sources of data \u2014 in essence, billions of words carefully strung together \u2014 that are needed to build the AI large language models behind chatbots like Anthropic's Claude and its chief rival, OpenAI's ChatGPT.",
      "Alsup's June ruling found that Anthropic had downloaded more than 7 million digitized books that it \"knew had been pirated.\" It started with nearly 200,000 from an online library called Books3, assembled by AI researchers outside of OpenAI to match the vast collections on which ChatGPT was trained.",
      "Debut thriller novel \"The Lost Night\" by Bartz, a lead plaintiff in the case, was among those found in the Books3 dataset.",
      "Anthropic later took at least 5 million copies from the pirate website Library Genesis, or LibGen, and at least 2 million copies from the Pirate Library Mirror, Alsup wrote.",
      "The Authors Guild told its thousands of members last month that it expected \"damages will be minimally $750 per work and could be much higher\" if Anthropic was found at trial to have willfully infringed their copyrights. The settlement's higher award \u2014 approximately $3,000 per work \u2014 likely reflects a smaller pool of affected books, after taking out duplicates and those without copyright.",
      "On Friday, Mary Rasenberger, CEO of the Authors Guild, called the settlement \"an excellent result for authors, publishers, and rightsholders generally, sending a strong message to the AI industry that there are serious consequences when they pirate authors' works to train their AI, robbing those least able to afford it.\"",

    "summary": "Armani never relinquished control over the multibillion-dollar company he created, a key to his enormous success.",
    "story": [
      "Giorgio Armani leaves a legacy not only as a seminal figure in the history of fashion, but also as a visionary business leader who built a globally recognized brand and multibillion-dollar business empire, industry experts said after his death Thursday at age 91.",
      "\"Armani made certain that his vision was consistent and that it was always classy, even down to presentation in the Armani Exchange stores,\" Shawn Grain Carter, an associate professor at the Fashion Institute of Technology, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Armani, or \"Re Giorgio\" (King George) as the Italians call him,\u00a0famously created luxury looks for Hollywood starlets on the red carpet while also producing stylish accessories and clothing for everyday consumers at casual price points.",
      "While meticulously tailored clothing made from quality fabrics has always been at the heart of the Armani brand, the designer expanded his business over the years to include not just perfumes and accessories but home furnishings, cosmetics, books, flowers \u2014 and even chocolates. Connecting them all was sophisticated design, which Armani wove into all things he put his name on.",
      "\"He was masterful in sticking to his vision, but executing it in a way that would be accessible luxury, a quiet luxury, but still tasteful and elegantly crafted,\" said Grain Carter.",
      "Among Armani's most celebrated contributions and successful business maneuvers was the power suit, a softly tailored, ready-to-wear take on office attire that quickly rose in popularity among the American business class.",
      "Introduced in the '70s, the Armani suit was a bold deviation from the rigid, restrictive suits businessmen were accustomed to wearing. Armani's elegantly tailored suits quickly became a must in every well-heeled man's closet. Beth Dincuff, an associate professor at Parsons School of Design, said Armani manifested the idea of a \"sophisticated man who cared about how he looked, who was aware of his physique and who wanted to show it off in a new way.\"",
      "Armani soon brought that masculine sensibility to women's fashion with the pantsuit, a shoulder-padded jacket and tailored trousers. This gave women a refined and sophisticated option for the office that projected confidence and power.",
      "\"That's attributed to Giorgio Armani \u2014 making it okay for a woman to wear a pantsuit but still look like a woman in terms of a power aesthetic,\" said Grain Carter.",
      "Armani's design decisions also tapped into the cultural moment. The designer\u00a0told CBS News in 2006 that his new line of women's clothes was in response to the feminist movement. Women needed their own version of the traditional men's suit jacket, he thought.",
      "Celebrities and Armani",
      "Using celebrities to elevate the Armani brand was another decision that cemented the Italian designer's business success. He began by outfitting Richard Gere in the 1980 neo-noir crime drama \"American Gigolo.\" The Italian designer went on to design clothes for more than 150 films throughout his career.",
      "\"His idea to reach out to celebrities was very, very important,\" Dincuff said .",
      "Armani pivoted to dressing celebrities on the red carpet in the 1990s, where his\u00a0black tie outfits and glittering evening gowns often stole the show. The use of celebrities to showcase his fashion was novel at the time, said Dincuff.",
      "Some early looks that captured popular attention included the oversized Armani suit worn by Julia Roberts at the 1990s Golden Globes and a champagne-colored Armani suit that Jodie Foster wore at the 1992 Academy Awards.",
      "The list of celebrities that have\u00a0worn Armani on the red carpet is long and includes Beyonc\u00e9, Selena Gomez, \u00a0Anne Hathaway, Michelle Pfeiffer, Margot Robbie and Winona Ryder.",
      "His own boss",
      "Central to Armani's success was the fact that he never relinquished control of the multibillion company he created. Having never agreed to a merger or sale, the Italian fashion designer was always his own boss.",
      "This allowed Armani to maintain creative control and consistency over his expanding business empire, distinguishing him from other designers.",
      "While he did strike several licensing deals over his career with companies like EssilorLuxottica\u00a0and\u00a0L'Or\u00e9al, he kept the majority of his business portfolio in-house. That included everything from Armani Priv\u00e9, his haute couture fashion collection and fragrance line, to Armani Exchange \u2014 a more affordable fashion line geared toward younger generations, said Grain Carter. Armani also kept the collections Giorgio Armani and Emporio Armani under his purview.",
      "\"All of this was in-house and he controlled it from concept to production to distribution to marketing to how it is finance,\" Grain Carter said. \"He was active at every level, at every step.\"",
      "Today the Armani empire has more than 9,000 employees along with seven industrial hubs and over 600 stores worldwide, according to figures released in 2023.",
      "As for potential succession plans, the Giorgio Armani company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "\"I cannot really contemplate the next person, because there will be no other Giorgio Armani,\" Grain Carter said.",

He was riding in the cockpit jump seat behind the pilot and first officer. The plane was diverted to Portland, where it landed safely with more than 80 people on board.",
      "Emerson told police he was despondent over a friend's recent death, had taken psychedelic mushrooms about two days earlier, and hadn't slept in over 40 hours. He has said he believed he was dreaming at the time and that he was trying to wake himself up by grabbing two red handles that would have activated the plane's fire suppression system and cut off fuel to its engines.",
      "\"You're not going home. You need to wake up. That's when I acted. I pulled the handles that were in front of my face,\" Emerson told CBS News he recalled thinking at the time.",
      "Emerson of Pleasant Hill, California, was charged in federal court with interfering with a flight crew. A state indictment in Oregon separately charged him with 83 counts of endangering another person and one count of endangering an aircraft.",

      "The Department of Transportation is dropping a proposed rule that would have required airlines to offer cash to passengers whose flights were disrupted.",
      "The rule, which never went into effect, would have required carriers to provide compensation \"to mitigate passenger inconveniences\" for cancellations or delays that were within a carrier's control.",
      "Reuters was the first to report that the Transportation Department was shelving the proposal.",
      "The proposal was introduced under President Biden and then-Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. It would've required airlines to pay up to $300 for domestic delays of three to six hours and up to $775 for flight delays lasting at least nine hours.",
      "\"The ability of airlines to choose the services that they provide to mitigate passenger inconveniences resulting from flight disruptions under current U.S. law contrasts with consumer protection regimes in other jurisdiction,\" the proposed rule states.",
      "In a statement, a spokesperson for the Department of Transportation told CBS News: \"We will faithfully implement all aviation consumer protection requirements mandated by Congress, including the requirement to refund ticket prices to passengers in the case of airline canceled or substantially delayed flights when consumers choose not to travel. Some of the rules proposed or adopted by the previous administration, however, went beyond what Congress has required by statute, and we intend to reconsider those extra-statutory requirements.\"",
      "\"This action does not change the Department's commitment or intent to carry out the consumer protection mandates from Congress in the recent FAA Reauthorization Act, including provisions relating to refunds. Instead, the action is part of USDOT's effort to ensure the traveling public is treated fairly while also acknowledging the realities of carriers' operations and the impact of overly burdensome regulations on the American people,\" the DOT spokesperson said.",
      "Although airlines guarantee rebooking, plus meals and lodging vouchers, for customers affected by flight delays and cancellations, none guarantee cash compensation for such inconveniences.",
      "Airlines were opposed to the proposed regulation when it was announced in December. At the time, Airlines for America, a trade group representing the nation's carriers, said it would \"drive up ticket prices, make air travel less accessible for price-sensitive travelers and negatively impact carrier operations.\"",
      "The group on Thursday cheered the Transportation Department's decision to drop the compensation proposal.",
      "\"We are encouraged by this Department of Transportation reviewing unnecessary and burdensome regulations that exceed its authority and don't solve issues important to our customers,\" Airlines for America said in a statement. \"We look forward to working with DOT on implementing President Trump's deregulatory agenda.\"",
      "The DOT is also reviewing what types of flight cancellations trigger refunds for consumers, and is considering repealing a Biden-era rule that requires airlines to disclose ancillary fees upfront to help consumers avoid unexpected charges.",

    "summary": "The latest employment data could inform the Federal Reserve's next rate decision meeting, set for Sept. 17.",
    "story": [
      "Employers across the U.S. added 22,000 jobs in August, falling short of economists' muted expectations and signaling the labor market is facing sharp headwinds from mounting economic uncertainty amid the Trump administration's wide-ranging tariffs.",
      "The numbers",
      "Economists had forecast payroll gains of 80,000 last month, according to a poll by FactSet.",
      "The unemployment rate rose to 4.3% in August, up from 4.2% in July, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said.",
      "The latest data points to an ongoing slowdown in the labor market, with employers hiring an average of 29,000 each month from June through August, versus 168,000 workers each month in 2024. Revised data shows that employers shed 13,000 jobs in June rather than adding the 14,000 that had been reported a month earlier, marking the first decline since late 2020.",
      "Some companies are paring back hiring plans amid the on-again, off-again uncertainty of the Trump administration's tariffs, which are import duties paid by U.S. companies. Businesses in seven of the Fed's 12 regional districts canvassed in the latest so-called Beige Book, a survey of local economic conditions, said they were hesitant to hire because of weaker demand and uncertainty over the near-term outlook.",
      "\"August's employment report confirmed that the labor market has headed off a cliff-edge,\" Bradley Saunders, North America economist at Capital Economics, said in a Friday research report.",
      "Consumers are also dour, with a new CBS News poll finding that Americans are continuing to rate the U.S. economy negatively, with most respondents picking \"uncertain\" and \"struggling\" to describe its current state.",
      "The August jobs report marks the first since President Trump\u00a0fired former Bureau of Labor Statistics Commissioner Erika McEntarfer on Aug. 1 in the wake of a disappointing July jobs report, which included a significant downward revision of May and June hiring figures.",
      "Citing the large revisions, Mr. Trump questioned the validity of the government data, although the BLS typically revises its prior reports each month based on fresher responses from employers.",
      "The new revisions",
      "On Friday, the BLS revised the prior two months' data, showing that employers shed 13,000 jobs in June, revising the month's hiring downward by 27,000 fewer jobs. That marks the first monthly decline in hiring since December 2020, when the U.S. was in the midst of an economic crisis caused by the pandemic.",
      "The BLS also revised July's jobs numbers upward, showing that employers added 79,000 workers that month, rather than the 73,000 reported in August.",
      "The revisions show that the economy added 21,000 fewer jobs in June and July than had earlier been reported by the BLS.",
      "What economists say",
      "The labor market data is complicating the Federal Reserve's next rate cut decision, which set for Sept. 17. The central bank's dual mandate requires it to ensure that both inflation and unemployment remain low, but inflation has been edging upward, which economists say is partly due to Mr. Trump's tariffs.",
      "The Fed's most powerful weapon for battling inflation is to hike interest rates, yet its best option for helping the job market is to lower borrowing costs, making it cheaper for businesses to expand. With the combination of rising inflation and weaker hiring, the Fed is in a tough position, economists say.",
      "Last month, Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who has been under pressure from Mr. Trump to cut rates, signaled that the central bank is open to reducing rates at its September meeting, citing risks to the labor market.",
      "\"The labor market continues to show fatigue as businesses hold back on hiring amid uncertainty around the direction of inflation, tariffs and the strength of the underlying economy,\" said Joe Gaffoglio, CEO at Mutual of America Capital Management, in an email after the data was released.",
      "\"Recent labor data showed that more individuals are unemployed in the U.S. (7.24 million) than there are available jobs (7.18 million), which hasn't happened since April 2021,\" he added.",
      "The latest data is likely to ensure a rate cut at the Fed's next meeting, experts said on Friday. The lower-than-expected hiring, as well as June's negative revision, could also persuade the central bank to cut later in the year as well, they added.",
      "\"The Federal Reserve needs to cut interest rates in September and probably October and December, too. The 'no hiring' economy is turning to a layoff economy and if that worsens, it will lead to a recession. This needs to be stopped,\" Heather Long, chief economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, said in an email.",

    "story": [
      "A Navy diver who died nearly three decades ago has been linked to half a dozen home invasion and rape cases across four states after a yearslong investigation, California officials said Thursday.",
      "All of the attacks were cold cases dating back to the 1980s and 90s, where women were sexually assaulted by a home intruder. The intruder terrorized the women, sometimes calling their homes or threatening to kill them if they reported the incidents to police, the district attorney's office said.",
      "The Ventura County District Attorney's Office said that Sean Patrick McNulty was connected to the crimes. McNulty died by suicide in Michigan in 1997, after becoming a suspect in a 1993 Indiana rape case.",
      "The Ventura County Sheriff's Office Forensic Services Bureau oversaw the testing of two rape kits collected in the county in 1982 and 1983. DNA from the tests were uploaded to the Combined DNA Index System, a database managed by the FBI that can be used to compare DNA profiles and find matches. In March 2024, investigators determined the DNA from the two cases matched, the district attorney's office said.",
      "The DNA was also found to match rapes in Michigan in 1994 and 1995, and a rape in Ohio in 1997. McNulty had not been named as a suspect in any of those cases. After Ventura County investigators reached out to law enforcement in Michigan and Ohio, the agencies launched a joint investigation and worked with an investigative genealogist from the Columbus Police Department.",
      "The genealogist's research allowed police to identify McNulty as a potential suspect in all five cases. His body had been cremated, leaving police unable to obtain a DNA sample from his remains, but investigators found the records from the 1997 Indiana rape case, where he had been named a suspect. Investigators from that case were able to find a biological sample collected from McNulty.",
      "That sample was then compared against the DNA sample from the other cases. Scientists determined that McNulty's DNA matched the biological samples found in all five cases.",
      "Police have worked to contact McNulty's victims and notify them of his identification and death. So far, only one victim has been located. The district attorney's office said the woman told investigators she had \"waited 40 years\" to receive closure.",
      "The victim in the 1997 Indiana case, where McNulty was a suspect, also said that she was \"grateful after all these years\" that investigators \"didn't give up\" on the case.",
      "McNulty was born in Burlingame, California and spent most of his life in Ventura County. He was arrested in the area in 1978 for placing obscene phone calls to women. He served as a diver in the Navy from 1979 to 1992.",
      "McNulty was married in 1988 and divorced his wife prior to his death, the district attorney's office said. His ex-wife is still alive but did not cooperate with Ventura County investigators.",

      "In a large-scale immigration enforcement raid at a huge Hyundai facility in Georgia on Thursday, 475 immigrants suspected of living and working in the U.S. illegally were detained, federal authorities announced.",
      "Steven Schrank, the special agent in charge of Homeland Security Investigations in Georgia, told reporters Friday that the majority of those detained were Korean nationals but he didn't know exactly how many. They worked for a variety of different companies at the site, including subcontractors, he said.",
      "No criminal charges were announced during Friday's news conference. The sweep was conducted as part of a monthslong investigation into allegations of unlawful employment practices and other federal crimes, Schrank said. He described Thursday's raid as the largest enforcement operation at a single site in the history of Homeland Security Investigations, which is a unit of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.",
      "\"This operation underscores our commitment to protecting jobs for Georgians and Americans, ensuring a level playing field for businesses that comply with the law, safeguarding the integrity of our economy and protecting workers from exploitation,\" Schrank said.",
      "Some of those detained Thursday allegedly entered the U.S. illegally and others were accused of overstaying their visas or violating visa waivers by working, Schrank said. Most of the detainees were taken to an ICE facility in Folkston, Georgia, near the Florida-Georgia state line.",
      "\"They will be moved based on their individual circumstances beyond that,\" Schrank said.",
      "The president of Georgia's chapter of the AFL-CIO called the raid politically motivated and said ICE has been escalating its presence at workplaces across the state.",
      "\"This raid is the latest in an ongoing campaign of harassment that has targeted immigrant Georgians as they try to earn an honest living,\" Yvonne Brooks said in a statement. \"Arresting and detaining workers, who are exploited every day and risk their lives every day on the job, creates an atmosphere of fear that terrorizes workers and their families and increases the workload burden on their coworkers.\"",
      "The operation involved law enforcement agents from multiple federal agencies, including ICE; the Border Patrol; the FBI; the Drug Enforcement Administration; the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives; and the IRS, underscoring the government-wide nature of the Trump administration's crackdown on illegal immigration.",

      "The sweep targeted one of Georgia's largest and most high-profile manufacturing sites, touted by Gov. Brian Kemp and other officials as the biggest economic development project in the state's history. Hyundai Motor Group, South Korea's biggest automaker, began manufacturing electric vehicles a year ago at the $7.6 billion plant, which employs about 1,200 people, and has partnered with LG Energy Solution to build an adjacent battery plant, slated to open next year. The search shut down construction on the battery plant.",
      "In a statement to The Associated Press, LG said it was \"closely monitoring the situation and gathering all relevant details.\" It said it couldn't immediately confirm how many of its employees or Hyundai workers had been detained.",
      "\"Our top priority is always ensuring the safety and well-being of our employees and partners. We will fully cooperate with the relevant authorities,\" the company said.",
      "ICE spokesman Lindsay Williams confirmed that federal authorities conducted an enforcement operation at the 3,000-acre site west of Savannah. He said agents were focused on the construction site for the battery plant.",
      "The South Korean Foreign Ministry said in a statement that it was dispatching officials to the site and urged the U.S. Embassy in Seoul \"to exercise extreme caution to ensure that the legitimate rights and interests of Korean citizens are not infringed upon.\"",
      "\"The economic activities of Korean investment companies and the rights and interests of Korean citizens must not be unfairly infringed upon during U.S. law enforcement operations,\" the Foreign Ministry said.",
      "Georgia State Patrol troopers blocked roads to the Hyundai site. The Georgia Department of Public Safety confirmed they were dispatched to assist federal authorities.",
      "Video posted to social media Thursday showed workers in yellow safety vests lined up as a man wearing a face mask and a tactical vest with the letters HSI, which stands for Homeland Security Investigations, tells them: \"We're Homeland Security. We have a search warrant for the whole site.\"",
      "\"We need construction to cease immediately,\" the man says. \"We need all work to end on the site right now.\"",
      "The Trump administration has undertaken sweeping ICE operations as part of a mass deportation agenda. Immigration officers have raided farms, construction sites, restaurants and auto repair shops.",

    "story": [
      "Tesla's board of directors is asking shareholders to approve a new pay package for CEO Elon Musk that could be worth up to $1 trillion in a decade, representing one of the richest compensation packages in corporate history.",
      "According to a regulatory filing published Friday, the electric car maker's board wants to award Musk about 423 million shares, which today have a value of $143 billion, if the company hits certain profitability, production and market capitalization milestones.",
      "\"Tesla does not currently have a long-term CEO performance award in place to retain and incentivize Elon to focus his energies on Tesla and lead us through this pivotal moment in our history. It's time to change that,\" board members said in a letter to shareholders.",
      "For Musk to earn the full pay package, Tesla would have to reach a market cap of $8.5 trillion \u2014 about eight times its current value \u2014 in 10 years. At that level, the stock awarded to Musk would be worth more than $1 trillion.",
      "Tesla would also need to hit certain operational targets for Musk to collect the full pay package. Those include delivering 20 million vehicles; producing 1 million of the automaker's self-driving \"robotaxis\"; and manufacturing 1 million of the company's humanoid robots, dubbed Optimus, which are currently under development.",
      "Musk would also receive more voting power over Tesla under the proposed plan.",
      "The company's new compensation scheme \"represents a critical next step to keep Musk as CEO at least until 2030,\" Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a report, adding that Tesla is \"heading into one of the most important stages of its growth cycle with the autonomous and robotics future now on the doorstep.\"",
      "The entrepreneur's previous compensation has drawn legal challenges. In 2018, Tesla investors filed a lawsuit challenging Musk's $56 billion pay package, alleging that he and the company's board had breached their fiduciary duties. In December, a Delaware judge ordered the company to revoke that award.",
      "In August, Tesla said it was granting Musk shares totaling\u00a0around $29 billion.",
      "Tesla's vehicle sales have stalled over the last year, dropping 1% in 2024 from the previous year \u2014 the car maker's first annual sales decline in 12 years \u2014 amid mounting competition from rival automakers and unhappiness among some customers at Musk's support for President Trump. In its most recent quarter, Tesla reported that quarterly profits plunged from nearly $1.4 billion to $409 million, while revenue also sank.",
      "Tesla's stock price has slumped in 2025, but has risen more than 54% over the last 12 months and roughly 143% over the last five years.",

      "So far this year, the Powerball jackpot has been grabbed four times.",
      "Saturday's drawing will be the 42nd since the Powerball jackpot was last won on May 31, by a lucky ticket-holder in California. The current run of 41 ties the game's mark for most consecutive drawings without a jackpot winner. The only other Powerball jackpot streak to get to 42 drawings ended on April 6, 2024, with a $1.326 billion jackpot won in Oregon.",
      "If a single ticket wins this Saturday's jackpot, its purchaser would get to choose between an annuity-tied estimated $1.8 billion or the lump sum payment of roughly $826.4 million, known as the cash value. If a winner picks the annuity option, they would get an immediate payment followed by 29 annual ones that increase by 5% each year.",

    "published": "Fri, 05 Sep 2025 11:50:00 -0400",
    "summary": "Students have long been required to receive vaccinations for once-common childhood illnesses like polio and measles. What if that changes?",
    "story": [
      "Florida officials announced this week that the state will work to phase out all childhood vaccine mandates, becoming the first in the U.S. to do so. Health experts say such a move raises the risk of deadly disease outbreaks.",
      "Students have long been required to receive vaccinations for once-common childhood illnesses like polio and measles. A large majority of Americans believe the government should make vaccines more available and should encourage vaccination against measles, mumps and rubella,\u00a0a CBS News poll found.",
      "In the past few years, the United States has seen rising numbers of families getting vaccine exemptions for non-medical reasons, and vaccination rates have declined. Some states have made it easier to seek such exemptions. Florida's plan to roll back requirements would be the most sweeping change to vaccine regulations by far.",
      "Why do schools have vaccine mandates?",
      "Communities need to maintain high rates of vaccination to prevent outbreaks of disease and achieve what's called herd immunity, public health experts say. Herd immunity helps protect vulnerable members of the population who can't get vaccinated, like those who are too young or immunocompromised. For a disease like measles, the CDC says a herd immunity threshold of 95% is necessary to avoid outbreaks.",
      "School vaccine mandates are an \"important tool\" to maintain herd immunity, said Liz Williams, a senior policy manager with KFF's Program on Medicaid and the Uninsured.",
      "\"It's so important to get those vaccination levels up so it protects everyone,\" Dr. Philip Huang, director of the Dallas County Health and Human Services Department, told CBS News. \"When you make it a requirement, that's where you get the rates up to where we need to protect everyone.\"",
      "Routine childhood vaccinations also keep \"children, families and their communities healthy and thriving,\" Dr. Susan J. Kressly, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics,\u00a0said in August.",
      "School vaccination rules vary by state. Most states require students receive vaccinations for polio, chicken pox, diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis (DTaP) and measles, mumps and rubella (MMR), according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Some states also require vaccination for meningitis and hepatitis B.",
      "\"When everyone in a school is vaccinated, it is harder for diseases to spread and easier for everyone to continue learning and having fun,\" Dr. Rana Alissa, chair of the Florida Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said in an email to The Associated Press on Wednesday. \"When children are sick and miss school, caregivers also miss work, which not only impacts those families but also the local economy.\"",
      "Will other states ban vaccine mandates?",
      "Florida is the first state to announce plans to entirely roll back vaccine mandates, but it's not clear when the changes will take effect. Some of the vaccine requirements can be struck down by the health department, while others will require legislative approval. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said a state \"Make America Healthy Again\" commission will help create a \"medical freedom package\" to be introduced in the state Legislature next session.",
      "Idaho loosened many of its rules on immunizations in a new law that took effect over the summer. The \"Idaho Medical Freedom Act\" prohibits schools, companies and government entities from denying admission or services to a person who has not received a \"medical intervention,\" including vaccines. The law weakens school vaccine mandates, said Williams, but does not go as far as Florida's plan.",
      "Idaho is also one of three states \u2014 along with Montana and Iowa \u2014 that have debated legislation that would limit the use of mRNA vaccines, according to Axios. Louisiana officials have not commented on banning vaccine mandates, but said in February\u00a0that they will stop promoting mass vaccination campaigns.",
      "Parents, across political lines, are overwhelmingly supportive of schools requiring vaccines for measles and polio, according to\u00a0a KFF-Washington Post poll.",
      "States allow for increased vaccine exemptions",
      "At least 10 states have made changes to state-level vaccination requirement policies in the last year, said Williams. Most of those changes will result in more students claiming exemptions from vaccine policies, she said. Areas with higher rates of vaccine exemptions tend to have lower vaccination rates and be at an increased risk for outbreaks, Williams said.",
      "There are two kinds of vaccine exemptions: medical and non-medical exemptions. Non-medical exemptions include those for personal reasons or religious beliefs. All states allow for medical exemptions. California, New York, Maine, Rhode Island and West Virginia do not allow for non-medical exemptions, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.",
      "The country has already seen a rise in vaccine exemptions in recent years, according to CDC data, and hit a record high last year. During the 2021-2022 school year, 2.2% of students had an exemption for at least one vaccine. Of those, 1.9% were for non-medical reasons. By the 2024-2025 school year, 3.6% students had an exemption for at least one vaccine with 2.4% of those exemptions for non-medical reasons.",
      "Idaho had the highest rate of exemptions during the 2024-2025 school year, at 15.4%, according to CDC data. Nearly all, or 15.1%, of those exemptions were for non-medical reasons. The state with the next highest rate of exemptions is Alaska, at 9.4%.",
      "The rise in exemptions has led to falling vaccination rates overall. CDC data shows that about 92.1% of kindergarteners received the DTaP vaccine, while 92.5% received the MMR and polio vaccines. The numbers are all down slightly from the previous school year, the CDC said.",
      "\"We've seen children's vaccination rates for routine childhood vaccination decline since the pandemic, and we've also seen exemptions to school vaccination increase,\" Williams said. \"It's likely a lot of these state level policy changes are going to continue to contribute to these trends (of) more exemptions and lower vaccination rates.\"",
      "What happens if vaccine rates fall?",
      "If vaccine rates fall below the numbers needed to maintain herd immunity, experts say the U.S. could see more outbreaks of preventable disease.",
      "Earlier this year, a measles outbreak erupted in a community in West Texas with low vaccination rates, leading to the U.S. recording the most cases of the potentially deadly illness in 30 years. Infections were confirmed in at least 39 states, with more than 1,400 cases nationwide. CDC data showed 92% of the people sickened had not received a measles vaccine or were of unknown vaccination status.",
      "Before the measles vaccine became available in the 1960s, about 48,000 Americans were hospitalized for the illness each year and\u00a0about 500, mostly children, would die.",
      "Lower vaccination rates have also enabled a number of cases of polio, which had officially been considered eliminated in the U.S. years ago.",
      "\"People forget the successes that we've seen with these vaccines. Before we had the polio vaccine, there were almost 60,000 cases in the U.S. each year, and almost 14,000 cases of paralytic polio,\" Huang, of the Dallas County health department,\u00a0told CBS News. \"Parents waited fearfully every summer to see if it would strike.\"",
      "Worldwide, vaccines have saved 154 million lives, mostly infants, in the past 50 years, according to the World Health Organization. The CDC says that childhood vaccinations prevent about 4 million deaths worldwide each year.",

      "\"We were able to work out not only which character used it, but exactly how it's used,\" Alinger told CBS News, \"and you can see the small steel post that comes out of the top of it here, that's how they actually mounted the blade on it.\"",
      "Propstore says the lightsaber was made from a 1950s camera flash bulb attachment and \"expertly modified by the production team into a lightsaber.\" It says the piece \"bears authentic signs of wear\" that \"serve as compelling evidence of the lightsaber's direct involvement in the action \u2014 testament to its film-used authenticity.\"",

      "Notre Dame law professor Amy Coney Barrett was serving on the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals in Indiana when she was nominated to the Supreme Court by President Trump in 2020. In her new memoir, \"Listening to the Law: Reflections on the Court and Constitution\" (to be published September 9 by Sentinel), Barrett writes of the decision she and her family made to \"burn the boats\" upon being asked to serve on the High Court.",
      "Read an excerpt below, and don't miss Norah O'Donnell's interview with Justice Barrett on \"CBS Sunday Morning\" September 7!",
      "\"Listening to the Law\" by Amy Coney Barrett",
      "Prefer to listen?\u00a0Audible\u00a0has a 30-day free trial available right now.",
      "I really loved my job on the Seventh Circuit and settled into the rhythm of hearing arguments and writing opinions. But after a few years, life took another turn: the White House counsel, who runs the judicial selection process for the president, invited me on behalf of President Trump to interview for a seat on the United States Supreme Court. Though I was deeply honored, I thought hard about whether to go forward. I knew that if I was chosen, both the confirmation process and the work of serving on the Court would require sacrifices, particularly from my family. Unlike my job on the Seventh Circuit, this one would require a move to Washington, D.C. We had a good life, wonderful friends, and close family in South Bend. We were attached to our old Prairie-style home, which was a short walk to campus for tailgates during football season\u2014a fall family high- light. The move would mean changes for Jesse's career and new schools for the children. We knew that public criticism was sure to come. And if I was nominated and confirmed, there would be a long-term loss of privacy for all of us. Public service was appealing, but the changes to our personal life were not.",
      "In fact, I felt a pit in my stomach when I considered what might lie ahead. I had been considered for a seat on the Court two years earlier, when Justice Anthony Kennedy retired. Being a finalist had thrust me into the spotlight, which (to put it mildly) was not enjoyable. There had been an avalanche of news stories and social media posts\u2014true and untrue, kind and cruel. It was difficult to have my life so publicly picked apart. There had also been a loss of physical privacy. Multiple camera crews parked outside our house and followed me by car when I pulled out of the driveway. I had one experience, funny only in retrospect, of realizing that I had been followed to church on a Sunday morning. I spent the whole Mass, not in prayer, but plotting an escape\u2014a plan that culminated in my sneaking out a side door, scaling a fence in high heels, and\u2014to the surprise of the associate pastor sitting on the rectory porch\u2014dropping into the priests' vegetable garden. (He was a happy co-conspirator; he took my keys and retrieved my car from the parking lot, allowing me to avoid the camera after all.) The scrutiny had affected my family too\u2014given the number of strangers who had started walking past and driving by our house, Jesse and I were reluctant to let our kids play in the yard. It was not an experience I was eager to repeat.",
      "Jesse and I had a very brief time to make one of the biggest decisions in our marriage. His position was full support on one condition: if we did it, we had to \"burn the boats.\" The phrase comes from a military strategy used by Alexander the Great, who, after landing on the shores of enemy territory, ordered his men to burn the ships they had come in. With the option of exit gone, there was no choice but to forge ahead, no matter the challenge. Likewise for us. There would be difficulties in store, some we could anticipate and others we couldn't. Jesse wisely thought that it would be unsustainable to face the difficulties\u2014whether in the confirmation process or beyond\u2014if we gave ourselves the option to look back, wishing that we could unwind what we had done. There would be no second-guessing and no turning back to our comfortable life in South Bend.",
      "So despite what might seem like a self-evident decision from the outside, saying yes to the interview, and then to the nomination, was not an easy call. I had just watched Brett Kavanaugh, whom I knew and respected, undergo a brutal confirmation process, and I was afraid of what I might face. I was reluctant to give up the good life we had for one that might prove to be less happy. Yet it seemed cowardly to bow out because we didn't want to make the sacrifice. As I later told the Senate Judiciary Committee, I believe deeply in the rule of law and the Supreme Court's role in preserving it; I also think that Americans of all backgrounds deserve an independent Supreme Court that interprets our Constitution and laws as they are written. It seemed strange to hold those views and be unwilling to serve, given that any nominee would face the same hardships. I accepted the interview and flew to Washington, D.C., to meet with President Trump. He announced my nomination on September 26, 2020, and the Senate confirmed me a month later. I have served as an associate justice since.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee are launching an investigation Friday into the firings of Justice Department attorneys and employees who investigated President Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election and his handling of classified records.",
      "In a letter obtained by CBS News, the panel's Democrats are asking Attorney General Pam Bondi to hand over records about at least 20 Justice Department staff fired last month.",
      "The senators said they're seeking information regarding the justification \"for any of these draconian personnel actions,\" in reference to the terminations. They said of Justice Department leaders, \"Firing career administrative staff who lack decision-making authority because they were doing their jobs is a petty but pernicious abuse of power.\"",
      "In their letter to Bondi, they said that those who lost their jobs were not just prosecutors, but included \"paralegals, finance staff, administrative support staff, and United States Marshals.\"",
      "The fired Justice Department staffers were identified by the agency's so-called \"weaponization working group\" which Bondi established as one of her first priorities after she was confirmed earlier this year, a source told CBS News.",
      "In their probe of the Justice Department, the Senate Democrats are asking the agency to hand over lists of employees who have been fired since Jan. 21, and for details on the \"criteria\" for the firings.",
      "The letter demands answers from the department by Friday, Sept. 12.",
      "The panel's Democrats also allege the fired employees were not given time to respond to accusations or to their terminations.",
      "\"Those dismissed since January are patriots and public servants,\" the letter reads. \"Your dismissal of their service without prior notice and without cause is a grave injustice that mocks the American ideal of nonpartisan government. Firing these public servants without cause is antidemocratic at best and likely unlawful.\"",
      "Sen. Adam Schiff, a California Democrat, said the Justice Department is undertaking \"ongoing efforts to whitewash the lawlessness that occurred on January 6, when a violent mob ransacked the Capitol in an attempted insurrection that led to the deaths of multiple police officers and injuries to more than 140 others.\"",
      "The Justice Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment from CBS News about the allegations from the Senate Democrats or the firings.",
      "The purge of Justice Department employees, which also includes those who worked on investigations and prosecutions related to the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot, began shortly after Mr. Trump's second inauguration, when he installed a former Jan. 6 defense attorney, Ed Martin, as the acting top prosecutor in Washington, D.C. It has continued under Jeanine Pirro, the new U.S. attorney in D.C.",
      "Mr. Trump and his supporters have downplayed the damage, injuries and trauma of the assault on the Capitol and have sought to recast convicted rioters as \"political prisoners.\" People convicted in connection with the events on Jan. 6 received pardons from Mr. Trump when he took office for his second term.",
      "\"Congressional oversight of the Justice Department's unprecedented purge of career employees is desperately needed,\" said Stacey Young, the executive director of Justice Connection, an organization that helps support fired and former Justice Department employees.",
      "Young said the Justice Department employees terminated since the beginning of the Trump administration were fired \"without notice and without following the other legal requirements under the Civil Service Reform Act.\" She noted that those who worked for Smith were among the first to be fired.",
      "\"Employees at the Justice Department should never be fired simply because they were assigned by their leadership to work on a case disfavored by the President,\" Young told CBS News.",

    "summary": "A Mike Tyson-Floyd Mayweather fight was announced Thursday. But there are multiple questions surrounding the bout.",
    "story": [
      "The boxing world was hit with a big announcement on Thursday night when former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson and former multi-division champion Floyd Mayweather said they\u00a0agreed to a bout to be held in the spring of 2026.",
      "Details on a date, location, television partner and any potential professional sanctioning of the bout were not immediately released, though both Hall-of-Fame boxers appeared excited about the fight in a press release distributed by CSI Sports.",
      "\"I still can't believe Floyd wants to really do this,\" Tyson said in the release. \"It's going to be detrimental to his health, but he wants to do it, so it's signed and it's happening!\"",
      "\"I've been doing this for 30 years and there hasn't been a single fighter that can tarnish my legacy,\" Mayweather said. \"You already know that if I am going to do something, it's going to be big and it's going to be legendary. I'm the best in the business of boxing. This exhibition will give the fans what they want.\"",
      "Coming Soon pic.twitter.com/lSeyrR0BKO",
      "While Mayweather noted that the bout would be an exhibition, meaning it wouldn't be sanctioned by an athletic commission or count toward either fighter's professional record, this was not confirmed by the fight promoters. But the sanctioning of the bout is just one of multiple outstanding questions surrounding this clash between two of the biggest names in boxing history. Below, we'll break down a few others.",
      "Will it be a professional, sanctioned bout?",
      "This is arguably the biggest question surrounding the bout but it's unlikely to be professionally sanctioned, despite the fact that Tyson just fought his first professional fight in 19 years when he lost to Jake Paul last November. Mayweather has had multiple exhibition bouts since retiring in 2017 following a knockout win against Conor McGregor. But he hasn't fought professionally since then, when he left the ring with a perfect 50-0 record. Mayweather indicated that the fight with Tyson will be an exhibition but he did not immediately respond to a CBS News request for further comment.",
      "What weight class would the fight be held in?",
      "This will largely depend on whether the bout is professional or an exhibition. If it's the former, then the boxers will need to agree on a weight limit that they would both be held to. But if it's an exhibition, which seems to be the case, it's likely that both boxers will enter the ring around the weight they last fought at. That means Mayweather would be around the middleweight limit, while Tyson is likely to be around the 220-pound range he often fought at as a champion in the 1980s and 1990s. Tyson tipped the scales at 230 pounds for his fight with Paul 10 months ago.",
      "Would the fight be held under non-standard rules?",
      "Whether it's a pro fight or an exhibition, there may be other, non-standardized rules in play here. Tyson is 59 years old. Mayweather is 48 years old. Boxers in that age range, when they do enter the ring, tend to perform under different rules and regulations. When Tyson fought Paul last fall, for example, the length of the rounds was reduced to two minutes from the standard three. And it was limited to an eight-round fight, when it normally would have been 10 for a non-championship affair. Both boxers also wore heavier gloves in the bout than is the norm, which is likely to be the case for a Tyson-Mayweather affair, too.",
      "Is this a new trend in boxing?",
      "Boxing exhibitions featuring retired champions is nothing new to the sport. Mayweather and former foe Manny Pacquiao have done so multiple times in recent years. While it may not be a boxing purist's preference, it's not unusual.",
      "What is a bit unique, however, is that this will be Tyson's third fight in approximately six years, after retiring from the sport in 2005. He fought an exhibition against former champion Roy Jones, Jr. in 2020 and Paul last November. Paul, meanwhile, who boxed Tyson as a heavyweight, appears to be moving on to his own exhibition fight against former lightweight champion Gervonta Davis, in an another match between boxers in wildly different weight classes. That fight was\u00a0announced for Nov. 14.",

    "summary": "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy denied pressuring the ousted CDC director to preapprove vaccine recommendations.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on Thursday denied that he pressured the ousted director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to preapprove vaccination recommendations from a panel he overhauled before her firing.",
      "Susan Monarez was fired from the position less than a month after her Senate confirmation. In an opinion piece\u00a0in the Wall Street Journal on Thursday, Monarez said that Kennedy \"pressured me to resign or face termination\" in an Aug. 25 meeting.",
      "\"One of the troubling directives from that meeting more than a week ago: I was told to preapprove the recommendations of a vaccine advisory panel newly filled with people who have publicly expressed antivaccine rhetoric,\" she wrote.",
      "The piece was published shortly before Kennedy testified before the Senate Finance Committee, where he faced tough questioning about his vaccine policies.",
      "\"I did not say that to her,\" Kennedy told Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon. \"I never had a private meeting with her. Other witnesses to every meeting that we have, and all those witnesses will say, I never said that.\"",
      "\"So she's lying today to the American people in the Wall Street Journal?\" Wyden asked.",
      "\"Yes, sir,\" Kennedy said.",
      "Later, Kennedy told Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock of Georgia that he did not demand Monarez accept the recommendations of the panel without further review from career scientists at the CDC.",
      "\"I told her I didn't want her to have a rule that she's not going to sign onto it,\" Kennedy said when asked whether he told Monarez to accept the recommendations.",
      "At another point in the hearing, Kennedy claimed he asked Monarez to resign \"because I asked her, 'Are you a trustworthy person?' and she said no.\"",
      "In a statement Thursday afternoon, lawyers for Monarez said Kennedy's claims were \"false, and at times, patently ridiculous.\"",
      "\"Dr. Monarez stands by what she said in her op-ed in The Wall Street Journal, would repeat it all under oath and continues to support the vision she outlined at her confirmation hearing that science will control her decisions,\" attorneys Mark Zaid and Abbe Lowell said.",
      "In June, Kennedy removed every member of the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices, a government panel that makes vaccine recommendations. At the time, he asserted that it \"has become little more than a rubber stamp for any vaccine.\" He then named several members to the panel, including vaccine skeptics, circumventing the usual CDC practice for selecting medical and public health experts.",
      "The newly constituted ACIP is set to meet later this month to consider vaccine recommendations. In her op-ed, Monarez wrote that \"[i]t is imperative that the panel's recommendations aren't rubber-stamped but instead are rigorously and scientifically reviewed before being accepted or rejected.\"",
      "After Monarez's firing, several other top CDC officials resigned, citing the Trump administration's stance on vaccines, which they found troubling, and budget cuts.",

    "published": "Fri, 05 Sep 2025 13:52:50 -0400",
    "summary": "The operation targeted one of Georgia's largest and most high-profile manufacturing sites, where Hyundai makes electric vehicles and is building an EV battery plant.",
    "story": [
      "In a large-scale immigration enforcement raid at a huge Hyundai facility in Georgia on Thursday, 475 immigrants suspected of living and working in the U.S. illegally were detained, federal authorities announced.",
      "Steven Schrank, the special agent in charge of Homeland Security Investigations in Georgia, told reporters Friday that the majority of those detained were Korean nationals but he didn't know exactly how many. They worked for a variety of different companies at the site, including subcontractors, he said.",
      "No criminal charges were announced during Friday's news conference. The sweep was conducted as part of a monthslong investigation into allegations of unlawful employment practices and other federal crimes, Schrank said. He described Thursday's raid as the largest enforcement operation at a single site in the history of Homeland Security Investigations, which is a unit of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.",
      "\"This operation underscores our commitment to protecting jobs for Georgians and Americans, ensuring a level playing field for businesses that comply with the law, safeguarding the integrity of our economy and protecting workers from exploitation,\" Schrank said.",
      "Some of those detained Thursday allegedly entered the U.S. illegally and others were accused of overstaying their visas or violating visa waivers by working, Schrank said. Most of the detainees were taken to an ICE facility in Folkston, Georgia, near the Florida-Georgia state line.",
      "\"They will be moved based on their individual circumstances beyond that,\" Schrank said.",
      "The president of Georgia's chapter of the AFL-CIO called the raid politically motivated and said ICE has been escalating its presence at workplaces across the state.",
      "\"This raid is the latest in an ongoing campaign of harassment that has targeted immigrant Georgians as they try to earn an honest living,\" Yvonne Brooks said in a statement. \"Arresting and detaining workers, who are exploited every day and risk their lives every day on the job, creates an atmosphere of fear that terrorizes workers and their families and increases the workload burden on their coworkers.\"",
      "The operation involved law enforcement agents from multiple federal agencies, including ICE; the Border Patrol; the FBI; the Drug Enforcement Administration; the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives; and the IRS, underscoring the government-wide nature of the Trump administration's crackdown on illegal immigration.",
      "Earlier, the Atlanta office of the ATF had said 450 people were detained in\u00a0a post on social media, which included pictures from the operation.",
      "The sweep targeted one of Georgia's largest and most high-profile manufacturing sites, touted by Gov. Brian Kemp and other officials as the biggest economic development project in the state's history. Hyundai Motor Group, South Korea's biggest automaker, began manufacturing electric vehicles a year ago at the $7.6 billion plant, which employs about 1,200 people, and has partnered with LG Energy Solution to build an adjacent battery plant, slated to open next year. The search shut down construction on the battery plant.",
      "In a statement to The Associated Press, LG said it was \"closely monitoring the situation and gathering all relevant details.\" It said it couldn't immediately confirm how many of its employees or Hyundai workers had been detained.",
      "\"Our top priority is always ensuring the safety and well-being of our employees and partners. We will fully cooperate with the relevant authorities,\" the company said.",
      "ICE spokesman Lindsay Williams confirmed that federal authorities conducted an enforcement operation at the 3,000-acre site west of Savannah. He said agents were focused on the construction site for the battery plant.",
      "The South Korean Foreign Ministry said in a statement that it was dispatching officials to the site and urged the U.S. Embassy in Seoul \"to exercise extreme caution to ensure that the legitimate rights and interests of Korean citizens are not infringed upon.\"",
      "\"The economic activities of Korean investment companies and the rights and interests of Korean citizens must not be unfairly infringed upon during U.S. law enforcement operations,\" the Foreign Ministry said.",
      "Georgia State Patrol troopers blocked roads to the Hyundai site. The Georgia Department of Public Safety confirmed they were dispatched to assist federal authorities.",
      "Video posted to social media Thursday showed workers in yellow safety vests lined up as a man wearing a face mask and a tactical vest with the letters HSI, which stands for Homeland Security Investigations, tells them: \"We're Homeland Security. We have a search warrant for the whole site.\"",
      "\"We need construction to cease immediately,\" the man says. \"We need all work to end on the site right now.\"",
      "The Trump administration has undertaken sweeping ICE operations as part of a mass deportation agenda. Immigration officers have raided farms, construction sites, restaurants and auto repair shops.",
      "The Pew Research Center, citing preliminary Census Bureau data, says the U.S. labor force lost more than 1.2 million immigrants from January through July. That includes people who are in the country illegally as well as legal residents.",
      "Hyundai and LG's battery joint venture, HL-GA Battery Company, said in a statement that it's \"cooperating fully with the appropriate authorities\" and paused construction of the battery site to assist their work.",
      "Operations at Hyundai's EV manufacturing plant weren't interrupted, said plant spokesperson Bianca Johnson.",
      "\"This did not impact people getting to work,\" Johnson said in an email. \"Production and normal office hours had already begun for the day\" when authorities shut down access.",

      "The actions took place through Operation Pacific Viper, which the Coast Guard has\u00a0described as \"a surge in forces to the Eastern Pacific to stop the cartels and criminal organizations - cutting off drugs and human smuggling before it reaches American shores.\" The Eastern Pacific sees \"significant transport\" of illicit narcotics from South America, the Coast Guard says.",
      "The federal agency, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security, released multiple images of recent operations. One picture shows crew members keeping watch over a burning vessel that was intercepted in the Eastern Pacific Ocean in mid-August, the Coast Guard says. Officials did not indicate why the boat was on fire.",

In that haul, the Coast Guard last week offloaded over 38 tons of cocaine and marijuana in Fort Lauderdale \u2014 the largest cocaine offload in Coast Guard history, officials said.",

    "story": [
      "A new image shows the growing tail of a comet from another star system streaking across our solar system.",
      "The image of comet 3I/ATLAS was captured on Aug. 27 using one of the telescopes at the International Gemini Observatory in Chile during a public outreach event allowing students to work with astronomers.",
      "The comet is only the third-known interstellar object to pass through our solar system. It poses no threat to Earth, NASA previously said.",
      "Comet 3I/ATLAS has been photographed multiple times since its discovery in July. In early August, NASA and the European Space Agency released photos taken by the Hubble Space Telescope. It was about 277 million miles away from Earth when the telescope captured it.",
      "The new image from the Gemini Observatory shows the comet's broad coma, or a cloud of dust and gas that forms around its nucleus as it gets closer to the sun, astronomers said in a news release. The tail spans about 1/200th of a degree in the sky. One degree is about the width of a pinky finger, according to the news release. The tail also points away from the sun.",
      "The features are \"significantly more extended than they appeared in earlier images,\" according to astronomers. This means that the comet has become \"more active\" as it travels through the inner solar system.",
      "The main purpose of the observatory session, which allowed students and members of the public to remotely join astronomers in the control room, was to look at the wavelengths of light that emit from the comet. The wavelengths, also called a spectrum, can give scientists information about the comet's composition and chemistry, helping them understand how the comet changes while passing through the solar system, the news release said.",
      "NASA previously said the comet is expected to make its closest approach to the sun in late October and pass between the orbits of Mars and Earth. The comet is expected to remain visible through September, then get too close to the sun to observe until it reappears on the other side of the solar body in early December.",
      "Interstellar comets are very rare, astronomers said. Only two other examples have ever been confirmed:\u00a01I/'Oumuamu\u00a0in 2017 and\u00a02I/Borisov\u00a0in 2019.",

      "Teenage girls are hiring themselves out as hitwomen in Sweden's organized crime wars, keen to prove they are more deadly and ruthless than young men, prosecutors say.",
      "\"I had a case involving a 15-year-old girl recruited to shoot someone in the head,\" Stockholm prosecutor Ida Arnell told AFP. \"She was able to choose the type of mission she wanted, in other words, to aim at the guy's door or his head. She chose the head.\"",
      "She was arrested with a 17-year-old male accomplice, who pulled the trigger, leaving the victim clinging to life after being shot in the neck, stomach and legs.",
      "Arnell said an increasing number of girls are offering their services to mobsters, including as hitwomen, on encrypted messaging sites.",
      "Girls \"have to show that they are even more determined and tougher (than boys) to get the job,\" the prosecutor added.",
      "Some 280 girls aged between 15 and 17 were charged with murder, manslaughter or other violent crimes last year \u2014 though it is unclear how many were linked to organized crime.",
      "The statistic is far from a blip, experts say, with the role of girls and young women in the violent organized crime networks that are plaguing the Scandinavian nation slipping under the radar for years.",
      "They say this blind spot has benefitted the crime networks and put young women at extreme risk.",
      "Kids under 15 hired to kill",
      "Shootings\u00a0and bombings are a near-daily occurrence with organized crime often recruiting teenagers under 15 \u2014 the age of criminal responsibility \u2014 to do their dirty work on encrypted apps.",
      "\"In general the young kids are thirsty for blood on these chats,\" regardless of their gender, Arnell said.",
      "Sweden was once known for low crime, but the gangs \u2014 who emerged over the last 15 years \u2014 have changed all that with drug and arms trafficking, welfare fraud and human trafficking, authorities say.",
      "The government now calls them a \"systemic threat\" to the country.",

    "summary": "At least one American was among the 16 people killed in a devastating electric streetcar crash in Portugal's capital, along with many other foreign nationals.",
    "story": [
      "Lisbon \u2014 Two days after Portugal's worst-ever electric streetcar crash killed 16 people and left more than 20 others from across the globe injured, authorities in Lisbon said Friday that they had identified nearly all of the victims, many of whom were crushed to death when the famed Elevador da Gloria funicular hurtled out of control down a steep hill, derailed and careened into a building.",
      "While names have not yet been disclosed, Portugal's national police said Friday that five Portuguese nationals, three Britons, two South Koreans, two Canadians, a French woman, one Swiss national, one American and one Ukrainian were killed in the Wednesday crash.",
      "A U.S. State Department spokesperson confirmed to CBS News on Thursday that an\u00a0American was among the 16 people killed, but they have not yet identified the victim.",
      "\"Our staff in Lisbon and here in the United States are working tirelessly to provide consular assistance to the victim and their family.\u00a0 We extend our condolences to the victims and families of all those affected,\" the official said. \"The Embassy is working closely with local authorities to assist U.S. citizens in the affected area, and continues to monitor the situation closely. Due to privacy considerations, we have no additional details at this time.\"",
      "At least 21 other passengers were injured, including people from Portugal, Spain, Israel, Brazil, Italy and France, according to the head of Portugal's National Health Service. Three German citizens were also injured, including a three-year-old child, the police said Friday.",
      "Millions of people ride Lisbon's iconic yellow-and-white funicular cars each year. It's a popular experience for foreign tourists, and the Elevador da Gloria, at almost 140 years old, has long been a big attraction. In 2024, an estimated 29 million foreigners visited Portugal, many passing through the capital and its quiet, cobblestone streets and hills.",
      "But the electric street cars and hillside funiculars are also part of everyday life for many locals.",
      "A Portuguese charity based on the hill near the top of the Elevador da Gloria funicular confirmed Friday that four of its employees were killed in the accident. They were believed to have been commuting from work.",
      "\"We have lost colleagues, friends and the people who we shared our daily lives as well as our mission\", the Santa Casa da Misericordia said in a statement. \"We're in a state of shock.\"",
      "Portugal's President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, Prime Minister Luis Montenegro and Lisbon Mayor Carlos Moedas attended a Mass in the early evening on Thursday near the site of the crash. Speaking to reporters outside the church, Rebelo de Sousa said: \"This is a time of mourning. It's the moment to mourn the dead... pray and think of the dead, and to support their friends and family.\"",
      "The president also called for a clarification of the causes of the accident \"as quickly as possible.\"",
      "After midnight on Friday, and with few onlookers, workers lifted the mangled wreckage of the Elevador da Gloria car that crashed.",
      "As with most funiculars, two carriages linked by a steel cable operate in tandem: One carriage climbs up the hill as the other trundles slowly down. Early Wednesday evening, many people believe that cable snapped, causing the tragedy.",
      "Portuguese media showed officials inspecting the frayed ends of the cable that had connected the cars, which they had pulled up from underground, on Friday. According to a fire brigade official, the car coming down from the top of the hill was not able to slow down, entered a curve in the hill too fast, derailed, and then plowed into the cobblestone pavement and crashed.",
      "Cable and brake failures are two of the most common causes of streetcar accidents.",
      "The president of the Portuguese Order of the Engineers, Almeis Santos, told CBS News the accident appeared to have been caused by the rupture of the cable.",
      "\"It's very strange... for this kind of cable. It's not normal and it's almost impossible to have [a] sudden rupture,\" he said.",
      "Santos said if the cable did snap suddenly, neither the manual nor automatic brakes on the funicular would have been sufficient to hold back the streetcars, which, when loaded with passengers weigh around 20 tons each.",
      "Carris, the company that operates the Elevador da Gloria, has said regular inspections \u2014 including daily checks \u2014 had been carried out as required.",
      "Portugal's Air and Rail Accident Investigation Unit was expected to release a preliminary report on the technical cause of the funicular crash later Friday. In 45 days, Portugal's national police will then issue their report on any potential criminality involved in the crash.",
      "The mayor said Lisbon and its three million residents would observe three days of mourning following the disaster.",

      "Tren de Aragua operations spread beyond Venezuela",
      "Tren de Aragua originated more than a decade ago at an infamously lawless prison with hardened criminals in Venezuela's central state of Aragua. The gang has expanded in recent years, recruiting from among the more than 7.7 million Venezuelans who have fled economic turmoil in their homeland and migrated to other Latin American countries or the U.S.",
      "Mr. Trump and administration officials have consistently blamed the gang for being at the root of the violence and illicit drug dealing that plague some U.S. cities. Mr. Trump has repeated his claim \u2014 contradicted by a declassified U.S. intelligence assessment \u2014 that Tren de Aragua is operating under Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro's control.",
      "During his 2024 presidential campaign, Mr. Trump described Aurora, Colorado, as a \"war zone\" overrun with members of the gang. Aurora Police Chief Todd Chamberlain rejected that characterization, explaining the gang was tied to organized violent crime concentrated in three apartment complexes in the city.",
      "Chamberlain said earlier this year his department had counted a total of nine confirmed Tren de Aragua members who passed through Aurora in the last two years.",
      "The size of the gang is unclear. Countries with large populations of Venezuelan migrants, including Peru and Colombia, have accused the group of being behind a spree of violence in the region.",
      "Authorities in Chile first identified the gang's operations in 2022. Prosecutors and investigators have said the group initially engaged primarily in human trafficking, organizing unauthorized border crossings and sexual exploitation, but over time, members have expanded their activities to more violent crimes, such as kidnapping, torture, extortion and became more involved in drug trafficking.",
      "While Tren de Argua has dominated ketamine trafficking in Chile, unlike other criminal organizations from Colombia, Central America and Brazil, it has no large-scale involvement in smuggling cocaine across international borders, according to InSight Crime, a think tank that last month published a 64-page report on the gang based on two years of research.",
      "\"We've found no direct participation of TdA in the transnational drug trade, although there are cases of them acting as subcontractors for other drug trafficking organizations,\" said Jeremy McDermott, a Colombia-based co-founder of InSight Crime.",
      "McDermott added that with affiliated cells spread across Latin America, it would not be a huge leap for the gang to one day delve into the drug trade.",
      "Landlocked Bolivia and Colombia, with access to the Pacific Ocean and Caribbean Sea and a border with Venezuela, are the world's top cocaine producers.",
      "Trump designated Tren de Aragua a foreign terrorist organization",
      "On his first day in office, Mr. Trump took steps to designate the gang a foreign terrorist organization alongside several Mexican drug cartels. The Biden administration had sanctioned the gang and offered $12 million in rewards for the arrest of three of its leaders.",
      "Mr. Trump's executive order accused the gang of working closely with top Maduro officials \u2014 most notably the former vice president and one-time governor of Aragua state, Tareck El Aissami \u2014 to infiltrate migration flows, flood the U.S. with cocaine and plot against the country. A U.S. intelligence assessment released earlier this year found minimal contact between the gang and low-level officials in the Venezuelan government but said there was no direct coordination between the gang and the government.",
      "In March, Mr. Trump also declared the group an invading force, invoking an 18th century wartime law that allows the U.S. to deport noncitizens without any legal recourse. Under the Alien Enemies Act, the administration sent more than 250 Venezuelan men to a maximum-security prison in El Salvador, where they remained incommunicado and without access to an attorney until their July deportation to Venezuela.",
      "A\u00a0U.S. appeals court panel this week ruled that Mr. Trump cannot use that law to speed deportations of people his administration accuses of being Tren de Aragua members. A final ruling on the matter, however, will be made by the Supreme Court.",
      "The Trump administration alleged the men deported to the prison were members of the Tren de Aragua gang, but provided little evidence. One justification officials used was that the men had certain kinds of tattoos allegedly signifying gang membership, including crowns, clocks and other symbols. But experts have said tattoos are not reliable markers of affiliation to the gang.",
      "Trump cites the gang in justifying the military strike",
      "The U.S. has not released the names and nationalities of the 11 people killed Tuesday. It also has not offered an estimate of the amount of drugs it says the boat was carrying.",
      "Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Wednesday told reporters the U.S. military will continue lethal strikes on suspected drug trafficking vessels, but he dodged questions on details of the strike, including if the people in the boat were warned before the attack.",
      "But, he said, Mr. Trump \"has a right, under exigent circumstances, to eliminate imminent threats to the United States.\"",
      "\"If you're on a boat full of cocaine or fentanyl or whatever, headed to the United States, you're an immediate threat to the United States,\" he told reporters in Mexico City during a visit to Latin America.",
      "Venezuela's government, which has long minimized the presence of Tren de Aragua in the South American country, limited its reaction to the strike to questioning the veracity of a video showing the attack. Communications Minister Freddy \u00d1\u00e1\u00f1ez suggested it was created using artificial intelligence and described it as an \"almost cartoonish animation, rather than a realistic depiction of an explosion.\"",
      "Hegseth responded that the strike \"was definitely not artificial intelligence,\" adding he watched live footage from Washington as the strike was carried out.",
      "The strike shows that the U.S. government is \"quite literally deadly serious\" in its targeting of drug traffickers, said Ryan Berg, director of the Americas program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington-based think tank.",
      "But he questioned whether the link to Tren de Aragua has more to do with the \"familiarity\" that Americans now have with the gang.",
      "\"I certainly hope that the U.S. government has the intelligence and we are not shooting first and asking questions later,\" Berg said.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rubio-us-designating-ecuador-gangs-foreign-terrorist-groups/",
    "published": "Thu, 04 Sep 2025 13:56:03 -0400",
    "summary": "The announcement targeting Los Lobos and Los Choneros came after a lethal U.S. military strike\u200b against a similarly designated gang in Venezuela.",
    "story": [
      "U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Thursday that the United States is designating two Ecuadorian gangs as foreign terrorist organizations in the Trump administration's latest move against cartels.",
      "The announcement came as Rubio traveled to Ecuador to meet with its leaders in a trip to Latin America this week that has been overshadowed by a U.S. military strike against a similarly designated gang, Tren de Aragua. The strike has raised concerns in the region about whether the Trump administration will step up military activity to combat drug trafficking and illegal migration.",
      "The two new designees, Los Lobos and Los Choneros, are Ecuadorian gangs blamed for much of the violence that began since the COVID-19 pandemic. The designation, Rubio said, brings \"all sorts of options\" for the U.S. government to work in conjunction with the government of Ecuador to crack down on these groups.",
      "That includes the ability to kill them as well as take action against the properties and banking accounts in the U.S. for the group's members and people with ties to the criminal organizations, Rubio said, adding it would also help with intelligence sharing.",
      "Rubio called them \"vicious animals, these terrorists.\"",
      "Criminal gang violence continues unabated following the recapture in June of the country's biggest drug lord,\u00a0Adolfo Mac\u00edas, who leads Los Choneros, after his escape from a maximum-security prison in 2024. In July, the Ecuadoran government extradited Macias to the United States, where he faces multiple drug trafficking and firearms charges.",
      "Last year, the U.S. classified Los Choneros as one of the most violent gangs and affirmed its connection to powerful\u00a0Mexican drug cartels who threaten Ecuador and the surrounding region.",
      "Earlier this year, a leader of Los Lobos was\u00a0arrested at his home in the coastal city of Portoviejo. Carlos D, widely known by his alias El Chino, was the second-in-command of Los Lobos and \"considered a high-value target,\" the armed forces said in a statement.",
      "The U.S. last year declared Los Lobos to be the largest drug trafficking organization in Ecuador.",
      "\"Interdiction doesn't work\"",
      "Rubio's meetings in Quito on Thursday follow talks a day earlier with Mexican leaders that were overshadowed by the U.S. military strike on suspected Tren de Aragua drug runners in the southern Caribbean.",
      "The Trump administration asserts that it targeted a Venezuelan drug-running ship crewed by members of Tren de Aragua. U.S. officials say the vessel's cargo was intended for the United States and that the strike killed 11 people.",
      "Rubio defended the action and offered no justification other than to say the boat posed an \"immediate threat\" to the U.S. and that Trump opted to \"blow it up\" rather than follow what had been standard procedure to stop and board, arrest the crew and seize any contraband on board.",
      "\"Interdiction doesn't work,\" Rubio said Wednesday. \"Instead of interdicting it, on the president's orders, we blew it up. And it'll happen again. Maybe it's happening right now, I don't know, but the point is the president of the United States is going to wage war on narco-terrorist organizations.\"",
      "Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said on Wednesday that U.S. military assets will remain in the region, and that more strikes may be forthcoming.",
      "\"This is a deadly, serious mission for us and it won't stop with just this strike,\" Hegseth told Fox News. \"Anyone else trafficking in those waters who we know is a designated narco-terrorist will face the same fate.\"",
      "The strike got a mixed reaction from leaders around Latin America, where the U.S. history of military intervention and gunboat diplomacy is still fresh. Many, like officials in Mexico, were careful not to outright condemn the attack but stressed the importance of protecting national sovereignty and warning that expanded U.S. military involvement might actually backfire.",
      "Mexico Foreign Affairs Secretary Ram\u00f3n de la Fuente, speaking to reporters alongside Rubio, emphasized his country's preference for \"nonintervention, peaceful solution of conflicts.\"",
      "Ecuador has its own issues with narcotics trafficking and also has been looked to by the Trump administration as a possible destination to deport non-Ecuadorian migrants from the United States. U.S. officials have said they would like to secure an agreement with Ecuador that would have it accept such deportees, but the status of negotiations with Quito was not clear.",
      "Ecuador's president, Daniel Noboa, on Thursday thanked Rubio for the U.S. efforts to \"actually eliminate any terrorist threat.\" Before their meeting, Rubio had said on social media that the U.S. and Ecuador are \"aligned as key partners on ending illegal immigration and combatting transnational crime and terrorism.\"",
      "Surging violence since COVID-19 pandemic",
      "The latest U.N. World Drug Report says various countries in South America, including Colombia, Ecuador and Peru, reported larger cocaine seizures in 2022 than in 2021, but it does not give Venezuela the outsize role that the White House has in recent months.",
      "\"The impact of increased cocaine trafficking has been felt in Ecuador in particular, which has seen a wave of lethal violence in recent years linked to both local and transnational crime groups, most notably from Mexico and the Balkan countries,\" the report says.",
      "Violence has skyrocketed in Ecuador since the COVID-19 pandemic, as drug traffickers expanded operations in the country and took advantage of the nation's banana industry.",
      "The South American country is the world's largest exporter of bananas, shipping about 7.2 million tons a year by sea. Traffickers find containers filled with bananas the perfect vehicle to smuggle their product.",
      "In addition, cartels from Mexico, Colombia and the Balkans have settled in Ecuador because it uses the U.S. dollar and has weak laws and institutions, along with a network of long-established, ruthless gangs that are eager for work.",
      "Ecuador also gained prominence in the global cocaine trade after political changes in Colombia last decade. Coca bush fields in Colombia have been moving closer to the border with Ecuador due to the breakup of criminal groups after the 2016 demobilization of the rebel group Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, better known by its Spanish acronym FARC.",
      "Rubio is also visiting the Andean country to argue against its close ties and reliance on China.",

      "The worst-hit villages are in remote parts of the province, and many roads have been blocked by landslides triggered by the temblor.

      "Some rescue workers have walked for miles to reach the affected areas.",
      "Some emergency crews have been flown in by helicopter, but in some affected villages, the rough terrain makes it impossible for helicopters to land, and the Taliban's Minister of Defense said it was sending commandos down by rope to help people.",

      "The earthquake struck mountainous and remote parts of Afghanistan, and there have been significant aftershocks, driving many families to sleep out in the open and far from their homes, most of which were not built to withstand earthquakes despite the region being prone to seismic activity.",
      "The disaster struck as Afghanistan was already struggling through a humanitarian crisis.",
      "The Afghan government, along with international aid organizations, have launched an appeal for donations to help the survivors. According to the Norwegian Refugee Council, local resources in Kunar have been stretched to breaking point.",
      "\"Communities in the valleys have lost almost everything \u2014 their families, homes, livestock, and vital water channels. In the aftermath, makeshift camps are sheltering 50 to 100 women and children per tent, with no access to proper wash facilities,\" the charity said in a statement. \"Families with children are deeply traumatized, with some children having been trapped under rubble for several hours before being rescued.\"",
      "The Taliban's official spokesman shared several bank account numbers seeking private donations, saying any funds would go to help those in need. On Wednesday, Minister of Foreign Affairs Amir Khan Mutaqi called on the country's diplomats abroad to seek aid from their host nation's governments, charitable organizations, and well-wishers.",

    "story": [
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy met Thursday with European leaders in Paris, along with President Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff, to discuss ongoing efforts to broker an end to Russia's war against his country that includes security guarantees for the war-torn nation.",
      "Mr. Trump has been pushing for Russia and Ukraine to strike a deal to end the war sparked by Russia's full-scale invasion on Feb. 24, 2022, and the French news agency AFP said the European leaders gathered in Paris held a video conference with the U.S. president right after their meeting on Thursday.",
      "A White House official confirmed that call to CBS News, adding that Mr. Trump had, \"emphasized that Europe must stop purchasing Russian oil that is funding the war \u2014 as Russia received 1.1 billion euros in fuel sales from the EU in one year.\"",

      "European nations have reduced their purchases of Russian fossil fuels since the Ukraine war began, but they have not ended. EU nations are working to replace Russian gas and oil in with fuel from other sources, but the continent had become reliant on cheap energy from Moscow over many years, and it will take years for most nations to achieve energy independence from Russia.",
      "European nations led by Britain and France, meanwhile, have been working to secure assurances from the White House that any troops they send to ensure long-term military support for Ukraine once a ceasefire comes into effect will have American backing.",
      "The French presidency shared a video of the meeting on social media that showed Witkoff at the table, and shaking hands and greeting Zelenskyy with a hug. Ukrainian presidential press secretary Serhii Nikiforov Zelenskyy told the AFP that Zelenskyy and Witkoff also held a closed-door meeting.",
      "Witkoff was invited to participate in the so-called \"coalition of the willing\" meeting to discuss aid for Ukraine, including sketching out plans for military support in the event of a ceasefire in the Russia-Ukraine war, to deter future Russian aggression, officials told AFP.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who lead the group, have insisted that any European \"reassurance\" force in Ukraine needs the backing of the United States.",
      "European Union chief Ursula von der Leyen said earlier this week that \"precise plans\" for post-war international military deployments in Ukraine were being drawn up, adding in an interview with the\u00a0Financial Times\u00a0that there was a \"clear road map\" and that President Trump had agreed to an unspecified \"American presence\" as a \"backstop\" to any European ground force.",
      "Starmer's office said after the meeting in Paris on Thursday that the British prime minister had \"emphasized that the group had an unbreakable pledge to Ukraine, with President Trump's backing, and it was clear they now needed to go even further to apply pressure on (Russian president Vladimir) Putin to secure a cessation of hostilities.\"",
      "While Ukraine has agreed to a proposal by the Trump administration for an immediate ceasefire, Putin has yet to even agree to meet with Zelenskyy on neutral ground, instead suggesting he come to Moscow. Despite Mr. Trump's mounting criticism, Putin has continued pressing his gains in Ukraine, and continued attacking not only military targets, but civilian infrastructure, with devastating effects.",
      "Starmer's office also mentioned a decision by the European coalition to supply long-range missiles to Ukraine \"to further bolster the country's supplies.\"",
      "Macron said ahead of Thursday's meeting that preparatory work on the security guarantees had been done and should now be approved at political level. Like von der Leyen several days ago, however, he did not provide any details.",
      "\"We Europeans are ready to provide security guarantees to Ukraine and the Ukrainians on the day peace is signed,\" Macron said.",
      "It is unclear what members of the coalition are willing to contribute, including troops on the ground.",
      "Andriy Yermak, the Ukrainian president's chief of staff, said Thursday after meeting Witkoff and other national security advisers that the security guarantees \"must be strong and effective \u2014 in the air, at sea, on land and in cyberspace.\"",
      "President Trump has made it clear that he will not deploy American troops to Ukraine as part of any ceasefire arrangement, and members of his administration have previously suggested a U.S. role could be to provide coordination, rather than boots on the ground.",
      "In an interview with the\u00a0Daily Caller\u00a0published over the weekend, Mr. Trump did not rule out using American warplanes to assist European peacekeeping efforts on the ground.",
      "Zelenskyy's government is hoping for continued U.S. intelligence sharing and air support.",
      "Putin has balked at the idea of any Western forces deploying to Ukraine as part of a peace deal.",
      "NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte dismissed that opposition on Thursday, insisting that Ukraine is \"a sovereign country,\" and thus it is \"not for them to decide\" in Moscow what security guarantees are put in place.",
      "But until there is a ceasefire, which Putin would have to agree to, post-war security guarantees will remain purely theoretical, and Ukraine will be forced to continue defending itself to the best of its ability from Russia's relentless attacks.",
      "Rutte, who attended the Paris meeting virtually, said a broad coalition of nations was needed to support Ukraine's defense against Russian aggression, but also to strengthen Europe to deter further military action by Moscow.",
      "Citing European military and intelligence officials who have warned of Russian plans to strike within the decade other European countries, most of them in the U.S.-led military alliance that Rutte currently helms, he said: \"we have to make sure that our deterrence is such that they will never try, knowing that our reaction will be devastating.\"",

    "story": [
      "China's President Xi Jinping and his visiting Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin discussed life-prolonging organ transplants and immortality as they chatted before a massive military parade in Beijing on Wednesday, in comments picked up by state media microphones.",
      "Historic images showed Xi shaking hands and speaking with Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un as they walked down a red carpet by Tiananmen Square, in scenes viewed as a challenge to President Trump and the U.S.-led global order that has prevailed for more than a century.",
      "\"These days ... 70 years old,\" Xi mused in Mandarin as he walked beside Putin and Kim, according to video aired by Chinese state broadcaster CCTV. Xi's translator conveyed the remarks to Putin, who is then heard in Russian quoting a line from a Tang dynasty poem: \"In the past, it used to be rare for someone to be older than 70 and these days they say that at 70 one's still a child.\"",
      "Putin then turned toward Xi, speaking while gesturing with his hands, though his words are inaudible on the CCTV feed. The same Chinese translator then relays Putin's remarks to Xi.",
      "\"With the ... development of biotechnology, human organs can be continuously transplanted, people could get younger as they grow older, and may even become immortal,\" Putin said, according to the translator.",
      "Xi then spoke again in Mandarin as the camera cut away: \"Predictions are, in this century, it may be ... possible to live to 150 years old.\"",
      "Putin confirmed the exchange during a news conference later Wednesday.",
      "\"Ah, I think it was when we were going to the parade that the chairman spoke about this,\" he told reporters, referring to Xi.",
      "\"Modern means \u2014 both health improvement and medical means, and then even all kinds of surgical ones related to organ replacement \u2014 allow humanity to hope that active life will continue not as it does today,\" Putin added.",
      "Xi and Putin, along with Kim and Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, have been dubbed an \"Axis of Upheaval\" by some Western analysts, and Xi's decision to bring together the leaders of some of the most heavily sanctioned nations in the world this week was clearly calculated.",
      "The parade was the first time Kim had ever appeared together with both Xi and Putin \u2014 providing him a first multilateral diplomatic event.",
      "Xi and Putin have made their ambition to shake up the global status quo clear for several years.",

      "China and Russia have declared a \"no limits partnership,\" and neither Xi nor Putin, who are both 72, has ever expressed any intention of stepping down from their respective roles at the helm of their nations.",
      "While Xi's predecessors Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao relinquished power after 10 years in office, he abolished term limits in 2018 and, in 2023, was handed a third term as Chinese president.",
      "Putin was elected to a record fifth six-year term just last year in Russia. Critics dismissed the vote as a patently undemocratic farse, as virtually all of Putin's serious political opponents were barred from running, and many of them were jailed.",
      "Putin has twice used his leverage as Russia's autocratic leader to amend the constitution so that he can theoretically stay in power until he's in his mid-80s. He already is the longest-serving Kremlin leader since Soviet dictator Josef Stalin.",
      "China, meanwhile, has historically had one of the lowest rates of organ donation in the world, with a severe shortage of organ donors and a long-standing black-market organ trade. In 2016, about four years into Xi's tenure as leader, surgeons from the World Health Organization gathered in Beijing to try to allay skepticism about whether Chinese hospitals had, as claimed, stopped performing transplants with the organs of executed prisoners.",

      "That approach, he said, demands patience, even when a quick resolution is sought, but he believes it has paid off in other peace agreements this year.",

      "Several Trump allies have told CBS News that Mr. Trump maintains that the work done by him and his administration has been crucial in furthering those negotiations.",

      "An Argentine federal court announced Wednesday that authorities had recovered the long-lost \"Portrait of a Lady,\" an 18th-century work by the Italian painter Giuseppe Ghislandi that was looted by the Nazis in World War II and rediscovered when it appeared in an online real estate listing last month.",
      "Before the presentation of the giant gold-framed portrait on Wednesday in the Argentine coastal city of Mar del Plata, the painting had not been seen publicly in 80 years.",
      "The first-ever color photo of the portrait surfaced in a real estate listing unwittingly posted by one of the daughters of Friedrich Kadgien, the fugitive Nazi officer accused of stealing the painting from one of Europe's most prominent prewar art dealers and collectors.",
      "\"We're doing this simply so that the community to whom we partly owe the discovery of the work ... can see these images,\" federal prosecutor Daniel Adler said during a press conference to display the full-length portrait of Countess Colleoni, her hair ink-black and dress embroidered with pastel flowers.",
      "\"It was people from the community, specifically journalists, who prompted the investigation,\" Adler said.",
      "Dutch journalists made the shocking discovery while investigating Kadgien's past in Argentina, where the high-ranking official fled after the collapse of the Third Reich, and later died in 1978.",
      "News of the find thrilled historians the world over and eventually reached the heirs of the painting's original owner, Dutch-Jewish art collector Jacques Goudstikker. He died in a shipwreck after fleeing Amsterdam ahead of advancing German troops in May 1940.",
      "His descendants have sought to recover an estimated 1,100 paintings missing since the forced sale of Goudstikker's extensive inventory to Adolf Hitler's right-hand man, Hermann G\u00f6ring, who built up a major art collection during WWII.",
      "The sudden reappearance of \"Portrait of a Lady\" last week was fleeting. Within hours of the story's publication in Dutch newspaper Algemeen Dagblad last Monday, the real estate listing was taken down. Police raided the rustic Mar del Plata home of Patricia Kadgien, the Nazi officer's daughter, but the painting wasn't there.",

      "Hegseth said Wednesday that the strike shows that \"President Trump is willing to go on offense in ways that others have not been\" when dealing with drug smugglers.",
      "\"You want to try to traffic drugs, it's a new day,\" the defense secretary said. \"It's a different day, and so those 11 drug traffickers are no longer with us, sending a very clear signal that this is an activity the United States is not going to tolerate in our hemisphere.\"",
      "Hegseth said that assets will remain in the region, and that further strikes may be forthcoming.",
      "\"This is a deadly, serious mission for us and it won't stop with just this strike,\" he said. \"Anyone else trafficking in those waters who we know is a designated narco-terrorist will face the same fate.\"",
      "Mr. Trump\u00a0directed the military\u00a0to target drug cartels in Latin America last month. In August, the U.S. said the Navy would increase its presence near Venezuela and deploy multiple warships as part of an anti-drug cartel mission. Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u00a0called the move\u00a0an \"extravagant, unjustifiable, immoral and absolutely criminal and bloody threat.\" Maduro responded by deploying\u00a0warships and drones to Venezuela's coastline.",
      "The U.S. has not indicated it plans to strike Venezuela directly. When Hegseth was asked Wednesday by Fox News about the possibility of a regime change in the country, he said it was a \"presidential decision.\" The Trump administration has\u00a0accused Maduro's government\u00a0of working with drug cartels and groups like Tren de Aragua to bring illicit substances into the United States.",
      "A U.S. federal court charged Maduro\u00a0with narco-terrorism and drug trafficking\u00a0in 2020, allegations that Maduro has denied. The U.S. is offering a $50 million\u00a0reward for Maduro's arrest.",
      "\"What we have, there in the Caribbean, is clear demonstration of military might,\" Hegseth said in the \"Fox & Friends\" interview. \"President Trump has shown whether it is southwest border, Houthis, (Operation) Midnight Hammer in Iran, precise power could impact and reshape dynamics around the world and in the region. Nicolas Maduro, as he considers whether to be a narco-trafficker, has decisions to make.\"",

      "Chagas disease is a parasitic illness spread by triatomine bugs, also known as \"kissing bugs,\" according to the CDC.",
      "The disease is transmitted when feces from bugs infected with the T. cruzi parasite enter a person\u2019s body, typically through a bite wound or contact with the eyes or mouth.",
      "FLESH-EATING PARASITE CASE DETECTED IN US TRAVELER RETURNING FROM CENTRAL AMERICA",
      "\"When the kissing bug takes a blood meal, it will eventually defecate and leave the feces somewhere,\" lead study author Dr. Norman Beatty, assistant professor of medicine at the University of Florida College of Medicine, told Fox News Digital.",
      "\"Sometimes it can \u2018poop\u2019 on our skin or mucous membrane while feeding, and then the parasite enters at that site. The bug\u2019s feces can also end up inside or near a home and then be incidentally ingested or rubbed into the skin or mucous membrane.\"",
      "\"Chagas can lead to fever, fatigue, rash, body aches and lymph node swelling, and later can lead to digestive issues, heart problems and neurological involvement,\" a doctor warned. (iStock)",
      "Transmission in the U.S. can also occur from congenital infection, where a chronically infected mother can transmit the parasite to a fetus, or from organ transplantation, according to Beatty.",
      "Signs and symptoms",
      "The first stage of Chagas disease, called the acute phase, happens shortly after infection. It is followed by the longer-term chronic phase, according to the CDC.",
      "The disease does not always cause illness, but some people can experience symptoms.",
      "\"Chagas can lead to fever, fatigue, rash, body aches and lymph node swelling, and later can lead to digestive issues, heart problems and neurological involvement,\" Siegel warned.",
      "\"What really matters is whether or not the kissing bug has been found invading homes and harbors the parasite.\"",
      "Another hallmark of the disease is eyelid swelling, also known as Roma\u00f1a's sign.",
      "In the chronic phase, about 20% to 30% of people with the infection may experience potentially fatal heart issues or serious digestive problems, the CDC states.",
      "Prevalence of the disease",
      "Approximately 300,000 people are living with Chagas disease who acquired the infection in Latin America and the U.S., according to Beatty.",
      "\"However, the exact number is unknown \u2014 a national prevalence study has never been conducted,\" he told Fox News Digital.",
      "MOSQUITO-BORNE DENGUE FEVER CASES SURGE AT POPULAR US VACATION DESTINATION",
      "The disease is more likely to occur in states where the kissing bug is found close to where people live, which includes parts of California, Arizona, Texas, Louisiana and Florida, according to the expert.",
      "\"What really matters is whether the kissing bug has been found invading homes and harbors the parasite that causes Chagas disease in a particular region,\" he said, adding that researchers are \"just tipping the iceberg\" with their understanding of locally acquired disease in the U.S.",

      "Screening and treatments",
      "In most circumstances, Beatty said, people are bitten by the bug in their bed or home.",
      "\"From there, a person will reach out with a picture of that bug, and we start the process of testing and educating on how to prevent the insect from getting in the home and deterring it from wanting to be around a human dwelling.\"",

      "Lab screening tests and treatments are readily available, Beatty said, but clinicians are largely unaware that the disease is being transmitted in certain communities.",
      "There are two antiparasitic drugs approved for the treatment of Chagas disease in the U.S. \u2014 Benznidazole and Lampit (nifurtimox).",
      "In the chronic phase, about 20% to 30% of people with the infection may experience potentially fatal heart issues or serious digestive problems, the CDC states. (iStock)",
      "\"Currently, there is a clinical trial being conducted to assess a new agent for the treatment of Chagas at certain centers in the U.S. and Latin America,\" Beatty said.",

      "NEW YORK \u2013 Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett hasn\u2019t seen The Handmaid\u2019s Tale. But she was well-prepared to be interrupted by any number of red-draped protesters, should they storm in to interrupt her confirmation hearing, the same way they did for her colleague, Brett Kavanaugh, several years prior.",
      "As she recounted in an interview at the Lincoln Center Thursday night, the preparation had been for naught: Her confirmation took place behind closed doors, thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic and the social precautions in place at the time. It also made the lengthy confirmation process and her first days as a justice on the nation\u2019s highest court \"awkward,\" she said, to laughter. \"Very awkward.\"",
      "That revelation was just one of many Barrett made during a wide-ranging interview Thursday, just days before the publication of her forthcoming memoir, \"Listening to the Law.\"",
      "Like her book, Barrett's appearance proved to be as telling for what she didn't say as for what she did.",

      "Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett stands with her husband, Jesse, on the front plaza of the Supreme Court building in Washington, D.C. (Al Drago/Bloomberg via Getty)",
      "Barrett, 53, spoke easily about her family, her faith, and the kindness of her newfound colleagues on the Supreme Court, whom she says lent her not only the use of their office supplies and bench memos during her first days on the job, but also temporarily dispatched their own staff to help her answer phones and restock supplies. \"There is an indispensable human element to judging,\" Barrett observes in her memoir, something she says is all the more true when serving on a nine-person bench.",
      "\"Thinking in categories of left and right \u2014 it's just the wrong way to think about the law,\" she said Thursday night to the jam-packed audience at Alice Tully Hall.",
      "Even so, Barrett artfully dodged some of the more polarizing issues the court has faced in the past eight months.",
      "She was demonstrably less candid on questions involving the so-called emergency, or \"shadow\" docket \u2014 the vehicle by which President Donald Trump has sought to temporarily stay lower court decisions that would have paused or halted some of his most sweeping executive orders from taking force.",
      "The Supreme Court has presided over a record blitz of emergency appeals and orders filed by the administration and other aggrieved parties during Trump's first eight months back in office. Justices on the 6-3 conservative bench have ruled in Trump\u2019s favor in the majority of emergency applications, allowing the administration to proceed with its ban on transgender service members in the military, its termination of millions of dollars in Education Department grants and its firing of probationary employees across the federal government, among many other actions.",
      "The court has sided with Trump in the majority of these requests, prompting a fresh level of scrutiny \u2014 and rare public criticism from some of her colleagues on the bench.",
      "The Supreme Court \"is at its best when it can review cases that have been fully adjudicated\" by the lower courts, she offered, before the conversation moved on.",

      "Barrett also sought to defend the court as a body that operates beyond the politics of a given moment, and (ideally) outside the reach of public opinion. She noted that public perceptions of what a judge ought to do is, at times, at odds with what the Constitution and existing Supreme Court precedent proscribe.",
      "\"I think everyone expects the court to deliver the results it likes,\" Barrett said Thursday night. There's a \"disconnect between what people want in the moment,\" and what the court should deliver, she said.",
      "People \"want what they want,\" and will inevitably be disappointed by the results, she said.",
      "Like other justices who have authored memoirs while on the bench, Barrett offered a lofty, and at times idealistic, view of the court.",
      "Pressed by journalist Bari Weiss about her majority opinion in Trump v CASA earlier this year, Barrett insisted that her \"spicy\" remarks towards Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson were nothing more than an attempt to \"set the calibration right.\"",

      "Thursday night's interview was the first of many public appearances Barrett is slated to give in coordination with her book release next week. It offered at times a refreshingly personal glimpse into her nearly five years on the Supreme Court \u2014 a job she says she wasn\u2019t quite sure she wanted, when the offer finally came.",
      "Barrett recounted what her husband told her at the time, when she was weighing whether to go through with the confirmation process. Should she choose to move forward, he told her, \"We have to burn the boats.\"",
      "The phrase, adopted from Alexander the Great, refers to the notion that one must eliminate all options for backup plans or retreat.",
      "It was one she held onto during the confirmation process, when media outlets pilloried her as an out-of-touch and hyper-religious mother of seven, when quips from lawmakers, such as then-Sen. Dianne Feinstein \u2014 \"the dogma lives loudly within you\" \u2014 might have rattled her further.",

      "Under the Trump administration, 22,638 unaccompanied children have been located so far, and more than 400 sponsors have been arrested. Twenty-seven of the minors were found dead, either by murder, suicide or drug overdose, according to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS.)",

      "The team was assembled in March to fulfill one of President Donald Trump's campaign promises. He tasked border czar Tom Homan with finding the unaccounted for children, many of whom had been released to unvetted sponsors or non-family members, leaving them vulnerable to exploitation, trafficking and harsh working conditions.",

We're talking about children that were brought into situations and then treated like sexual slaves. You know, where children are in horrific environments, just environments that they should not be in, where the sponsor is a heroin dealer and that child winds up dying of a heroin overdose.\"",
      "In early 2021, a record number of\u00a0children started crossing the border faster than HHS could process.\u00a0Between January 2021 and December 2024, ORR received more than 470,000 referrals of unaccompanied alien children who crossed the border.",
      "According to HHS, many of those children were released to sponsors under very lax vetting policies that failed to ensure child safety or prevent multiple instances of child endangerment, including neglect, labor exploitation, trafficking and sexual and physical abuse.",

      "\"There wasn't very good recordkeeping\" under the Biden administration, Fabbricatore said. \"It's drawing that data back in, being able to identify addresses, where these children went, who these sponsors actually were. In many cases, that data is, is horrible. What the Biden administration was taking in and putting into our computer systems was not the right information. So now we have to draw that all back in and deeply investigate into where some of these children went.\"",
      "According to Fabbricatore, the most concerning lapse in screening was the failure to conduct DNA tests to confirm that children were being released to their actual family members.",
      "The Trump administration took steps to improve the vetting process for children who arrive in the U.S. alone, ensuring that sponsors \u2013 usually parents or guardians \u2013 are properly screened. These measures include requiring DNA testing, proof of income to demonstrate the ability to care for the child, criminal background checks, fingerprinting and identification verification.",
      "\"So now, under this administration, we are making sure that we know there's a real familial connection through DNA, and we are not releasing these children unless we have the right information,\" Fabbricatore said. \"Children are staying in custody longer, but there's a reason for that, because we want to ensure that these children remain safe.\"",
      "When the Trump administration took office, there was a backlog of over 65,000 unaddressed post-release reports, called Notifications of Concern, according to ORR.

      "Congress is currently marking up fiscal 2026 spending levels, but some in the administration are pressing to bypass the process and instead extend current levels through a yearlong continuing resolution (CR).",
      "Republicans broadly agree some form of CR will be needed to avoid a partial shutdown when fiscal 2025 ends on Sept. 30, but some appropriators are frustrated with a lack of a top-line budget number from the House, Senate and White House as they continue their work.",

      "Meanwhile, length is also an issue. The White House is in favor of a clean CR stretching into the new year, while one House lawmaker said appropriators would like a stopgap that was \"as short as possible.\" Some conservative lawmakers have even argued for a bill lasting at least the full fiscal year.",
      "Committee member Rep. Ryan Zinke, R-Mont., called the idea of a long-term measure \"very frustrating.\"",
      "\"As a member of Appropriations, where you do an enormous amount of work, and it leads to a continuing resolution because that\u2019s easier \u2026 I\u2019m deeply concerned that we will roll over and not do our job,\" Zinke told Fox News Digital.",
      "Senior appropriator Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart, R-Fla., predicted \"a very short-term CR,\" but he warned a yearlong measure \"would be devastating for the country.\"",
      "\"The concept that Republicans control the House, Senate and the White House, and we would somehow be stuck with the last Biden [budget] for a second year, to me, is preposterous,\" Diaz-Balart said, adding that the push for a yearlong measure \"is not coming from appropriators.\"",
      "Other committee Republicans echoed those concerns and issues with what they saw as a lack of direction from top officials on a top-line spending number.",
      "The Trump administration official said accusations that House appropriators were not given enough direction from leaders are \"completely false,\" however, and said the White House was engaged in monthly and weekly conversations with lawmakers relevant to the process.",

      "It's not uncommon for administrations to unveil their budget proposals after the traditional early February deadline, however. The Biden administration similarly let its budgets slip past the Feb. 15 deadline, including fiscal 2022, when its proposal was not released until late May.",
      "In 2018, during the Obama administration, no White House budget was proposed at all.",
      "House Freedom Caucus Chair Andy Harris, R-Md., told Fox News Digital he supports going even further with a CR that stretches into December 2026.",

And while he said there were \"a lot of people\" who could share blame for the current situation, he was hesitant to single any one party out.",
      "\"The top-line number, that wasn't done this year, the president's budget was late in arriving, and I\u00a0think Democrats are still flustered by President Trump and aren't sure whether they should deal with him or fight him at every step,\" he said.",

That's not coming from the appropriators, but it is coming out of the White House \u2026 I'm willing to work within any time frame my leadership gives me. I don't want a government shutdown. I want a bipartisan deal.\"",
      "In March, with the White House's support, Congress passed a CR through Sept. 30 that extended fiscal 2024 spending levels, with some increases for defense funding.",
      "The White House has since acted to rescind some of those funds, chiefly aimed at foreign aid and public broadcasting.",

    "story": [
      "If you are struggling with a slow Wi-Fi or internet connection, follow Kurt \"The CyberGuy\" Knutsson's instructions to solve these issues.",
      "Home Wi-Fi networks are the backbone of how most people get online, connecting laptops, phones, smart TVs and more. When properly secured, they offer a convenient and private way to browse the internet, stream content and work from home. But \"private\" doesn't always mean \"safe.\" Wi-Fi security can be easily compromised if you have weak settings or outdated equipment.",
      "I recently heard from Carol in Smithtown, New York, who asked, \"Is it safe to browse the internet on your own laptop using only your home Wi-Fi?\"",
      "Her question points to a bigger concern. Many of us rely on home networks every day without really knowing if they're as secure as they should be.",
      "Let's break down what makes a home Wi-Fi network secure, the risks you should know about and the steps you can take to protect your privacy.",
      "Sign up for my FREE CyberGuy ReportGet my best tech tips, urgent security alerts and exclusive deals delivered straight to your inbox. Plus, you\u2019ll get instant access to my Ultimate Scam Survival Guide \u2014 free when you join my\u00a0Cyberguy.com newsletter.",
      "A user troubleshoots an internet router. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Why home Wi-Fi security is important",
      "Your home Wi-Fi is not just a way to get online but also the gateway to your personal and professional life. Everything from online banking to work emails to video calls passes through it. If your network isn't secure, that information could be intercepted or exposed.",
      "One of the biggest misconceptions is that a home network is safe simply because it's private. In reality, hackers often target residential networks because they tend to have weaker defenses than corporate ones.",
      "Someone nearby could connect to your network if your password is weak or your encryption is outdated. This not only slows your internet but also lets them use your connection for illegal activities. Sensitive information like passwords, credit card numbers and personal documents can be intercepted if the network is compromised.",
      "11 EASY WAYS TO PROTECT YOUR ONLINE PRIVACY IN 2025",
      "Attackers can use an insecure network to push malicious software onto your devices, sometimes without you even realizing it. Smart devices such as security cameras, thermostats and speakers can be taken over and used for spying or as part of larger cyberattacks.",
      "Even if you trust everyone in your household, your network is still exposed to risks from outside. And with so many devices connected today, including laptops, phones, tablets, TVs and IoT gadgets, there are more entry points for an attacker than ever before. Securing your Wi-Fi closes those doors before someone decides to try them.",
      "A hacker executes cybercrime. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Choose the right router for Wi-Fi protection",
      "Every piece of Wi-Fi security advice ultimately comes back to the same foundation: your router. It is the gatekeeper for your entire home network. If it is old, poorly configured, or missing important updates, even the strongest passwords and best digital habits will not fully protect you.",
      "Investing in a good router is one of the most important steps you can take to secure your home Wi-Fi. A modern, well-supported router gives you stronger encryption, better control over connected devices and regular updates that patch security flaws.",
      "Don't stop at the hardware itself. Check regularly for firmware updates from the manufacturer. Some new routers update automatically, but many require you to log in and install patches manually. Outdated firmware leaves known vulnerabilities wide open.",
      "IS YOUR HOME WI-FI REALLY SAFE? THINK AGAIN",
      "Also, change the default router login password immediately. Most routers ship with basic credentials like \"admin/admin.\" Attackers know this and can easily hijack your settings if you never change them.",
      "If your router supports it, enable\u00a0two-factor authentication (2FA)\u00a0for logins. This extra step makes it much harder for attackers to gain control, even if they steal your password.",
      "If you are not sure where to begin, I have put together a list of some of the best and most secure routers you can buy right now by visiting\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Enable strong Wi-Fi encryption",
      "Encryption ensures that the data flowing across your network is scrambled, making it useless to anyone who tries to intercept it. Without proper encryption, nearby attackers can capture and read your traffic.",
      "The current gold standard is WPA3, which provides the strongest protection. If your router doesn't support it, WPA2 is still considered safe and widely used. Older options like WEP or an open, password-free network are highly insecure and should be avoided at all costs. It's worth logging into your router's settings just to confirm what level of encryption your network is using.",
      "Cables run out of an internet router. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Create a strong Wi-Fi password",
      "Your Wi-Fi password is the digital equivalent of the key to your home. A short or predictable password is like leaving a spare under the doormat, and anyone determined enough can find a way in. Instead, create a long passphrase that combines upper and lowercase letters, numbers and symbols. Aim for at least 12 to 16 characters.",
      "Consider using a password manager to generate and store complex passwords.",
      "Check out the best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Check who is connected to your network",
      "Even with a solid password, it's smart to check who is actually connected to your network. Most routers allow you to view a list of active devices. If you spot something you don't recognize, investigate. It could be a neighbor piggybacking on your connection or, in the worst case, an intruder.",
      "It also helps to disable Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS). This feature was designed to make connecting new devices easier, but it has security flaws that attackers can exploit. Some users go further by enabling MAC address filtering, which limits access to specific devices.",
      "To reduce risk even more, set up a\u00a0separate guest network for smart devices and visitors. That way, if one device gets hacked, your laptops and phones remain protected.",
      "And remember, keep all your devices updated. From laptops and phones to smart bulbs and thermostats, every gadget is a potential entry point. A weak link in one device can put your entire network at risk.",
      "IS YOUR PHONE HACKED? HOW TO TELL AND WHAT TO DO",
      "Protect your privacy with a VPN",
      "A Virtual Private Network, or VPN, helps solve one of the biggest issues with online privacy, which is who can see what you're doing. When you connect through a VPN, it creates an encrypted tunnel between your device and the websites or apps you use. Everything that travels through this tunnel is hidden from outsiders, including your internet provider.",
      "A reliable VPN is essential for protecting your online privacy and ensuring a secure, high-speed connection.",
      "For the best VPN software, see my expert review of the best VPNs for browsing the web privately on your\u00a0Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Don't overlook antivirus protection",
      "While your Wi-Fi settings form the first line of defense, you should also protect the devices connected to your network. Install strong antivirus software to block malware that could spread through downloads, emails, or malicious links. This extra step ensures that even if a threat slips past your router's defenses, your devices stay protected.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "So, to return to Carol's question: Is it safe to browse the internet on your home Wi-Fi? The answer is yes, but only if you take the time to secure it. Strong router settings, proper encryption and a solid password do most of the heavy lifting. Building habits such as checking who is connected, keeping devices updated and using tools like a VPN adds even greater peace of mind.",

      "The Navy, in partnership with Skydweller Aero, recently achieved continuous solar-powered unmanned flight during a nonstop three-day test. (Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division)",
      "Navy expands solar-powered surveillance",
      "NAWCAD leaders say Skydweller will fit into the Navy's intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) network. Unlike expensive satellites or large drones such as the Global Hawk, Skydweller offers commanders a cheaper option for persistent monitoring. It can hover over an area in what experts call a \"pseudo-satellite role,\" freeing up more advanced systems for priority missions.",
      "For U.S. Southern Command, Skydweller could help track drug trafficking, border security threats and other maritime challenges. Longer tests are already planned for this summer in the SOUTHCOM region, which covers Latin America and the Caribbean and oversees U.S. military operations in that area.",

      "Future of solar-powered flight for Navy missions",
      "While Skydweller has already logged nearly 220 flight hours, engineers believe it could stay airborne far longer. Weather and range limits kept this recent test at 73 hours, but in theory, the aircraft could remain aloft for weeks.",
      "The Department of Defense sees platforms like Skydweller as vital for future conflicts where fuel resupply may not be possible. Renewable-powered drones could solve logistics headaches, especially in contested environments, which essentially means operating in places where enemies can block supply lines and make traditional refueling too risky.",
      "What this means for you",

      "The good news: you don't have to chase down every broker yourself. A personal data removal service does the legwork for you, contacting data brokers, demanding removal and following up to make sure your new details don't creep back in. Think of it as hiring a moving company for your personal data.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0 They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0 These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0 It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0 By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "When you change your address, always use the official USPS website or your local post office. Some third-party sites look like they're offering a convenient service, but they often collect extra data about you and sometimes even resell it. Going straight to the source means your sensitive details don't take unnecessary detours.",
      "When you sell your home, more than just the price gets published. Your name, past addresses and even photos of your home can become part of the public record. Ask your realtor what's automatically disclosed and whether anything can be limited or redacted. It's worth being picky here: the less of your personal footprint that's tied to your property, the better.",
      "Moving is the perfect excuse to purge. But don't just throw out old bills, medical statements, or financial records; shred them. Dumpster-diving for personal data may sound outdated, but it's still a method scammers use. A good shredder ensures your sensitive history doesn't end up in the wrong hands.",
      "It's tempting to post a \"Goodbye, old house!\" photo online, but resist the urge. Publicly announcing a move tells scammers exactly when your home is empty and what your new address might be. Instead, share the news directly with family and close friends. A little less buzz online means a lot more safety offline.",
      "One powerful way to stay ahead of scammers is to freeze your credit. A freeze blocks new credit accounts from being opened in your name, even if criminals have your address or other details. The good news is that you can do this for free with all three major credit bureaus: Equifax, Experian and TransUnion.",
      "It only takes a few minutes online or by phone, and you can lift the freeze anytime if you need to apply for a loan or credit card. By freezing your credit before and after your move, you create a strong barrier that keeps thieves from turning stolen data into financial damage.",
      "CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Moving should feel like a new beginning, not an invitation for scammers to strike. With a few smart steps, you can stay ahead of data brokers and fraudsters. From shredding documents to freezing your credit, every action adds a layer of protection. By protecting your information before and after your move, you gain peace of mind and start your next chapter on solid ground. The effort is small compared to the security it brings.",

      "Self-driving trucks are moving closer to reality. PlusAI released its first half 2025 performance results, showing how far the company has come toward its goal of launching factory-built autonomous trucks in 2027.",
      "The numbers are clear. Safety case readiness reached 86%, with a goal of 100% by launch. Autonomous miles percentage climbed to 98%. Remote assistance free trips rose to 76%, with a target of more than 90%.",

      "PlusAI reports that its driverless trucks could be ready to hit the road within the next two years. (PlusAI)",
      "Why PlusAI's 2025 results matter for autonomous trucks",
      "Even if you never step into a truck, these results affect your daily life. Every product you buy travels by truck at some point, whether it's groceries, clothing or furniture. The way those trucks operate influences cost, availability and safety on the road.",
      "The trucking industry faces three major challenges. There are not enough long-haul drivers to meet demand. Costs continue to rise due to labor shortages, tariffs and fuel prices. And safety is a concern because human drivers can get tired or distracted.",
      "Autonomous trucks could help address each of these issues. PlusAI's vehicles are already hauling freight on Texas highways today, and they are also undergoing road testing in Sweden. The company has already logged more than 5 million autonomous miles across the United States, Europe and Asia. That real-world experience fuels the AI system with the data it needs to improve.",
      "LUCID JOINS TESLA AND GM WITH HANDS-FREE HIGHWAY DRIVING",
      "The PlusAI Safety Case Framework. Data shows that self-driving trucks will roll out by 2027. (PlusAI)",
      "How PlusAI plans to launch autonomous trucks by 2027",
      "PlusAI has created a roadmap that sets it apart. Instead of retrofitting trucks with autonomous systems, it is working with major manufacturers like TRATON GROUP, Hyundai and IVECO to integrate the technology at the factory. This approach makes scaling production faster and ensures consistency.",
      "The initial launch is planned for the Texas Triangle, a major freight corridor connecting Dallas, Houston, San Antonio and Austin. From there, PlusAI plans to expand into other U.S. routes and eventually Europe.",
      "The company has also committed to publishing regular performance updates as it transitions to a public company. By sharing measurable results, PlusAI builds trust with regulators, the public, and businesses that may one day rely on its trucks to move goods.",
      "\"We have a clear roadmap to the commercial launch of SuperDrive,\" said David Liu, CEO and co-founder of PlusAI. \"By publicly sharing these performance metrics, we are showing our commitment to safety and scalability while bringing partners, customers, and regulators along on this journey.\"",
      "What's next for PlusAI and driverless freight trucks?",
      "PlusAI still has milestones to meet. Safety readiness must rise from 86% to 100%. Remote Assistance Free Trips must surpass 90%. These are ambitious goals, but the progress so far suggests the company can achieve them.",
      "Fleet trials are scheduled to begin later this year, and PlusAI continues testing in both the United States and internationally. Each step adds to the case that driverless trucks will be ready for commercial launch in 2027.",

      "What this means for you",
      "As a shopper, autonomous trucks could mean faster and more affordable deliveries. As a driver, you may soon share highways with self-driving freight haulers. As a business owner, this technology could reduce logistics costs and ease the impact of driver shortages.",

    "story": [
      "The CyberGuy explains steps you can take to protect yourself from scams.",
      "Forget roaring lawnmowers and fuel-guzzling tractors. Today's solar companies are turning to flocks of sheep to trim grass and control weeds under solar panels. These eco-friendly grazers easily navigate narrow panel rows, cutting maintenance costs and carbon emissions at the same time. In fact, using sheep instead of gas-powered mowing crews can reduce upkeep expenses by up to 20 percent.",

      "WHY AI IS CAUSING SUMMER ELECTRICITY BILLS TO SOAR",
      "Why solar grazing with sheep cuts costs and emissions",
      "Sheep fit neatly between solar arrays, reaching into nooks that mechanical gear can't. They chew rain or shine. And since sheep run on grass, not gas, their grazing helps reduce carbon emissions. Using these natural lawnmowers better aligns with solar's green mission goals. Developers like SB Energy in Texas now rely on herds of around 3,000 sheep to cover thousands of acres, benefiting both their bottom line and the planet.",
      "WHY YOU SHOULD THINK TWICE BEFORE JOINING A POWER SAVER PROGRAM",
      "Sheep graze near solar panels in Haskell, Texas, Dec. 2, 2024.\u00a0 (REUTERS/Annie Rice)",
      "How agrivoltaics turns sheep and solar panels into profits",
      "This isn't your average landscaping story. There's even a fancy word for it: agrivolatics, or the practice of combining solar energy production with agriculture.\u2028Farmers who jump on board aren't just maintaining the lawn; they're opening up multiple revenue streams. First, ranchers can lease land to solar companies, sign grazing contracts, while still earning from traditional farm products like wool and lamb.",
      "Chad Raines is a rancher from Texas. He decided to trade in cotton farming for sheep grazing on solar land. That move has paid off. Last year, he brought in around $300,000. If he had stuck with cotton, he estimates he would've lost about $200,000 instead. That's a huge swing, and it's a real-world example of how solar grazing is helping revive a sheep industry that had been stuck in neutral for decades.",
      "How sheep improve soil health and boost biodiversity at solar farms",
      "Letting sheep do the mowing isn't just about saving time or money. It actually helps the land. As they move through the fields, sheep naturally break down plant material, aerate the soil and leave behind fertilizing manure. This leads to healthier dirt and better carbon capture.",
      "Companies like Lightsource BP are already seeing those benefits. They manage over 14,000 sheep across solar farms that produce more than 3 gigawatts of power. These sites aren't just power generators, they're also habitats. Flowers that support bees and butterflies are planted among the panels, creating ideal conditions for pollinators. Some farms have even started producing honey thanks to the thriving bee population.",
      "GOOGLE TURNS CO2 INTO BATTERY POWER FOR CLEAN ENERGY",
      "Sheep grazing cuts operations and maintenance costs for solar operators. (REUTERS/Annie Rice)",
      "Major solar farms scale up sheep grazing across thousands of acres",
      "This isn't just happening on a small scale. Enel North America recently signed one of the biggest solar grazing deals in the country. They're deploying over 6,000 sheep across eight large solar farms, covering more than 10,000 acres.",
      "At some of those sites, the amount of organic matter in the soil has more than doubled. For solar operators, this approach just makes sense. It cuts operations and maintenance costs, strengthens environmental credibility and builds better relationships with nearby communities.",
      "Investors are paying attention, too. In just two years, the number of solar grazing projects has skyrocketed, especially in places backed by heavy hitters like DE Shaw and Berkshire Hathaway.",

      "What solar grazing means for you",
      "If you care about clean energy, sustainable farming or smart land use, solar grazing is worth watching. It shows how innovation doesn't always require high-tech gadgets; sometimes, it just takes some sheep. For farmers and ranchers, this model opens the door to new income by partnering with solar companies. If you own land or work in agriculture, grazing contracts could provide a steady stream of revenue without giving up traditional operations.",
      "For everyone else, this trend offers hope that renewable energy can coexist with rural livelihoods, boost biodiversity and fight climate change, all at once. As solar farms expand across the country, expect to see more flocks doing the work of machines, quietly transforming how we power the planet.",

This approach blends sustainability with practicality. It supports healthier soil, boosts biodiversity and strengthens rural economies, all while helping solar farms operate more efficiently.

      "Scammers impersonating local authorities are on the rise, telling victims they missed jury duty and must pay to avoid legal trouble. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What jury duty scam victims need to know",
      "Scammers posing as court officials are targeting individuals with false claims about missed jury duty, prompting warnings from law enforcement. The fraud typically begins with a call from a blocked or unknown number, alleging that the recipient has missed jury duty and is facing an arrest warrant. The scammers then demand payment, usually through wire transfers or gift cards.",
      "A key warning sign is being asked to pay money to avoid arrest or legal trouble. It is important never to give money or personal information to unknown callers.",
      "These scams often target older or more vulnerable individuals, although younger people have also reported close calls. In one example, a person received repeated calls from an unidentified number before answering. The caller, claiming to be from a local sheriff's department and equipped with the individual's full name and address, insisted they had failed to appear for jury duty and faced multiple citations.",

      "This might sound obvious, but don't trust any unknown caller, especially if they demand money. Legitimate authorities will never ask for payment over the phone, especially not through gift cards, wire transfers, or cryptocurrency. If someone threatens you with arrest or legal action unless you pay immediately, it's almost certainly a scam. Hang up and call your local court or police department using an official number.",
      "If you receive a suspicious call, take a breath and fact-check. Court summonses are always delivered by mail, not over the phone. Even if the caller has personal information like your name or address, that doesn't make them credible. Scammers often use leaked or publicly available data to appear convincing.",
      "Be extra cautious, even if the scam comes through text messages or email. Do not click on any suspicious links, as they can install malware on your device and steal your personal data.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites. It's what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.

      "Why AI stuffed animals worry child experts",
      "Pediatricians and psychologists raise red flags about these AI toys. Young children naturally form attachments. If those attachments shift to chatbots, kids may learn to trust machines more than people. Research already shows children ages 3 to 6 sometimes trust robots more than humans, even when the robots give wrong answers. That undermines how kids build empathy, learn to question, and develop critical thinking. There are also privacy concerns. Parents may not realize that these\u00a0\"personalized\" toys are recording conversations. Sensitive information could be stored, analyzed, or misused without families fully knowing.",

That responsiveness can be powerful. It can encourage curiosity, vocabulary growth, and even creativity. But it can also crowd out human interactions, those subtle facial expressions, pauses, and \"nos\" that children need to experience to learn empathy and resilience. Another risk is that AI companions are trained to be overly charming and agreeable. Instead of challenging a child's thinking, these\u00a0\"sycophantic\" toys may simply tell kids what they want to hear. Over time, that could nudge children toward believing comforting lies instead of asking hard questions, a toxic pattern for developing critical thinking.",

      "Now, credit reporting firm TransUnion has confirmed its own major incident, with more than 4.4 million U.S. consumers affected.\u00a0Attackers exploited weaknesses in third-party integrations, not Salesforce itself.

      "SCAMMERS ARE USING DOCUSIGN EMAILS TO PUSH APPLE PAY FRAUD",
      "Hackers stole 13 million records, exposing data of 4.4 million Americans in the latest TransUnion cyberattack. (Christopher Dilts/Bloomberg)",
      "What you need to know about the TransUnion data breach",
      "TransUnion has disclosed a major data breach that impacted 4,461,511 individuals in the United States, according to a filing with the Maine Attorney General's Office. The incident occurred on July 28, 2025, and was discovered two days later on July 30.",
      "The breach resulted from unauthorized access to a third-party application used in TransUnion's U.S. consumer support operations. The company stressed that its core credit database and credit reports were not compromised.",
      "Although TransUnion characterized the exposed information as \"limited,\" the stolen data is highly sensitive. It includes names, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, billing addresses, email addresses, phone numbers, reasons for customer transactions (such as requests for a free credit report), and customer support tickets and messages.",
      "Hackers claim they stole more than 13 million records in total, with about 4.4 million tied to U.S. consumers.",
      "In response, TransUnion is providing all affected individuals with 24 months of free credit monitoring and identity theft protection services.",

      "The breach at TransUnion follows several similar cyberattacks against tech companies, including Google and Cisco, and retail brands, such as Chanel and Adidas.\u00a0 (Mike Kemp/In Pictures)",
      "Hackers target companies through Salesforce apps",
      "The breach appears to be part of a broader wave of Salesforce-related attacks that is hitting organizations across sectors, from tech and finance to retail and aviation. Alongside Google, Farmers Insurance, Allianz Life, Workday, Pandora, Cisco, Chanel and Qantas, brands like Adidas, Louis Vuitton, Dior, Tiffany & Co., Cartier and Air France-KLM have also reported incidents tied to weaknesses in Salesforce-linked applications.",
      "In most cases, attackers exploited malicious third-party integrations or OAuth-connected apps disguised as legitimate Salesforce tools to siphon sensitive records. This technique bypassed traditional login protections and gave intruders long-lasting access to customer relationship management data. The stolen information ranges from basic contact details and business notes to highly sensitive identifiers such as Social Security numbers, dates of birth and driver's license information.",
      "Researchers say these intrusions align with activity from the extortion group ShinyHunters, with some overlap in tactics and infrastructure linked to other threat actors like Scattered Spider. Campaigns tracked under names such as UNC6395 and UNC6040 point to a larger \"extortion-as-a-service\" model, where criminal crews collaborate and share stolen data across underground forums.",
      "TransUnion's response",
      "CyberGuy reached out to TransUnion for a comment and received the following response:",
      "\"TransUnion recently experienced a cyber incident that affected a third-party application serving our U.S. consumer support operations. Upon discovery, we quickly contained the issue, which did not involve our core credit database or include credit reports.",
      "The incident involved unauthorized access to limited personal information for a very small percentage of U.S. consumers. We are working with law enforcement and have engaged third-party cybersecurity experts for an independent forensics review. Additionally, we will notify affected consumers and provide credit monitoring services.\"",
      "As for the gap between when the breach occurred (July 28, 2025) and when it was officially recorded as \"discovered\" (July 30, 2025), a TransUnion spokesperson clarified that the company\u00a0\"identified and contained this event within hours\" of it happening, but that it is common industry practice to designate a later \"date of discovery\" to reflect a more complete assessment following the initial response.",

      "Go through old online accounts, shopping profiles or cloud storage that may still hold sensitive data. Deleting what you no longer use reduces the amount of information that could be stolen in future breaches or sold on dark web forums. You can also get help from a data removal service.",

If you get an email or text claiming to be from TransUnion, your bank or any service asking you to \"verify\" details, don't click on the link. Instead, log in through the official website or call customer service directly.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

Use a password manager to create and store strong, unique passwords for every service. Even if hackers get hold of one, they won't be able to use it elsewhere. Consider using a password manager to generate and store complex passwords.",
      "Next, see if your passwords have been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager (see Cyberguy.com/Passwords) pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",

      "Two-factor authentication (2FA)\u00a0adds a critical extra step beyond just a password. If someone tries to break into your email, banking app or social media account, they'll also need the one-time code from your authenticator app or text message. This makes stolen credentials much less useful.",
      "Hackers often rely on outdated software to spread malware or steal information. Installing the latest updates for your phone, computer and apps ensures security patches are in place, blocking known vulnerabilities that attackers might exploit.",
      "One of the biggest risks after a breach is criminals opening new loans or credit cards in your name. A credit freeze with all three major bureaus, TransUnion, Equifax and Experian, prevents anyone from accessing your credit file without your approval. It's free and can be temporarily lifted if you need to apply for credit.",
      "Watch your bank and credit card statements for unfamiliar charges, no matter how small. Set up transaction alerts where available. You should also pull your free annual credit report to check for unauthorized accounts or inquiries, which could be signs of fraud.",
      "If your Social Security number, driver's license or other sensitive identifiers were exposed, you may want to sign up for an identity theft protection service. These services monitor credit reports, dark web forums and financial activity for signs of misuse. Some also include insurance or recovery assistance if your identity is stolen, giving you added peace of mind beyond basic credit monitoring. If you're one of the affected TransUnion users, make use of the 24 months of free credit monitoring and identity theft protection services. If not, you might get one yourself for the future.",

      "In reality, neither Apple nor these other companies sends billing receipts through DocuSign. That detail alone is a red flag. Another telltale sign is the sender's address.

It includes an order ID, a charge amount, and a DocuSign link that supposedly holds a receipt or confirmation file.

They might ask for your Apple ID, banking details, or card numbers. They may pressure you to download remote access software so they can \"fix\" the issue on your device.

      "In a notice published on its website, the U.S. insurance giant said the breach occurred on May 29, 2025, through one of its third-party vendors. Farmers serves over 10 million households nationwide. It offers auto, home, life, and business insurance through a vast network of agents and subsidiaries.",

In some cases, the last four digits of Social Security numbers. Farmers began notifying affected individuals on Aug. 22, with a filing to the Maine Attorney General's Office confirming that 1,111,386 customers were impacted.",

      "The Salesforce attacks have been ongoing since early 2025. Researchers attributed them to a threat actor cluster tracked as UNC6040/UNC6240. The intrusions typically begin with voice phishing (vishing) calls, where employees are tricked into approving a malicious OAuth application linked to their company's Salesforce instance.",
      "Once connected, attackers siphon customer relationship management (CRM) databases and use the stolen data in extortion attempts.

While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0 They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0 These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0 It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0 By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "After a data breach, attackers often follow up with phishing emails or phone calls. They pretend to be from your insurance company or a support service. Don't click on links in unsolicited messages, and verify any claims through official channels before responding. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "Berlin swing musician David Hermlin says he is facing cancellation after being excluded from some of Europe\u2019s leading jazz festivals and accused of intimidation at a meeting organized by a pro-Palestinian group.\u00a0The 25-year-old told Fox News Digital that his only actions were asking two questions and wearing a yellow pin in solidarity with hostages still held in Gaza.\"I didn\u2019t harass or intimidate anyone. I merely asked two questions I thought were legitimate,\" Hermlin said.",
      "Known on social media as \"Daveetheewave,\" Hermlin has built a reputation not just for his music but for his image. He dresses in authentic 1930s fashion, complete with slicked-back hair, vintage microphone, and a charcoal gray suit that looks plucked from a Fred Astaire film.BBC DEEMED UK PUNK-RAP DUO 'HIGH RISK' BEFORE CONTROVERSIAL ANTI-ISRAEL PERFORMANCE",

      "The look fits the sound. He sings classics like \"Let\u2019s Fall in Love\" backed by his own big band, The Swing Dance Orchestra, that re-creates the golden era of swing down to the last detail. His yellow ribbon pin, worn neatly on the lapel of that tailored suit, stood out at this year\u2019s festival and became a flashpoint in the controversy.",
      "Hermlin\u2019s experience raises questions about free speech in the entertainment world. He frames his case as part of a broader historical pattern of exclusion.\"What kind of a world is this now that before I can play at a festival, I have to make a political statement? It\u2019s a music festival, not a political festival,\" he said.ANTI-ISRAEL BAND PLAYS VICTIM AFTER BEING HAMMERED FOR SAYING \u2018DEATH TO THE IDF\u2019 DURING MUSIC FESTIVAL",

      "The Herr\u00e4ng Dance Camp in Sweden is considered one of the world\u2019s most recognized swing festivals. At this year\u2019s gathering, a group called Jazz with Palestine held an open meeting. Hermlin was performing as a drummer with another ensemble, not his own orchestra.\u00a0He later learned that organizers not only excluded him from that group\u2019s jam sessions but also made it clear they would not consider booking his personal projects, like The Swing Dance Orchestra.\"I went with the sole intention to just listen to their concerns and if possible have a dialogue,\" Hermlin explained.",
      "At the Jazz with Palestine meeting, Hermlin asked two questions. He wanted to know where monetary donations would be directed, and what the lyrics of the Arabic song used for choreography meant. The exchange later prompted complaints about his \"intimidating presence.\"\"The first question was, if I want to donate some money, where are the donations going?\" Hermlin recalled. \"The second was, what\u2019s the meaning of the Arabic song? They said they didn\u2019t know. I asked, wouldn\u2019t it be nice to know before filming a choreography?\"STATE DEPARTMENT PULLS VISAS FOR BRITISH BAND BOB VYLAN, FOLLOWING \u2018DEATH TO THE IDF\u2019 CHANTS AT GLASTONBURY",

      "He said he was stunned when a board member told him some attendees were uncomfortable.",
      "Hermlin also faced criticism for wearing the small yellow lapel pin, which symbolizes solidarity with the 50 hostages still held by Hamas. Festivalgoers suggested the pin was inflammatory or political propaganda. Hermlin rejects that characterization.\"People pointed at my yellow pin and said, maybe people are aggressive because of your pin. I asked them, do you know what it means? They said no,\" he said. \"This pin is about the hostages. It\u2019s not about the IDF or the government. It\u2019s about empathy.\"",
      "After Herr\u00e4ng, Hermlin said other festivals began dropping him from their lineups while keeping his band. \"I\u2019m the only one being excluded. Not the band, just me,\" he said. \"A festival told me, don\u2019t take it personally, you\u2019ll get a cancellation fee. But how is that not personal?\"",

      "Fox News Digital reached out to Jazz with Palestine for comment but did not receive a response. On its website and social media, the group describes itself as a movement of jazz and swing dancers across Europe who use music, dance, and political action to stand with the Palestinian people.\u00a0Its mission statement says the group raises awareness and funds and that jazz is rooted in the \"fight against racial and colonial oppression.\" The group has recently promoted fundraising efforts for humanitarian groups in Gaza and announced plans for social dance events and educational forums.",
      "Hermlin says the treatment reminds him of both the McCarthy era and his own family\u2019s history in Berlin during the 1930s. He also points to the swing world\u2019s history of exclusion.\u00a0\"It reminds me of the McCarthy era, when artists were pressed to declare if they were communists. If you said yes, you were boycotted,\" he said. \"They did this in front of photos of Norma Miller, Frankie Manning, and the Nicholas Brothers, artists excluded in the 1930s. How ironic is that?\"",
      "He also cites Benny Goodman, the Jewish clarinetist who became the \"King of Swing\" and defied segregation by hiring Black musicians such as Teddy Wilson, Lionel Hampton, and Charlie Christian. \"As Benny Goodman showed in the 1930s, swing is about inclusion. That\u2019s its very soul,\" Hermlin said.",
      "Despite the fallout, Hermlin vows to keep playing. \"I had no choice but to speak up. Music should unite and not divide,\" he said.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\"I never wanted to be dragged into politics. I\u2019m a swing musician, not a politician \u2014 my instrument is the drums, not a political statement.\"\u00a0\"My way of fighting back is to keep swinging. That\u2019s what I\u2019ll do. I always end my concerts by saying, don\u2019t forget, keep swinging. And I mean it.\"",

      "FIRST ON FOX: A new study disputes claims that\u00a0Israel committed genocide in Gaza following Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023 massacre, arguing that allegations of starvation, indiscriminate bombing and deliberate civilian killings lack verifiable evidence.",
      "The report by researchers from the Begin-Sadat Center for Strategic Studies at Bar-Ilan University, \"Debunking the Genocide Allegations: A Reexamination of the Israel-Hamas War\" (2023-2025), contends that the genocide narrative has been driven by faulty data, uncritical sourcing and a humanitarian system vulnerable to manipulation.",
      "A key element of the genocide accusations is the claim that Israel deliberately starved Gaza\u2019s population. The study argues that \"claims of starvation prior to March 2, 2025, were based on erroneous data, circular citations, and a failure to critically review sources.\" While U.N. officials and rights groups maintained that 500 trucks a day were needed to prevent famine, prewar U.N. figures show Gaza averaged 292 daily in 2022 \u2014 only 73 of them carrying food.",

      "The genocide allegation also rests on claims that Israel intentionally targeted civilians, but the study acknowledges civilian deaths while finding no evidence of a systematic policy of massacre.",
      "Orbach cited BBC data showing that between May 2024 and January 2025, 550 people were killed in designated safe zones\u2014just 2.1% to 3.5% of total casualties, even though half of Gaza\u2019s population was concentrated there for much of the period.",

      "After a slew of high-profile successes in the U.S. Supreme Court, the Trump administration found key parts of its agenda blocked in federal court this week, with judges criticizing its actions as \"unlawful\" and \"unconstitutional.\"",
      "Judges issued orders blocking the president's use of the wartime Alien Enemies Act to speed deportations, the federal deployment of the National Guard for law enforcement purposes in California, and the freezing of $2 billion in federal funds to Harvard.",
      "It was the worst week in the courts in months for President Donald Trump and his administration \u2014 and came after another major loss last week, when an appeals court struck down some of his tariffs. Trump is already appealing that ruling to the Supreme Court and has said it would be a \"disaster\" if it's not overturned.",
      "The high court has granted the Trump administration\u2019s emergency requests in 17 of 22 cases to date, a recent NBC News analysis found.",
      "The flurry of appeals comes as the president has issued an unprecedented number of executive orders aimed at transforming the federal government.",
      "\u201cThe courts aren\u2019t going to strike down all that they\u2019re doing, and, at the end of the day, they\u2019ll end up accomplishing more by flooding the zone,\u201d a lawyer who is close to the White House said in May in reference to the administration's strategy.",
      "Asked to comment on the rulings, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said in a statement Friday that \"Fake News NBC is trying to push the left\u2019s narrative in a new way.\"",
      "\"Here\u2019s the reality: with almost 20 Supreme Court victories, the Trump Administration\u2019s policies have been consistently upheld by the Supreme Court as lawful despite an unprecedented number of legal challenges and unlawful lower court rulings. And the winning will continue,\u201d she said.",
      "Here's a look at the string of legal losses:",
      "Judge calls Harvard funding cuts an ideologically motivated 'assault'",
      "The judge presiding over Harvard's lawsuit on the government's gutting of its federal funding found the administration's actions were \"violative of the First Amendment\"  and \"unconstitutional coercion.\"",
      "The administration had said it was freezing over $2 billion in funds because of Harvard's failure to combat antisemitism. U.S. District Judge Allison D. Burroughs said in her Wednesday ruling that the claim \"reeks of pretext.\"",
      "She said that while the school has been \u201cplagued by antisemitism\u201d in recent years, it's taken several steps since early 2024 to combat the problem. Burroughs also said the majority of the changes the White House was seeking to make at the school had nothing to do with the issue, and neither did the grants it was canceling.",
      "\"The terminated grants related to all manner of medical, scientific, technological, and other projects,\" she wrote, pointing to research on breast cancer, antibiotic resistance and veterans' health.",
      "The judge accused the administration of using \"antisemitism as a smokescreen for a targeted, ideologically-motivated assault on this country\u2019s premier universities, and did so in a way that runs afoul of the APA, the First Amendment and Title VI,\u201d referring to the Administrative Procedure Act and a Civil Rights Act statute that prohibits discrimination based on race, color or national origin.",
      "The White House said it will appeal Burroughs' ruling.",
      "Judge says National Guard deployment to Los Angeles was unlawful",
      "On Tuesday, a federal judge in California found the administration was violating a 19th-century law barring the domestic use of the military for civilian law enforcement activities.",
      "The administration activated the National Guard and sent hundreds of Marines to the Los Angeles area in June, after thousands of protesters took to the streets to rally against Trump's immigration policies.",
      "The administration said the move was necessary because some of the protests had turned violent and the troops were needed to protect federal property and personnel.",
      "In his 52-page ruling, U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer said the troops did more than that \u2014 a violation of the Posse Comitatus Act. The 1878 statute prohibits the president from using the military as a domestic police force without approval from Congress.",
      "The government \"systematically used armed soldiers (whose identity was often obscured by protective armor) and military vehicles to set up protective perimeters and traffic blockades, engage in crowd control, and otherwise demonstrate a military presence in and around Los Angeles,\" the judge wrote.",
      "Breyer's order blocks the administration \"from deploying, ordering, instructing, training, or using the National Guard currently deployed in California, and any military troops heretofore deployed in California, to execute the laws, including but not limited to engaging in arrests, apprehensions, searches, seizures, security patrols, traffic control, crowd control, riot control, evidence collection, (or) interrogation.\"",
      "He stayed his order until Sept. 12 to give the White House time to appeal, which it said it will do.",
      "Court blocks Alien Enemies Act deportations",
      "Also on Tuesday, an appeals court in Louisiana issued an order blocking the administration from deporting alleged Venezuelan gang members using the Alien Enemies Act of 1798.",
      "Trump invoked the rarely used wartime power in an executive order in March to deport alleged members of Venezuela\u2019s Tren de Aragua (TdA) gang, an organization he said was \"perpetrating, attempting, and threatening an invasion or predatory incursion against the territory of the United States.\"",
      "The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which had been tasked with reviewing the issue by the Supreme Court, found the government had not shown there was a warlike invasion going on.",
      "\u201cOur analysis leads us to GRANT a preliminary injunction to prevent removal because we find no invasion or predatory incursion,\u201d the panel\u2019s majority wrote.",
      "The judges also noted that TdA has been designated as a foreign terrorist organization and  \"there are other provisions that would allow the Government to promptly remove precisely those individuals whom it seeks to remove under the President\u2019s Proclamation.\"",
      "Jackson, the White House spokesperson, in a statement following the ruling, defended the president's actions and said administration officials \"expect to be vindicated.\"",
      "\u201cThe authority to conduct national security operations in defense of the United States and to remove terrorists from the United States rests solely with the President,\" she said. \"President Trump exercised this lawful authority and employed the Alien Enemies Act to remove enemies of the United States, including vicious TdA gang members, from the country.\"",
      "Trump takes tariff fight to the Supreme Court",
      "The ruling the president has expressed the most concern about was handed down on Aug. 29, when the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit found he had exceeded his authority when he imposed tariffs using an emergency powers statute.",
      "\u201cTariffs are a core Congressional power,\u201d it said, upholding a lower court's finding that Trump's orders are \u201cinvalid as contrary to law.\u201d",
      "The ruling affects two sets of tariffs Trump has sought to impose, but not others imposed under other laws.",
      "The tariffs are still in effect and will remain in place until at least Oct. 14 to give the government time for further appeals.",
      "The administration asked the Supreme Court to hear the case in an emergency filing on Wednesday.",
      "\u201cSwift review of that decision is necessary to avoid derailing critical ongoing negotiations with our foreign trading partners and threatening broader U.S. strategic interests internationally,\u201d Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent wrote in a declaration supporting the appeal."

    "story": [
      "Showrunner, a technology platform that dubs itself the \u201cNetflix of AI,\u201d plans to use artificial intelligence to reconstruct 43 minutes of excised footage from Orson Welles\u2019 \u201cThe Magnificent Ambersons,\u201d a sweeping family drama that was famously butchered by studio executives.",
      "Edward Saatchi, CEO of the Amazon-backed firm Showrunner, confirmed the plans in an interview with CNBC on Friday morning. Saatchi described \u201cThe Magnificent Ambersons\u201d as a \u201cruined masterpiece,\u201d adding that \u201cusing AI to reconstruct it\u201d is a way to bring the film \u201cback to life.\u201d",
      "The plans come as generative artificial intelligence tools threaten to dramatically upend the way films and television shows are typically made, sending waves of anxiety through Hollywood and other creative industries.",
      "\u201cAmbersons\u201d would not be the first celluloid classic to get the AI treatment. In recent weeks, an AI-altered version of \u201cThe Wizard of Oz\u201d on display at the orb-shaped Sphere venue in Las Vegas has stoked both curiosity and revulsion \u2014 especially from filmworld purists.",
      "\u201cI think that what\u2019s coming is a world where we\u2019re not the only creative species, and that we will enjoy entertainment created by AIs,\u201d Saatchi told the hosts of CNBC\u2019s \u201cSquawk Box.\u201d \u201cWe wanted to try our AI on the greatest storyteller of the last 200 years: Orson Welles.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe Magnificent Ambersons\u201d was released in July 1942 after a pitched battle between Welles and executives at RKO Pictures. Welles \u2014 who enjoyed \u201cfinal cut\u201d privilege on his previous project, the revolutionary \u201cCitizen Kane\u201d \u2014 got kicked out of the editing room during the post-production of \u201cAmbersons.\u201d",
      "The studio snipped off an hour of footage, slapped on a more cheerful ending and released a slight 88-minute cut into theaters. \u201cAmbersons\u201d drew largely positive reviews and nabbed a best picture nomination at the Academy Awards, but Welles long insisted the theatrical edition did not fulfill his creative vision.",
      "\u201cThey destroyed \u2018Ambersons,\u2019 and it destroyed me,\u201d Welles was once quoted as saying. Welles\u2019 original, more melancholy 132-minute cut took on mythic stature among cinephiles. The late director William Friedkin (\u201cThe Exorcist\u201d), for example, referred to Welles\u2019 intended version as the \u201cHoly Grail of cinema.\u201d",
      "\u201cAmbersons,\u201d adapted from a Pulitzer Prize-winning novel of the same name by Booth Tarkington, coincidentally centers on another period of immense technological change in America. It chronicles the declining fortunes of an affluent Midwestern family amid the arrival of the country\u2019s automotive boom.",
      "Showrunner is working on the AI-enabled \u201cAmbersons\u201d with Brian Rose, a filmmaker who has spent half a decade digitally rebuilding sets based on some 30,000 missing frames from \u201cAmbersons.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere was, for example, a four-minute-long, unbroken moving camera shot whose loss is a tragedy,\u201d Rose said in a statement to The Hollywood Reporter. \u201cThe camera moves from one end of a ballroom and then back up the other end [while] you have about a dozen different characters walk in and out of frame, and crisscrossing subplots.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt was really ahead of its time,\u201d Rose added. \u201cYet all but about the last 50 seconds of the shot was cut.\u201d",
      "In response to Showrunner\u2019s announcement, some X users expressed skepticism or outright hostility.",
      "\u201cCan\u2019t wait to see what Joseph Cotten looks like with six fingers!\u201d film critic Sean Burns posted on X, referring to the star of \u201cAmbersons\u201d and a common AI glitch that inserts extra hands or limbs into images of human beings.",
      "Showrunner\u2019s edition of \u201cAmbersons\u201d is a \u201cstrictly academic noncommercial project\u201d because the company does not hold the rights, Saatchi told NBC News in an email. The rights are held by the media conglomerate Warner Bros. Discovery, which controls the RKO library.",
      "Welles, who died in 1985 at age 70, left behind a variety of unrealized or incomplete projects \u2014 including \u201cThe Other Side of the Wind,\u201d an experimental Hollywood satire that was largely shot in the early 1970s and completed in the 2010s. Netflix distributed the restored film in 2018."

In the new documentary \u201cJohn Candy: I Like Me,\u201d he recalls how Candy was among the first to sense that something was off about his dad\u2019s behavior, a dynamic that only worsened after the box-office success of \u201cHome Alone\u201d the following year.",
      "\u201cI think he always had that really great instinct. I think he saw. Listen, even before the wave crested and the 'Home Alone' stuff was happening, it was hard not to see how difficult my father was. It was no secret,\u201d Culkin, 45, revealed in the film. \u201cAll of a sudden, the fame and the money came, and he became an infamous monster. He was already not a good guy.\u201d",
      "Culkin remembered Candy looking out for him, giving off what he described as \u201cpaternal\u201d vibes: \u201cI think John was looking a little side-eyed, like, \u2018Is everything alright? You doing good? Good day? Everything\u2019s alright? Everything\u2019s good at home?\u201d",
      "For Culkin, the fact that there was an adult looking out for him meant a great deal and left a lasting impression.",
      "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t happen that often. It actually happened less as time went on,\u201d Culkin shared. \u201cI wish I got more of that in my life. It\u2019s important that I remember that. I remember John caring when not a lot of people did.\u201d",
      "Candy was married to his wife, a ceramist and abstract painter, Rosemary Margaret Hobor, for 15 years. Together, they had two children, Chris and Jennifer",
      "\u201cHe was the best dad,\u201d Jennifer told TODAY.com in 2024. \u201cHe\u2019d say, \u2018Don\u2019t worry what people think about you. Just be your authentic self.\u2019\u201d"

      "The four-time Emmy-nominated actor and director has appeared in dozens of TV shows and movies; fronts his own alternative rock band; hosts a podcast; and has had seven books published, including his latest effort, \u201cAbout Time,\u201d a book of Duchovny\u2019s collected poetry.",
      "\u201cIt was a way for me ... to try and talk about things that felt almost too deep for words, almost like journaling, but before we journaled,\u201d Duchovny tells Savannah Guthrie and Willie Geist during a recent appearance on Jenna & Friends.",
      "Despite being his first published book in the genre, \u201cThe X-Files\u201d star says he\u2019s been writing poetry since he was a teen. He eventually parlayed that love of prose into an English literature degree from Princeton University, as well as earning a master's from Yale University. In the process, Duchovny picked up an honorable mention nod from the Academy of American Poets for his work.",
      "\u201cThey sent me a plaque,\u201d Duchovny tells TODAY.com during a sit-down interview. \u201cBut, oddly, as I was getting up early yesterday morning to come from LA to (New York) and was reaching around in the dark for things that I needed, I knocked over this plaque and I broke it.\u201d",
      "\u201cSo, I thought, \u2018Is this a good omen or bad omen?\u2019 We don\u2019t know,\u201d Duchovny says with a laugh.",
      "Either way, \u201cAbout Time\u201d is a catharsis of sorts for the actor who says he\u2019s always looking for new means of \u201cservicing the inspiration,\u201d which he says he\u2019s fortunate to have plenty of.",
      "\u201cWhy I find myself doing many different things, I think, is because I\u2019m constantly trying to express something, and I\u2019m looking for the best vessel to do that in,\u201d Duchovny says about deciding on which outlet works best for channeling his feelings and ideas.",
      "\u201cIt usually starts in language, and that leads into acting, directing, poetry, fiction, writing,\u201d he explains. \u201cSo, it\u2019s really just finding different ways because the form is going to influence the expression. And I find that to be interesting.\u201d",
      "\u2018Life Is a Game\u2019",
      "At 65, Duchovny is celebrating his recent marriage to longtime girlfriend Monique Pendleberry. Prior to Pendleberry, he was married for nearly two decades to T\u00e9a Leoni, with whom he shares two children: West, 26, and Kyd, 23.",
      "When asked what he hopes he\u2019s imparted on his children, Duchovny ponders for a moment before answering, \u201cI think to take away the sense that life is just game, it doesn\u2019t mean anything.\u201d",
      "Not that life is trivial, he clarifies, but rather he hopes his kids take things seriously \u2014 but not too seriously.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a sense in which you want your kids to find their passion,\u201d says Duchovny, who explains that having passion is good, unless it prevents you from keeping an open mind to other possibilities.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m always saying, that\u2019s not the world. There\u2019s many different worlds. But, yes, find the thing that turns you on. So, I\u2019m giving them very bad advice, I\u2019m giving contradictory advice.\u201d",
      "It makes no sense to try and relive, relitigate or redo because you can\u2019t.",
      "David Duchovny",
      "In reflecting on his own life, would he do anything differently if he could go back and do it all again?",
      "\u201cWell, I can\u2019t,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd it makes no sense to try and relive, relitigate or redo because you can\u2019t.\u201d",
      "Instead, he prefers to focus on the philosophy behind failure, the subject of his popular podcast, \u201cFail Better,\u201d which he launched in 2024.",
      "In the Q&A podcast, Duchovny interviews newsmakers like Bette Midler, Ben Stiller and Amanda Knox about how perceived failure can actually be the catalyst for opportunity and personal growth.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t know when we\u2019re on the right road. Most of the time, we just know we\u2019re on some kind of road and we have some kind of goal,\u201d he says about the concepts of success and failure.",
      "\u201cFailure towards an imperfect goal or a wrong goal or whatever you think you\u2019re going or doing can be a good thing. So, failure and success are really, at this point, I don\u2019t see them as meaningful. They\u2019re just snapshots in time. What could be a success is actually a failure waiting to happen and vice versa.\u201d",
      "On \u2018The X-Files\u2019: \u2018They Really Had a Crystal Ball\u2019",
      "On the subject of success, one of Duchovny\u2019s notable accomplishments is his turn as FBI agent Fox Mulder on the hit show \u201cThe X-Files.\u201d The sci-fi program, which originally ran from 1993-2002 before reboots in 2016 and 2018, launched his career and made the actor a household name.",
      "Through the decades, he\u2019s left and returned to the franchise, as well as appeared in the series\u2019 two feature films, \u201cThe X-Files\u201d and \u201cThe X-Files: I Want to Believe,\u201d released in 1998 and 2008, respectively.",
      "Known for its spooky UFO and paranormal themes, was there ever an episode that left Duchovny feeling particularly unsettled?",
      "\u201cSometimes I think back, and I said this to (series creator) Chris Carter, 'I think you really were kind of Nostradamus in a way. You really saw a lot of what\u2019s going on, a lot of the conspiratorial thinking and stuff like that happen.' So, it\u2019s not really one episode, but I\u2019m just kind of amazed at that writers room, which included Vince Gilligan, Jim Wong, Darin Morgan, Glen Morgan, Howard Gordon. This was a heavy-hitting writers room, and they really had a crystal ball.\u201d",
      "\u2018I\u2019m Not Content Ever\u2019",
      "In addition to his latest book, Duchovny says he\u2019s also just wrapped a new album, though he\u2019s not sure when it\u2019ll be released.",
      "It\u2019s the fourth for the actor-musician whose other albums include his 2015 debut, \u201cHell or Highwater,\u201d \u201cEvery Third Thought,\u201d released in 2018, as well as the 2021 album \u201cGestureland.\u201d",
      "With so many projects on his plate, it begs the question: Does Duchovny have unfinished business?",
      "\u201cNo,\u201d he says without hesitating. \u201cNo. There\u2019s just more business.\u201d",
      "Even so, it doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s static.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not content ever. It\u2019s good to have a new thing to do or to have a new project because they all have different hurdles. They all have different problems to solve. And that\u2019s when you get creative is when you\u2019re solving problems.\u201d"

This time, we\u2019re different,\u201d Todd Chrisley tells TODAY.com. \u201cWe\u2019ve gone through a lot, and I don\u2019t think that you can go through what we\u2019ve gone through and come back and be the same \u2014 and if you do, you probably should go back.\u201d",

      "Convicted on federal fraud charges in 2022, Todd Chrisley was originally sentenced to 12 years in prison, with Julie Chrisley receiving a seven-year sentence, according to the U.S. attorney\u2019s office.

      "\u201cBut there was a level of like, OK, he\u2019s not suffering anymore. He\u2019s not struggling.\u201d Jack said, adding that although his dad Ozzy was having \u201ca rough go,\" he never imagined it would happen so suddenly, and \"no one expected it to happen as quickly as it did.\"",
      "Ozzy, one of heavy metal\u2019s pioneering figures, passed away from a heart attack on July 22 at the age of 76 in England. According to The New York Times and The Sun, his death certificate also listed cardiac arrest, coronary artery disease, and Parkinson\u2019s disease as contributing factors.",

      "Jack expressed his gratitude for the precious moments he shared with Ozzy during his final weeks. After traveling to England for Ozzy\u2019s last performance with Black Sabbath, Jack, his wife and their children had planned a vacation to Portugal. But when a stomach bug struck, they canceled the trip \u2014 a turn of events Jack sees as fate, giving them a little more time with Ozzy.",
      "\u201cIt was awesome. It was sunny. My dad was in an amazing mood. He was really happy every day,\u201d Jack said, noting that Ozzy loved opening the newspaper and reading reviews and stories about his \u201cBack to the Beginning\u201d farewell charity concert on July 5.",

    "summary": "If a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine ever comes together, the U.S. could take the lead role in monitoring a large buffer zone inside Ukraine.",
    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 If a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine ever comes together, the United States could take the lead role in monitoring a large buffer zone inside Ukraine envisioned as a way to protect the country from Russia, according to four people familiar with a plan that military officials from Ukraine\u2019s allies, including the United States, have been discussing.",
      "The buffer zone would be a large demilitarized area \u2014 the borders of which have not yet been decided \u2014 inside what is now Ukraine, dividing Russian and Ukrainian territory within the country. In part because of its technological capabilities, the United States would take the lead in watching the buffer zone, using drones and satellites along with other intelligence capabilities, but it would coordinate with other countries that would also monitor.",
      "The zone could then be secured by troops from one or more non-NATO countries, like Saudi Arabia or even Bangladesh, according to the people familiar with the plan. No U.S. troops would be deployed inside Ukraine, they said. Politico previously reported the general idea of a buffer zone.",
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin would have to agree to any plan for security guarantees for Ukraine, and NATO involvement or even the suggestion of it is a major issue for him, so the planners are taking pains to avoid using NATO forces or anything resembling NATO branding, some of the people familiar with the plan said.",
      "Instead, some of the guarantees would be likely to rely on the troops from non-NATO countries and on a patchwork of bilateral agreements among Ukraine and its allies that would give Ukraine security assurances without involving NATO\u2019s Article V \u2014 an attack on one means an attack on all \u2014 which amounts to a red line for Moscow.",
      "Any plan is only tentative until Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy agree to one, in addition to the leaders of the countries that would be involved in the security guarantees, including President Donald Trump.",
      "This one has been developed in the wake of Trump\u2019s meeting with Putin in Alaska on Aug. 15. That meeting was initially expected to lead to further talks, possibly direct discussions between Putin and Zelenskyy, but progress toward a peace deal has stalled since then. Still, Ukraine\u2019s allies have gone ahead with their work on the potential security guarantees, which would most likely be key to peace.",
      "On Thursday, members of the group of allies, which is informally known as the \u201ccoalition of the willing,\u201d met to potentially formalize aspects of the plan. The meeting was led by France and the United Kingdom, which are also expected to head up the overall effort to provide Ukraine with security after the war\u2019s end.",
      "Zelenskyy wrote on X after the meeting: \u201cWe discussed in detail each country\u2019s readiness to make a contribution to ensuring security on land, at sea, in the air, and in cyberspace. We coordinated positions and reviewed elements of security guarantees.\u201d",
      "On Friday, though, Putin rejected the idea of troops from other countries playing any role, saying, \u201cAs for possible military contingents in Ukraine \u2014 this is one of the primary reasons for drawing Ukraine into NATO. ...  And if decisions are reached that will lead to peace, to a long-term peace, then I simply do not see any sense in their presence on the territory of Ukraine. That\u2019s all. Because if these agreements are reached, let no one doubt that Russia will implement them in full. And we will respect those security guarantees that, of course, must be developed for both Russia and Ukraine. And, I repeat once again, of course, Russia will fulfill the agreement.\u201d",
      "Putin's stance is one of many challenges involved as planning moves forward. There are also tough decisions to be made about what kind of Russian incursions would trigger a response from either Ukraine or the monitoring forces and what kind of response would be allowed. one of the sources said. This person said that the rules of engagement still need to be worked out and that they are likely to be contested during any disagreements after a deal and the buffer are in place.",
      "Along with the buffer zone, it would also be important to guarantee that Russia could not choke off Ukraine\u2019s economy. To that point, Turkey would be responsible for ensuring the unimpeded flow of goods and services on the Black Sea by conducting maritime surveillance of and enforcement in the Bosporus and Dardanelles straits. Shortly after Russia invaded Ukraine, Turkey played a part in securing the maritime corridor that was established to get grain out of Ukraine.",
      "At the Pentagon, talks are being led by Air Force Gen. Dan Caine, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, with a broader discussion also centered on deterrence, training and defense industrial cooperation. On the latter front, the United States is discussing with Ukraine a deal that could be worth around $100 billion, under which Kyiv would be able to buy American weapons, while in exchange the United States would get intellectual property rights for the cutting-edge systems the Ukrainians have been developing, according to a U.S. official.",
      "The week after Trump met with Putin, Caine briefed Trump on four options for the security guarantee and recommended the most forward-leaning approach, this official said.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt did not address the contours of the plan in a statement to NBC News.",
      "\u201cPresident Trump is the decision maker,\u201d she wrote. \u201cOut of respect for ongoing diplomatic negotiations, the White House is not going to get ahead of him on these important matters.\u201d",
      "She added: \u201cAnyone anonymously claiming to know what he will or will not support doesn\u2019t know what they are talking about.\u201d",
      "The people familiar with the plan who spoke with NBC News did not say Trump had endorsed or ruled out any of the options."

And it is on that platform that both the United States and Israel are built and that puts us in a very, very special relationship.\u201d",
      "Huckabee\u2019s strong ties to Israel were forged during more than 100 visits to the country before his appointment and are grounded in a belief that God commanded Jewish sovereignty over their biblical homeland.",
      "His ambassadorship could end up being deeply consequential. Not only was it a win for the evangelical Christian community, a vital part of Trump\u2019s base, but it was also a boon to Israel\u2019s far-right government as it faces unprecedented criticism for its war in the Gaza Strip. His stances in just over six months in Israel have hewn closely to the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s, even as Trump expresses occasional unease with the close U.S. ally\u2019s conduct.",
      "In July, images of badly emaciated children in Gaza prompted Trump to acknowledge \u201creal starvation\u201d in the enclave \u2014 a break with Netanyahu, who maintained there was no starvation.",
      "The following month, on Aug. 22, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, the world\u2019s leading body on hunger, officially declared famine in part of northern Gaza, including Gaza City. For months before that announcement, international humanitarian organizations had warned that the trickle of aid Israel had allowed into the enclave wasn\u2019t nearly enough to feed its population of 2.1 million."

      "For centuries, an iconic winged lion has perched above Venice, a symbol of the \u201cFloating City\u201d that millions of tourists have passed under in St. Mark\u2019s Square.",
      "But scientists now believe that this ancient emblem of the Italian city may in fact have origins a world away.",
      "A study released Thursday found evidence that the statue may have been partially made in China and arrived in northern Italy after a long journey across the medieval Silk Road that may have involved the father of the explorer Marco Polo and the court of the Mongol emperor Kublai Khan.",
      "Historical documents confirm the statue was in Venice by the late 13th century, but its history before that remains murky.",
      "How the lion made its way to Venice \u2014 an economic powerhouse in the medieval world owing to its strategic position close to Europe and the Byzantine Empire \u2014 has long been a mystery.",
      "It was assumed by experts that the statue may have come from ancient Persia or Syria.",
      "By studying copper isotopes taken from samples of the statue, scientists were able to identify that the metal originated from the Yangtze River in eastern-central China, more than 8,000 miles away from where it now stands.",
      "Their findings were published in the archeology journal Antiquity.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a rather extraordinary discovery,\u201d Hannah Skoda, associate professor of medieval history at the University of Oxford, told NBC News.",
      "\u201cAt the same time it is indicative of the sheer extent and intensity of global trading networks, even in this really early period,\u201d which would have made the long journey from China to Italy via the Silk Road possible all those centuries ago,\" Skoda, who was not involved in the study, said in a phone interview.",
      "The study\u2019s conclusion \u201cis striking \u2014 though perhaps not quite as improbable as it might sound,\u201d said Peter Frankopan, professor of global history at Oxford and author of \u201cThe Silk Roads: A New History of the World.\u201d",
      "\u201cDiscoveries like this are not unusual once you start to look carefully at the materials, the motifs and the methods that shaped the cities we think we know,\u201d he said by email.",
      "The statue may not even be a lion at all, the study suggests.",
      "Researchers argue that the figure closely mirrors tomb guardians from the Tang dynasty, which ruled from the 6th to 9th centuries during China\u2019s golden age. These ancient sculptures were known as \u201czhenmushou\u201d and share similar features with the Venice statue such as the position of the ears and the distinctive \u201cbulbous nose,\u201d according to the study.",
      "There are no written records telling us where the statue that now looks down from a Piazzetta column in St. Mark\u2019s came from. The only historical document mentioning it dates to 1293, and researchers have long presumed that the statue had a rich history before it made its way to Venice.",
      "Scientists still don\u2019t have a firm grasp on how exactly the statue traversed such great distances across multiple continents all those years ago. However, the study suggests that Niccolo and Maffeo Polo, Marco Polo\u2019s father and uncle, might have discovered the original statue in the 13th century while visiting the court of Kublai Khan in what is now Beijing.",
      "As traveling merchants, they would have then transported the statue back to their home city of Venice along the famed Silk Road.",
      "Pointing to the fact that the city had not long ago adopted the lion as its emblem, the study suggested that the Polo brothers may have seen a Chinese figure and had the \u201cbrazen idea of readapting the sculpture into a plausible (when viewed from afar) Winged Lion.\u201d",
      "While not enough evidence exists to be sure of this rumored route, experts say the statue\u2019s eastern origins underscore Venice\u2019s longstanding global prowess.",
      "As with so many great trading centers in history, Frankopan said, \u201cthe city\u2019s capacity to absorb and adapt outside influences \u2014 from Byzantine mosaics to Egyptian porphyry \u2026 is what gave it dynamism and resilience.\u201d",
      "In such a global city, he adds, \u201ca Tang dynasty lion fits right in.\u201d"

      "HONG KONG \u2014 What do autocratic leaders talk about when they get together? Maybe how to live forever.",
      "The exchange between Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin was caught on a hot mic Wednesday as the duo and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, in their first joint public appearance, led a delegation of 27 world leaders attending a massive military parade in Beijing.",
      "State-run broadcaster CCTV was livestreaming the event, which marked the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II, and providing the feed to other media organizations.",
      "As they ascended the rostrum at Tiananmen Square to watch the parade, Putin and Xi, who are both 72, appeared to be discussing the world\u2019s strides in life expectancy.",
      "While it used to be rare for people to reach age 70, \u201cnow they say that at 70 you are only a child,\u201d a translator for Xi can be heard telling Putin in Russian.",
      "With advances in biotechnology, people will be able to \u201ctransplant human organs continuously, grow younger with age and perhaps even achieve immortality,\u201d Putin\u2019s translator responds in Mandarin.",
      "Xi, who at that point was off-camera, can then be heard saying, \u201cSome have predicted that by the end of this century, humans could potentially live up to 150 years.\u201d",
      "It was unclear whether the conversation was also being translated for Kim, believed to be 41, who was smiling and looking toward the older leaders.",
      "Though they may have just been making conversation, the exchange holds extra weight because both Putin and Xi have indicated an interest in staying in office as long as possible.",
      "Xi, who has been president since 2013, was awarded a rare third term in 2023 after he removed the two-term limit from the constitution five years earlier, breaking with China\u2019s long-standing tradition of changing leaders every decade. In another departure from historical practice, he has not given any sign of who his successor might be.",
      "Putin, who has been president or prime minister of Russia since 2000, won a controversial referendum in 2020 that amended the constitution to allow him to potentially stay in power until 2036. At that point, he would be 83 and Russia\u2019s longest-serving ruler since Peter the Great.",
      "Putin is known for his long-standing interest in longevity, and last year Russian lawmakers established an anti-aging research center called \u201cNew Health Preservation Technologies\u201d after Putin said the nation should focus on preserving the health of its citizens.",
      "Though Xi does not appear to have the same fixation, Chinese leaders tend to enjoy long lives, with Deng Xiaoping living until 92 and his successor, Jiang Zemin, making it to 96.",
      "Organ transplants are a sensitive subject in China, where rights groups say organs may still be harvested from executed prisoners even after the government pledged to end the controversial practice in 2014. China has long struggled with a shortage of donated organs because of cultural taboos, and in 2023 the government issued new rules tightening regulation and promoting public awareness.",
      "There was little discussion of the two leaders\u2019 impromptu exchange on Chinese social media, which is heavily censored.",
      "Putin confirmed the conversation with Xi when reporters asked about it later Wednesday, saying, \u201cOh, I believe the chairman talked about it when we were going to the parade.\u201d",
      "\u201cModern means, both health improvement, and medical means and even all kinds of surgical ones related to organ replacement, allow humanity to hope that active life will continue not as it does today,\u201d he said.",
      "He also appeared to refer to United Nations estimates that by 2050 there will be more than twice as many people over 60 as children under 5.",
      "\u201cThis will have social, political and economic consequences,\u201d he said. \u201cWe should certainly think about this, too, when we talk about life expectancy.\u201d"

Jacques Goudstikker, a Jewish art dealer, died in 1940 while fleeing the Nazis,\u201d the Cultural Heritage Agency of the Netherlands told NBC News in a written statement.",
      "The painting resurfaced last month after it was spotted on a real estate website, hanging above a velvet sofa in a virtual tour of a property for sale in the coastal town of Mar del Plata, about 160 miles south of Argentina's capital, Buenos Aires.",
      "On Wednesday, the portrait of the countess, in a flower-embroidered dress and in a golden frame, was sitting in a nearby federal prosecutor\u2019s office.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re doing this simply so that the community to whom we partly owe the discovery of the work ... can see these images,\u201d the prosecutor, Daniel Adler, said, according to The Associated Press. \u201cIt was people from the community, specifically journalists, who prompted the investigation,\u201d he added.",
      "A group of Dutch journalists made the discovery as they investigated Friedrich Kadgien, a high-ranking official under Adolf Hitler, who fled Germany\u2019s Third Reich and went into hiding in Argentina.",
      "Under the government of three-time President Juan Domingo Per\u00f3n, fugitive German fascists brought plundered Jewish property with them, including gold, bank deposits, paintings, sculptures and furnishings.",
      "News of the portrait\u2019s find first appeared in the Dutch newspaper Algemeen Dagblad (AD), and was part of a nearly decadelong project by investigative journalists Cyril Roseman and Peter Schouten, as well as researcher Paul Post. NBC News reached out to the journalists who declined to comment.",
      "After coming across the image of the painting, the journalists contacted Friedrich Kadgien's daughter, Patricia Kadgien, but did not receive a response for weeks, according to their report in AD.",
      "The image of the painting was soon replaced with an image of a tapestry, and an initial raid by Argentinian authorities on the family home did not find the artwork.",
      "But prosecutors carried out four raids at different locations that belonged to the Kadgien family this week and both Patricia Kadgien and her husband, Juan Carlos Cortegoso, were placed under house arrest, pending a formal hearing Thursday on charges of concealment and obstruction of justice.",
      "Adler, the prosecutor, told reporters that the couple\u2019s lawyer had handed over the painting to authorities Wednesday. He did not specify where the portrait would go next.",
      "\u201cMy search for the artwork of my father-in-law, Jacques Goudstikker, began in the late 1990s and I have not given up to this day,\u201d Goudstikker\u2019s daughter-in-law Marei von Saher told AD. \u201cIt is my family\u2019s goal to recover every artwork stolen from the Goudstikker collection and to restore Jacques\u2019 legacy.\u201d"

      "Andrew Neil Hopper, a 49-year-old vascular surgeon at the Royal Cornwall Hospital, pleaded guilty to two counts of fraud by false representation and three counts of possession of extreme pornographic images, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said.",
      "He was sentenced to 32 months in prison by a Truro Crown Court  judge and remanded into custody.",
      "Hopper \"fraudulently claimed over \u00a3466,000 (about $630,000) in insurance payouts\" after \"he claimed the injuries to his limbs were the result of sepsis,\" prosecutors said.",

      "The \u201cVictory Day\u201d parade, which commemorated the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II, was the first time Xi, Kim and Russian President Vladimir Putin had been seen in public together.",

      "But relations between North Korea and China, its neighbor and biggest trading partner, have been strained by Kim\u2019s support for Putin\u2019s war against Ukraine.",

    "story": [
      "With the United States seemingly content to take a back seat, a high-level meeting in Paris on Thursday will seek to answer the question: Can European powers step up and bring Ukraine and Russia closer to peace?",
      "An actual halt in fighting seems an increasingly distant ambition, with President Donald Trump \u2014 who called into the meeting \u2014 having said that he remained hopeful but that the two sides were clearly \u201cnot ready yet\u201d to make a deal.",
      "\u201cTrump emphasized that Europe must stop purchasing Russian oil that is funding the war,\" a White House official told NBC News on Thursday after Trump spoke to European leaders. The official added that he also told the leaders they had to \u201cplace economic pressure on China for funding Russia\u2019s war efforts.\u201d",
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin said Wednesday during a visit to Beijing that he will end the war by force if Ukraine does not agree to his demands. He suggested he would meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, but only in Moscow.",
      "With Trump adopting a lesser role after his peace push stalled, European powers hope to plug the diplomatic gap.",
      "They met in Paris early Thursday as part of the informal \u201cCoalition of the Willing\u201d \u2014 nations that say they are prepared to underwrite the \u201csecurity guarantees\u201d Ukraine says it needs to be confident any future ceasefire would hold.",
      "Hosting the talks, French President Emmanuel Macron said Wednesday that after months of planning, \u201cwe are ready as Europeans to offer security guarantees to Ukraine and the Ukrainian people the day a peace deal is signed.\u201d He declined to offer details, saying they were \u201cextremely confidential.\u201d",
      "The meeting included Zelenskyy, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte.",
      "During the meeting, Starmer \u201cemphasized that the group had an unbreakable pledge to Ukraine, with President Trump\u2019s backing, and it was clear they now needed to go even further to apply pressure on Putin to secure a cessation of hostilities,\u201d his office said afterward.",
      "Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez was due to attend, but a technical problem forced his plane to turn around, meaning he will join the summit virtually.",
      "After the meeting, the leaders held a 90-minute phone call with Trump, who has said that he is willing to offer American support as a \u201cbackstop\u201d but that the initiative must be led by the Europeans.",
      "Macron said after the meeting that 26 countries, which he did not name, had agreed to send troops to Ukraine after the war ends.",
      "\u201cWe have today 26 countries that have formally committed \u2014 with several others to clarify their position \u2014 but 26 countries committed to deploy as a reassurance force troops in Ukraine or to be present on the ground, at sea, in air, in order to bring this reassurance to the Ukrainian territory and to Ukraine the day after a ceasefire or peace,\" he said, adding that if Russia refuses peace talks, then additional sanctions would be coordinated with the United States.",
      "Andrii Yermak, Zelenskyy's powerful chief of staff, said Thursday that he had met with Trump's envoy, Steve Witkoff, in Paris.",
      "The security guarantees \"must be strong and effective\u2014in the air, at sea, and on land,\" he said in a statement. \"The war launched by Russia must be stopped. President Trump\u2019s principle of \u2018peace through strength\u2019 is exactly the kind of approach that can influence the aggressor.\"",
      "For Trump, the war is proving harder to resolve than his onetime claim that he would be able to fix the situation in 24 hours. He has increasingly expressed disappointment and even anger toward Putin but has repeatedly stopped short of imposing new sanctions against Moscow despite numerous threats.",
      "After his push for a meeting between Putin and Zelenskyy appeared to have fallen apart, Trump conceded Wednesday that there was still a chasm between the two leaders.",
      "\u201cSomething is going to happen, but they are not ready yet. But something is going to happen. We are going to get it done,\u201d Trump said in a phone interview with CBS News.",
      "Since the Kremlin's full-scale invasion in February 2022, Ukraine has been bombed nightly by Russian missiles and drones and repeatedly said it is ready to call a ceasefire. Russia has rejected that, maintaining it will not do so until Ukraine has fulfilled a set of demands that resemble surrender.",
      "However, Kyiv is still deeply wary of a ceasefire, warning Russia could use it to rearm, regroup and launch other attacks on Ukraine and neighboring countries in Europe.",
      "That\u2019s why it and other European powers say the much-vaunted but knotty \u201csecurity guarantees\u201d are essential. They could come in the form of European peacekeeper troops being stationed in Ukraine to uphold the ceasefire, although Russia has summarily rejected that idea so far.",
      "During his high-profile visit to China on Wednesday, Putin gave no signal of shifting from his absolutist demands that Ukraine must surrender and come back into Moscow\u2019s sphere of influence.",
      "He believes he is winning this conflict, throwing thousands of troops' lives into his war machine each week for grinding battlefield gains.",
      "Putin did say that \u201cif common sense prevails, then it is possible to agree on an acceptable option for ending this conflict,\u201d adding that Trump\u2019s \u201csincere desire to find this solution\u201d meant there is \u201ca certain light at the end of the tunnel.\u201d",
      "However, he said, if Ukraine did not accept its demands, \u201cthen we will have to solve all our tasks by force.\u201d"

      "The U.S.\u2019s offensive posture in the region is raising questions about its ultimate goal \u2014 and how U.S. intelligence agencies were so certain that the boat contained drugs and members of the notorious Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua.",
      "\u201cWe have tapes of them speaking,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt was massive amounts of drugs coming into our country to kill a lot of people.\u201d",
      "Though the president\u2019s specific intentions regarding Maduro are unclear, the U.S. seems to have two objectives: stemming the flow of illegal drugs from Venezuela and placing debilitating pressure on the Venezuelan leader.",
      "The goal is to force Maduro to make rash decisions that could ultimately lead to his ouster \u2014 without American boots on the ground \u2014 according to a source familiar with the Trump administration\u2019s thinking.",
      "A second source familiar said that last week the administration privately signaled plans to intensify pressure on Venezuela, saying that the situation was about to quickly escalate and that Maduro \u201chad a lot to worry about.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s definitely going to be more to come\u201d with regard to hitting drug cartel operations, the source said.",
      "In 2019, during Trump\u2019s first term, his administration recognized Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3 as interim president while Maduro faced mass protests after years of hyperinflation and a string of blackouts. Despite the U.S. backing of Guaid\u00f3, Maduro held onto power.",
      "Last month, some members of the Venezuelan opposition movement visited the State Department for meetings with top officials, according to two people familiar with the talks.",
      "Rubio's role",

      "The source familiar with the administration\u2019s thinking believes regime change in Venezuela has been Rubio\u2019s goal. The administration is preparing for this by not recognizing Maduro as a legitimate president, accusing him of rigging elections and  alleging he\u2019s a narco-terrorist, the head of the Cartel de Los Soles. Several weeks ago, the U.S. doubled its reward for information leading to Maduro\u2019s arrest to $50 million.",
      "The source familiar with the administration\u2019s thinking said the U.S. hopes that ramping up pressure on Maduro may prompt finger-pointing inside Venezuela and lead cartel bosses inside and outside the country to blame Maduro and force him out. The source speculated that Russia \u2014 not wanting to get involved in a domestic power struggle \u2014 would pull its financial, diplomatic and military support from Venezuela, long considered its ally.",
      "Tuesday\u2019s military strike on the alleged drug smuggling boat, which Trump said killed 11 people and did not hurt U.S. forces, came as a surprise to many members of Congress.",
      "Democrats, even those in leadership positions on relevant oversight committees, have not been provided with any information about the strike, according to multiple congressional officials with direct knowledge of the situation. It\u2019s not clear what information, if any, Republicans were given before or after the strike.",
      "Rubio defended the strike on Wednesday while visiting Mexico, arguing that the typical interdiction procedures that the U.S. Coast Guard conducts to arrest drug smugglers didn\u2019t work in these cases.",
      "\u201cThese drug cartels, what they do is they know they\u2019re going to lose 2% of their cargo,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cThey bake it into their economics. What will stop them is when you blow them up.\u201d",
      "Additional U.S. military forces",
      "Last month, the U.S. began sending more military resources, including three guided-missile destroyers, to the southern Caribbean. Stephen Donehoo, a former military intelligence officer specializing in Latin America, told NBC News the deployment was enormous.",
      "\u201cI haven\u2019t seen this much U.S. naval military force in the Caribbean under the command of the Southern Command in decades,\u201d Donehoo said. \u201cAll these ships have intelligence systems, and they are also armed to carry out this type of attack if necessary.\u201d",
      "In the last few weeks, Maduro has claimed the U.S. military presence in the Caribbean is aimed at overthrowing his government. He has deployed troops along the border while calling on thousands of civilians to join armed militias to defend the nation.",
      "A senior White House official downplayed any possibility of the U.S. invading Venezuela, but said, \u201cYou can expect to see the president use any means necessary to tackle drug cartels.\u201d",

      "Maduro pushback",
      "For its part, the Maduro government has escalated its criticism of the White House, even claiming the video of Tuesday\u2019s attack on the alleged drug trafficking boat was created using AI.",
      "\u201cI can tell you that was definitely not artificial intelligence,\u201d Hegseth said in the Fox interview. \u201cI watched it live.\u201d",
      "In comments broadcast on Venezuelan state television Tuesday night, Maduro referred to what he considered Rubio\u2019s significant power within the Trump administration regarding Venezuela policy.",
      "\u201cThe youth of the United States do not believe the lies of the big shot in the White House, Marco Rubio,\" Maduro said. \"Because who runs the White House is Marco Rubio \u2014 the mafia of Miami \u2014 who wants to fill Donald Trump\u2019s hands with blood.\u201d",
      "More actions expected",
      "The Trump administration\u2019s strike against the cartel boat may only be the beginning of its actions in the region.",
      "In February, the State Department designated eight drug cartels and criminal organizations as foreign terrorist organizations and specially designated global terrorists. That gave the White House new legal authorities to take military action against such groups throughout the Western Hemisphere.",
      "Asked about the cartels in an interview last month, Rubio said it was time they were treated \u201cas armed terrorist organizations, not simply drug-dealing organizations.\u201d",
      "The secretary of state said the new designations would allow the Trump administration to target the cartel\u2019s operations using other elements of American power, including U.S. intelligence agencies and the Department of Defense.",
      "\u201cIt is a criminal enterprise \u2014 all the way to the various cartels that operate in Mexico, and in between,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cSo, what it changes is it gives us legal authorities to target them in ways you can\u2019t do if they\u2019re just a bunch of criminals. It\u2019s no longer a law enforcement issue. It becomes a national security issue.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration asked the Supreme Court on Wednesday to quickly decide whether he has the power to impose broad tariffs under a law designed for use during times of emergency.",
      "The Justice Department is appealing a ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit on Friday that President Donald Trump had exceeded his authority, the filings said.",
      "The filings, shared by the Justice Department and the challengers, have not yet been officially docketed by the Supreme Court.",

      "\u201cThese unlawful tariffs are inflicting serious harm on small businesses and jeopardizing their survival. We hope for a prompt resolution of this case for our clients,\u201d he added.",
      "The appeals court, divided 7-4, said the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which allows the president to regulate imports when there is a national emergency, does not give sweeping powers to impose global tariffs of unspecified duration.",
      "The tariffs are in effect and will remain in place until at least Oct. 14 under the appeals court ruling.",
      "The administration submitted two filings: an appeal and a motion to expedite.",
      "In the latter, Solicitor General D. John Sauer asked the justices to fast-track consideration of the case so oral arguments can be heard as soon as the first week of November. That would require the court to decide by next week whether to hear the case.",
      "The challengers have agreed to that timeline, a Liberty Justice Center spokesman said.",
      "The appeals court's \"erroneous decision has disrupted highly impactful, sensitive, ongoing diplomatic trade negotiations, and cast a pall of legal uncertainty over the President\u2019s efforts to protect our country by preventing an unprecedented economic and foreign-policy crisis,\" Sauer wrote.",
      "The filings included a declaration by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent citing the importance of a quick ruling.",
      "\"Swift review of that decision is necessary to avoid derailing critical ongoing negotiations with our foreign trading partners and threatening broader U.S. strategic interests internationally,\" he wrote.",
      "The high court has a 6-3 conservative majority, including three Trump appointees. Although it has frequently ruled in favor of Trump in the first few months of his term, some legal experts believe it may be more skeptical about his tariff powers.",
      "During the Biden administration, the court was skeptical of the White House\u2019s moves to seek broad powers via laws enacted by Congress that did not explicitly authorize them. In one significant example, the court, endorsing what has been dubbed the \"major questions doctrine,\" ruled against President Joe Biden's plan to forgive student loan debt.",
      "The case under appeal affects two sets of tariffs Trump has imposed. The first are the country-by-country or \u201creciprocal\u201d tariffs, which now range from 34% for China to a 10% baseline for the rest of the world. The second is a 25% tariff Trump imposed on some goods from Canada, China and Mexico for what the administration said was their failure to curb the flow of fentanyl.",
      "Other tariffs implemented under other laws, such as 50% steel and aluminum tariffs on all other worldwide trading partners, were implemented under other statutes not at issue in the case.",
      "Even if Trump loses at the Supreme Court, he has other avenues to impose additional tariffs.",
      "V.O.S. Selections Inc., a wine and spirits importer, and Plastic Services and Products, a pipe and fittings company, are among five businesses that sued Trump over his use of the emergency law. Twelve states also challenged the move.",
      "The Court of International Trade initially blocked the tariffs in late May, prompting the Trump administration to appeal.",
      "Trump has long sought to raise revenue by taxing imported goods, which he believes will revitalize manufacturing in the United States. While the tariffs are bringing in billions of dollars in revenue, economists say they are slowing U.S. economic growth, while inflation has also ticked up."
