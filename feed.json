Add in 10 other listed players (including herself) and that makes for 26 musicians on the album-ending song \u201cMatch-Lit\u201d alone.",
      "\u201cI wanted to remind people of what it sounded like to have a large group of people playing together,\u201d Case said. \u201cThat doesn't mean I have anything against synthesizer string sections or horn sections, because those things sound cool when you use them in the right way.

      "It wasn't writer's block that kept Case out of the picture for a few years. The pandemic was an interruption for everybody. The Vermont-based singer also records and tours with the band The New Pornographers. She has written the music for an upcoming stage adaptation of \u201cThelma & Louise.\u201d And she also wrote a memoir, \u201cThe Harder I Fight the More I Love You,\u201d published earlier this year.",

      "What will be interesting in coming months, as she prepares to take new songs on the road, is whether opening her life to the world with the memoir will draw more people to her music. Her management has seen preliminary signs that it has, but Case isn't sure.",
      "Colin Dickerman, editor-in-chief at Grand Central Publishing and editor of Case's book, has a hunch that it will. From reading reviews of the memoir, he knows it attracted fans who wanted to learn more about the writer of songs they loved. But it also reached people who were interested in the story about overcoming adversity and subsequently said they would check out her music.",

The group is peppered with members portrayed by musicians-turned-actors like Dijon Duenas, Alana Haim, and Shayna McHayle and notable actors like Regina Hall and Wood Harris.",

Together, Perfidia and Pat seem unstoppable, until the racist and xenophobic Col. Steven Lockjaw (Sean Penn) sets out end the group to fuel his rise to power.",
      "\u201cAnd this is a movie, fast-forward, in today\u2019s day and age, where you see this sort of systematic breakdown that comes from it, if it\u2019s not done with grace and purity and consistently, the whole sort of\u2014 our revolution is dismantled and our past comes back to haunt us,\u201d said DiCaprio. \u201cSo that\u2019s what I love that Paul did. He shows extremity on both sides of the spectrum and how no one seems to be communicating or getting things done in the right way nowadays.\u201d",
      "The film jumps 16 years into the future. Perfidia has disappeared and DiCaprio\u2019s character lives under a new alias in a sanctuary city as a paranoid, stoner dad with his teenage daughter, Willa (newcomer Chase Infiniti). Everything is seemingly mundane until Lockjaw reappears, forcing the father-daughter duo on the run.",

      "Brett Goldstein explores complex relationships in the new film \u201cAll of You,\u201d streaming on Apple TV+ Friday",
      "Brett Goldstein might want to break your heart. Or at least give you a proper ugly cry.",
      "In the new film \u201cAll of You,\u201dstreaming on Apple TV+ Friday, audiences are presented with a sticky conundrum: What if your soulmate, and your best friend, were different people?",
      "Reactions might differ about the choices Simon (Goldstein) and Laura (Imogen Poots) make in the film, which is a kind of rom-com-dram, if you will. But one thing Goldstein has noticed is that a lot of people who see it think that it\u2019s about them.",
      "\u201cI think everyone has this friendship,\u201d Goldstein said. \u201cThere\u2019s someone in their life that is not their partner that they have a connection that feels more than friends, but what is that? What is love? And does it take away from the other? We just wanted to explore all of that over time.\u201d",
      "The idea came out of a getting to know you conversation with William Bridges, an Emmy winner for \u201cBlack Mirror\u201d whose episodes include \u201cUSS Callister.\" He co-wrote the film with Goldstein, and directed. At the time of the chat, Goldstein was single. Bridges was not. And Goldstein asked him if the woman he was seeing was \u201cthe one.\u201d It got them thinking about the idea of a soulmate test, something that could just take all the guesswork, all the bad dates, all the lost time, out of the equation.",
      "\u201cAll of You\u201d begins with a moment of truth as Simon accompanies Laura, his best friend from university, on her way to take the test. He even pays for it, and soon enough she\u2019s off making plans with a husband to be.",
      "Though the film has a bit of a science fiction element to it, it\u2019s decidedly less dystopian than a \u201cBlack Mirror.\u201d Some, like Laura, take the test. Some, like Simon, try to do it the old-fashioned way. But many are left wondering if they made the right choice. The film is told linearly, but skips over months and sometimes years in the saga of Laura and Simon.",

      "\u201cI was really conflicted, but I also felt great compassion for each of the characters,\u201d Poots said. \u201cAll a person is the choices they make or don\u2019t make, and I think that feelings and desire and love, these are completely out of your control. And I don\u2019t think you can vilify a person for sort of having them. It\u2019s just when they follow through it obviously complicates things.\u201d",
      "Part of the equation involved making sure that Laura\u2019s soulmate, and husband, wasn\u2019t easy to dismiss. Not only did they write him as kind, loving and a good father. They also cast a handsome Scottish actor, Steven Cree, to play him.",
      "\u201cOne thing we didn\u2019t want to do that I think romantic comedies do a lot is they make the other guy boring or a (expletive)-head. So you\u2019re going, \u2018Oh, obviously not him,\u2019\u201d Goldstein said. \u201cYou have to kind of stack the odds against all of them because that is more real and it\u2019s much more challenging, I think, for an audience because I think you are going \u2018I want this thing to happen and I also don\u2019t want this thing to happen.\u2019\u201d",
      "\u201cWhen Harry Met Sally\u201d was a kind of unintentional touchstone in thinking about the idea of friendships between straight men and women that only became clear to them after they made the film. An even less intentional reference was \u201cAtonement.\u201d Unbeknownst to the filmmakers, they set a pivotal scene between Laura and Simon in the same cottage on the English Channel in East Sussex that Joe Wright used for his classic tearjerker.",
      "While movie fans might bemoan the lack of the Nora Ephron-style romantic comedies of the 1990s on our screens, modern movies are grappling with the state of relationships in serious, satirical and genre-skewing ways, with films like \u201cMaterialists,\u201d\u201cSplitsville,\u201d \u201cAll of You\u201d and more. The distinction, Bridges said, is perhaps audiences today are craving stories not about aspirational, unattainable romance, but about love \u2014 however complicated and messy it might be.",
      "\u201cWe have seen the movie where somebody runs to the train station at the end and confesses undying love and the movie ends and the idea is they live happily ever after. But I\u2019m not quite sure that that\u2019s the experience of love that a lot of people have,\u201d Bridges said. \u201cI think they\u2019re looking for love stories rather than romance stories.\u201d",

      "The attorneys for the family of Kevin Rodriguez Zavala, 32, said the fact that he had a spinal disability from birth and used a wheelchair played no role in his death, and he had no medical issues before getting on the Stardust Racers ride at Epic Universe. At a news conference in Orlando, the lawyers also took issue with a top Universal executive last weekend saying in a note to employees that \u201cinternal findings\u201d showed the ride worked as it should have.",

      "Zavala's family described him as a theme park enthusiast and a gamer with friends worldwide from gaming. He treasured his independence and drove and cooked for himself. He also worked as an employment counselor for people with disabilities, helping them land jobs and then checking on them once they started working. His parents said they never treated him any differently than his sister and brother because of his disability.",

      "Lear deBessonet, the new artistic director of Lincoln Center Theater, has chosen \u201cRagtime\u201d as her first show",
      "NEW YORK -- When Lear deBessonet, the incoming artistic director of Lincoln Center Theater, was thinking about what should be her first show as its new leader, she landed on something sweeping, very American \u2014 and some unfinished business.",
      "She had just directed an off-Broadway concert version of \u201cRagtime\u201d \u2014 a big, soaring musical celebrating early 20th-century America \u2014 that had wowed critics despite being a bare-boned production with some actors reading from their scripts. Might it fit the bill if she filled it out?",
      "\u201cWhat you\u2019re hoping is to make work that\u2019s going to be meaningful in people\u2019s lives, and I really felt that it was. And that it was in a way that wasn\u2019t finished,\u201d the Tony Award-nominated director says. \u201cIt really warranted the full flourishing of the idea.\u201d",
      "She gets her wish this fall as 33 actors buoyed by an 28-piece orchestra announce her arrival with a full-throated Broadway revival of the stage version of E.L. Doctorow\u2019s bestselling novel. Previews begin Friday; opening night is Oct. 16.",
      "\u201cRagtime'' is the story of three distinct groups of characters navigating their way through the turbulent racial and economic times of 1906 in New York City \u2014 a Jewish immigrant with his young daughter, a well-to-do white family and a Black piano player.",
      "\u201cBecause \u2018Ragtime\u2019 has, in fact, so many stories with multiple protagonists, there is an opportunity for people to connect with it in many different ways that reflect their own history, their own family\u2019s history, their own experience,\u201d she says.",
      "Tony Award-nominee Joshua Henry leads the cast and views it as the perfect musical for this moment. \u201cHow we see each other, how we hear each other is right now at the forefront,\u201d he says.",
      "\u201cI think \u2018Ragtime\u2019 puts the spotlight on how we have been successful and not successful doing that in the past, and I feel that\u2019s going to help us move forward.\u201d",
      "The revival is part of a slate of shows that deBessonet is crafting for the multi-Tony Award-winning, three-theater complex on the Lincoln Center campus, one that has built a reputation for new plays and sumptuous revivals of great musicals.",
      "\u201cThe work we make here I want it to be something that anyone of any background \u2014 whether they are visiting New York City or were born here \u2014 could come in and feel restored to humanity, feel connected to other people,\u201d she says. \u201cPart of why I\u2019m such a passionate advocate for the theater as an art form is, I really believe, it\u2019s a place where we can gather across difference.\u201d",
      "DeBessonet this season is also bringing over the London hit \u201cKyoto,\u201d a political thriller about the climate accords, and a revival of \u201cThe Whoopi Monologues\u201d with Kerry Washington and Kara Young. There also will be a family holiday opera and a comedy series in its rooftop off-Broadway venue.",

      "Scarlett Johansson makes her directorial debut with \u201cEleanor the Great,\u201d starring June Squibb",
      "There is a lovely story of friendship, grief and starting over at the heart of \u201cEleanor the Great.\u201d The film, directed by Scarlett Johansson in her feature debut, gets tangled in a plot contrivance that is, at best, unnecessary and at worst, loathsome.",
      "That\u2019s the problem with the elevator pitch mentality, though. A story about a 90-something trying to make friends in a new city might sound a little too simple, a little too straightforward. What if she does so by pretending to be a Holocaust survivor? I\u2019m not kidding.",
      "Eleanor is played by June Squibb (the great). At 94-years-old, she has moved from Florida to New York after the death of her best friend and roommate Bessie (Rita Zohar). Her daughter, Lisa (Jessica Hecht), and grandson, Max (Will Price), have taken her into their small Manhattan apartment, but they only seem interested in getting Eleanor into an assisted living arrangement. Lisa especially treats her mother's presence like an inconvenience, a problem to fix, and Eleanor starts looking elsewhere for companionship.",
      "The thing is Eleanor had a great life in Florida, living with her platonic best friend in a little apartment. The script, Tory Kamen\u2019s first produced screenplay, smartly introduces this idyllic moment first. It is a distinct joy to watch the two nonagenarians go about their daily activities, from velcroing their shoes to doing their exercises on the beach.",
      "Squibb recently had a version of this in the delightful \u201cThelma,\u201d but there she was alone, a widow determined to hold onto her independent living situation. Here, Bessie and Eleanor help each other, whether it\u2019s waking up on time, or standing up for the other at the local supermarket when their preferred brand of kosher pickles isn\u2019t on the shelf and the teenage employee dares to suggest that \u201call pickles taste the same.\u201d Then Bessie suddenly dies, and Eleanor is left with no choice but to start over.",
      "It\u2019s hard to make new friends anywhere, at any age, but perhaps even more so in drizzly, cold New York. When a friendly woman at the Jewish Community Center asks Eleanor if she\u2019s here for \u201cthe group,\u201d Eleanor doesn\u2019t question it. Yes, she says with a relieved smile. When it becomes clear that this group is for Holocaust survivors, she does try to leave, but everyone encourages her to stay and suddenly she\u2019s telling Bessie\u2019s story of losing her brother in Poland as her own. The script has already established Eleanor as a bit of a liar \u2014 but they\u2019re the small kinds, the white lies that, she says, aren\u2019t hurting anyone.",

It\u2019s here where you can start to see how the rest of the movie is going to play out, how the lie will go on too long and be exposed at a terrible time, leading to inevitable feelings of betrayal and humiliation. And it is very, very hard to watch Squibb in distress. Rather than celebrate the performance you want to lash out at the script that put her in this situation in the first place. That may not be fair but it\u2019s also true.",
      "The story becomes less of a character study of the strange ways in which grief manifests and more about the escalating hijinks of a lie that takes on a wild life of its own. Soon Eleanor is speaking to Nina\u2019s journalism peers in an on-the-record, taped conversation, telling another of Bessie\u2019s stories. Then, Nina\u2019s distant father ( Chiwetel Ejiofor ), a local news anchor, decides Eleanor\u2019s is a great human-interest story for his show.",
      "There is a thread about the merits of preserving memory, but it\u2019s introduced a little too late and too flimsily to justify all that came before it. Johansson directs the proceedings simply, like a classic New York character drama, allowing the performances to shine over the filmmaking, but who she is as a filmmaker remains to be seen. Squibb and Kellyman, both terrific, are the real reasons to seek out \u201cEleanor the Great.\u201d The film may trip over its own contrivances but their performances will leave you moved.",
      "\u201cEleanor the Great,\u201d a Sony Pictures Classics release in theaters Friday, is rated PG-13 by the Motion Picture Association for \u201csome language, thematic elements and suggestive references.\u201d Running time: 98 minutes. Two and a half stars out of four.",

      "HAVANA -- Cuban teenagers Fabio and Diego Abreu seem shy at first, but the moment they step on stage, they become confident, filling a concert hall in downtown Havana with a hypnotic form of traditional jazz.",
      "The Abreu brothers, aged 19 and 17, are part of a new generation of musicians revitalizing Cuba\u2019s music scene. They are filling a void left by established performers who have emigrated or stayed abroad as the island endures one of its most dire economic crises in decades. Their rise is also fueled by the opening of small, private venues for their shows and the relatively recent spread of internet access on the island, which they use for promotion.",
      "\u201cWe do what we like and we\u2019re fortunate enough to make a living from what we love, which is music,\u201d 19-year-old Fabio Abreu said shortly before a concert at the F\u00e1brica de Arte Cubano, a sprawling cultural center housed in a former factory that now operates as an art gallery, music venue and nightclub.",
      "And it's not just good old traditional jazz like that of the Abreus. Young musicians in Cuba are experimenting with everything, mixing traditional Cuban music like timba and salsa with newer, more daring sounds like electronic music and hip hop.",
      "The Cuban music scene is both complex and interesting, said Michel Hern\u00e1ndez, a writer and journalist specialized in music. \u201cThe recent migration of major Cuban artists \u2014 many with established careers \u2014 has created a void that is now being filled by a new generation of musicians,\u201d he said.",
      "The emerging scene is highly hybrid, he said, blending rock, pop and electronic music with traditional Afro-Cuban music styles such as \u201cson,\u201d which is the root of salsa. The phenomenon has led to the rise of new genres, including the highly commercial \u201creparto,\" a genre that originated in Havana\u2019s working-class neighborhoods and is known for its explicit lyrics.",
      "In addition to new sounds, many of these artists are now performing in small, private bars that have opened over the last decade. And lacking a formal record industry, young Cuban artists rely heavily on social media and the internet \u2014 a tool only widely available on the island since late 2018. They also depend on music videos, some of which are made with very low production budgets, that are shared between phones.",
      "One of them is Melanie Santiler, a 23-year-old pop singer and songwriter who has gained a following among young people. She credits online videos for much of her success. Her Instagram account boasts 248,000 followers, while her YouTube channel has 73,000.",
      "\u201cWe emerging musicians are the ones carrying the flag and shaping the future of Cuban music,\" she said. \u201cFor me, this is a decisive moment.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- Lawyers for music mogul Sean \u201cDiddy\u201d Combs urged a New York federal judge Monday to sentence him early next month to no more than 14 months in prison for his conviction on two prostitution-related charges, meaning he'd go free almost immediately if the judge agreed.",
      "The lawyers made their arguments in a written submission to Judge Arun Subramanian, who has already rejected a proposed $50 million bail package, signaling that he doesn't believe the Grammy-winning artist is close to being released.",
      "\u201cMr. Combs\u2019s celebrity status in the realms of music, fashion, spirits, media, and finance has been shattered and Mr. Combs\u2019s legacy has been destroyed,\u201d the lawyers wrote, saying their client has been punished enough.",
      "The submission provided new information about what life behind bars for nearly 13 months has been like for Combs, what's happened to his businesses and other interests and explains why he turned down a plea-deal offer from prosecutors prior to his trial.",
      "Combs faces an Oct. 3 sentencing after his July conviction by a Manhattan jury on two Mann Act charges that outlaw interstate commerce related to prostitution. Each charge carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison.",
      "The Bad Boy Records founder was exonerated on more serious racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking charges that would have required a minimum of 15 years in prison and the possibility of a life sentence.",
      "In their submission, Combs' lawyers argued that a jury sent a loud message to the judge by exonerating him of the most serious charges.",
      "\u201cPut simply, the jury has spoken. Its verdict represents an \u2018affirmative indication of innocence,\u2019\u201d the lawyers said.",
      "\u201cHe has served over a year in one of the most notorious jails in America \u2014 yet has made the most of that punishment. It is time for Mr. Combs to go home to his family, so he can continue his treatment and try to make the most of the next chapter of his extraordinary life,\u201d they added.",
      "Prosecutors, who will submit their recommendations prior to the Oct. 3 sentencing, have already said they\u2019ll urge Combs stay imprisoned substantially longer than the four to five years they originally thought.",
      "Defense lawyers, though, wrote in their submission Monday that prosecutors \u201chave lost all perspective.\u201d",
      "\u201cMr. Combs\u2019s career and reputation have been destroyed,\u201d they wrote. \u201cHis life outside of jail has been systematically dismantled.\u201d",
      "Among other things, they noted that he had to let go over 100 employees from his businesses and many of them have been unable to get new jobs because of their past association with Combs.",
      "His seven children, they said, have faced \u201cdevastating consequences,\u201d including lost business opportunities in acting, television, fashion and concerts, with some of them being included in some of the nearly 100 civil lawsuits filed against Combs since his arrest.",
      "The lawyers also noted that Combs and his family were set to star in a Hulu show about their lives, but the show was cancelled once the allegations against him became public.",
      "Combs was removed from the boards at three charter schools he created in Harlem, the Bronx and Connecticut and was stripped of an honorary doctorate degree from Howard University, which plans to return his prior donations, they said.",

      "Meanwhile, Combs's life in prison has been harrowing at times, even as it has allowed him to become sober for the first time in 25 years, his lawyers said.",
      "On one occasion, another inmate approached Combs with a shiv, accusing Combs of sitting on a chair that the inmate wanted to sit on, before Combs defused the situation and calmed the man and his makeshift weapon down, the lawyers said.",
      "They said he has been under constant suicide watch, meaning every two hours he must present his identification card to guards to show he is alive and well and is awakened from sleep in a brightly lighted cell by a guard to ensure he is well.",
      "He also has limited access to clean water, leaving him to heat the water that he drinks to ensure it won't make him sick and he must sleep within two feet of other inmates in a dorm-style room containing a bathroom and no door, the lawyers wrote.",
      "\u201cMr. Combs has not breathed fresh air in nearly 13 months, or felt sunlight on his skin, often walking with a limp due to a painful knee injury that requires surgery,\u201d they said. And the food, they added, sometimes contains maggots.",
      "Prior to trial, the lawyers said, prosecutors offered Combs a plea deal that would have recommended a prison sentence of at least 25 years and required him to plead guilty to crimes of which he was acquitted.",
      "They portrayed their client as a changed man, who had realized that his overuse of drugs, including some prescribed by doctors, had contributed to violent acts he participated in.",
      "\"Without minimizing Mr. Combs\u2019s conduct, this is in many ways a \u2018sex, drugs, and rock n\u2019 roll\u2019 story,\" they said. \"Mr. Combs had severe substance abuse problems throughout the entirety of the offense conduct and participated in a high-octane celebrity lifestyle.\u201d",
      "The music maven's trial featured lengthy testimony from two former girlfriends of Combs who said they felt forced to participate in drug-fueled sex marathons with male sex workers as Combs watched and sometimes filmed the dayslong encounters.",

      "Another ex-girlfriend, testifying under the pseudonym \u201cJane,\u201d said she also felt pressured to perform sexually with male sex workers while she dated Combs from 2021 until his arrest at a New York hotel a year ago.",
      "There was also extensive testimony during the trial about Combs beating his girlfriends and using violence and the fears of it to control those around him.",
      "Defense lawyers at trial conceded there was domestic abuse but said the charges brought by prosecutors were not proven.",
      "While he was once so depressed in jail that \u201cthere were days when he was unable to get out of his bed or even talk to the psychology department,\u201d his lawyers said he looks forward to the future.",
      "They said he has begun teaching other inmates essential skills in business management, entrepreneurship and personal development.",
      "The lawyers wrote that the education program has become \u201cone of the most impactful and important endeavors of his life\u201d and he hopes to expand it to state-run facilities once he is released.",
      "\u201cHe is a humbled man who understands that the most important things in life are his devotion to and quality time with his family and his contributions for the benefit of others,\u201d they said.",

      "Pamela Anderson has embraced a makeup-free lifestyle at 58, attending fashion shows and film premieres with a bare face",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Pamela Anderson has nothing against makeup. It's just that she's been there, done that in her younger years. That's why now, at 58, she's attending fashion shows and film premieres with a blissfully bare face.",
      "It's a look, especially for older women, that serves to plague and perplex. Do we chase youth (and relevancy) with a full face, or do we foster radiant skin and march on makeup free?",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not trying to be the prettiest girl in the room,\u201d Anderson told Vogue ahead of a recent show she attended during Paris Fashion Week. \u201cI feel like it\u2019s just freedom. It\u2019s like a relief.\u201d",
      "Down here in the non-celebrity world, is it just as easy and comfortable to go makeup free? Some proponents of the look, along with style and beauty experts, weigh in.",
      "Women, particularly older women, are not universally giving up makeup, but Anderson, Alicia Keys and other celebrities who have publicly shown off bare faces have certainly inspired some to cast it off.",
      "Working women, however, acknowledge difficulties doing that on the job \u2014 especially in traditional, less creative work spaces.",
      "\u201cI do still think that there are some politics associated with it. More around feeling and looking polished,\u201d said Deborah Borg, the chief of human resources for a creative-leaning company that has roughly 25,000 employees.",
      "She said she's seen more women come into work makeup-free since COVID, and thinks the pandemic significantly altered the workplace dynamic.",
      "Borg, 49, gave up makeup four years ago, save an occasional swipe of her bold, signature red lipstick. At Dalya, a cozy clothing shop in New York's trendy Soho neighborhood, she lent herself as a model to demonstrate how to help one's bare skin glow and how to use attire and accessories to accentuate the look.",
      "Makeup artist Rebecca Robles counseled Borg and others with mature skin to think hydration when choosing products to make the most of their bare faces.",
      "Robles recommends a five-step workday routine: A gentle cleanser that doesn't strip the skin; a vitamin C serum to brighten and mitigate fine lines; a moisturizer with sun protection; a separate broad-spectrum sunscreen for an extra boost (don't forget to apply that to the ears); and a glossy lip balm for a bit of added polish.",
      "No mascara? No problem. Use a lash curler to offer a bit of pop to the eye, Robles said. And gently brush brows into place to complete the look.",
      "Find products with hyaluronic acid and ceramides, Robles suggests, and always swipe up with skincare products. Minimize tugging and pulling on the skin.",
      "\u201cWhen your skin is glowing, one thing that\u2019s really fun to keep in mind is that light reflects off that moisture in the skin and can help blur out any fine lines or enlarged pores. So it\u2019s win-win,\u201d Robles said.",
      "She advised that each product should sit for a minute or two before the next step is applied.",
      "Borg emphasized the ease of her morning routine since going makeup free. She used to spend about 30 minutes just on makeup. Now, she does hair and face in half that time.",

If you have more silk satin, like say something like a blouse, it\u2019s going to be more like a laser beam,\u201d she said.",
      "Finally, accessorize. Tincher said added touches like lapel pins, earrings and necklaces can provide a finished polish \u2014 especially if that polish is still expected at work. A considered style can offset judgments about going makeup free, she said.",
      "\u201cThink of your outfit as the big picture. When you walk in, what is the statement that it\u2019s making? It\u2019s not just about one part of you, it\u2019s your whole presence in a room,\u201d she said.",

      "Makeup, she said, \u201cfelt like prison.\u201d She stopped gradually, giving up foundation first. But still, she's not above applying a bit of mascara on special occasions.",

      "Miles Mykkanen has come a long way since his musical theater dreams shifted to opera at Juilliard",
      "NEW YORK -- Miles Mykkanen grew up wanting to sing and dance on Broadway, but he was turned down by the musical theater programs he applied to for college. So he had to \u201csettle\u201d for studying opera at the Juilliard School at Lincoln Center.",
      "\u201cAt 18, when your sights are set on 42nd Street and then you\u2019re getting called to 65th Street, it was weirdly a letdown,\u201d he recalled. \u201cBut after a few hours I kind of slapped myself and said \u2018Miles, pull yourself together.\u2019\u201d",
      "That was 16 years ago, and he has since pulled himself together to such an extent that at age 34 he\u2019s just opened the Metropolitan Opera season in a leading role in a new opera, \u201cThe Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay.\u201d",
      "With a libretto by Gene Scheer and score by Mason Bates, the opera is based on the novel by Michael Chabon. Mykkanen portrays Sammy Clay, a Jewish kid growing up in World War II-era Brooklyn who teams with his cousin, Czech refugee Joe Kavalier, to create a comic strip hero modeled on Superman.",
      "He\u2019ll also be back at the Met in the spring in another modern opera, Finnish composer Kaija Saariaho\u2019s \u201cInnocence.\u201d He plays the Bridegroom, a part he first sang in 2024 when San Francisco Opera gave the work\u2019s U.S. premiere.",
      "Mykkanen had sung at the Met before, mostly attracting little attention in small parts, though his haunting rendition of the Holy Fool in Mussorgsky\u2019s \u201cBoris Godunov\u201d in 2021 drew critical acclaim.",
      "\u201cBut this season is so ideal,\u201d Mykkanen said. \u201cAll of a sudden my schedule came together, and I thought, my God, where did this all come from.\u201d",
      "When the Met was casting \u201cKavalier & Clay,\u201d it was Michael Heaston, the artistic administrator, who thought of Mykkanen for the role of Sammy.",
      "\u201cI first became acquainted with Miles when he was still a student at Juilliard, and he immediately impressed me,\u201d Heaston said. \u201cHe is a singer who can straddle genres, that rare artist who can sing a heartfelt operatic aria in one moment and then turn on a dime to a classic tune from the American Songbook.",
      "\u201cWhen I looked at Mason\u2019s score and considered the vocal and acting demands alike, it seemed tailor-made for Miles.\u201d",
      "Mary Birnbaum, who taught Mykkanen acting at Juilliard, said she\u2019s not surprised at his sudden rise to prominence.",
      "\u201cHonestly it\u2019s what I thought he would do all along,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s got a very American sound, and it\u2019s appealing and it\u2019s lush. But also he\u2019s bold as an actor \u2026 and he makes material look better for being in it.\u201d",
      "By coincidence, both his roles this season are people who have something to hide. \u201cThey are characters with two huge secrets that are kind of gnawing away at them,\u201d Mykkanen said.",

      "\u201cAs a gay man myself, it\u2019s been really rewarding for me to be working on this role, thinking back to my coming out process 20 years ago now,\u201d Mykkanen said. \u201cSammy wants to believe there\u2019s a future for him, but he keeps struggling and wondering if the world will ever get past its prejudice and accept him.\u201d",
      "\u201cInnocence\u201d deals with the lingering effects of a school shooting 10 years later, and as secrets are peeled away, the Bridegroom\u2019s role in the horrific events is gradually exposed.",
      "Mykkanen relishes the very different musical challenges the two roles provide. Saariaho\u2019s score for \u201cInnocence,\u201d he said is composed with a kind of \u201cmathematical\u201d precision. \u201cWhen I first cracked it open, it was overwhelming because of the time signatures, the key signatures. You\u2019re trying to figure out, what was she thinking, how do you put this all together?\u201d",
      "\u201cKavalier & Clay,\u201d written in a style that uses what Bates calls \u201csymphonic electronica,\u201d has been easier to learn. \u201cI almost feel it\u2019s starting to carve a new genre in opera,\u201d Mykkanen said. \u201cSomething American opera has been trying to find in the last decade or so. \u2026 I don\u2019t want to stay to say it\u2019s musical theater, but at times it\u2019s very colloquial.\u201d",
      "Mykkanen grew up in the remote Ironwood region of Michigan\u2019s Upper Peninsula, where both his parents were high school band directors. Though he displayed a talent for singing at a young age, it was show music rather than opera that inspired him. When his parents found him a classical voice teacher, \u201cFor me it was a means to an end, to develop my voice so I could sing on the Broadway stage.\u201d",
      "Though his career now takes him all over the U.S. and to Europe, Mykkanen still calls the Ironwood region home. In 2020, he launched an arts festival called Emberlight that has grown into a two-month summer program of live performance, film, art shows and talkbacks with visiting artists. When he\u2019s not on site he handles logistics remotely and also relies heavily on volunteers.",
      "\u201cJust being the person who with a lot of other people behind me brings art to this region which is rural and remote \u2026 It\u2019s been one of the big blessings of my life,\u201d he said.",
      "And when he isn\u2019t performing, he returns. \u201cI have a room in my parents\u2019 basement where I store my stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I\u2019m between contracts I come back here and stay with my mom and dad. \u2026 I\u2019lll call them from Amsterdam and say \u2018OK, what are we having for dinner next Tuesday when I land.\u2019\u201d",

      "PORTLAND, Maine -- Australian scientists tested the strength of bite-resistant wetsuits by allowing sharks to chomp the materials at sea and found that the suits can help keep swimmers safe.",
      "Fatal shark bites are vanishingly rare, with less than 50 unprovoked shark bites on humans worldwide in 2024, according to the International Shark Attack File at the Florida Museum of Natural History. But increased sightings of large sharks in some parts of the world have swimmers, surfers and divers looking for new ways to stay safe.",
      "Scientists with Flinders University in Adelaide, South Australia, tested four bite-resistant materials and found they all reduced the amount of damage from shark bites. They performed the work by dragging samples of the materials behind boats and allowing white and tiger sharks to bite the samples.",
      "The bites from such large sharks can still cause internal and crushing injuries, but the materials showed effectiveness beyond a standard neoprene wetsuit, the scientists said. The research found that the bite-resistant materials \u201ccan reduce injuries sustained from shark encounters,\u201d said Flinders professor Charlie Huveneers, a member of the Southern Shark Ecology Group at Flinders and a study co-author.",
      "\"Bite-resistant material do not prevent shark bites, but can reduce injuries from shark bites and can be worn by surfers and divers,\" Huveneers said.",
      "There were small differences between the four tested materials, but they all \"reduced the amount of substantial and critical damage, which would typically be associated with severe hemorrhaging and tissue or limb loss,\u201d said Tom Clarke, a researcher with the science and engineering college at Flinders and a study co-author.",
      "Chainmail suits to resist shark bites have existed for decades, but lack in flexibility for aquatic activities like surfing and diving, the scientists said in research published in the journal Wildlife Research on Thursday. Newer wetsuits can be designed to provide flexibility as well as protection.",

That includes surfers and spearfishers, he said.",

      "\u201cI also like it because it's not relying on any impact on the shark's behavior,\u201d Whitney said. \u201cIt's basically very, very simple. In the extremely rare event that you get bitten by a shark, this material will hopefully make you bleed less than you would if you were not wearing this.\u201d",

      "President Donald Trump's administration has extended Georgia's Pathways to Coverage program for 15 months",
      "ATLANTA -- Georgia's program that provides health insurance to some low-income adults that document work or other activities has been extended for 15 months by President Donald Trump's administration.",
      "Republican Gov. Brian Kemp announced Thursday that the federal government approved that the Pathways to Coverage program will continue as part of the state-federal Medicaid program through December 2026. The five-year pilot program had been scheduled to expire next week, but Kemp argued Georgia should get more time because the program only started after a court battle with President Joe Biden\u2019s administration, which tried to shut it down.",
      "Georgia's program has been closely watched because Republicans mandated similar work requirements throughout the country as part of the tax and budget overhaul signed into law by Trump. Starting in 2027, some adults who seek Medicaid coverage must first show they are working, taking classes or performing community service for at least 80 hours a month.",
      "The Georgia program, which has similar work or activity requirements, has enrolled far fewer people than originally projected, covering 9,175 people as of August. It has spent twice as much on administrative costs than on providing actual health care. The Kemp administration had projected it would cover 25,000 people in its first year and up to 100,000 eventually.",
      "Critics warn the Georgia experience shows that millions will lose coverage under the Trump law because the administrative process will make it too difficult for them to document their work. Republicans have defended the low enrollment, saying Medicaid should be temporary for people who can get insurance through an employer.",
      "Pathways is Kemp's answer to pressure to expand Medicaid to cover all adults who earn less than 138% of federal poverty line wages, as originally envisioned under President Barack Obama's healthcare overhaul. Georgia is one of 10 Republican-led states that refused to expand coverage. Instead, Kemp launched Pathways, offering coverage to people who earn up to the poverty line \u2014 $15,650 a year. Georgia\u2019s traditional Medicaid program still covers poorer children, disabled adults, poor people in nursing homes and a few other very poor adults.",
      "Under the extension, Georgia will offer health coverage to parents and guardians of children younger than six without any additional work requirement. The state will also let beneficiaries report qualifying work or activity hours only once a yearly, instead of monthly. Some beneficiaries had said the monthly reporting process was glitchy and hard to use. Insurance will also start on the first day of the month that an application is received, meaning hospitals and doctors will have an incentive to help uninsured patients apply in hopes of getting paid for care already delivered. Right now, coverage doesn't start until after someone is approved.",

      "Abortion funding across the U.S. has been under siege, particularly Planned Parenthood affiliates, which are the biggest provider.",
      "The organization warned earlier this year that about half its clinics that provide abortion could be closed as a result of a ban on Medicaid funding for Planned Parenthood for services other than abortion.",
      "The measure was part of the tax and spending law President Donald Trump signed in July. Initially, a judge said reimbursements must continue, but a federal appeals court this month said the government could halt the payments while a court challenge to the provision moves ahead.",
      "Planned Parenthood services include cancer screenings and sexually transmitted infection testing and treatment. Federal Medicaid money was already not paying for abortion, but affiliates relied on Medicaid to stay afloat.",
      "The remaining Planned Parenthood clinics in Louisiana \u2013 where abortion is banned \u2013 are scheduled to shut down at the end of this month.",
      "Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin said in a statement that it is trying to see as many patients as possible between now and Tuesday. The federal law takes effect Wednesday. It is not scheduling patients beyond that date and the organization believes the move will allow it to continue seeing other Medicaid patients. The organization said it was working with providers across the state to make sure patients are referred quickly and receive timely care.",

      "\u201cPlanned Parenthood of Wisconsin will continue to provide the full spectrum of reproductive health care, including abortion, as soon and as we are able to,\u201d Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin President and CEO Tanya Atkinson said in the statement. \u201cIn the meantime, we are pursuing every available option through the courts, through operations, and civic engagement.\u201d",
      "The abortion landscape has been shifting frequently since the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in 2022 that allowed states to ban abortion. Currently, 12 states do not allow it at any stage of pregnancy, with limited exceptions, and four more ban it after about six weeks\u2019 gestation.",
      "The bans have resulted in more women traveling for abortion and an increased reliance on abortion pills.

      "The Wisconsin Supreme Court in July struck down the state's 1849 near-total ban on abortion, saying it was superseded by newer state laws regulating the procedure. The same day it ruled in that case, the court dismissed a lawsuit filed by Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin asking it to find the law unconstitutional.",
      "Wisconsin's abortion ban was in effect until 1973, when the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s landmark Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion nationwide nullified it. Legislators never officially repealed it, however, and conservatives argued that the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s ruling that overturned Roe reactivated it.",
      "Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin stopped providing abortions after that ruling for 15 months before resuming them as the lawsuit over the state law played out. It has been providing abortions at three clinics in Wisconsin for the past two years.",
      "Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin serves about 50,000 people across the state. About 60% of them are covered by Medicaid, the organization said.",

      "Every year, tons of heroin, cocaine, methamphetamine and other drugs flow around the world",
      "UNITED NATIONS -- Every year, tons of heroin, cocaine, methamphetamine and other drugs flow around the world, an underground river that crisscrosses borders and continents and spills over into violence, addiction and suffering. Yet when nations' leaders give the U.N. their annual take on big issues, drugs don't usually get much of the spotlight.",
      "But this was no usual year.",
      "First, U.S. President Donald Trump touted his aggressive approach to drug enforcement, including decisions to designate some Latin American cartels as foreign terrorist organizations and to carry out deadly military strikes on speedboats that he says said were carrying drugs in the southern Caribbean.",
      "\u201cTo every terrorist thug smuggling poisonous drugs into the United States of America: Please be warned that we will blow you out of existence,\u201d he boasted at the U.N. General Assembly on Tuesday.",
      "Hours later, his Colombian counterpart fired back that Trump should face criminal charges for allowing an attack on unarmed \"young people who were simply trying to escape poverty.\u201d",
      "The U.S. \u201canti-drug policy is not aimed at the public health of a society, but rather to prop up a policy of domination,\u201d Colombia's Gustavo Petro bristled, accusing Washington of ignoring domestic drug dealing and production while demonizing his own country. The U.S. recently listed Colombia, for the first time in decades, as a nation falling short of its international drug control obligations.",
      "The barbs laid bare, on global diplomacy's biggest stage, the world's wide and pointed differences over how to deal with drugs.",
      "\u201cThe international system is extremely divided on drug policy,\u201d said Vanda Felbab-Brown, who has followed the topic as a senior fellow at the Washington-based Brookings Institution think tank. \u201cThis is not new, but it\u2019s really just very intense at this UNGA.\u201d",
      "While the wars in Gaza and Ukraine, climate change and other crises got much of the focus in the U.N.'s marathon week of speeches and meetings, the topic of drugs turned up from Trump's and Petro's tough talk to side events on such themes as gender-inclusive drug policy and international cooperation to fight organized crime.",
      "Some 316 million people worldwide used marijuana, opioids and/or other drugs in 2023, a 28% rise in a decade, according to the most recent statistics available from the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime. The figures don\u2019t count alcohol or tobacco use.",
      "The specifics vary by region, with cocaine use growing in Europe, methamphetamine on the rise in Southeast Asia, and synthetic opioids making new inroads in West and Central Africa and continuing to trouble North America, though opioid-related deaths have been falling.",
      "The U.N. drug office says trafficking is increasingly dominated by organized crime groups with tentacles and partnerships around the world, and nations need to think just as broadly about trying to tackle the syndicates.",
      "\u201cGovernments are increasingly seeing organized crime and drug trafficking as threats to national and regional security and stability, and some are coming around to the fact that they need to join up diplomatic, intelligence, law enforcement and central-bank efforts to push back,\u201d agency chief of staff Jeremy Douglas said by email.",
      "Although organized crime hasn't featured very prominently in top-level discussions at the General Assembly to date, he said, \u201cwe\u2019re at a point where this needs to, and hopefully will, change.\u201d",
      "Nations pair up in various joint counternarcotics operations and working groups and sometimes form regional coalitions, but some experts and leaders see a need to go global.",
      "Countries need to \u201cpool resources in a fight that must be a common cause among all nations,\u201d Panamanian President Jos\u00e9 Ra\u00fal Mulino told the assembly. He said his nation had seized a \u201chistoric and alarming\u201d total of 150 tons of cocaine and other drugs this year alone.",

      "To be sure, there is already some global-scale collaboration on drug control. The U.N. Commission on Narcotic Drugs decides what substances are supposed to be internationally regulated under decades-old treaties, and it can make policy recommendations to the U.N.'s member countries. The International Narcotics Control Board monitors treaty compliance.",
      "But the U.N. is big-tent politics at its biggest, so even as some components of the world body deal with drug enforcement, others emphasize public health programs \u2014 substance abuse treatment, overdose prevention and other services \u2014 over prohibition and punishments.",
      "The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker T\u00fcrk, has advocated for decriminalizing at least some drug use while clamping down on illegal markets. Given that policing hasn't reduced substance use or crime, \u201cthe so-called war on drugs has failed, completely and utterly,\u201d he said last year.",
      "Separately, a U.N. Development Programme report last week said punitive drug control had led to deaths and disease among users who shied from seeking help, racial disparities in enforcement, and other societal downsides.",
      "At a gathering marking the report's release, former Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo deplored that \u201cthe global drug control regime has become a substantial part of the problem.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe question is: Do governments have the wisdom and courage to act?\u201d asked Zedillo, now a Yale professor and a commissioner of the Global Commission on Drug Policy, a Geneva-based anti-drug-war advocacy group.",
      "The other question is whether they could ever agree on what action to take.",
      "Even if countries agree \u2014 or say they do \u2014 with ending the drug trade and resulting ills, \u201cthe objectives might be different, and certain means, tools, resources they're willing to devote to them, are different,\u201d Felbab-Brown said.",
      "Nations' own drug laws vary widely. Some impose the death penalty for certain drug crimes. Others have legalized or decriminalized marijuana. At least one \u2014 Thailand \u2014 legalized it only to have second thoughts and tighten the rules. Countries' openness to needle exchange programs, safe injection sites and other \u201charm reduction\u201d strategies is similarly all over the map.",
      "As leaders took their turns at the assembly rostrum this week, observers got occasional glimpses of the world's different views of its drug problem.",
      "Tajikistan's president, Emomali Rahmon, called drug trafficking \u201ca serious threat to global security.\u201d Guyanese President Irfaan Ali endorsed international efforts to address drug trafficking, which he counted among the \u201dcrimes that are destroying the lives of our people, especially young people.\u201d",
      "Syria's new president, Ahmad al-Sharaa, noted that his administration closed factories that produced the amphetamine-like stimulant Captagon, also known as fenethylline, during his now-ousted predecessor's time. Costa Rican Foreign Minister Arnoldo Andr\u00e9 Tinoco said drug smuggling networks are exploiting routes traveled by migrants and \u201ctaking advantage of the vulnerability of those seeking international protection.\u201d",
      "\u201cIsolated responses are insufficient,\u201d as the traffickers just go elsewhere and create new hotspots of crime, Tinoco said.",
      "Reviewing the challenges facing Peru, President Dina Boluarte listed transnational organized crime and drug trafficking alongside political polarization and climate change.",
      "\u201cNone of these problems is merely national, but rather global,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is why we need the United Nations to once again be a forum for dialogue and cooperation.\u201d",

      "The memo, written by Deputy Defense Secretary Steve Feinberg on May 29 and sent to all the military services, says reserve troops now will need to be on active duty for 30 days or more before being required to get an annual flu shot. It also says the military will no longer be paying for reservists or National Guard members to get the vaccine on their own time.",
      "News of the policy change, which has not been publicly announced by the Pentagon, comes as the Trump administration and its advisers have suggested changes to other vaccination guidance. An influential immunization panel that the administration updated to include anti-vaccine figures decided to not recommend the COVID-19 shot to anyone, while President Donald Trump used his platform to promote unproven and, in some cases, discredited ties between the pain reliever Tylenol, vaccines and autism.",
      "At the Pentagon, the flu shot memo declared that \u201cgoing forward, the Department will conserve its resources by requiring seasonal flu vaccination for Service members only when doing so most directly contributes to readiness.\" However, the document is not clear about the changes because it later says the annual requirement for active-duty troops is still in effect.",
      "While the memo was quietly sent months ago, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth drew attention to it Wednesday when he reposted a comment from an anonymous account that claimed they \u201cwon\u2019t be forced to get a flu shot this fall for the privilege of serving my state and country in the National Guard.\u201d",

      "The criticism targets a plan from the Ministry of Energy and Mines in August to auction the rights for 49 oil and gas projects worth more than $47 billion.",
      "Officials say the \u201chydrocarbon roadmap\u201d is a strategy to modernize Ecuador\u2019s oil industry, attract foreign capital and boost production. Their plan includes contract renegotiations and new licensing rounds that the government says comply with existing legal frameworks.",

      "\u201cOf course, I\u2019m thinking about all the women who were treated like I was,\u201d said Petersen, who had her IUD removed earlier this year, after not speaking about her experiences for over 30 years. \u201cI feel with my fellow women from this episode of our life.\u201d",
      "The alleged purpose of the forced contraception was to limit population growth in Greenland by preventing pregnancies. The population on the Arctic island was rapidly increasing at the time because of better living conditions and better health care. Greenland took over its own health care programs in 1992.",
      "Kirstine Berthelsen, 66, who now lives in Copenhagen, will attend Wednesday's event in Nuuk. She believes she was 14 when she was fitted with an IUD in Greenland. She recalls being taken to a hospital, but not being given a reason why. Later, she remembers she was in \u201cendless pain.\u201d",
      "At 34 she gave birth to a son, but believes two subsequent failed pregnancies were a result of complications caused by the contraception.",
      "\u201cOf course, I am angry at the Danish state because of this act,\u201d Berthelsen said, as she packed a suitcase for her flight to Greenland. \u201cI wanted to join, so I\u2019ve booked a one-way ticket to Nuuk.\u201d",
      "For Berthelsen, now a retiree, the official apology comes at \u201cthe right time.\"",
      "\u201cI am ready for a reconciliation, because it will help me,\u201d she said. \u201cIt will personally be a big event for me, and I\u2019m sure it will ease.\u201d",

      "Government scientists say infection rates from drug-resistant \u201cnightmare bacteria\u201d have been increasing dramatically",
      "NEW YORK -- Infection rates from drug-resistant \u201cnightmare bacteria\u201d rose almost 70% between 2019 and 2023, according to a new report from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention scientists.",
      "Bacteria that are difficult to treat due to the so-called NDM gene primarily drove the increase, CDC researchers wrote in an article published Monday in the Annals of Internal Medicine. Only two antibiotics work against those infections, and the drugs are expensive and must be administered through an IV, researchers said.",
      "Bacteria with the gene were once considered exotic, linked to a small number of patients who received medical care overseas. Though the numbers are still small, the rate of U.S. cases jumped more than fivefold in recent years, the researchers reported.",
      "\u201cThe rise of NDMs in the U.S. is a grave danger and very worrisome,\u201d said David Weiss, an Emory University infectious diseases researcher, in an email.",
      "It's likely many people are unrecognized carriers of the drug-resistant bacteria, which could lead to community spread, the CDC scientists said.",
      "That may play out in doctors\u2019 offices across the country, as infections long considered routine and easy to treat \u2014 like urinary tract infections \u2014 could become chronic problems, said Dr. Maroya Walters, one of the report\u2019s authors.",
      "Antimicrobial resistance occurs when germs such as bacteria and fungi gain the power to fight off the drugs designed to kill them. The misuse of antibiotics was a big reason for the rise \u2014 unfinished or unnecessary prescriptions that didn\u2019t kill the germs made them stronger.",
      "In recent years, the CDC has drawn attention to \u201c nightmare bacteria \u201d resistant to a wide range of antibiotics. That includes carbapenems, a class of antibiotics considered a last resort for treatment of serious infections.",
      "Researchers drew data from 29 states that do the necessary testing and reporting of carbapenem-resistant bacteria.",
      "They counted 4,341 cases of carbapenem-resistant bacterial infections from those states in 2023, with 1,831 of them the NDM variety. The researchers did not say how many of the infected people died.",
      "The rate of carbapenem-resistant infections rose from just under 2 per 100,000 people in 2019 to more than 3 per 100,000 in 2023 \u2014 an increase of 69%. But the rate of NDM cases rose from around 0.25 to about 1.35 \u2014 an increase of 460%, the authors said.",

      "The CDC\u2019s count is only a partial picture.",
      "Many states are not fully testing and reporting cases. Even in states that do, cases tend to be among hospital patients sick enough to warrant special testing. Many hospitals also aren\u2019t able to do the testing needed to detect certain forms of genetic resistance.",
      "The CDC researchers did not have data from some of the most populous states, including California, Florida, New York and Texas, which means the absolute number of U.S. infections \u201cis definitely underestimated,\u201d Burnham said.",

      "RALEIGH, N.C. -- North Carolina Republican legislators are poised this week to approve criminal justice measures designed to toughen bail rules, restrict magistrates' powers and evaluate offenders' mental health after the fatal stabbing of a Ukrainian refugee on a Charlotte commuter train. The bill also could help get the death penalty carried out again in the ninth-largest U.S. state.",
      "Senate and House Republicans unveiled legislation that their leaders previously signaled would surface when the General Assembly reconvened on Monday after nearly two months away from Raleigh.",
      "The Aug. 22 death of 23-year-old Iryna Zarutska \u2014 her attack caught on camera \u2014 and subsequent charges against a suspect who had previously been arrested more than a dozen times caused public outrage. An array of Republicans, President Donald Trump among them, have attempted to blame Zarutska's death on Charlotte-area leaders and Democratic state officials for what they call soft-on-crime policies.",
      "The Senate approved the legislation 28-8 late Monday, with many Democrats absent from the otherwise party-line vote. The bill now goes to the House, where a vote is likely Tuesday.",
      "Any final measure would then go to Democratic Gov. Josh Stein\u2019s desk. Stein, the former attorney general, has suggested pretrial release changes and greater emphasis on mental health are needed in light of Zarutska's death.",
      "But the measure took a different direction \u2014 away from bipartisan support \u2014 when Senate Republicans approved an amendment that could in the future open the door to other forms of capital punishment beyond lethal injection, which is currently the state\u2019s sole method. North Carolina last carried out an execution in 2006.",
      "The stabbing suspect, Decarlos Brown Jr., could received a death sentence if convicted of first-degree murder in state court or a federal count filed against him.",
      "Brown, whose criminal record included serving more than five years in prison after pleading guilty to robbery using a deadly weapon, had been charged in January in Mecklenburg County, which includes Charlotte, with misusing the 911 system, a misdemeanor, according to court records.",
      "But a magistrate \u2014 a nonelected local court official who often determines if a defendant can be released while awaiting trial \u2014 released him on a written promise to return for court. And it took more than six months for a court to order a mental evaluation for him. Brown\u2019s mother told Charlotte-area television that she had sought an involuntary psychiatric commitment this year after he became violent at home.",
      "GOP Sen. Ralph Hise said the legislation has nothing to do with winning political points, but rather is a response to the failure of the criminal justice system.",
      "\u201cWe need a criminal justice system that protects society from individuals. I believe these are many great steps in this bill,\u201d Hise said.",
      "The measure, named \u201cIryna\u2019s Law,\u201d would prohibit cashless bail for certain crimes and eliminate some of the discretion that magistrates and judges have for pretrial release decisions.",
      "For example, first-time defendants accused of a violent offense could only be released on a secured cash bond or receive house arrest with electronic monitoring. Such house arrest and monitoring would be the only option for some repeat defendants.",
      "The bill also attempts to ensure that more suspects are subject to psychological examinations before their potential release. Defendants accused of a violent crime and committed involuntarily in recent years to a mental health facility would be subject to a psychological evaluation.",

      "MEXICO CITY -- The former head of Mexico\u2019s immigration agency apologized Friday to victims and families affected by a fire at a Ciudad Juarez detention center that killed 40 migrants.",
      "Francisco Gardu\u00f1o, who remained in his position as head of the National Immigration Institute until April, was ordered by a judge to make the public apology, among other steps, during a temporary suspension in his prosecution for failing in his responsibility to protect those in his custody.",
      "There were \u201chuman rights violations that never should have happened\u201d due to \u201comissions by personnel of the (National Immigration Institute),\u201d Gardu\u00f1o said at an event in Mexico City.",
      "He called for \u201cthose responsible\u201d to be punished and for reparations to be made without recognizing his own responsibility in the tragedy.",
      "In addition to the 40 killed, more than two dozen people were injured. Most of the victims were from Central America and Venezuela.",
      "Two Venezuelan migrants have been charged with homicide for starting the fire.",
      "Dozens of victims' relatives were present, including some who wept when their loved one's names were read, along with representatives of the immigration agency and the Foreign Affairs Ministry.",
      "Two migrants allegedly started a fire on March 27, 2023, inside the Ciudad Juarez detention center to protest conditions. Security cameras inside the facility showed smoke quickly filling the cell holding several dozen male migrants, but no one with keys attempted to release them.",
      "In January, the judge in Gardu\u00f1o\u2019s case gave him 18 months to take several steps that could lead to the closure of his case. Several of his subordinates face charges including homicide.",
      "Lawyers representing the victims and their families, worried Gardu\u00f1o will escape prison time, have challenged the suspension of his trial but accepted the idea of a public apology because it was the first time they would face the former official in person.",
      "On Friday, some victims and relatives were allowed to address Gardu\u00f1o.",

      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- As Iran's ailing economy braced Saturday for the reimposition of United Nations sanctions over its nuclear program, it is ordinary people who increasingly find themselves priced out of the food they need to survive and worried about their futures.",
      "Iran's rial currency already sits at a record low, increasing pressure on food prices and making daily life that much more challenging. That includes meat, rice and other staples of the Iranian dinner table.",
      "Meanwhile, people worry about a new round of fighting between Iran and Israel \u2014 as well as potentially the United States \u2014 as missile sites struck during the 12-day war in June now appear to be being rebuilt.",
      "Activists fear a rising wave of repression within the Islamic Republic, which already has reportedly executed more people this year than over the past three decades.",
      "Sina, the father of a 12-year-old boy who spoke on condition that only his first name be used for fear of repercussions, said the country has never faced such a challenging time, even during the deprivations of the 1980s Iran-Iraq war and the decades of sanctions that came later.",
      "\u201cFor as long as I can remember, we\u2019ve been struggling with economic hardship, and every year it\u2019s worse than the last,\u201d Sina told The Associated Press. \u201cFor my generation, it\u2019s always either too late or too early \u2014 our dreams are slipping away.\u201d",
      "Early Sunday at 0000 GMT (8 p.m. Eastern), barring any last-minute diplomatic breakthrough, U.N. sanctions on Iran will be reimposed through \u201csnapback,\u201d as the mechanism is called by the diplomats who negotiated it into Iran\u2019s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. Snapback was designed to be veto-proof at the U.N. Security Council, meaning China and Russia cannot stop it alone, as they have other proposed actions against Tehran in the past.",
      "The measure will again freeze Iranian assets abroad, halt arms deals with Tehran, and penalize any development of Iran\u2019s ballistic missile program, among other measures.",
      "France, Germany and the United Kingdom triggered snapback over Iran, further restricting monitoring of its nuclear program and the deadlock over its negotiations with the U.S.",
      "Iran further withdrew from the International Atomic Energy Agency monitoring after Israel\u2019s war on the country in June, which also saw the U.S. strike nuclear sites in the Islamic Republic. Meanwhile, the country still maintains a stockpile of uranium enriched up to 60% purity \u2014 a short, technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90% \u2014 that is largely enough to make several atomic bombs, should Tehran choose to rush toward weaponization.",
      "Iran has long insisted its nuclear program is peaceful, though the West and IAEA say Tehran had an organized weapons program up until 2003.",
      "Tehran has further argued that the three European nations shouldn\u2019t be allowed to implement snapback, pointing in part to America\u2019s unilateral withdrawal from the accord in 2018, during the first term of President Donald Trump\u2019s administration.",
      "\u201cThe Trump administration appears to think it has a stronger hand post-strikes, and it can wait for Iran to come back to the table,\u201d said Kelsey Davenport, a nuclear expert at the Washington-based Arms Control Association. \u201cGiven the knowledge Iran has, given the materials that remain in Iran, that\u2019s a very dangerous assumption.\u201d",
      "Risks also remain for Iran as well, she added: \u201cIn the short term, kicking out the IAEA increases the risk of miscalculation. The U.S. or Israel could use the lack of inspections as a pretext for further strikes.\u201d",

Authorities believe the students were abducted in the town of Iguala as they traveled by bus to Mexico City for a protest and killed by members of a criminal cartel with ties to government and military officials.",

      "Vitale\u2019s debut collection was a full-throttle return to the overtly sexualized Versace of the 1980s and 1990s \u2014 seen in the snug high-waisted jeans cinched as tightly as possible, the revealing open-sided T-shirts, the dresses left carelessly open in the back, and the joyous bursts of primary color.",
      "The flamboyant energy of that decade was echoed in the show soundtrack of George Michael, Prince and Eurythmics.",
      "Vitale\u2019s ascension at Versace marks a dramatic turn for the fashion house: He is only the third creative director after Gianni Versace, who was killed in 1997, and his sister Donatella Versace, who assumed the role after his death until Vitale took over April 1. Donatella Versace remains on as brand ambassador and welcomed the 41-year-old as a champion of young designers.",
      "The change in creative leadership comes as the Prada Group is completing the purchase of Versace in a deal expected to be completed by the year's end. Conveniently for the transition, Vitale most recently worked in the design house of Prada\u2019s little sister brand, Miu Miu.",
      "If he was nervous about being the first nonfamily member to have creative reign at Versace, he didn\u2019t show it as he held court with a gaggle of journalists backstage after the show.",

      "\u201cWhat is sexy? We will never get enough, we will keep on trying,\u2019\u2019 he said.",
      "The staging reinforced a sense of decadence: Inside the Pinacoteca Ambrosiana art gallery, the rooms were styled like the noble home in disarray, with silver set out to be polished, a dog bed tucked in a corner, a work computer was turned on and a bed left unmade, with Vitale's own sheets. \u201cI needed that little niche where I go to stay,'' he said.",
      "Even the invitation \u2014 a love letter quoting Keats \u2014 was more about seeking human contact than organizing an event, he said, which also drives his expression of sexuality in the collection.",
      "\u201cYou know, to me, it\u2019s not even the sex. It\u2019s more the experience. It\u2019s about the smell, it\u2019s about the tactile aspect of it. It\u2019s about the souvenir of the next day. It\u2019s not even that moment,\u2019\u2019 he said.",
      "Outside, fans clogged the tiny streets around the art gallery venue, cheering especially Chinese actor Ding Yuxi and Chinese singer Jingyi Ju.

But since its 2022 invasion of Ukraine, such incursions have carried a bigger threat, none more so than when drones swarmed into Poland two weeks ago and caused NATO to scramble jets to shoot them down.",
      "Estonia said Russian fighter jets flew into its territory last week and remained there for 12 minutes \u2014 an incursion Estonia\u2019s foreign minister described as \u201cunprecedently brazen\u201d but that Russia denied happened. And Romania and Latvia reported that single Russian drones violated their airspace this month.",
      "With Moscow making slow but steady progress on the battlefield in Ukraine and holding a strong hand should it decide to talk peace, its recent forays into NATO airspace also raise questions about why it would risk triggering a direct military confrontation with the alliance.",
      "Here's a look at what's been happening and what Russia's motives might be:",
      "None of the intrusions of NATO airspace has had the scope of what happened in Poland on Sept. 10, when authorities say about 20 Russian drones flew deep over the countryside before being shot down by NATO jets or crashing on their own. It marked the first direct military engagement between the alliance and Russia since the start of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.",
      "Russia denied that it targeted Poland, and its ally Belarus claimed the drones' signals had been jammed by Ukraine, which borders Poland. But European leaders have cast it as a deliberate provocation, pointing to last week's violation of Estonian airspace and other recent incidents as further proof of some broader scheme orchestrated by Moscow.",
      "Before invading Ukraine in 2022, the Kremlin demanded that NATO drop any plans to offer Kyiv membership in the alliance and roll back troop deployments near Russia's borders, including in the Baltic countries of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, small former Soviet republics that joined NATO and the EU in the early 2000s. NATO rejected the demands.",
      "Russian President Vladimir Putin also warned NATO to not allow Kyiv to strike deep inside Russia with Western-supplied longer-range weapons, threatening that Moscow could respond by targeting military facilities in NATO countries that enable such attacks. Doing so would carry huge risks, including for Moscow, as it could spark a direct conflict between Russia and NATO, which has a huge edge in conventional weapons.",
      "Some experts view the recent uptick in NATO airspace incursions as an attempt by Russia to see how the alliance reacts so that it can exploit any fissures or indecision. And some believe Russia is hoping to divert NATO\u2019s attention and resources from supporting Ukraine to defending its own territory.",
      "\u201cMaybe their calculation was that now the European countries have to send something additionally to Estonia regarding the air defense assets, and that means they cannot send it to Ukraine,\u201d Estonian Defense Minister Hanno Pevkur said. \u201cRussia is trying to tear us out from Ukraine.\u201d",
      "Mark Galeotti, an expert in Russian politics who heads the Mayak Intelligence consultancy, thinks the intrusions are part of a \u201ccoercive signaling\u201d aimed at discouraging NATO members from offering robust security guarantees to Kyiv, including the possible deployment of their troops to Ukraine as part of a peace deal. Moscow has warned that it won't accept any NATO troops in Ukraine.",

      "Edward Lucas, senior fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis, said Russia might be trying to highlight NATO\u2019s weaknesses to try to \u201cplant the corrosive question in allies\u2019 minds: Are you willing to go to war with Russia on behalf of the Baltic states?\u201d",
      "\u201cRussia does not need to defeat NATO militarily if it can defeat it politically,\u201d Lucas wrote in an analysis. \u201cIf alliance members do not believe that other members will come to their aid when they are attacked, they feel isolated.\u201d",
      "Russia specifically might have wanted to gauge the reaction of NATO's biggest member, the U.S., said Max Bergmann, head of Europe, Russia, and Eurasia program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.",
      "\u201cI think it was quite underwhelming,\u201d he said of the U.S.'s response to the incursions. \u201cI think what we are seeing is the United States under President Trump doesn\u2019t feel responsible for European security, and that will be quite enlightening to the Russians. They may escalate even more.\u201d",
      "After its drone swarm incident, Poland triggered a NATO mechanism that allows any member to demand a full meeting if it believes its territorial integrity, political independence or security is threatened. Soon after, the alliance launched an operation to bolster its air defenses along its eastern flank.",
      "NATO held discussions again Tuesday in response to the Russian fighter jets that flew into Estonian airspace and warned Moscow that it would any and all means to defend against further breaches.",

He demurred, though, when prodded if the U.S. would step in to back the alliance in such case.",

      "CHISINAU, Moldova -- Moldovans head to the polls Sunday to cast ballots in a tense parliamentary election fraught with claims of Russian interference. The vote could decide the country\u2019s geopolitical future: a stark choice between East and West.",
      "Landlocked between Ukraine and European Union member Romania, Moldova has spent recent years on a westward path toward the EU. Sunday\u2019s ballot to elect a new 101-seat parliament will determine whether that continues or if the country of about 2.5 million people is pulled back into Moscow's orbit.",
      "The race pits the ruling pro-Western Party of Action and Solidarity, which has held a strong parliamentary majority since 2021, against several key Russia-friendly opponents but no viable pro-European partners, leaving a lot of uncertainty over potential outcomes in the pivotal ballot.",
      "If PAS fails to win a majority on Sunday, \u201cIt would mean an end to EU integration,\u201d Igor Grosu, the PAS leader and speaker of parliament, told The Associated Press. \u201cIt would mean dependence, halting all justice reforms, infrastructure projects, everything \u2026 there is no middle option.\u201d",
      "\u201cAll our efforts and messages are about mobilizing to win a parliamentary majority,\u201d he added.",
      "Besides voter turnout, the outcome of Sunday\u2019s high-stakes ballot might depend on how effective Moldovan authorities have been in their cat-and-mouse race to outwit Russia\u2019s alleged \u201chybrid war\u201d \u2014 the aim of which they say is to derail the country\u2019s EU path.",
      "Moldova\u2019s Prime Minister Dorin Recean warned that Russia is spending hundreds of millions of euros to try to \u201cseize power in Chisinau\u201d in a campaign he described as \u201cincreasingly radical.\u201d",
      "The alleged schemes include a large-scale vote-buying operation, cyberattacks on critical government infrastructure, a plan to incite mass riots around the election, and a sprawling disinformation campaign online to sway voters.",
      "Modovan authorities have tried to crack down by conducting hundreds of raids in recent weeks, in which scores have been detained. Moldovan President Maia Sandu said this week in a public address that the Kremlin \u201chas accomplices here in Moldova,\u201d describing them as people \u201cwilling to sell out their country for money.\u201d",
      "Moscow has repeatedly denied meddling in Moldova. In a statement Thursday, Russia\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs dismissed allegations of Russian interference in Moldova\u2019s elections as \u201canti-Russian\u201d and \u201cunsubstantiated.\u201d",
      "Sunday\u2019s vote also will be held less than a year after Moldovans voted narrowly in favor of securing the country\u2019s EU path, the same day Sandu won a second term in a separate vote. But those votes were also overshadowed by widespread claims of Russian interference and a massive vote-buying scheme, which Moscow denied.",
      "In recent years, as the country has lurched from crisis to crisis, Moldovans have faced rampant inflation, increasing costs of living and high poverty rates, which may have diminished support for the ruling pro-Western government.",
      "To relieve the strain, Brussels is providing Moldova with up to 1.9 billion euros ($2.2 billion) between 2025 and 2027, 270 million euros of which was released in July for projects like a new hospital and helping to lower energy bills.",

      "SUMENEP, Indonesia -- Three health care workers rode motorbikes into the Indonesian city of Sumenep, carrying doses of measles vaccine and a list of children who needed them. With blue medical boxes in hand, they went from house to house administering the life-saving shots.",
      "The health workers on wheels are part of the regional government\u2019s latest efforts to curb a deadly measles outbreak on Madura Island that has persisted for the past nine months. More than 2,600 children have already been infected this year and 20 have died.",
      "But efforts to stop the outbreak from spreading through the predominately Muslim population are being hindered in part by concerns that some measles vaccines may not meet Islam\u2019s halal standards because they use a stabilizer that is derived from pigs.",
      "Pork-derived gelatin is widely used as a stabilizer to ensure vaccines remain safe and effective during storage and transport, presenting a dilemma to religious communities that view pigs as ritually unclean. Many Islamic scholars say that vaccines with gelatin stabilizers can be used under religious law, as can other medical products with pig-derived ingredients, under certain conditions.",
      "Indonesian religious leaders ruled in 2018 that vaccines with pig gelatin are haram, or forbidden, but advised Muslims that they should be used until other shots are available \u201cfor the benefit of society,\u201d said Ahmad Syamsuri, the head of Disease Control and Prevention at the Sumenep Health Office.",
      "In Sumenep, many are reluctant to even discuss their religious concerns.",
      "Pujiati Wahyuni, a 31-year-old Muslim mother and nurse, knows parents who refuse the vaccines for their children on religious grounds, though she recently had her daughter receive the vaccine at an Islamic kindergarten in Pamolokan village.",
      "\u201cYes, there are some. Islam is a big religion. Maybe some Muslim people just do not want to get vaccinated, and it is not just now, but since they were born,\u201d Wahyuni said.",
      "The regional government\u2019s latest efforts began in August and include making more than 78,000 vaccines available to children in the region, which are distributed through local clinics, delivered directly to the residents at their homes and even brought to schools.",
      "The hope is that the campaign will help prevent future outbreaks, infections and deaths. But they cannot compel reluctant parents, said Musthafa, the general secretary of Indonesian Ulema Council in Sumenep.",
      "\u201cWe have high hopes for Muslims in Indonesia, who are the ones consuming it. Let us ask the government, in this case the Health Office and the Ministry of Health, to find a halal vaccine,\u201d said Musthafa.",
      "Indonesia, the world\u2019s largest Muslim-majority nation, has reported previous outbreaks of measles, mostly driven by gaps in vaccination coverage.",
      "In 2018, a major outbreak of the highly infectious disease occurred in the easternmost province of Papua, causing dozens of deaths. Due to some vaccine hesitancy then, the Indonesian Ulema Council said the measles-rubella vaccine, produced by the Serum Institute of India, contained an ingredient derived from pigs but allowed its use until a halal alternative was available.",

      "Measles vaccination rates in Indonesia fell below the country's targets in 2023, according to data from the Ministry of Health. In 2023, measles-rubella vaccinations reached 86.6% of the target, and in 2024, the number fell to 82.3%.",

      "LONDON -- Russia is selling military equipment and technology to China that could help Beijing prepare for an airborne invasion of Taiwan, according to an analysis of leaked Russian documents by a London think tank.",
      "The authors of the analysis at the Royal United Services Institute in London obtained around 800 pages of documents, including contracts and lists of equipment to be supplied by Moscow to Beijing, from the Black Moon hacktivist group.",
      "The group, which previously published some of the documents online, does not identify its members but describes itself in a manifesto as opposed to governments that carry out aggressive foreign policy. The authors of the RUSI report shared some of the documents with The Associated Press and say they appear to be genuine, although parts of the documents may have been omitted or altered. AP is unable to independently verify their authenticity.",
      "The mix of completed and apparent draft Russian documents reference meetings between Chinese and Russian delegations \u2014 including visits to Moscow \u2014 and payment and delivery timelines for high-altitude parachute systems and amphibious assault vehicles. They suggest that Russia has begun work on the products to be delivered but don\u2019t contain direct evidence from the Chinese side that Beijing has paid any money or received any equipment.",
      "While the authors argue the equipment could be used to invade Taiwan, under Xi Jinping China has embarked upon a broad modernization program of its armed forces with the goal of transforming it into a \u201cworld-class\u201d military by 2050.",
      "High ranking U.S. officials have suggested Chinese President Xi Jinping ordered his military to be prepared for a possible invasion of Taiwan as early as 2027. Beijing claims the self-governing democracy is rightfully a part of China and has not ruled out seizing the island by force.",
      "The documents don't mention Taiwan directly, but the RUSI analysis suggests the deal would help China gain advanced parachuting capabilities that it would need to mount an invasion, potentially speeding up a timeline.",
      "It\u2019s not certain that China has decided to invade Taiwan, but access to Russian equipment and localized training in China means Beijing will be better equipped for a potential invasion, Danylyuk said.",
      "\u201cThe Chinese school of airborne landing is very young,\u201d he said, suggesting Moscow\u2019s assistance could help speed up China\u2019s airborne program by about 10 to 15 years.",
      "Russia's Kremlin, and China and Taiwan\u2019s defense and foreign ministries did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "\u201cThe greatest value of the deal\u201d to China is likely in the training and procedures for command and control of parachute forces, because Russia has \"combat experience,\u201d whereas China doesn't, write Oleksandr Danylyuk and Jack Watling.",
      "The analysts say Russia\u2019s aim is to develop as a military supplier to China and fund its war in Ukraine. But Danylyuk also suggested to AP that Moscow may want to draw Beijing into a conflict with Washington over Taiwan, distracting the U.S. from Russia's war with Ukraine.",
      "While Beijing\u2019s military capabilities largely surpass Moscow\u2019s, the analysis says China has gaps which Russia can fill. Russia has a long history of airborne forces dating back decades, knowhow the authors say China needs.",
      "Song Zhongping, a military commentator in Beijing, said China had superior equipment, but \u201cRussia has more combat experience.\"",

      "In an invasion of Taiwan, China's \u201coperational challenge\u201d would be to do what Russia did not: suppress Taiwan\u2019s air defenses and land sufficient troops and equipment to be able to build up a force to defeat the Taiwanese military before it mobilizes, the analysts wrote.",

      "The mountain \u201cgateway\u201d town of Old Fort, North Carolina, was well on its way to achieving a major goal: to become a hot spot for mountain biking and all things outdoors",
      "OLD FORT, N.C. -- Morning mist is still burning off the surrounding mountains when they appear: Small groups of helmeted riders on one-wheeled, skateboard-like contraptions, navigating the pitched streets, past the 30-foot granite Arrowhead Monument on the town square.",
      "They are among the 400 or so people converging on this Blue Ridge foothills town for FloatLife Fest, which bills itself as \u201cthe ORIGINAL and LONGEST RUNNING\u201d gathering dedicated to motorized Onewheel boards. Swelling Old Fort\u2019s normal population by half, the mid-September festival is injecting much needed money and hope into a town still recovering a year after it was inundated by the remnants of Hurricane Helene.",
      "\u201cWe should definitely come back again,\u201d says Jess Jones, a 34-year-old marine biologist from Edinburgh, Scotland. \u201cThe vibe and the welcome that we got there was really nice.\u201d",
      "That the festival occurred at all is a tribute to the area\u2019s natural beauty, and the resilience of its people.",
      "Signs of progress are mixed with still-visible scars from Helene in this town about 24 miles (39 kilometers) east of Asheville. Most of Old Fort\u2019s shops have reopened, even as workers continue clawing away at a debris pile downtown and some homes remain unlivable.",
      "Like other businesspeople in this tourist-dependent mountain region, bike shop owner Chad Schoenauer has been banking on a strong fall leaf-peeping season to help get him back on track after Helene. But many seem to assume Old Fort is still a wasteland.",
      "\u201c\u2018Oh, I didn\u2019t know that you were open,\u2019\u201d he says is a typical reaction.",
      "When Helene swept through, Old Fort was well on its way to remaking itself as an outdoor destination, especially after furniture manufacturer Ethan Allen laid off 325 workers when it converted its factory there into a distribution center in 2019.",
      "\u201cWhen the Ethan Allen layoff happened, local leaders started coming together and saying, `How do we use these beautiful natural assets that we have to diversify the manufacturing economy?\u2019\u201d says Kim Effler, president and CEO of the McDowell Chamber of Commerce.",
      "Named for a Revolutionary War-era stockade, the town decided to become a world-class destination for hiking, running, horseback riding and, most notably, mountain biking.",
      "\u201cWe have a red clay that makes some of the best trails in the country,\u201d FloatLife founder Justyn Thompson says. \u201cThe trails are epic.\u201d",
      "In 2021, the G5 Trail Collective \u2014 a program led by the nonprofit Camp Grier outdoors complex \u2014 got the U.S. Forest Service to agree to 42 miles (68 kilometers) of new multi-purpose trails. The effort began paying dividends almost immediately.",
      "\u201cFor every trail that we were able to open, we saw a new business open up in town,\u201d says Jason McDougald, the camp\u2019s executive director.",
      "The collective had just completed the 21st mile (34th kilometer) of trail when Helene, in Schoenauer\u2019s words, hit \u201cthe reset button\u201d by washing away trails and damaging businesses.",
      "When the storm blew through on Sept. 27, 2024, the Catawba River converged with the normally placid Mill Creek, leaving much of downtown under several feet of muddy water.",
      "Schoenauer, who opened his Old Fort Bike Shop in 2021, says it took two days before he could make it to town to assess damage to the business housed in a refurbished 1901 former general store.",
      "\u201cI was numb coming all the way here,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd as soon as I got off the exit, I started crying.\u201d",
      "The water rose more than 3 feet (1 meter) inside the shop, leaving behind a 10-inch (25-centimeter) layer of reddish-brown mud. The beautiful heart pine floors buckled.",

      "\u201cWe had a septic field, a brand-new constructed septic field for the business that was destroyed,\u201d says Casey McKissick, who spent the last three years developing the bike park. \u201cNever been used; not even turned on yet. And it all went right down the river.\u201d",

CBP officials flagged the potential contamination to the FDA, which tested samples of the shrimp and detected cesium 137 in one sample of breaded shrimp.",
      "The company has sent about 84 million pounds (38 million kilograms) of shrimp to U.S. ports this year, according to data from Import Genius, a trade data analysis company. It supplies about 6% of foreign shrimp imported in the U.S.",
      "This month, FDA officials detected cesium 137 in one sample of cloves exported by PT Natural Java Spice, which sends spices to the U.S. and other countries. Records show the company sent about 440,000 pounds ( 200,000 kilograms) of cloves to the U.S. this year.",
      "No food that triggered alerts or tested positive has been released for sale in the U.S., FDA officials emphasized.",
      "But hundreds of thousands of packages of imported frozen shrimp sold at Kroger and other grocery stores across the U.S. have been recalled because they may have been manufactured under conditions that allowed them to be contaminated, the agency said.",

      "The nationwide audit of these licenses began after a fatal U-turn crash in Florida that killed two people caused by a truck driver who officials said was in the country illegally. But Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said fatal crashes caused by truck drivers who shouldn\u2019t have had licenses were also found in Texas and Alabama earlier this year.",
      "Duffy also threatened to revoke $160 million in federal funding for California because investigators found that one in four of the 145 commercial drivers licenses for non-citizens issued since June that they reviewed should have never been issued under the current rules.

      "All states must pause issuing commercial drivers licenses to non-citizens until they can comply with the new rules.",
      "Officials said the new rules would mean that roughly 190,000 of the 200,000 non-citizens that currently hold one of these commercial licenses should never have received one, but the rules aren't retroactive so those drivers won't lose their licenses. Only drivers who have either an H-2a, H-2b or E-2 visa will now be eligible to get a commercial driver's license. Just having an employment authorization document won't be enough.",

      "The Washington attorney who brokered book deals for Barack Obama, George W. Bush and dozens of other government leaders has died at age 79",
      "NEW YORK -- Robert B. Barnett, a powerhouse Washington attorney who became a fixture in the political and publishing worlds as the literary representative for Barack and Michelle Obama, Bill and Hillary Clinton and dozens of other leaders, has died at age 79.",
      "Barnett's executive assistant, Ashley Duffy, told The Associated Press that he died Thursday night. Additional details were not immediately available.",
      "A stocky, raspy-voiced man with tortoise shell glasses, antique cuff links and a knack for being both forthright and discrete, Bob Barnett embodied an era when it was possible to work freely with both Democrats and Republicans and politics could stop at the edge of a good book deal. He was a longtime Democrat, working on Jimmy Carter's 1976 campaign and helping Bill Clinton and other candidates in debate preparation. But he would broker contracts for such a wide range of political figures that he liked to joke that should his clients all gather in one room the result would be \u201cWorld War III.\u201d",
      "He was a partner at the high-end law firm Williams & Connolly, and for more than 20 years no one approached his stature as an intermediary between the Washington elite and New York publishers. From the early 1990s through the end of the Obama administration, in 2017, Barnett represented three consecutive presidents and first ladies \u2014 the Clintons, George W. and Laura Bush and the Obamas \u2014 and much of the remaining A-list political players, from Ted Kennedy and Mitch McConnell to Dick Cheney and Joe Biden, from Paul Ryan and Donald Rumsfeld to Al Franken and Elizabeth Warren.",
      "Barnett was called upon so often by politicians leaving office that he became known as \u201cthe doorman to Washington\u2019s revolving door.\u201d",
      "He was not an agent, he liked to point out, but an attorney who billed clients by the hour instead of receiving a percentage of royalties. It was a unique business arrangement that priced out the average writer, but well rewarded Obama, the Clintons and others who landed multi-million dollar deals.",
      "The general public could have made good money betting on Barnett's authors to prevail in elections. In six consecutive presidential races, from 1992-2012, a current or future Barnett client was elected, often defeating a non-Barnett client.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s one of the sagest advisers I\u2019ve ever been able to call upon,\u201d Republican strategist Karl Rove, a Barnett client and top aide to George W. Bush, told Politico in 2017. \u201cHe has counseled me on every professional decision I\u2019ve made.\"",
      "Barnett also handled negotiations for media executives and reporters (Roger Ailes, Bob Woodward, Chris Wallace), musical superstars (Elton John, Barbra Streisand), business leaders (Jack Welch, Phil Knight), international leaders (former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, Queen Noor of Jordan) and one of the world's best-selling novelists, James Patterson. For years, he was not only representing presidents, but Jake Tapper, Brit Hume and other White House reporters who covered them. One of the best-selling political novels in recent years, \u201cThe President Is Missing,\u201d was a collaboration conceived by Barnett for Patterson and Bill Clinton.",
      "His political winning streak ended after 2016 when non-client Donald Trump defeated Hillary Clinton. He was disdainful of Trump and eventually overtaken by the Creative Artists Agency and such younger Washington players as the Javelin literary agency.",
      "Asked in 2012 by the British law firm Chamber Associates how he wanted to be remembered, Barnett responded. \u201c\u2018He was loyal, kept confidences, and tried his best. He was a good husband, father, grandfather, counselor, and friend.\" Around the same time, Obama offered a wryer take, as recorded in Mark Leibovich\u2019s bestselling political chronicle \u201cThis Town.\u201d",

When Barnett prefaced one of his comments with \u201cthe conventional wisdom is,\u201d Obama responded, \u201cBob, you ARE the conventional wisdom.\u201d",
      "In 1972, Barnett married Rita Braver, a fellow graduate of the University of Wisconsin and a future CBS television correspondent. They had a daughter, Meredith.",
      "A native of Waukegan, Illinois, Robert Bruce Barnett graduated as senior class president from Waukegan High School, majored in political science at the University of Wisconsin and received a law degree from the University of Chicago. He moved to Washington in the early 1970s, clerking for Supreme Court Justice Byron White and working as aide to then-Sen. Walter Mondale of Minnesota. In 1975, he joined Williams & Connolly, and was made a partner three years later. Beyond his political clients, he also represented numerous corporations and businesses, including Deutsche Bank, McDonald's and JM Family Enterprises.",
      "Barnett did not plan his rise in book publishing. He had helped Vice Presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro prepare for her 1984 debate against George H.W. Bush, Ronald Reagan's vice president, and consulted with her when reports came out about her husband's alleged ties to organized crime. After the election, Ferraro asked him to help find a publisher for her memoir. Barnett, as inexperienced about publishing a book as Ferraro was about writing one, worked with New York agent Esther Newberg on a 7-figure deal with Bantam Books. Soon after, he arranged a lucrative deal for David Stockman, the first budget director in the Reagan administration.",
      "Among political leaders, he was especially close to the Clintons. They turned to him when White House aide and family friend Vince Foster killed himself in 1993 and when news broke that Bill Clinton had an affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky. His influence was never greater than in 2008, during the Democratic presidential primary. The main contenders were his longtime client, Hillary Clinton, and a new client, Obama, who had dropped his previous agent and turned to Barnett to make a deal for \u201cThe Audacity of Hope,\u201d one of history's bestselling political books and a key factor in his stunning rise.",
      "After a long and emotional primary campaign, Clinton, who had been heavily favored, conceded in June 2008 and began negotiating her role at the Democratic National Convention. The negotiations were handled by Barnett. By the end of the year, Obama had been elected (defeating the non-Barnett client Sen. John McCain) and Barnett was arranging a multi-million dollar deal for another client, the outgoing president, George W. Bush.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Senate Majority Leader John Thune is rejecting Democratic demands on health care as unserious but says a government shutdown is still \u201cavoidable\u201d despite sharp divisions ahead of Wednesday's funding deadline.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m a big believer that there\u2019s always a way out,\u201d the South Dakota Republican said in an interview with The Associated Press on Thursday. \u201cAnd I think there are off-ramps here, but I don\u2019t think that the negotiating position, at least at the moment, that the Democrats are trying to exert here is going to get you there.\u201d",
      "Thune said Democrats are going to have to \u201cdial back\u201d their demands, which include immediately extending health insurance subsidies and reversing the health care policies in the massive tax bill that Republicans passed over the summer. Absent that, Thune said, \u201cwe\u2019re probably plunging forward toward the shutdown.\u201d",
      "It's just the latest standoff in Washington over government funding, stretching back through several administrations. President Donald Trump was the driving force behind the longest shutdown ever during his first term, as he sought money for a U.S.-Mexico border wall. This time it is Democrats who are making demands as they face intense pressure from their core supporters to stand up to the Republican president and his policies.",
      "Democrats have shown little signs of relenting, just before spending runs out Wednesday. Their position remained the same even after the White House Office of Management and Budget on Wednesday released a memo that said agencies should consider a \u201creduction in force\u201d for many federal programs if the government closes \u2014 meaning thousands of federal workers could be permanently laid off.",
      "Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York said the OMB memo was simply an \u201cattempt at intimidation\u201d and predicted the \u201cunnecessary firings will either be overturned in court or the administration will end up hiring the workers back.\u201d",
      "Thune stopped short of criticizing the White House threat of mass layoffs, saying the situation remains \u201ca hypothetical.\u201d Still, he said no one should be surprised by the memo as \u201ceveryone knows Russ Vought,\u201d the head of the Office of Management and Budget, and his longtime advocacy for slashing government.",
      "\u201cBut it\u2019s all avoidable,\u201d Thune said. \u201cAnd so if they don\u2019t want to go down that path, there\u2019s a way to avoid going down that path.\u201d",
      "One way to avoid a shutdown, Thune said, would be for enough Democrats to vote with Republicans for a stripped-down \u201cclean\u201d bill to keep the government open for the next seven weeks while negotiations on spending continue. That\u2019s how Republicans avoided a shutdown in March, when Schumer and several other Democrats decided at the last minute to vote with Republicans \u2014 to great political cost when Schumer's party then revolted.",
      "A seven-week funding bill has already passed the House.",
      "\u201cWhat would eight Democrats be willing to support?\u201d Thune asked. \u201cIn terms of a path forward, or at least understanding what that path forward looks like.\u201d",

      "Republicans in the 100-member Senate need at least seven Democrats to vote with them to get the 60 votes necessary for a short-term funding package, and they may lose up to two of their own \u2014 Republican Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Rand Paul of Kentucky both opposed it in preliminary votes last week. A competing bill from Democrats also fell well short of 60 votes.",
      "Thune suggested some individual bipartisan bills to fund parts of the government for the next year could be part of a compromise, \u201cbut that requires cooperation from both sides,\u201d he said.",
      "Democrats say they are frustrated that Thune hasn\u2019t approached them to negotiate \u2014 and that Trump abruptly canceled a meeting with Schumer and House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York that had been scheduled for this week. Trump wrote on social media, \u201cI have decided that no meeting with their Congressional Leaders could possibly be productive.\u201d",
      "Thune said he \u201cdid have a conversation with the president\u201d and offered his opinion on the meeting, which he declined to disclose. \u201cBut I think the president speaks for himself, and I think he came to the conclusion that that meeting would not be productive,\u201d Thune said.",
      "Still, he says he thinks Trump could be open to a negotiation on the expanded health care subsidies that expire at the end of the year if Democrats weren't threatening a shutdown. Many people who receive the subsidies through the marketplaces set up by the Affordable Care Act are expected to see a sharp rise in premiums if Congress doesn\u2019t extend them.",
      "Some Republicans have agreed with Democrats that keeping the subsidies is necessary, but Thune says \u201creform is going to have to be a big part of it.\u201d Democrats are likely to oppose such changes.",
      "By Monday, when the Senate returns to session, lawmakers will have just over 24 hours to avoid federal closures.",
      "Thune said he intends to bring up the bills that were rejected last week. \u201cThey\u2019ll get multiple chances to vote,\u201d he said, before a government shutdown begins at midnight Wednesday.",
      "He said he hopes \u201ccooler heads will prevail.\u201d",

      "BAGHDAD -- BAGHDAD (AP) \u2014 Iraq will resume exporting oil from the country's northern, semiautonomous Kurdish region through Turkey\u2019s Ceyhan port after exports had been halted for more than two years, officials said Friday.",
      "The resumption, which starts on Saturday, is a step toward boosting Iraq\u2019s oil revenues and stabilizing the relationship between the central government in Baghdad and the Kurdish region, even as disputes over revenue sharing and field management persist.",
      "The exports stopped in early 2023 after the International Chamber of Commerce sided with Iraq in an arbitration case over the independent export of oil by the Kurdish regional government. Several previous attempts to reach a deal to resume exports fell through.",
      "Ali Nizar al-Shatari, head of Iraq\u2019s State Oil Marketing Organization, told The Associated Press that pumping will begin at 6 a.m. Saturday, with the agreed quantity set at 240,000 barrels per day.",
      "Between 180,000 and 190,000 barrels will actually be exported, while around 50,000 barrels will be used locally, within the Kurdish region.",
      "The resumption follows a tripartite agreement between the federal Oil Ministry, the Kurdish region's natural resources ministry, and international oil companies operating in the region. Companies operating in the Kurdistan Region will receive $16 per barrel to cover production and transportation costs, al-Shatari said.",
      "He said the United States supported and closely monitored the agreement. Iraq\u2019s export agreement with Turkey runs until July 2026, and discussions will be held with Ankara regarding its renewal, the Iraqi official added.",

      "DNO Executive Chairman Bijan Mossavar-Rahmani said the company has also launched a major production expansion program and is replacing equipment damaged during July drone attacks on its fields in Iraq.",
      "Officials in Baghdad and Irbil, the seat of the Kurdish regional government, have long been at odds over sharing of oil revenues. In 2014, the Kurdish region decided to unilaterally export oil through an independent pipeline to the Turkish port of Ceyhan.",
      "Iraq's central authorities have maintained it's illegal for the Kurdish region to export oil without going through the Iraqi national oil company, while Kurdish authorities said the practice was meant to compensate for budget transfers withheld from the Kurdish region by Baghdad.",

      "President Donald Trump is planning big tariffs on pharmaceuticals, kitchen counters, bathroom vanities, upholstered furniture and heavy trucks",
      "WASHINGTON -- Naturepedic, a mattress and furniture company based outside Cleveland, has been planning to introduce an upscale upholstered headboard late this year or early in 2026.",
      "But President Donald Trump has thrown those plans into disarray. On Thursday night, the president announced on social media that he was slapping a 30% tax on imported upholstered furniture. Naturepedic ships its headboards in from India and Vietnam.",
      "So what is the company to do?",
      "\u201cDo we continue forth ... and hope for the best?\u2019\u2019 asked Arin Schultz, Naturepedic\u2019s chief growth officer. \u201cOr do we feel like we\u2019re priced out and drop it altogether?\u2019\u2019 And if Naturepedic decides to continue with the rollout, \u201cdo we eat the cost or pass it on\u2019\u2019 to customers?",
      "Across the United States, lots of executives were asking themselves similar questions as they came to work Friday morning.",
      "Upholstered furniture, after all, wasn\u2019t the only import in Trump\u2019s crosshairs Thursday night. In addition, the president posted on his Truth Social platform, he\u2019s plastering import taxes \u2013 tariffs \u2013 of 100% on pharmaceutical drugs, 50% on kitchen cabinets and bathroom vanities and 25% on heavy trucks.",
      "And he\u2019s not waiting around to do it. The tariffs, he said, would take effect Wednesday.",
      "Trump also raised eyebrows by justifying the levy on vanities and sofas as necessary for national security. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to see how a kitchen cabinet industry is essential to winning the next war,\u2019\u2019 said Mary Lovely, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.",
      "Thursday\u2019s social media barrage was j ust the latest in Trump\u2019s push to upend American trade policy, which for decades pushed for lower trade barriers around the world.",
      "In place of an open market, Trump has built a tariff wall around the U.S. economy, slapping double-digit taxes on imports from almost every country on earth and targeting products (steel, aluminum, autos) with specific taxes of their own.",
      "Trump says the tariffs will protect U.S. industries from foreign competition, encourage companies to bring production to the United States and raise money for the U.S. Treasury.",
      "They certainly have become a moneymaker for the federal government. Since fiscal year 2025 began last Oct. 1, the U.S. Treasury has collected $172 billion in customs duties, up by $96 billion (or 126%) from the same period in fiscal 2024. Still, tariffs account for less than 4% of federal revenue.",
      "Businesses, lawyers and trade analysts are still wondering what to make of Trump\u2019s Thursday night tariffs. \u201cWe\u2019ve only seen the President\u2019s Truth Social posts,\u201d said Dan McCarthy, principal in McCarthy Consulting and a former official with the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative in the Biden administration. \u201cWe need to see the details.\u2019\u2019",
      "For example, Naturepedic isn\u2019t sure whether the 30% levy on upholstered furniture will be stacked atop a separate and earlier 50% tariff on goods from India.",
      "Here\u2019s what we know so far:",
      "The president has been threatening tariffs of 200% or more on pharmaceuticals. \u201cIt\u2019s to force Big Pharma to move jobs and put new factories into the U.S,\u2019\u2019 said Barry Appleton, a senior fellow at the Center for International Law at New York Law School. \u201cSo it\u2019s industrial policy.\u201d",
      "In recent decades, drugmakers have moved many operations overseas \u2013 to take advantage of lower costs in China and India and tax breaks in Ireland and Switzerland.",
      "The COVID-19 experience \u2013 when countries were desperate to hang onto their own medicine and medical supplies \u2014 underscored the dangers of relying on foreign countries in a crisis, especially when a key supplier is America\u2019s geopolitical rival China.",

      "The stock prices of pharmaceutical companies actually rose after Trump\u2019s announcement Thursday night. The 100% tariff was lower than it might have been. And Trump said the tariffs would not apply to companies \u201cbreaking ground\u201d or being \u201cunder construction.\u201d",
      "Several big drugmakers like Merck & Co. Inc., Eli Lilly and Co. and Johnson & Johnson have already announced U.S. expansion plans.",
      "In his tariff announcement, Trump did not mention generic drugs, which account for the vast majority of U.S. prescriptions.",
      "Still, analysts warn, the tariffs are likely to mean higher prices. \u201cThe people who are punished the most are Americans who need the drugs so badly, especially those who don\u2019t have full health care plans,\u201d Appleton said. He called the tariff is a \u201csimplistic but drastic\u201d approach to a complicated problem. \u201cWe don\u2019t know how it\u2019s going to go, but it doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s going to do well for consumers,\u201d he said.",
      "The tariffs on kitchen cabinets, bathroom vanities and upholstered furniture come as the White House is investigating whether imports of lumber and other wood products pose a threat to U.S. national security. A report on that investigation is due Nov. 26 and could mean more and broader tariffs.",
      "The levies are likely to hurt big furniture exporters China and Vietnam.",
      "But they\u2019re also likely to drive up the cost of new homes and apartments and of do-it-yourself redecorating projects.",
      "Homeowners are already scaling back due to high costs and a shaky economy. According to the Labor Department, the price of living room, kitchen and dining room furniture has risen nearly 10% over the past year.",
      "\u201cAdding significant costs to furniture, cabinets, vanities and building materials will make the American dream of owning a home significantly more expensive,\u201d said Jonathan Gold, the National Retail Federation\u2019s vice president of supply chain and customs policy. \u201cThe speed at which these tariff announcements are made and implemented continues to wreak havoc on retail supply chains. The uncertainty makes it difficult for retailers to properly plan and mitigate the impact of tariffs.\u201d",
      "Charles Clevenger, a supply chain specialist at the consultancy UHY, said tariffs on pharmaceuticals make sense because so much production has shifted away from the United States to Europe and Asia. Likewise, North Carolina and other states in the American South have also lost furniture factories to cheaper competitors in the China.",
      "But he was surprised by the tariffs on heavy trucks because \u201cwe do have a rather robust industry\u2019\u2019 \u2013 with manufacturers like Paccar (parent company of Peterbilt and Kenworth).",
      "But Appleton at New York Law School suspects the tariff is aimed at Mexico, where many heavy trucks are made. The U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, a trade deal negotiated in Trump\u2019s first term, is coming up for negotiation. \u201cI don\u2019t think that (the tariff) was done by accident, Appleton said. \u201cThey wanted to put some more pressure onto the Mexicans\u201d to make concessions in the talks.",
      "Using Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, Trump had launched investigations into whether imports of pharmaceuticals, lumber and heavy trucks posed a threat to U.S. national security.",
      "He\u2019d justified his broader tariffs another way: by declaring national emergencies under a 1977 law. But two courts have ruled that Trump overstepped his authority by invoking the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose import taxes. The Supreme Court is hearing the case on appeal.",
      "Robert Lawrence, a professor of International trade and investment at Harvard University, said that using Section 232 gives the president a Plan B if the courts strike down his IEEPA tariffs. \u201cHe now has insurance and shows that he\u2019s going to be able to get away with raising tariffs, even if he loses that case.\u201d",
      "But Ted Murphy, co-leader of the trade practice at the Sidley Austin law firm, said: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to discern much of a plan ... What the administration does is they identify a problem and then the solution is a big tariff. The question is whether that\u2019s really as nuanced or strategic as it could be. There could be a strategy but it\u2019s hard to discern from a tweet.\u2019\u2019",

      "The number of homes for sale in the District of Columbia, Maryland and Virginia region, also known as the DMV, is up by 64% since June 2024, and the region\u2019s unemployment rate is the highest in the nation, according to the DMV Monitor, a real-time data interactive created by the Brookings Institution with the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments.",
      "Washington has had the nation's highest seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for four straight months. The unemployment rate was 5.3% in January and ticked up to 6% in August, compared with the 4.3% national average, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data.",
      "From the start of President Donald Trump's second term in January, DOGE, led by his then-adviser Elon Musk, instigated purges of federal agencies with the expressed mission of rooting out fraud, waste and abuse. DOGE led to tens of thousands of job cuts, including layoffs and people who accepted financial incentives to quit. Some people were rehired, a reflection of the haphazard process. Although losses were felt around the country, the Washington area was particularly hard hit.",
      "Scott Kupor, director of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, said last month that there will be 300,000 fewer federal workers on the payroll nationwide by the end of the year. The government has about 2.5 million workers, including military members.",
      "Contractors have been affected, too. DOGE's website states that 13,231 federal government contracts have been terminated, totaling $59 billion in savings. In fiscal year 2024, more than 100,000 companies received contracts, totaling roughly $774 billion.",
      "Besides the mass layoffs, the Republican president's other actions to remake the image of the nation\u2019s capital \u2014 including deploying National Guard troops and federalizing the city\u2019s local Metropolitan Police Department \u2014 \u201ccould shape consumer spending and investment in the local economy,\u201d the report says.",
      "The report also says private-sector job growth is stagnating, \u201cwith many new jobs not aligned with the skills and experiences of most laid-off federal workers.\u201d",
      "\u201cAs a result,\u201d it says, \u201cjob postings were not as robust as they were in peer regions, which is concerning when unemployment has soared, especially in the suburbs.\u201d",
      "Taylor Rogers, a White House spokeswoman, said D.C. \u201chas often had the highest unemployment rate in the nation, even during Joe Biden\u2019s federal hiring frenzy.\u201d D.C.'s unemployment rate hit 11.3% at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic and fell to 5.3% at the end of Biden's presidency. \u201cThis longstanding problem is due to an overreliance on federal bloat and sky-high crime, two problems that President Trump is quickly and successfully fixing by cracking down on crime in the Nation\u2019s capital and implementing supply-side reforms that have already created over half a million private-sector jobs for American-born workers,\u201d Rogers said.",

      "It\u2019s been only a year since Hurricane Helene hammered the southeast U.S. from Florida to the Carolinas",
      "WOODFIN, N.C. -- Bracing himself against the current in waist-deep water, Clancy Loorham wrestles a broken length of PVC pipe from the rocky bottom of the French Broad River and peers inside.",
      "\u201cI got a catfish in the pipe,\u201d the 27-year-old with wispy beard and mustache shouted to fellow cleanup workers floating nearby in rafts, canoes and kayaks piled with plastic pipe and other human-made detritus. \u201cHe\u2019s right here. I\u2019m looking him in the eyes!\u201d",
      "It\u2019s been just a year since floodwaters from the remnants of Hurricane Helene washed these pipes out of a nearby factory with such force that some pieces ended up in Douglas Lake, about 90 miles (145 kilometers) away in Tennessee. But they're already slick with algae and filled with river silt \u2014 and creatures.",
      "Helene killed more than 250 people and caused nearly $80 billion in damage from Florida to the Carolinas. In the North Carolina mountains, rains of up to 30 inches (76 centimeters) turned gentle streams into torrents that swept away trees, boulders, homes and vehicles, shattered century-old flood records, and in some places carved out new channels.",
      "In the haste to rescue people and restore their lives to some semblance of normalcy, some fear the recovery efforts compounded Helene\u2019s impact on the ecosystem. Contractors hired to remove vehicles, shipping containers, shattered houses and other large debris from waterways sometimes damaged sensitive habitat.",
      "\u201cThey were using the river almost as a highway in some situations,\u201d said Peter Raabe, Southeast regional director for the conservation group American Rivers.",
      "Conservationists found instances of contractors cutting down healthy trees and removing live root balls, said Jon Stamper, river cleanup coordinator for MountainTrue, the North Carolina-based nonprofit conducting the French Broad work.",
      "\u201cThose trees kind of create fish habitats,\u201d he said. \u201cThey slow the flow of water down. They\u2019re an important part of a river system, and we\u2019ve seen kind of a disregard for that.\u201d",
      "The Army Corps of Engineers said in a statement that debris removal missions \u201care often challenging\u201d due to the large volume storms can leave behind across a wide area. The Corps said it trains its contractors to minimize disturbances to waterways and to prevent harm to wildlife. North Carolina Emergency Management said debris removal after Helene took into account safety and the environment, and that projects reimbursed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency met that agency\u2019s standards for minimizing impact.",
      "Hannah Woodburn, who tracks the headwaters and tributaries of the New River as MountainTrue's Upper New Riverkeeper, said waters are much muddier since Helene, both from storm-related vegetation loss and from heavy machinery used during cleanup.",
      "She said it's been bad for the eastern hellbender, a \u201cspecies of special concern\u201d in North Carolina. It's one of only three giant salamanders found in the world, growing up to 2 feet (61 centimeters) long and weighing more than 3 pounds (1.4 kilograms).",
      "\u201cAfter the storm, we had so many reports and pictures of dead hellbenders, some nearly a mile from the stream once the waters receded,\u201d said Woodburn.",
      "Of even greater concern is the Appalachian elktoe, a federally endangered mussel found only in the mountains of North Carolina and eastern Tennessee. Helene hurt the Appalachian elktoe, but it also suffered from human-caused damage, said Mike Perkins, a state biologist.",
      "Perkins said some contractors coordinated with conservation teams ahead of river cleanups and took precautions. Others were not so careful.",
      "He described snorkeling in the cold waters of the Little River and \u201cfinding crushed individuals, some of them still barely alive, some with their insides hanging out.\u201d On that river, workers moved 60 Appalachian elktoe to a refuge site upstream. On the South Toe River, home to one of the most important populations, biologists collected a dozen and took them to a hatchery to store in tanks until it's safe to return them to the wild.",
      "\u201cIt was shocking and unprecedented in my professional line of work in 15 years,\u201d Perkins said of the incident. \u201cThere\u2019s all of these processes in place to prevent this secondary tragedy from happening, and none of it happened.\u201d",

      "With the land paid for and no flood insurance payment to move away, they decided to stay put.",
      "\u201cWhen you own it and you\u2019re not rich, you know, you can\u2019t,\u201d Vickie Revis said, staring across the river at a row of condemned commercial buildings.",
      "After a year in a donated camper, they'll soon move into their new house \u2014 a double-wide modular home, also donated by a local Christian charity. It sits atop a 6-foot mound that Paul Revis piled up near the front of the property, farther from the river.",
      "Using rock, fill dirt and broken concrete dumped on his property by friendly debris-removal contractors, Paul has reclaimed the frontage the Swannanoa took. His wife planted it with marigolds for beauty and a weeping willow for stability. And they've purchased flood insurance.",

      "WASHINGTON -- A bipartisan group of former Federal Reserve chairs, Treasury secretaries, and top White House economists urged the Supreme Court Thursday to reject an attempt by President Donald Trump to fire Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook.",
      "In a filing with the court, the former officials argued that allowing the removal to proceed would undermine the Fed's longtime independence from day-to-day politics and lead to higher inflation and a weaker economy.",
      "The filing from such an influential group underscores the unpredecented nature of Trump's effort to remove Cook and the potentially far-reaching consequences for the economy if he were to succeed.",
      "\u201cThere is broad consensus among economists, based on decades of macroeconomic research, that a more independent central bank will lead to lower and more stable inflation without creating higher unemployment,\u201d the brief, signed by 18 top economists from both political parties, said. \u201cIndependent central banks also help increase confidence in the stability of the U.S. dollar, enabling the United States, businesses, and households to borrow at lower interest rates.\u201d",
      "Former Fed chairs Janet Yellen, Ben Bernanke, and Alan Greenspan signed onto the filing. Former Treasury Secretaries Henry Paulson, Lawrence Summers, Robert Rubin, Timothy Geithner, and Jacob Lew also signed. Paulson served in the George W. Bush administration while Rubin and Summers served in Bill Clinton's administration. Geithner and Lew served in President Barack Obama's White House.",
      "Trump sought to fire Lisa Cook last month after members of the administration accused her of mortgage fraud, the first time a president has tried to remove a Federal Reserve governor in the institution's 112-year history. Cook has denied the accusations and some documents have surfaced that appear to undercut the fraud claims.",
      "Cook sued to keep her job and two federal courts have ruled that she can stay in her position while her case is considered by the courts.",
      "Federal Reserve officials aren't like cabinet secretaries and don't serve at the pleasure of the president. Instead, they can only be fired \u201cfor cause,\u201d which has traditionally meant some kind of malfeasance or neglect on the job. At issue in the legal fight is whether the mortgage fraud allegations are sufficient cause for her to be removed. Governors vote on the Fed's interest-rate policies as well as oversee banking regulation.",
      "Bernanke and the other former officials argued in their filing that the perception of Fed independence is crucial for the central bank, because it can fight inflation much more effectively if businesses and workers \u2014 whom the filing refers to as \u201cprice-setters\u201d \u2014 believe the Fed will fight to keep inflation at its 2% target.",

The Fed typically seeks to combat inflation by raising its short-term interest rate to cool borrowing and spending.",
      "But if political pressure forces the Fed to shift its focus away from inflation and instead lower its key interest rate to provide a short-term boost to the economy, \u201cthe price-setters will not believe a future Fed announcement of a commitment to low-inflation policies and will therefore not structure their own economic decisions around the expectation of low inflation,\" the brief said. \u201cInstead, price-setters will expect inflation to go up and act accordingly, leading to a vicious cycle of high inflation and low employment.\u201d",
      "\u201cCentral bank independence is the solution that Congress and the President have chosen, effectively tying their hands, like Ulysses as he passed the sirens, to protect against the risk that monetary policy will be mishandled,\u201d they added.",
      "Former officials from both parties also signed onto the brief, including Phil Gramm, a former Republican senator from Texas, as well as Jason Furman, who was a top economic adviser to Obama; Glenn Hubbard and Gregory Mankiw, economic advisers to George W. Bush; Kenneth Rogoff, former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund; and Cecilia Rouse, a top adviser to former president Joe Biden.",
      "John Cochrane, a frequent Fed critic and a senior fellow at the right-leaning Hoover Institution signed onto the brief, as did Jared Bernstein, an adviser to Biden.",
      "The Trump administration appealed the case to the Supreme Court after an appeals court upheld an earlier court ruling that allowed Cook to keep her job. The administration argues that the allegations of mortgage fraud provide the president with sufficient cause to remove Cook from a position that included oversight of the financial system.",

      "Cincinnati\u2019s win and New York\u2019s 6-2 loss to Miami enabled the Reds to tie the Mets in the standings. However, the Reds \u2014 vying for their first postseason berth since 2020 \u2014 own the head-to-head tiebreaker over the Mets.",
      "The Reds allowed just three hits and handed a rare loss to Milwaukee\u2019s Quinn Priester, who had set a Brewers record by winning 12 straight decisions. The Brewers had won the last 19 games in which Priester had pitched, a stretch including 16 starts and three appearances in which he followed an opener.",
      "Priester (13-3) struck out four and allowed three runs, nine hits and one walk in five innings. The last time the Brewers lost a game Priester had pitched was May 24 against the Pittsburgh Pirates.",
      "The score was tied 1-all in the sixth when Lux hit a leadoff double and advanced to third when the ball got past left fielder Jake Bauers. Miguel Andujar singled home Lux and scored an insurance run on Tyler Stephenson\u2019s sacrifice fly.",
      "Connor Phillips (5-0) earned the win with 1 1/3 scoreless innings in relief of Zack Littell, who allowed one run over 4 2/3 innings. Emilio Pagan retired the side in order in the ninth for his 31st save in 37 opportunities.,",
      "The Brewers could have clinched the best record in the majors and guaranteed themselves home-field advantage throughout the playoffs with a win. Milwaukee still can earn that status if it wins one of its last two games or Philadelphia loses one of its final two games.",

He pitched eight innings for the first time since he tossed a shutout against the New York Mets in May 2024. Nola also struck out Edouard Julien to end the fifth inning for his 1,872nd career strikeout, putting him second behind Hall of Famer Steve Carlton on the franchise\u2019s list.",

      "HARRISBURG, Pa. -- Private investment firms that are helping finance America\u2019s artificial intelligence race and the huge buildout of energy-hungry data centers are getting interested in the local utilities that deliver electricity to regular customers \u2014 and the servers that power AI.",
      "Billions of dollars from such firms are now flowing toward electric utilities in places including New Mexico, Texas, Wisconsin and Minnesota that deliver power to more than 150 million customers across millions of miles of power lines.",
      "\u201cThe reason is very simple: because there\u2019s a lot of money to be made,\u201d said Greg Brown, a University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill professor of finance who researches private equity and hedge funds.",
      "Private investment firms that have done well investing in infrastructure over the last 15 years now have strong incentives to add data centers, power plants and the services that support them at a time of rapid expansion and spiking demand ignited by the late 2022 debut of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT, Brown said.",
      "BlackRock's CEO Larry Fink said as much in a July interview on CNBC, saying infrastructure is \u201cat the beginning of a golden age.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe believe that there\u2019s a need for trillions of dollars investing in infrastructure related to our power grids, AI, the whole digitization of the economy\" and energy, Fink said.",
      "In recent weeks, private equity firm Blackstone has sought regulatory approval to buy out a pair of utilities, Albuquerque-based Public Service Company of New Mexico and Lewisville, Texas-based Texas New Mexico Power Co.",
      "Wisconsin earlier this year granted the buyout of the parent of Superior Water, Light and Power and the owner of Northern Indiana Public Service Co. last year sold a 19.9% stake in the utility to Blackstone.",
      "However, a fight has erupted in Minnesota over the buyout of the parent of Duluth-based Minnesota Power and the outcome could determine how such firms expand their holdings in an industry that's a nexus between regular people, gargantuan data centers and the power sources they share.",
      "Under the proposed deal, a BlackRock subsidiary and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board would buy out the publicly traded Allete, parent of Minnesota Power, which provides power to 150,000 customers and owns a variety of power sources, including coal, gas, wind and solar.",
      "Both sides of the fight have attracted influential players ahead of a possible Oct. 3 vote by the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission. Raising the stakes is the potential that Google could build a data center there, a lucrative prospect for whoever owns Minnesota Power.",
      "Opponents of the acquisition suspect that BlackRock is only interested in squeezing bigger profits from regular ratepayers. Allete makes the opposite argument, that BlackRock can show more patience because it is free of the short-term burdens of publicly traded companies.",
      "Opponents also worry that a successful Minnesota Power buyout will launch more such deals around the U.S. and drive up electric bills for homes.",
      "\u201cIt's no secret that private equity is extremely aggressive in chasing profits, and when it comes to utilities, the profit motive lands squarely on the backs of ratepayers who don\u2019t have a choice of who they buy their electricity from,\u201d said Karlee Weinmann of the Energy and Policy Institute, which pushes utilities to keep rates low and use renewable energy sources.",
      "The buyout proposals come at a time when electricity bills are rising fast across the U.S., and growing evidence suggests that the bills of some regular Americans are rising to subsidize the rapid buildout of power plants and power lines to supply the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech\u2019s data centers.",

      "That's because electric utilities are seen as valuable long-term investments that earn around 10% returns not on the electricity they deliver, but the upcharge that utility regulators allow on capital investments, like upgrading poles, wires and substations.",
      "That gives utility owners the incentive to spend more so they can make more money, critics say.",
      "The fight over Minnesota Power resembles some of the battles erupting around the U.S. where residents don\u2019t want a data center campus plunked down next to them.",
      "Building trades unions and the administration of Democratic Gov. Tim Walz, who appointed or reappointed all five utility commissioners, are siding with Allete and BlackRock.",
      "On the other side are the state attorney general\u2019s office and the industrial interests that buy two-thirds of Minnesota Power's electricity, including U.S. Steel and other owners of iron ore mines, Enbridge-run oil pipelines and pulp and paper mills.",
      "In its petition, Allete told regulators that, under BlackRock's ownership, Minnesota Power's operations, strategy and values wouldn't change and that it doesn't expect the buyout price \u2014 $6.2 billion, including $67 a share for stockholders at a 19% premium \u2014 to affect electric rates.",
      "In essence, Allete \u2014 which solicited bids for a buyout \u2014 argues that BlackRock's ownership will benefit the public because, under it, the utility will have an easier time raising the money it needs to comply with Minnesota\u2019s law requiring utilities to get 100% of their electricity from carbon-free sources by 2040.",
      "Allete has projected needing to spend $4.3 billion on transmission and clean energy projects over five years.",
      "However, opponents say Allete's suggestion that it'll struggle to raise money is unfounded, and undercut by its own filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in which it says it is \u201cwell positioned\u201d to meet its financing needs.",
      "It hasn't been smooth sledding for BlackRock.",
      "In July, an administrative law judge, Megan J. McKenzie, recommended that the commission reject the deal, saying that the evidence reveals the buyout group's \u201cintent to do what private equity is expected to do \u2013 pursue profit in excess of public markets through company control.\u201d",
      "In recent days, a utility commission staff analysis echoed McKenzie's concerns.",
      "They suggested that private investors could simply load up Minnesota Power's parent with massive debts, borrow at a relatively low interest rate and turn a fat profit margin from the utility commission granting a generous rate of return.",
      "\u201cFor the big investors in private equity, this is a win-win,\u201d the staff wrote. \u201cFor the ratepayers of the highly leveraged utility, this represents paying huge profits to the owners if the private equity \u2018wins\u2019 and dealing with a bankrupt utility provider if it loses \u2013 it is a lose-lose.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "Rep. John Moolenaar has requested an urgent briefing from the White House after Trump supported a deal giving Americans a majority stake in TikTok",
      "WASHINGTON -- The chairman of a House committee that pushed for the law demanding TikTok be spun off from its Chinese owners has requested an urgent briefing from the White House, one day after Trump signed an executive order supporting a proposed deal that would put the popular social video platform under U.S. ownership.",
      "In a statement released Friday, Rep. John Moolenaar, the chairman of the Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, praised the proposed deal as \"an important step\u201d in transitioning ownership of the TikTok platform to American hands but he emphasized that \u201cdivestment was not the law's only requirement.\u201d",
      "\u201cThe law also set firm guardrails that prohibit cooperation between ByteDance and any prospective TikTok successor on the all-important recommendation algorithm, as well as preclude operational ties between the new entity and ByteDance,\u201d Moolenaar said.",
      "The Michigan Republican's statement marks the first congressional effort to conduct oversight into the negotiations over TikTok, coming nearly two weeks after Chinese and American officials met in Spain to discuss a framework divestment deal for TikTok. Trump on Thursday signed an executive order providing support for the deal, and said Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to move forward with negotiations.",
      "The White House didn't immediately respond to an inquiry from the Associated Press regarding the urgent briefing.",
      "Much is still unknown about the actual deal in the works, but the new U.S. venture would license the famed ByteDance-owned algorithm that currently keeps TikTok users engaged. U.S. tech giant Oracle, a confirmed partner in the U.S. investment consortium that would own TikTok, would audit the copy of the algorithm and monitor it for security purposes.",
      "Vice President JD Vance on Thursday assured the public that the deal would not only keep TikTok operating but also protect Americans' data privacy as required by law. Moolenaar on Friday said he would like to know more.",
      "While algorithms are valuable assets, the real value of TikTok is its users, which is likely why the consortium won\u2019t just start from scratch to build a new app, said computer scientist Bart Knijnenburg, an associate professor at Clemson University who has studied how recommendation systems steer people to online content.",
      "Knijnenburg said all algorithms are biased in some way and if the administration is serious about retraining the TikTok algorithm to avoid Chinese influence, it should push for \u201cradical openness\u201d in TikTok\u2019s mechanics so that users have a window into how bias might be influencing their feeds.",
      "More than politics, Knijnenburg said the biggest problem with TikTok\u2019s algorithm is that it\u2019s geared toward addictive engagement and overuse.",
      "\u201cMoving it to the U.S. is not going to magically solve these types of problems,\u201d he said. \u201cAny company might put undue influence on these applications and from a business perspective, the best way to engage users is to make them addicted to watching these videos, which is not a good idea.\u201d",
      "Craig Singleton, senior China fellow at the Washington-based think tank Foundation for Defense of Democracies, doubts that the deal, as revealed so far, complies with the law.",
      "\u201cThe law is clear: divestiture means severance, not supervision,\u201d Singleton said. \u201cA board seat for ByteDance or any continued role in maintaining the algorithm would flout Congress\u2019s mandate.\"",
      "Though the details have yet to be finalized, the U.S. investment group\u2019s controlling stake in the new venture would be around 80%. While ByteDance is expected to have a stake in the new venture, it would be less than 20% \u2014 a portion of the ownership reserved for foreign investors. The board running the new platform would be controlled by U.S. investors. ByteDance will be represented by one person on the board, but that individual will be excluded from any security-related matters.",

      "Singleton argues that a board foothold by ByteDance is not merely symbolic. \u201cByteDance\u2019s reported role as the largest single shareholder in a restructured TikTok U.S. venture, combined with a board seat, ensures continuing Chinese influence over the app,\u201d he said. \u201cPlainly put, ByteDance on the board means Beijing in the building.\u201d",
      "Vance said he expects the new U.S.-based TikTok to be valued at about $14 billion, describing it as a \u201cgood deal\u201d for investors who must ultimately decide \u201cwhat they want to invest in and what they think is the proper value.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s a \u201csurprisingly low\u201d valuation, said Daniel Keum, a management professor at Columbia University\u2019s business school.",
      "Keum said it\u2019s possible that \u201cpolitics overrode the business case\u201d or that the licensing structure, which hasn\u2019t yet been disclosed, could have been designed with high fees or profit-sharing that depressed the value of TikTok\u2019s app in the U.S.",
      "Keum said TikTok had an early edge in attracting youth to its innovative video-sharing format, but its competitiveness has \u201cfundamentally eroded\u201d as social media creators and influencers increasingly post their videos on many different apps.",
      "As TikTok\u2019s popularity soared among young Americans in the past several years, U.S. lawmakers grew concerned that Beijing \u2014 viewed by many on the Capitol Hill as the biggest geopolitical rival to the U.S. \u2014 could use the platform to influence public discourse in the United States.",
      "\u201cByteDance has shown time and again that it is a bad actor, and the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s ultimate goal is to see America divided and weakened,\u201d Moolenaar said in his statement. \u201cThat is why, on an overwhelming bipartisan basis, Congress required ByteDance to divest control of TikTok.\u201d",
      "President Joe Biden signed legislation passed by Congress last year that would ban TikTok unless ByteDance sold its U.S. assets to an American company by early this year. The U.S. Supreme Court in January unanimously upheld the TikTok law.",
      "Trump, after he returned to the White House, has repeatedly signed orders that have allowed TikTok to keep operating in the U.S. as his administration tries to reach an agreement for the sale of the company.",
      "On Friday, the Chinese Foreign Ministry didn't provide any new information but repeated China's position on TikTok.",
      "\u201cThe Chinese government respects the will of enterprises and welcomes them to conduct sound commercial negotiations based on market rules, reaching solutions that comply with Chinese laws and regulations and achieve a balanced outcome of interests,\u201d said Guo Jiakun, a ministry spokesperson. \"We hope the U.S. will provide an open, fair, and non-discriminatory business environment for Chinese enterprises investing in the United States.\u201d",

Others share knowledge on social media, and experienced foragers offer training to novices on safe and sustainable practices.",
      "The renewed interest ranges from those wanting to be budget-conscious \u2014 foraging is free after all \u2014 to those wanting to be more mindful of their environmental footprint. Some even use foraging as a creative outlet, using mushrooms they find to create spore prints and other art.",

      "World Gorilla Day is observed on September 24",
      "BWINDI, Uganda -- Sept. 24 is observed as World Gorilla Day. It was launched in 2017 to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the establishment of a Rwanda-based gorilla study center founded by Dian Fossey, the American primatologist and conservationist who gained global renown for her research.",
      "The gorillas Fossey studied and looked after were mountain gorillas that belong to the species known as the eastern gorilla and live mostly in the Virunga Massif, a mountainous area encompassing parts of Congo, Rwanda and Uganda. The second species, known as the western gorilla, inhabits areas of west and central Africa.",
      "Gorillas are losing their habitat because of poaching and other threats. The International Union for Conservation of Nature lists both gorilla species as endangered, with three of four subspecies critically endangered.",
      "Here are some things to know about the great apes:",
      "Humans share much of their DNA with gorillas, and scientists cite figures showing up to 98% similarity. \u201cGorillas are humans\u2019 closest living relatives after chimpanzees, and are of comparable importance for the study of human origins and evolution,\u201d according to the science journal Nature. This kinship with humans is one reason gorillas are susceptible to infections spread through close contact with tourists, researchers and others who come near them. Gorillas are especially vulnerable to the influenza virus, and respiratory illnesses are a frequent cause of death among adult gorillas.",
      "Visitors tracking gorillas in the wild are usually urged to stand at least 7 meters (yards) from the primates \u2014 as well as not to touch them even if they wander, as they sometimes do, closer to people. In her lifetime, Fossey worried that gorilla tourism was injurious to the well-being of gorillas because it might alter their behavior in the wild, but tourism-driven gorilla conservation projects in countries such as Uganda has proved successful over the years.",

      "Gorillas in the wild live in families, with the dominant male \u2014 known as the silverback because of the patch of silvery fur on his back \u2014 as the head of the group. He can co-exist with younger males, who defer to him, as well as many females, juveniles and infants.",
      "Uganda's Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, home to many of the world's remaining gorillas, has 27 families considered \u201chabituated,\u201d trained to appear comfortable in the presence of humans. Most silverbacks are known to be protective of their families. The silverback in one of the Bwindi families is named Murinzi, a local word for \u201cprotector,\u201d because rangers have seen him to be quite solicitous.",
      "To assert their authority, silverbacks sometimes stand on their hind legs, beat their chests and vocalize, sending younger males in flight and warning rivals from other groups. Gorilla mothers are just as generous with their offspring, and the \u201clove they show for their youngsters is undeniably deep and evident to everyone lucky enough to observe it,\u201d according to the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund, a charity working to protect the primates. Gorillas can live for over 40 years in the wild.",
      "The powerful majesty of gorillas in the wild is one reason they fascinate tourists. But while they are the largest living primates, they can also seem gentle and meek. An average silverback can weigh up to 180 kilograms (396 pounds). Herbivorous creatures, gorillas eat mostly leaves and the shoots and stems of plants. They may also eat ants and snails.",
      "The International Gorilla Conservation Program says the main threat to gorillas is habitat loss from the clearance of the forested ecosystems they inhabit. \u201cConversion of land for agriculture and competition for limited natural resources such as firewood lead to varying degrees of deforestation,\u201d according to the group, a coalition of conservation nonprofits focusing on the survival of mountain gorillas.",

      "NEW YORK -- Soon people will be able to use satellite technology and artificial intelligence to track dangerous soot pollution in their neighborhoods \u2014 and where it comes from \u2014 in a way not so different from monitoring approaching storms under plans by a nonprofit coalition led by former Vice President Al Gore.",
      "Gore, who started Climate TRACE, which uses satellites to monitor the location of heat-trapping methane sources, on Wednesday expanded his system to track the source and plume of pollution from tiny particles, often referred to as soot, on a neighborhood basis for 2,500 cities across the world. Particle pollution kills millions of people worldwide each year \u2014 and tens of thousands in the United States \u2014 according to scientific studies and reports.",
      "Gore's coalition uses 300 satellites, 30,000 ground-tracking sensors and artificial intelligence to track 137,095 sources of particle pollution, with 3,937 of them categorized as \u201csuper emitters\u201d for how much they spew. Users can look at long-term trends, but in about a year Gore hopes these can become available daily so they can be incorporated into weather apps, like allergy reports.",
      "It\u2019s not just seeing the pollutants. The website shows who is spewing them.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s difficult, before AI, for people to really see precisely where this conventional air pollution is coming from,\u201d Gore said. \u201cWhen it\u2019s over in their homes and in their neighborhoods and when people have a very clear idea of this, then I think they\u2019re empowered with the truth of their situation. My faith tradition has always taught me you will know the truth and the truth shall set you free.\u201d",

      "PARIS -- A lifelong fan of \u201cTomb Raider,\u201d French gamer Romain Bos was on tenterhooks when an update of the popular video game went online in August.",
      "But his excitement quickly turned to anger.",
      "The gamer's ears \u2014 and those of other \u201cTomb Raider\" fans \u2014 picked up something amiss with the French-language voice of Lara Croft, the game\u2019s protagonist.",
      "It sounded robotic, lifeless even \u2014 shorn of the warmth, grace and believability that French voice actor Fran\u00e7oise Cadol has given to Croft since she started playing the character in 1996.",
      "Gamers and Cadol herself came to the same conclusion: A machine had cloned her voice and replaced her.",
      "\u201cIt's pathetic,\" says Cadol, who straight away called her lawyer. \u201cMy voice belongs to me. You have no right to do that.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt was absolutely scandalous,\u201d says Bos. \u201cIt was artificial intelligence.\u201d",
      "Aspyr, the game developer based in Austin, Texas, didn\u2019t respond to e-mailed questions from The Associated Press. But it acknowledged in a post last week on its website that what it described as \u201cunauthorized AI generated content\u201d had been incorporated into its Aug. 14 update of \u201cTomb Raider IV\u2013VI Remastered\" that angered fans.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve addressed this issue by removing all AI voiceover content,\u201d Aspyr's post said. \u201cWe apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused.\u201d",
      "Still, the affair has triggered alarms in the voiceover community, with campaigners saying it's a sobering example of dangers that AI poses to human workers and their jobs.",
      "\u201cIf we can replace actors, we\u2019ll be able to replace accountants, and a whole range of other professions that could also be automated,\" says Patrick Kuban, a French-language voice actor who is also a co-president of United Voice Artists, an international federation of voiceover artists.",
      "\"So we need to ask ourselves the right questions: How far should we go, and how do we regulate these machines?\"",
      "Hollywood has seen similar concerns, with video game performers striking for 11 months for a new contract this year that included AI guardrails.",
      "\u201cThis is happening pretty much everywhere. We\u2019re getting alerts from all over the world \u2014 from Brazil to Taiwan,\u201d Kuban said in an Associated Press interview.",

      "\u201cActors\u2019 voices are being captured, either to create voice clones \u2014 not perfect ones \u2014 but for illicit use on social media by individuals, since there are now many apps for making audio deepfakes,\" Kuban said.",
      "\u201cThese voices are also being used by content producers who aren\u2019t necessarily in the same country,\" he said. \u201cSo it\u2019s very difficult for actors to reclaim control over their voices, to block these uses.\u201d",
      "Cadol says that within minutes of the release of the \u201cTomb Raider\u201d update, her phone began erupting with messages, emails and social media notifications from upset fans.",
      "\u201cI took a look and I saw all this emotion \u2014 anger, sadness, confusion. And that's how I found out that my voice had been cloned,\u201d she said in an AP interview.",
      "Cadol says 12 years of recording French-language voiceovers for Lara Croft \u2014 from 1996 to 2008 \u2014 built an intimate bond with her fans. She calls them the \u201cguardians\u201d of her work.",
      "Once the initial shock subsided, she resolved to fight back. Her Paris lawyer, Jonathan Elkaim, is seeking an apology from Aspyr and financial redress.",
      "In the update, new chunks of voiceover appear to have been added to genuine recordings that Cadol says she made years ago.",
      "Most notably, fans picked up on one particularly awkward segment. In it, a voice instructs players how to use their game controllers to make Lara Croft climb onto an obstacle, intoning in French: \u201cPlace toi devant et appuyez sur avancer\u201d \u2014 Stand in front and press \u2018advance.'",
      "Not only does it sound clunky but it also rings as grammatically incorrect to French speakers \u2014 mixing up the polite and less polite forms of language that they use, depending on who they're addressing.",
      "Gamers were up in arms. Bos posted a video on his YouTube channel that same evening, lamenting: \"It\u2019s half Fran\u00e7oise Cadol, half AI. It\u2019s horrible ! Why have they done that?\u201d",
      "\u201cI was really disgusted,\u201d the 34-year-old said in an AP interview. \u201cI grew up with Fran\u00e7oise Cadol's voice. I've been a \u2018Tomb Raider\u2019 fan since I was young kid.\"",
      "\u201cLara Croft is a bit \u2014 how should I say \u2014 a bit sarcastic at times in some of her lines. And I think Fran\u00e7oise played that very, very well,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s exactly why now is the time to set boundaries,\" he added. \u201cIt\u2019s so that future generations also have the chance to experience talented actors.\"",

      "Estonia is extending a fence along its border with Russia and building anti-tank ditches and bunkers in preparation for a potential conflict with Moscow",
      "VINSKI, Estonia -- Estonia is extending a fence along its border with Russia and building anti-tank ditches and bunkers in preparation for a potential conflict with Moscow. But those defenses won\u2019t guard against the threat it and its NATO allies face from Russian drones and electronic warfare.",
      "From the Baltic to the Black Sea, countries bordering Russia, Belarus and Ukraine are facing the spillover from Moscow's war in Ukraine.",
      "The incursion of about 20 Russian drones into Poland this month shone a spotlight on holes in NATO's air defenses, as multimillion-dollar jets had to be scrambled to respond to drones that cost thousands and that ended up crashing into the Polish countryside. Russia denied that it targeted Poland, but Polish officials suggested it was intentional.",
      "Faced with a growing problem, some EU defense ministers will meet Friday to discuss creating a \u201cdrone wall.\"",
      "NATO warned Russia on Tuesday that it would defend against any further breaches of its airspace after Estonia said Russian fighter jets violated it last week. But although the alliance knows how to identify threats from jets and missiles, dealing with drones is a greater challenge, officials said.",
      "In Poland, \u201cmost of the drones were not detected,\" said Hanno Pevkur, Estonia\u2019s defense minister. \u201cThis is a real gap we have to solve.\u201d",
      "Military and defense officials from the Baltic countries of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania \u2014 NATO and EU members that border Russia \u2014 told The Associated Press that defending against drones requires solving a complex set of technological, financial and bureaucratic problems.",
      "Europe needs cheaper technology to buy and to speed up slow production and procurement cycles, they said. But even then, drone technology is advancing so quickly that anything bought now could be outdated in months.",
      "\u201cWhat I need,\u201d said Lt. General Andrus Merilo who commands Estonia's military, is technology that is \u201cgood enough, it\u2019s affordable and can be produced in mass.\u201d",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t need high-end capabilities of which I can fire only one, against targets which will be attacking in hundreds,\u201d he said.",
      "Russia is using drones every night in Ukraine because each drone is a \u201clottery ticket that always wins,\u201d said Kusti Salm a former top official at Estonia\u2019s Defense Ministry.",
      "That\u2019s because a drone either hits something or, if Ukraine shoots it down with a missile, it drains Kyiv's air defenses and finances, since missiles are more expensive than drones, said Salm who now runs Frankenburg Technologies, a company developing low-cost anti-drone missiles.",
      "Although NATO countries have a \u201cvery good understanding\u201d of how to defend against conventional threats such as missiles and planes, they need to rapidly improve at dealing with drone threats, said Tomas Godliauskas, Lithuania\u2019s vice-minister of national defense.",
      "When the Russian drones flew into Poland, NATO nations deployed fighter jets and attack helicopters and put missile defense systems on alert. But none of those options was specifically designed for drone warfare.",
      "Although Russia and Ukraine have been firing more and more drones at each other, there has been less investment in counter-drone systems, said Salm. He suggested that's partly because it's easier to get a drone to fly than it is to develop something to detect or intercept it.",
      "Slow, low-flying drones made from wood, fiberglass, plastic or polystyrene might not be detected by radar systems searching for a fast-moving missile made of metal, or they might look like birds or a plane. Enemy operatives can also bypass defenses by launching drones from inside a country, as Ukraine did to devastating effect when it attacked Russian airfields this year.",
      "There are also other technological hurdles, including trying to jam the enemy\u2019s drones and communications without cutting your own, Merilo said.",
      "In August, a Ukrainian drone \u2014 possibly sent off course by Russian electronic jamming \u2014 landed in a field in southeastern Estonia. It crashed because the military wasn't capable of detecting it, Merilo said.",

      "There is growing support among European leaders for establishing some sort of drone wall along the EU\u2019s eastern border, though the bloc in March denied funding to a joint Estonia-Lithuania proposal to establish one.",
      "The EU needs to prioritize funding for the project, said Pevkur. But although support for the idea is growing, actually creating a drone defense system won't be easy.",
      "\u201cDrones are not mosquitoes,\u201d the Estonian minister said, suggesting they would be unlikely to be zapped by an \u201celectronic wall\u201d along NATO\u2019s borders.",
      "There are many types of drones, including those used for intelligence and reconnaissance, that fly at high-altitude, that are used in attacks, or that even remain attached to a thin fiber-optic cable while flying, making them impossible to jam. Russia also uses decoy drones in Ukraine that carry no payload and are designed to exhaust air defenses.",
      "Any plan to defend against drones needs a multilayered approach including sensors, \u201celectronic warfare \u2026 also low-cost small missiles or attack drones,\u201d said Merilo.",
      "Although the need for better drone defenses isn't new, it\u2019s still largely only possible to buy systems that are \u201creally expensive,\u201d take a long time to develop and cannot be mass-produced, Merilo said.",
      "He suggested that\u2019s partly because big defense companies that have spent decades developing billion-dollar air defense systems might not want something new \u2014 and cheaper \u2014 on the market.",
      "\u201cWe have to understand this game,\u201d Merilo said, adding that some technology does exist, but \u201cthe question is who \u2014 and how fast they can start producing.\u201d",
      "Facing nightly onslaughts, Ukraine is rapidly developing its technology, including long-range attack drones and smaller ones for use on the frontlines.",
      "Latvia and some other NATO countries have turned to Salm's company, Frankenburg, to acquire its small anti-drone missiles once they're in production.",
      "But a piecemeal approach isn't ideal, Salm said. Instead, the EU needs to invest more in European startups which can turbocharge drone defense production that can be used by allies across different weapons systems, he said.",
      "Europe needs to switch to \u201csemi-wartime thinking\u201d and foster greater collaboration between the military, government and defense industries to be able to fill its technology gap, said Godliauskas.",
      "In Ukraine, it's sometimes only a matter of weeks between drone technology being developed and used on the battlefield. Europe \u201cdoesn't have time\u201d to spend years waiting to acquire equipment, the Lithuanian said.",
      "Another lesson from Ukraine is that what works today, might not work tomorrow, Godliauskas noted.",
      "While drone defense is critical now, it would be wrong to forget about everything else, said T\u016btins. That's because Moscow is using \u201call means possible\u201d to destabilize Europe, including hybrid warfare and cyberattacks, he said.",

      "BWINDI, Uganda -- News of a sick or injured mountain gorilla can worry local residents in this mountainous area that\u2019s home to the endangered species. That\u2019s partly because most of the gorillas have been given names, allowing rangers and others to humanize the animal's suffering.",
      "But widespread interest in protecting mountain gorillas also comes from the economic benefits of tourism that have turned poachers into conservationists, married women into porters and rangers into eloquent spokespeople for the great apes.",

It\u2019s suffering from what?\u2019\u201d said Joyleen Tugume, a ranger-guide in Uganda\u2019s Bwindi Impenetrable National Park. \u201cEven the community people. Everyone is touched.\u201d",

      "Tourists pay a considerable sum \u2014 $800 in permit fees per foreign non-resident \u2014 for the right to see gorillas in their natural habitat. An official revenue-sharing policy channels $10 from each permit back to the local community via their elected leaders, who can invest in projects ranging from water provision to health care. Local communities are also entitled to 20% of all park entry fees generated annually.",
      "Many locals, including reformed poachers living near the park, told The Associated Press that the money generated has ensured the recovery of the species, with habitat encroachment and poaching in decline as wildlife authorities seek to collaborate more with nearby communities.",
      "Philemon Mujuni, a poacher until five years ago, said he once thought of the gorilla as a hostile animal to be killed before it killed him if he ever encountered one. As a boy, he used to follow his father, whom he described as \u201ca senior poacher,\u201d into the forest to help carry the antelopes they pulled from traps.",
      "But in 2020, when poachers killed a beloved gorilla named Rafiki, Mujuni and others formed an organization of former poachers who now say the primates are more important than any other animal.",
      "They serve as community watchdogs, looking out for people who might venture into the forest to set duiker traps that sometimes ensnare gorillas. Their surveillance efforts help support the work of armed rangers who also regularly patrol the park.",
      "\u201cWhen community conservation rangers sensitized us, we said, \u2018Let us reform and stop poaching in the national park of Bwindi,\u2019\u201d Mujuni said. \u201cI can\u2019t go there. Because, through the conservation team from (Bwindi Impenetrable National Park), we get some money from these gorillas we could kill.\u201d",

      "A day after the indictment of former FBI Director James Comey, officials with the Justice Department were still offering few details about their case -- but sources said Friday that one of the two counts in the indictment focuses on his alleged role in the sharing of information about an FBI investigation related to Hillary Clinton.",
      "Count 1 of the indictment, which charges Comey with making false statements to Congress, involves Comey's alleged role in having his close friend and former personal lawyer, Daniel Richman, provide information to reporters about an FBI probe connected to Clinton, sources told ABC News.",
      "In the indictment, Count 1 says that Comey \"willfully and knowingly\" lied when, testifying under oath to the Senate Judiciary Committee in September 2020, he reaffirmed previous Senate testimony insisting that he never \"authorized someone else at the FBI to be an anonymous source in news reports\" about an investigation connected to someone only identified as \"PERSON 1.\"",
      "\"That statement was false, because, as JAMES B. COMEY JR. then and there knew, he in fact had authorized PERSON 3 to serve as an anonymous source in news reports regarding [the] FBI investigation,\" the indictment reads.",

      "The U.N. cultural agency UNESCO has designated 26 new biosphere reserves",
      "An Indonesian archipelago that's home to three-fourths of Earth's coral species, a stretch of Icelandic coast with 70% of the country's plant life and an area along Angola's Atlantic coast featuring savannahs, forests and estuaries are among 26 new UNESCO-designated biosphere reserves.",
      "The United Nations cultural agency says the reserves \u2014 785 sites in 142 countries, designated since 1971 \u2014 are home to some of the planet\u2019s richest and most fragile ecosystems. But biosphere reserves encompass more than strictly protected nature reserves; they're expanded to include areas where people live and work, and the designation requires that scientists, residents and government officials work together to balance conservation and research with local economic and cultural needs.",
      "\u201cThe concept of biosphere reserves is that biodiversity conservation is a pillar of socioeconomic development\u201d and can contribute to the economy, said Ant\u00f3nio Abreu, head of the program, adding that conflict and misunderstanding can result if local communities are left out of decision-making and planning.",
      "The new reserves, in 21 countries, were announced Saturday in Hangzhou, China, where the program adopted a 10-year strategic action plan that includes studying the effects of climate change, Abreu said.",
      "The new reserves include a 52,000-square-mile (135,000-square-kilometer) area in the Indonesian archipelago, Raja Ampat, home to over 75% of earth\u2019s coral species as well as rainforests and rare endangered sea turtles. The economy depends on fishing, aquaculture, small-scale agriculture and tourism, UNESCO said.",
      "On Iceland's west coast, the Sn\u00e6fellsnes Biosphere Reserve's landscape includes volcanic peaks, lava fields, wetlands, grasslands and the Sn\u00e6fellsj\u00f6kull glacier. The 1,460-square-kilometer (564 square-mile) reserve is an important sanctuary for seabirds, seals and over 70% of Iceland's plant life \u2014 including 330 species of wildflowers and ferns. Its population of more than 4,000 people relies on fishing, sheep farming and tourism.",
      "And in Angola, the new Qui\u00e7ama Biosphere Reserve, along 206 kilometers (128 miles) of Atlantic coast is a \u201csanctuary for biodiversity\u201d within its savannahs, forests, flood plains, estuaries and islands, according to UNESCO. It's home to elephants, manatees, sea turtles and more than 200 bird species. Residents' livelihoods include livestock herding, farming, fishing, honey production.",
      "Residents are important partners in protecting biodiversity within the reserves, and even have helped identify new species, said Abreu, the program's leader. Meanwhile, scientists also are helping to restore ecosystems to benefit the local economy, he said.",
      "For example, in the Philippines, the coral reefs around Pangatalan Island were severely damaged because local fishermen used dynamite to find depleted fish populations. Scientists helped design a structure to help coral reefs regrow and taught fishermen to raise fish through aquaculture so the reefs could recover.",
      "\u201cThey have food and they have also fish to sell in the markets,\u201d said Abreu.",
      "In the African nation of S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe, a biosphere reserve on Pr\u00edncipe Island led to restoration of mangroves, which help buffer against storm surges and provide important habitat, Abreu said.",

      "At least 60% of the UNESCO biosphere reserves have been affected by extreme weather tied to climate change, which is caused primarily by the burning of fossil fuels such as coal and gas, including extreme heat and drought and sea-level rise, Abreu said.",
      "The agency is using satellite imagery and computer modeling to monitor changes in coastal zones and other areas, and is digitizing its historical databases, Abreu said. The information will be used to help determine how best to preserve and manage the reserves.",
      "Some biosphere reserves also are under pressure from environmental degradation.",
      "In Nigeria, for example, habitat for a dwindling population of critically endangered African forest elephants is under threat as cocoa farmers expand into Omo Forest Reserve, a protected rainforest and one of Africa\u2019s oldest and largest UNESCO Biosphere Reserves. The forest is also important to help combat climate change.",
      "The Trump administration in July announced that the U.S. would withdraw from UNESCO as of December 2026, just as it did during his first administration, saying U.S. involvement is not in the national interest. The U.S. has 47 biosphere reserves, most in federal protected areas.",

      "Golden lion tamarins and Hoffman's two-toed sloths have become roommates at the Palm Beach Zoo in Florida",
      "WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- Golden lion tamarins and Hoffman's two-toed sloths have become unlikely roommates in a brand new habitat at the Palm Beach Zoo and Conservation Society in Florida.",
      "Both species are native to the forests of South America, which is why the new habitat features a thick canopy of trees. The golden tamarins, with their distinct orange mane, love frolicking in the treetops, while the sloths are perfectly happy hanging from the trees.",
      "\u201cMaybe the golden tamarins think of the sloth as more furniture because they don\u2019t really do too much. They\u2019re more sedentary,\u201d said Devin Clarke, a senior supervisor at the zoo. \"They like to sleep during the day, a little bit more active at night. So just watching, you know, like their couch walking around at night isn\u2019t too scary for them.\u201d",
      "The habitat, which opened in late August, offers the sloths and tamarins a unique space to interact with one another \u2014 or mind their own business. The space features a network of vines, ropes and tunnels that encourages exploration, zoo officials said.",
      "\u201cJust being able to see them up close and personal is really a way to inspire connection,\u201d Clarke said. \u201cAnd once people start really having that connection and harboring that connection with the wild animal, they\u2019re able to look at their lives and say, \u2018What can I do differently to help these animals\u2019 wild counterparts down in Brazil and Central America thrive?\u2019\u201d",
      "He said that in the 1970s, there were less than 200 golden tamarinds in the wild. Some 40 zoos accredited through the Association of Zoos and Aquariums put together a plan to rerelease the species into the wild. Their numbers topped 5,000 as of last year, he said.",
      "The previous tamarin habitat at the zoo was a little smaller, Clarke said.",
      "\u201cWe wanted to be able to give them a better well-being, so enhancing their lives with enrichment, with space, so they can act a little bit more natural,\u201d he added.",

      "The new habitat provides an opportunity for visitors to have get a closer view of the two species, said Margo McKnight, the zoo's president and CEO.",
      "\u201cWe hope to foster a love for wildlife in wild places, including our own backyards. We hope every person leaves inspired to be a wildlife hero in their own community,\u201d she said.",

      "JUNEAU, Alaska -- The truck that arrived ahead of schedule at Allyssa Canoy\u2019s home in Fairbanks brought enough heating fuel for the frigid winter months ahead \u2014 and a surprise bill for $2,600.",
      "Canoy and her two sons have checks arriving that will cover that expense and leave some money for the boys, too. Starting Thursday, Alaska plans to begin distributing to residents their annual dividend derived from the state's $83 billion oil wealth fund, a sort of bonus that Alaskans get for living in the state.",
      "For some, it's extra spending money for a new set of tires or a vacation to a sunnier clime during the long, dark winter. For others, it's a vital supplement in a state where the cost for internet service, gas and groceries can be sky-high.",

      "Alaskans are getting $1,000 per person \u2014 the lowest amount since 2020, when they each received $992. The payout has been below $1,000 only two other times since 2006.",
      "There used to be a formula for calculating the amount, tied to the fund's market performance. But lawmakers widely consider that formula unaffordable and within the last decade have abandoned it.",
      "Politicians now set the amount. It's often one of the last items settled during sensitive budget negotiations. Lawmakers must weigh the check\u2019s size against other programs and public needs, including education, and in 2018 began using earnings from the fund \u2014 long used to pay dividends \u2014 to also help balance the budget.",
      "This year, $1,000 is what lawmakers argued they could afford while also backing an increase in K-12 funding and trying to limit draws from savings.",

      "American soybean farmers are worried about where they're going to sell their crops and whether they'll lose money this year because China hasn't bought any for months",
      "MAGNOLIA, Ky. -- The leafy soybean plants reach Caleb Ragland's thighs and are ripe for harvest, but the Kentucky farmer is deeply worried. He doesn't know where he and others like him will sell their crop because China has stopped buying.",
      "Beijing, which traditionally has snapped up at least a quarter of all soybeans grown in the U.S., is in effect boycotting them in retaliation for the high tariffs President Donald Trump has imposed on Chinese goods and to strengthen its hand in negotiations over a new overall trade deal.",
      "It has left American soybean farmers fretting over not only this year's crop but the long-term viability of their businesses, built in part on China's once-insatiable appetite for U.S. beans.",
      "\u201cThis is a five-alarm fire for our industry,\u201d said Ragland, who leads the American Soybean Association trade group.",
      "The situation might even be enough to test farmers\u2019 loyalty to Trump, although he still enjoys strong support throughout rural America. If no deal is reached soon, they hope the government will come through with aid as it did during Trump's first term, but they see that only as a temporary solution. Trump said Thursday he is considering an aid package.",
      "U.S. and Chinese officials have held four rounds of trade talks between May and September, with another likely in the coming weeks. No progress on soybeans has been reported.",
      "Getting closer to harvest, \u201cI\u2019m honestly getting worried that the time is running out,\u201d said Jim Sutter, CEO of the U.S. Soybean Export Council.",
      "After Trump imposed tariffs on Chinese goods, China responded with tariffs of its own, which now total up to 34% on U.S. soybeans. That makes soybeans from other countries cheaper.",
      "China's retaliatory tariffs also hit U.S. growers of sorghum, corn and cotton, and even geoduck divers have been affected. But soybeans stand out because of the crop\u2019s outsized importance to U.S. agricultural exports. Soybeans are the top U.S. food export, accounting for about 14% of all farm goods sent overseas.",
      "And China has been by far the largest foreign buyer. Last year, the U.S. exported nearly $24.5 billion worth of soybeans, and China accounted for more than $12.5 billion. That compared with $2.45 billion by the European Union, the second-largest buyer. This year, China hasn't bought beans since May.",
      "With U.S. farmers hurting, the Trump administration is under growing pressure to reach a deal with China. As talks drag on, Trump appears ready to help.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to take some of the tariff money \u2014 relatively small amount, but a lot for the farmers \u2014 and we\u2019re going to help the farmers out a little bit\u201d during this transition period, Trump said.",
      "The only way most farmers survived Trump\u2019s trade war in his first term was with tens of billions of dollars in government payments. But that's not what most farmers want.",
      "\u201cThe American farmer, especially myself included, we don\u2019t want aid payments,\u201d said Brian Warpup, 52, a fourth-generation farmer from Warren, Indiana. \u201cWe want to work. We work the land, we harvest the land, the crop off the land. And the worst thing that we could ever want is a handout.\u201d",
      "Farmers are looking to Trump for a long-term solution.",
      "\u201cOverwhelmingly, farmers have been in President Trump\u2019s corner,\u201d said Ragland, the president of the soybean association. \u201cAnd I think the message that our soybean farmers as a whole want to deliver is: \u2018President Trump, we\u2019ve had your back. We need you to have ours now.\u2019\u201d",
      "He said farmers appreciate the willingness to provide some short-term relief, but what they ultimately need are strong, reliable markets. \u201cOur priority remains seeing the United States secure lasting trade agreements \u2014 particularly with China \u2014 that allow farmers to sell their crops and build a sustainable future with long-term customers,\u201d he said.",

Trump's tariffs, which helped make their crops uncompetitive around the world, drove prices down further. And tariffs on steel and fertilizer sent costs up even more.",
      "Darin Johnson, president of the Minnesota Soybean Growers Association, said he still has faith in the Trump administration to reach a good trade deal with China.",

      "The U.S. soybean industry grew in response to Chinese demand starting back in the 1990s, when China began its rapid economic rise and turned to foreign producers to help feed its people. Protein-rich soybeans are an essential part of the diet.",
      "While China relies on domestic crops for steamed beans and tofu, it needs far more soybeans for oil extraction and animal feed. In 2024, China produced 20 million metric tons of soybeans, while importing more than 105 million metric tons.",
      "American farmers have come to count on China as their biggest customer, and this has \u201cgiven the Chinese a point of leverage,\u201d Sutter said. By holding off on buying U.S. soybeans, China is seen as trying to leverage that purchasing power in the trade talks.",
      "\u201cI think that\u2019s the strategy,\u201d said Sutter of the U.S. Soybean Export Council. \u201cI think that\u2019s why China is targeting soybeans and other agricultural products, because they know that farmers have a strong lobby and farmers are important to the U.S. government.\u201d",

Last year, Brazilian beans accounted for more than 70% of China's imports, while the U.S. share was down to 21%, World Bank data shows. Argentina and other South American countries also are selling more to China, which has diversified to boost food security.",
      "U.S. farmers also are broadening their customer base, said Sutter, who recently traveled to Japan and Indonesia in search of new markets. Taiwan pledged to purchase $10 billion worth of soybeans, corn, wheat and beef in the next four years.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s strong diversification efforts underway,\u201d Sutter said. But \u201cChina is so big, it\u2019s hard to replace them overnight.\u201d",
      "Farmers are working to boost consumption at home, too. Growth in biodiesel production has taken in some of the soybeans that were once exported. Others are crushed to produce soybean oil and soybean meal. The United Soybean Board is investing in research into the benefits of using soybeans to feed dairy cows and hogs.",
      "But Iowa farmer Robb Ewoldt, a director with the Soybean Board, knows that such domestic uses are growing gradually.",

      "South Korea\u2019s top diplomat says his boss has asked President Donald Trump to become \u201ca peacemaker\u201d and use his leadership to get North Korea to talks to reduce military tensions on the Korean Peninsula",
      "UNITED NATIONS -- South Korea\u2019s president has asked President Donald Trump to become \u201ca peacemaker\u201d and use his leadership to get North Korea to talks to reduce military tensions on the Korean Peninsula, the South\u2019s top diplomat said Friday.",
      "Trump \u201cwelcomed\u201d the request from President Lee Jae Myung and \"he expressed his willingness to be engaged with North Korea again,\u201d Foreign Minister Cho Hyun said in an interview with The Associated Press. There was no immediate word from the White House.",
      "Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un met three times as North Korea was building a nuclear weapons stockpile, which Kim views as key to the country\u2019s security and his continued rule of the northeast Asian nation.",
      "There were two summits in Singapore in June 2018, and in Vietnam in February 2019, where Trump and Kim disagreed about U.S.-led sanctions against the North. A third meeting that year at the border between the two Koreas failed to salvage their nuclear talks and Kim has since shunned any diplomacy with the U.S. and South Korea.",
      "\u201cIt would be fantastic if they met with each other in the near future,\u201d Cho said. \"And President Lee Jae Myung made it clear to President Trump that he will not be sitting in the driver\u2019s seat. He asked president Trump to become a peacemaker, and he relegated himself to become a pacemaker,\u201d the foreign minister said. \u201cWe don\u2019t mind. On the contrary, we want president Trump (to) exercise his leadership to pull North Korea to dialogue table.\u201d",
      "Since Trump returned to power in January, he has repeatedly expressed hope of restarting talks with Kim. The North Korean leader said Monday he still has \u201cgood memories\u201d of Trump but urged the United States to drop its demand that the North surrender its nuclear arms as a precondition for resuming long-stalled diplomacy.",
      "Trump is expected to visit South Korea next month to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, which has prompted media speculation that he might meet Kim again at the border. Trump is also expected to meet with Chinese leader Xi Jinping during that meeting.",
      "The foreign minister said Lee asked Trump to take the lead because the world has changed and become \u201cmuch more precarious\u201d since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022.",
      "\u201cAccordingly, we are equally worried about any possible military skirmish on the Korean Peninsula,\u201d Cho said. \u201cSo we are compelled to explore dialogues with North Korea to reduce the military tension, and at least we want to have a hotline.\u201d",
      "He stressed that denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula \u201cis the imperative \u2013 we cannot let it go.\u201d",
      "Early Friday, South Korea\u2019s military said it fired warning shots to drive away a North Korean merchant ship that briefly crossed the disputed western sea boundary between the two countries, amid continuing high tensions.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m not surprised at all,\u201d Cho said, \u201cbut this incident justifies the policy of the new government that we need to have a hotline between the militaries, reduce the military tension and build confidence between the two parties.\u201d",

      "Tennessee Republican Gov. Bill Lee has publicly said he would not expect more than 150 National Guard members to be sent to Memphis, though he's said the numbers aren't solidified. The city has said there won't be tanks. And the Guard troops won't be armed unless local authorities request that, Lee said.",
      "Next week, Memphis will get its first batch of additional federal officers. In waves over weeks and months, they will come from 13 federal agencies, ranging from immigration to drug enforcement. The Guard members won\u2019t be making arrests, Lee said.",

      "\u201cImagine a place like Memphis that already can\u2019t compete when it comes to those things, they\u2019re struggling with tourism and getting people to come and feel safe,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s going to bring businesses back.\u201d",
      "Johnson said it\u2019s important for people to feel safe in highly visited areas, but some neighborhoods have greater needs. Lee has pledged a long-term effort, but Johnson said that if the follow-through isn't enough, the situation could get worse before it gets better.",
      "Lee's estimate of 150 National Guard members came with the caveat that it's not finalized, and he's been hesitant to repeat it. And while authorities from the FBI, Drug Enforcement Administration and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives will be in town starting next week, it's unclear when Guard members will arrive. Lee also said 300 Tennessee Highway Patrol troopers will be in the region.",
      "Trump's Sept. 15 order setting up the Memphis task force calls for \"large-scale saturation of besieged neighborhoods with law enforcement personnel\" and \"strict enforcement of applicable quality-of-life, nuisance, and public-safety laws.\"",

      "WASHINGTON -- The Congressional Black Caucus kicked off its annual legislative conference this week, which has been upended by President Donald Trump's second term and by the presence of National Guard patrols near the conference's venue.",
      "The 62-member caucus, all of whom are Democrats, gathered with business leaders, activists, policy experts, local government officials, and other professionals from across the country to strategize how to build its new agenda and to counter Trump\u2019s policies, which have disrupted federal government programs that address civil rights, education, healthcare, housing, immigration and labor policy, among other areas.",

      "Here are some comments from the CBC lawmakers who attended this year's conference:",
      "\u201cThis is probably going to be one of the most consequential weeks that you have ever spent in your lives,\u201d said Clyburn, the former House Democratic leader, during an address at the outset of the conference. \u201cTake it from me: we are on the precipice of losing this democracy. We are. And if you don\u2019t think so, take a journey through the history of the country.\u201d",
      "\u201cI would hope that I would not leave this Earth, and my children and grandchildren would not be sentenced to having to live the life that their grandparents and parents lived,\u201d said the 85-year-old congressman.",
      "\u201cIf we are made to this moment, we will win this year. If we lose, our children would not think well of us.\u201d",
      "\u201cThis is not a conventional time. This is the time that we make for ourselves our own destiny,\u201d Clarke, chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, said in an address to conference attendees.",
      "\u201cThis is not a situation where we can necessarily say, well, look, those people in Congress have got it. Because the Congress is broken,\u201d Clarke said. \u201cWe delivered democracy to the United States of America. Were it not for the abolitionists, were it not for the Civil Rights leaders, were it not for the foot soldiers on the ground, we'd still be living in apartheid. So let's get it straight and let's straighten up our backs.\u201d",
      "Clarke added: \u201cI believe in us because were it not for the folks who came before me, I wouldn't be standing here today as chairwoman of the largest Black Caucus in the history of the United States.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt's not that if (Democrats) get the gavel, we rebuild back to what we had. We are also taking this opportunity to see what we can start from scratch,\u201d said McClellan.",

The strategy is to fight the battles at the local elections. The facts of strategy are to make sure that we are shored up so that when 2028 comes around, folks are ready.\u201d",

      "NEW YORK -- China's second-in-command sounded his nation's oft-repeated alarm against aggressive and unilateral action in global politics, addressing world leaders Friday in a speech brimming with references that echoed long-standing concerns about the United States and the Trump administration in particular \u2014 and cast Beijing as a defender of the world order in an era of encroaching chaos.",
      "Li Qiang's remarks also reflected his own continuing rise to prominence after being elevated to premier more than two years ago.",
      "Li made no major announcements and offered no specific policy revelations in his speech to the U.N. General Assembly, as has typically been the practice of China in that forum in recent years. But his comments, in sweep and assertive tone, revealed several things \u2014 including what might be seen as his official debut on the world stage since his promotion 2\u00bd years ago.",
      "\u201cUnilateralism and Cold War mentality are resurfacing,\" Li said. \u201cHistory keeps reminding us that when might dictates right, the world risks division and regression. Should the era of the law of the jungle return and the weak be left as prey to the strong, human society would face even more bloodshed and brutality.\"",
      "China and the United States, the two biggest forces in the global economy, are looking to get relations back on track after a spate of fissures that include the fate of the Chinese-founded TikTok and the prospect of harsh tariffs that Donald Trump's White House slapped on Beijing and other governments earlier this year but have been paused. Trump and Xi are tentatively scheduled to meet on the sidelines of the APEC regional economic summit in South Korea, which convenes late next month.",
      "Li, 66, is considered the second-highest figure in the Chinese government behind paramount leader Xi Jinping, who is the president and general secretary of the Communist Party and has, at least until recently, promoted a personality cult around him. While Xi himself has addressed the General Assembly in the past \u2014 notably via video during the pandemic \u2014 top diplomat Wang Yi has been the go-to figure for U.N. addresses in recent years.",
      "Li's remarks contrasted with a speech he made earlier this year in a different kind of limelight \u2014 the domestic one \u2014 at the start of China's National People's Congress. Those remarks were dry and financially focused, as is the premier's general practice at that forum.",
      "Not at this one. His speech cast China as a defender of the world order and was filled with flourishes and imagery inflected with Chinese culture. \u201cThe tide of history surges forward and the great way remains smooth and steadfast,\" he said at one point. He also paused for a romantic, notably personal reflection about his observations as a first-time featured speaker at the United Nations \u2014 what he saw when he arrived and how he perceived it.",
      "\u201cArriving at the U.N. headquarters this time, I saw over 190 national flags lined up in front of the building and fluttering in the breeze. I saw the sculptures that have beat swords into plowshares and non-violence with their time-tested message ever so loud. And I saw staff members from different regions, of different races, and with different skin colors working in collaboration for the common goals of humanity,\" he said.",
      "\"What I saw got me thinking: Those people, objects, and scenes that embody peace, progress, and development are exactly why we choose to commemorate victory. They\u2019re also what inspires us to forge ahead, hand in hand.\u201d",

      "The aging Xi's decision to let the U.N. spotlight shine on Li, who often oversees the nation's economy, is notable. Unlike his predecessor, who was sidelined by Xi, Li is a loyalist. China, which vigorously emphasizes multilateralism, consensus and cooperation in most of its foreign policy statements, has long looked to the United Nations as a counterbalance to what it perceives as U.S. domination and arrogance.",

      "WASHINGTON -- The White House is moving forward with a deal that would allow the U.S. government to take a small equity stake in a Canadian company that is developing one of the world's largest lithium mines in northern Nevada, an official said.",
      "The Department of Energy and Lithium Americas, developer of the proposed Thacker Pass lithium mine and processing plant about 200 miles north of Reno, have agreed on changes to a $2.3 billion federal loan that could allow the project to move forward to extract the silver-white metal used in electric vehicle batteries. General Motors has pledged more than $900 million to help develop Thacker Pass, which holds enough lithium to build 1 million electric vehicles annually.",
      "The proposed equity stake in Vancouver-based Lithium Americas is the latest example of President Donald Trump's administration intervening directly in private companies. The government is getting a 10% stake in Intel through the conversion of billions in previously granted government funds and pledges. The administration spent $400 million of taxpayer money in July on MP Materials stock to make the U.S government the biggest owner in the Las Vegas rare earths miner. Trump also made a deal with Nvidia and AMD to give the U.S. government a 15% cut of revenue from selling certain chips to China.",

Lithium Americas asked the Energy Department to restructure the federal loan, which was approved last year by the Biden administration.",
      "\u201cWe support the project moving forward,'' said the White House official, who was granted anonymity in order to talk about a deal that is not yet completed.",
      "\u201cCritical minerals like lithium are very important' to boost the U.S. economy and restore domestic manufacturing,\" the official said, adding: \u201cWe're trying to do this in a way that is fair to the taxpayers. We don't believe in free money.\u201d",
      "A spokesman for Lithium Americas declined to comment, but the company said in a statement that it is in discussions with DOE and General Motors regarding the DOE loan.",
      "\u201cThe topics of these discussions include certain conditions precedent to draw on the DOE Loan and associated loan specifics, as well as incremental requests from the DOE for potential further conditions\u201d to gain access to the loan, the statement said.",
      "Jim Cain, a GM spokesman, said Friday the company remains \u201cconfident in the project\u201d but declined to comment on ongoing negotiations.",
      "Thacker Pass is considered crucial to building a domestic supply chain to make batteries for electric vehicles and other electronics.

      "TRENTON, N.J. -- The Democratic candidate for governor of New Jersey in this year's high-stakes race is defending her Navy service record amid questions surrounding a cheating scandal during her time at the Naval Academy, and pushing back against the Trump administration's release of her mostly unredacted military records.",
      "Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill and Republican Jack Ciattarelli are competing to succeed term-limited Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy in New Jersey, one of just two states, along with Virginia, that are electing a governor this year.",
      "With mail-in ballots already being returned in the Nov. 4 contest, news stories surfaced Thursday saying that Sherrill did not participate in her 1994 Naval Academy graduation ceremony amid fallout from an exam cheating scandal, though she was not directly implicated and was awarded her degree and commissioned as an officer in the Navy.",
      "Another news story from CBS showed that Sherrill's military record was released \u2014 improperly and mostly unredacted \u2014 to a Republican operative in New Jersey.",
      "The fallout from the reports has turned up the heat in a race that already was being closely watched as a sign of how voters are reacting to President Donald Trump's second term and how Democrats are responding to their 2024 election defeat.",
      "Here's a closer look at what we know and what we don't about the developments.",
      "The New Jersey Globe reported Thursday that Sherrill, whose campaign has hinged on her service as a Navy veteran and helicopter pilot, did not walk in the Naval Academy commencement ceremony in 1994 and didn't appear in a commencement program from the ceremony. The story says it was a punishment after an exam cheating scandal that year.",
      "In a statement, Sherrill noted that she graduated and got her commission as an officer despite not walking. She went on to pilot Sea King helicopters during her service, a regular part of her campaign speech on the trail.",
      "\u201cI didn\u2019t turn in some of my classmates, so I didn\u2019t walk, but graduated and was commissioned as an officer in the U.S. Navy, serving for nearly ten years with the highest level of distinction and honor,\u201d she said.",
      "Ciattarelli's campaign is using the development to attack Sherrill, calling on her to release more of her disciplinary and academic record and linking her to the scandal. The Republican former state lawmaker's campaign is citing a pledge Sherrill recently made to be more transparent in order to pressure her to release more.",
      "It's unclear if there are further records to be released. Sherrill did not make any records in her possession available.",
      "The Navy declined to comment. A message seeking comment was also left with the Naval Academy.",
      "Sherrill's campaign attributed the release of information to the National Archives and included a letter dated Sept. 22 from the director of the National Personnel Records Center informing the congresswoman that it released \u201cin error\u201d her military file to an \u201cunauthorized requester,\u201d identified as a former Republican candidate for office in New Jersey.",

      "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- Sara Jane Moore, who was imprisoned for more than 30 years after she made an unsuccessful attempt to assassinate President Gerald Ford in 1975, has died. She was 95.",
      "Moore died Wednesday at a nursing home in Franklin, Tennessee, according to Demetria Kalodimos, a longtime acquaintance who said she was informed by the executor of Moore\u2019s estate. Kalodimos is an executive producer at the Nashville Banner newspaper, which was first to report the death.",
      "Moore seemed an unlikely candidate to gain national notoriety as a violent political radical who nearly killed a president. When she shot at Ford in San Francisco, she was a middle-aged woman who had begun dabbling in leftist groups and sometimes served as an FBI informant.",
      "Sentenced to life, Moore was serving her time at the Federal Correctional Institution in Dublin, California, when she was unexpectedly paroled Dec. 31, 2007. Federal officials gave no details on why she was set free.",
      "She lived largely anonymously in an undisclosed location after that, but in broadcast interviews she expressed regret for what she had done. She said she had been caught up in the radical political movements that were common in California in the mid-1970s.",
      "\u201cI had put blinders on, I really had, and I was listening to only ... what I thought I believed,\u201d\" she told San Francisco television station KGO in April 2009. \u201cWe thought that doing that would actually trigger a new revolution.\u201d",
      "Moore was often confused with Lynette \"Squeaky\" Fromme, a disciple of cult murderer Charles Manson who aimed a semiautomatic pistol at Ford in Sacramento, California, on Sept. 5, 1975. A Security Service agent grabbed the gun before any shots could be fired, and the president was unharmed.",
      "Just 17 days later, on Sept. 22, Moore shot at Ford as he waved to a crowd outside the St. Francis Hotel in San Francisco's Union Square. Oliver Sipple, a 33-year-old former Marine, knocked the .38-caliber pistol out of her hand as she fired, causing the shot to go astray and hit a building.",
      "\u201cI'm sorry I missed,\u201d Moore said during an interview with the San Jose Mercury News seven years later. \u201cYes, I'm sorry I missed. I don't like to be a failure.\u201d",
      "But in later interviews, before and after her release, she repeatedly said that she regretted her actions, saying she was convinced that the government had declared war on the left.",
      "Asked by KGO in 2009 what she would say to Ford if that had been possible, she replied that she would tell him, \u201cI'm very sorry that it happened. ... I'm very happy that I did not succeed.\u201d Ford died in 2006, about a year before her release.",
      "Her family did not publicly comment on her death. Geri Spieler, who wrote a biography of Moore titled \u201cHousewife Assassin,\u201d said she had abandoned her children and was estranged from all her living relatives.",
      "Moore was born Sara Jane Kahn on Feb. 15, 1930, in Charleston, West Virginia. Her confusing background, which included multiple failed marriages, name changes and involvement with both leftist political groups and the FBI, baffled the public and even her own defense attorney during her trial.",

      "WASHINGTON -- WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The Supreme Court on Friday extended an order that allows President Donald Trump's administration to keep frozen nearly $5 billion in foreign aid, handing him another victory in a dispute over presidential power.",
      "With the three liberal justices in dissent, the court's conservative majority granted the Republican administration\u2019s emergency appeal in a case involving billions of dollars in congressionally approved aid. Trump said last month that he would not spend the money, invoking disputed authority that was last used by a president roughly 50 years ago.",
      "The Justice Department sought the high court's intervention after U.S. District Judge Amir Ali ruled that Trump's action was likely illegal and that Congress would have to approve the decision to withhold the funding.",
      "The federal appeals court in Washington declined to put Ali's ruling on hold, but Chief Justice John Roberts temporarily blocked it on Sept. 9. The full court indefinitely extended Roberts' order.",
      "The court has previously cleared the way for the Trump administration to strip legal protections from hundreds of thousands of migrants, fire thousands of federal employees, oust transgender members of the military and remove the heads of independent government agencies.",
      "The legal victories, while not final rulings, all have come through emergency appeals, used sparingly under previous presidencies, to fast-track cases to the Supreme Court, where decisions are often handed down with no explanation.",
      "Trump told House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., in a letter Aug. 28 that he would not spend $4.9 billion in congressionally approved foreign aid, effectively cutting the budget without going through the legislative branch.",
      "He used what\u2019s known as a pocket rescission. That\u2019s a rarely used maneuver when a president submits a request to Congress toward the end of a current budget year to not spend the approved money. The late notice essentially flips the script. Under federal law, Congress has to approve the rescission within 45 days or the money must be spent. But the budget year will end before the 45-day window closes, and in this situation the White House is asserting that congressional inaction allows it to not spend the money.",
      "The majority wrote in an unsigned order that Trump\u2019s authority over foreign affairs weighed heavily in its decision, while cautioning that it was not making a final ruling in the case.",
      "But that was cold comfort to the dissenters. \u201cThe effect is to prevent the funds from reaching their intended recipients \u2014 not just now but (because of their impending expiration) for all time,\u201d Justice Elena Kagan wrote in her dissent, joined by Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson.",
      "The Trump administration has made deep reductions to foreign aid one of its hallmark policies, despite the relatively meager savings relative to the deficit and possible damage to America\u2019s reputation abroad as people lose access to food supplies and development programs.",

      "President Donald Trump's transportation department has been reversing grants for recreational trails and bicycle lanes",
      "CHICAGO -- President Donald Trump's transportation department has been pulling back grants already announced for recreational trails and bicycle lanes, telling local officials their projects fail to promote road capacity or are \u201chostile to motor vehicles.\u201d",
      "The department recently sent letters to local governments in at least six states \u2014 Alabama, California, Connecticut, Illinois, Massachusetts and New Mexico \u2014 informing them it was withdrawing money awarded under the $1.1 trillion infrastructure law former President Joe Biden signed in 2021.",
      "The reversals are among the clearest signals yet of the drastic shift from the Biden administration's emphasis on alternative transportation, such as transit and biking, to the Trump administration's focus on preserving and expanding lanes for cars and trucks.",
      "While the new grants Trump's transportation department announced this year reflect that change, it's practically unprecedented for an administration to claw back grants awarded by a predecessor without a compelling reason, such as potential environmental harms. However, the latest recalled projects didn't have fully funded grant agreements in place, which would have made reversing them far trickier.",
      "The transportation department's press office didn't respond to emails requesting comment.",
      "Connecticut won a $5.7 million federal grant last summer to help design segments of a 44-mile (71-kilometer) recreational trail connecting several communities along the Naugatuck River.",
      "Rick Dunne, executive director of the Naugatuck Valley Council of Governments, said the grant\u2019s final details were being negotiated when the U.S. Department of Transportation sent a letter this month to inform local officials that the project wouldn't move forward. The agency wants \u201cmultimodal grant programs\u201d to focus on \u201cprojects that promote vehicular travel,\u201d the letter explained.",
      "\u201cThey're defining quality of life for Americans as enhancing automobile operations,\u201d Dunne said.",
      "The same reason was given in a letter sent to Albuquerque, New Mexico, pulling $11.5 million in funding for a leg of a rail trail cutting through the city's core. It was among the first active transportation projects awarded under the infrastructure law, with funding announced in 2022, but it was still going through the approval process.",
      "\u201cWe are going to stand up for Albuquerque and prevent the Trump Administration from pulling money from a project the people of Albuquerque want,\u201d Mayor Tim Keller said in a press release. \u201cWe will see you in court.\u201d",
      "Kevin Mills, vice president of policy for the Rails to Trails Conservancy, called the cuts \u201can affront to the priorities set by Congress and Americans\u2019 demands for safer, more convenient walking and biking routes.\u201d",

The reversal was based in part on the project's electric vehicle charging stations, which the administration said contradicted its preference for promoting \u201ctraditional forms of energy and natural resources,\u201d the Boston Globe reported.",
      "Some of the withdrawn projects were relatively small in dollars and scope but still targeted for reversal due to the department's changing priorities.",
      "One applied to just a single block in San Diego County, California, where the community wanted to test whether it could improve safety without disrupting traffic flow. It sought to employ \u201ccreative roadway features\u201d such as roundabouts in place of traffic signals, with plans to expand the approach to other intersections if the model proved successful, said Donna Durckel, spokesperson for the county's Land Use and Environment Group.",
      "But Trump's transportation officials flagged it as \u201chostile to motor vehicles\u201d in a letter sent Sept. 9 because the project included a so-called road diet that would have reduced the stretch from four lanes to two.",
      "On the same day, McLean County in central Illinois got a similar letter recalling federal funding awarded last year to help design a final 9-mile segment of a bike and pedestrian trail along Route 66. County engineer Jerry Stokes said the project wouldn't affect motor vehicle travel but would promote safety by getting bicyclists and pedestrians off the road.",

      "Atlanta\u2019s airport has forfeited $37.5 million in federal grants after refusing to disavow diversity, equity, and inclusion programs",
      "ATLANTA -- Atlanta\u2019s airport has forfeited at least $37.5 million because city leaders have refused to disavow diversity, equity and inclusion programs as mandated by President Donald Trump\u2019s administration.",
      "The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports that Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport, the world\u2019s busiest airport by passenger traffic, declined on July 29 to agree to terms set out by the Federal Aviation Administration. Those terms certify that the airport doesn\u2019t \u201coperate any programs promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives that violate any applicable Federal anti-discrimination laws.\u201d",
      "That language mirrors a January executive order signed by Trump banning DEI programs operated by anyone doing business with or receiving money from the federal government.",
      "The FAA told the Atlanta airport, owned and controlled by the city government, that it was holding back $57 million, The Journal-Constitution reports. But federal authorities said $19 million of that money would be available to Atlanta in the next federal budget year if it agrees to the language then.",
      "The money would have gone to repave taxiways and renovate public restrooms, among other projects.",
      "The language could force the city to give up on a longstanding program that targets 25% of airport business for minority-owned firms and 10% for women-owned firms. Atlanta\u2019s first Black mayor, Maynard Jackson, held up a $400 million airport expansion by insisting that a portion of the spending go to minorities and women. That project put Atlanta on the path to having the world's busiest airport, and the complex is now partially named for Jackson, along with former Mayor William Hartsfield. The city\u2019s minority business programs are credited with helping to bolster Black-owned businesses in Atlanta, burnishing the city\u2019s reputation as a place where Black people could advance materially.",

They argue in a lawsuit filed in Seattle that Trump is usurping powers reserved to Congress by trying to impose funding conditions on congressionally approved grants. A judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from altering the grant conditions for the local governments that are suing, but not for any other governments.",
      "Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens, who is seeking reelection this year, has said he\u2019s considering changes to the program so the city could keep receiving federal money for a wide range of functions including the airport. Atlanta\u2019s officials are elected on a nonpartisan basis, but Dickens, who is Black, says he\u2019s Democrat.",
      "\u201cThe city is currently evaluating all options to ensure alignment with our long-held values, local policy, and federal law and we are confident that the airport will be well positioned to receive federal funds in the future,\u201d said Michael Smith, a spokesperson for Dickens.",
      "In the meantime, the airport plans to \u201cpursue alternative funding to advance these projects without impacting customers or airport service providers,\u201d although Smith didn\u2019t say where that money would come from. The city\u2019s policy has been to finance airport improvements solely with airport-generated income.",
      "In the year ended June 2024, the airport had $989 million in revenue and $845 million in expenses, according to a city financial report. At the time, the airport had almost $1 billion in ongoing construction. Smith said federal funding is \u201cimportant\u201d but represents less than 10% of the airport\u2019s planned construction program over the next six years.",

So for our staff, it's part of that reinforcement that you're part of the family.\"",
      "How the Chiefs' chef finds inspiration",

      "\"To have a part in a show that is quite complicated and asks a lot of me as an actor\u00a0 and is popular are things I was not expecting at all,\" Crudup told CBS News' Anthony Mason.",

Crudup earned his master's degree in acting there.",
      "After landing his first movie role in 1996's \"Sleepers\" alongside Brad Pitt, Crudup remained wary of leading man roles, aware that his looks would eventually fade. Instead, he sought challenging parts like the lead guitarist Russell Hammond in Cameron Crowe's 2000 film \"Almost Famous.\"",
      "\"I didn't play guitar,\" Crudup said. \"And not only that, I was supposed to be a prodigal talent. So, I was well aware that this was not gonna work for some group of the audience.\"",

      "But it was Crudup's work at the Vineyard Theatre that ultimately led to his \"Morning Show\" role. After making his off-Broadway debut there in 1994 in a play about Japanese internment camps where he appeared nude and earned \"hundreds of dollars a week,\" he returned for perhaps his greatest stage challenge: playing 19 different characters in the one-man show \"Harry Clarke.\"",

    "story": [
      "A former stylist for Sean \"Diddy\" Combs \u2014 who testified against the disgraced music mogul in his federal criminal trial earlier this year \u2014 filed a lawsuit Wednesday accusing Combs of sexual abuse and violence while he was in Combs' employ.",
      "The 37-page lawsuit, filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court on behalf of Deonte Nash against Combs and Combs' label, Bad Boy Entertainment, also accuses Combs of sexual battery, human trafficking and false imprisonment.",
      "According to the lawsuit, Nash said he was hired to be Combs' stylist around 2008, at the age of 21, and worked for him until about 2018. Nash said that during that time period, he also worked as a stylist and creative director for Combs' then-girlfriend, R&B singer Cassandra Ventura, who also accused Combs of sexual abuse in a 2023 lawsuit and gave graphic testimony against him in his trial.",
      "\"Nash personally experienced sexual, physical, mental, and emotional abuse at the hands of Defendants during his ten-year employment,\" including \"forced tests of loyalty and manipulation, sexual harassment and sexual assaults, physical violence and manhandling, labor trafficking, threats of harm, and threats of death,\" the lawsuit against Combs reads.",
      "The lawsuit alleges that Nash was sexually assaulted by Combs on \"multiple occasions.\"",
      "Nash said the alleged abuse prompted him to resign in 2018, but Combs \"continued to threaten Mr. Nash after his employment ended.\"",
      "CBS News has reached out to Combs' attorneys for comment on the lawsuit.",
      "In one incident that Nash claims occurred in 2013 or 2014, Combs discovered that Nash and Ventura had gone out to dinner in L.A. without Combs' permission. The following day, the lawsuit states, Combs \"threw\" Nash \"onto the car and violently strangled him.\"",
      "On another occasion in 2014, Combs and his security team allegedly entered Nash's home without permission, during which they \"confiscated Mr. Nash's keys and phone while they forcibly searched the house\" for Ventura, the lawsuit says.",
      "\"After enduring years of abuse, I finally found the courage during the criminal trial, and I am now ready to take action,\" Nash said in a statement. \"Sean Combs has never taken accountability for the years of harm he inflicted on me and so many others.\"",
      "In July, following a lengthy trial, the 55-year-old Combs was found guilty of two counts of prostitution-related charges, but acquitted on more serious charges of racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking.",
      "He is\u00a0scheduled to be sentenced on Oct. 3.",
      "During the trial, Ventura testified that she was repeatedly physically and sexually abused by Combs over the course of their relationship. She testified about a 2016 incident, which was caught on\u00a0surveillance video, that showed Combs violently assaulting her in the hallway of a California hotel.",
      "Nash also testified in the trial that Combs threatened Ventura and that he \"would beat her.\"",
      "Nash testified about a time when Combs allegedly grabbed a sleeping Ventura by the hair and started hitting her \"pretty hard.\" Nash said Ventura's head hit a bed frame and started bleeding, and Combs then told her, Nash and an assistant, \"Look what y'all made me do.\"",
      "Nash testified he dialed 911 but was told to hang up. He said he feared retaliation but did tell some of Combs' employees about the alleged abuse and told jurors Combs got physical with him a few times.",
      "During the trial,\u00a0Combs' attorneys denied the sexual abuse allegations brought by Ventura against their client, and argued that while evidence showed Combs may have lived a party lifestyle, they claimed he did not engage in racketeering conspiracy or sex trafficking.",
      "Nash's lawsuit seeks both compensatory and punitive damages and demands a jury trial.",

      "In an\u00a0episode\u00a0of his podcast The Tim Dillon Show released online on Sept. 20, the comedian said he had been \"fired\" from the festival because of jokes he had previously made referencing the alleged use of\u00a0forced labor in the conservative Islamic kingdom.",

      "Combs was removed from the boards at three charter schools he created in Harlem, the Bronx and Connecticut and was stripped of an honorary doctorate degree from Howard University, which plans to return his prior donations, they said.",
      "Inmate approached Combs with a shiv, lawyers say",
      "Meanwhile, Combs's life in prison has been harrowing at times, even as it has allowed him to become sober for the first time in 25 years, his lawyers said.",
      "On one occasion, another inmate approached Combs with a shiv, accusing Combs of sitting on a chair that the inmate wanted to sit on, before Combs defused the situation and calmed the man and his makeshift weapon down, the lawyers said.",
      "They said he has been under constant suicide watch, meaning every two hours he must present his identification card to guards to show he is alive and well and is awakened from sleep in a brightly lighted cell by a guard to ensure he is well.",
      "He also has limited access to clean water, leaving him to heat the water that he drinks to ensure it won't make him sick and he must sleep within two feet of other inmates in a dorm-style room containing a bathroom and no door, the lawyers wrote.",
      "\"Mr. Combs has not breathed fresh air in nearly 13 months, or felt sunlight on his skin, often walking with a limp due to a painful knee injury that requires surgery,\" they said. And the food, they added, sometimes contains maggots.",
      "Lawyers say Combs had no choice to face trial after plea offer",
      "Prior to trial, the lawyers said, prosecutors offered Combs a plea deal that would have recommended a prison sentence of at least 25 years and required him to plead guilty to crimes of which he was acquitted.",
      "They portrayed their client as a changed man, who had realized that his overuse of drugs, including some prescribed by doctors, had contributed to violent acts he participated in.",
      "\"Without minimizing Mr. Combs's conduct, this is in many ways a 'sex, drugs, and rock n' roll' story,\" they said. \"Mr. Combs had severe substance abuse problems throughout the entirety of the offense conduct and participated in a high-octane celebrity lifestyle.\"",
      "The music maven's trial featured lengthy testimony from two former girlfriends of Combs who said they felt forced to participate in drug-fueled sex marathons with male sex workers as Combs watched and sometimes filmed the dayslong encounters.",
      "R&B singer Cassandra \"Cassie\" Ventura testified that she participated in hundreds of the meetups that were referred to as \"freak-offs\" while she was his most frequent girlfriend from 2007 to 2018.",
      "Another ex-girlfriend, testifying under the pseudonym \"Jane,\" said she also felt pressured to perform sexually with male sex workers while she dated Combs from 2021 until his arrest at a New York hotel a year ago.",
      "Lawyers say a sober Combs looks to new future unlike his past",
      "There was also extensive testimony during the trial about Combs beating his girlfriends and using violence and the fears of it to control those around him.",
      "Defense lawyers at trial conceded there was domestic abuse but said the charges brought by prosecutors were not proven.",
      "While he was once so depressed in jail that \"there were days when he was unable to get out of his bed or even talk to the psychology department,\" his lawyers said he looks forward to the future.",
      "They said he has begun teaching other inmates essential skills in business management, entrepreneurship and personal development.",
      "The lawyers wrote that the education program has become \"one of the most impactful and important endeavors of his life\" and he hopes to expand it to state-run facilities once he is released.",
      "\"He is a humbled man who understands that the most important things in life are his devotion to and quality time with his family and his contributions for the benefit of others,\" they said.",
      "Possibility of a pardon",
      "Combs' lead attorney, Marc Agnifilo, told CBS News in July that he has not had any conversations with the Trump administration about seeking a pardon for his client after another attorney for Combs, Nicole Westmoreland, told\u00a0CNN\u00a0it was her understanding that the defense team \"had conversations in reference to a pardon.\"",
      "But Agnifilo told CBS News, \"I have nothing to do with a possible pardon.\"",
      "\"I have had conversations with nobody,\" Agnifilo said. \"I have not spoken to the president. I have not spoken to anybody who speaks to the president about Sean Combs. I have not.\"",
      "He says he hasn't discussed it with Combs either, except to tell him what's in the news.",
      "\"He says, 'Go tell him (Mr. Trump) that I need a pardon,'\" Agnofilo said. \"'Go tell him I deserve a pardon.' That's what he said.\"",

    "story": [
      "After being pulled off the air nearly a week ago, \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" will return on Tuesday, The Walt Disney Company announced Monday.",
      "The late-night show had been \"pre-empted indefinitely\" last week following comments Kimmel made on the show in response to\u00a0the shooting death\u00a0of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.",
      "In a statement Monday, The Walt Disney Company, which owns ABC, said Kimmel's show was suspended \"to avoid further inflaming a tense situation at an emotional moment for our country,\" adding that some of the host's comments were \"ill-timed and thus insensitive.\"",
      "\"We have spent the last days having thoughtful conversations with Jimmy, and after those conversations, we reached the decision to return the show on Tuesday,\" Disney said.",
      "Kimmel had not yet commented on Monday on his show's return.",
      "The late-night host made the remarks in his monologue on Sept. 15, saying: \"We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them, and doing everything they can to score political points from it.\" He also mocked Mr. Trump's reaction to the shooting.",
      "Before Disney announced last week that Kimmel's show was \"pre-empted indefinitely,\" Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr called the remarks \"some of the sickest conduct possible,\" and said there was a \"path forward for suspension over this.\"",
      "\"The FCC is going to have remedies we could look at,\" he said during a podcast interview, telling host Benny Johnson: \"We can do this the easy way or the hard way.\"",
      "Kimmel faced criticism from conservatives over his comments. Mr. Trump last week had congratulated ABC for \"finally having the courage to do what had to be done.\"",
      "ABC parent company Disney has faced fallout in Hollywood over the move: Other late-night hosts have publicly sided with Kimmel, A-listers like Tom Hanks and Robert De Niro signed an open letter calling it a \"dark moment for freedom of speech,\" and screenwriter and \"Lost\" co-creator Damon Lindelof vowed not to work with Disney unless Kimmel's show is restored. Former Disney CEO Michael Eisner, who led Disney for more than two decades, spoke out and defended Kimmel last week, writing on X: \"Where has all the leadership gone? If not for university presidents, law firm managing partners, and corporate chief executives standing up against bullies, who then will step up for the first amendment?\"",
      "Carr's comments on Kimmel drew pushback on First Amendment grounds, with the FCC's sole Democrat-appointed commissioner, Anna Gomez, arguing the agency had used Kimmel's \"inopportune joke as a pretext to punish speech it disliked.\" Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas also sharply criticized Carr for urging ABC to crack down on Kimmel, calling the Trump appointee's comments \"dangerous as hell\" and \"right out of 'Goodfellas.'\" Cruz chairs the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.",
      "ABC's announcement last week came after media giant Nexstar announced that it would preempt Kimmel's show indefinitely on all its stations over Kimmel's remarks. Andrew Alford, president of Nexstar's broadcasting division, said the comments were \"offensive and insensitive at a critical time in our national political discourse, and we do not believe they reflect the spectrum of opinions, views, or values of the local communities in which we are located.\"",
      "Nexstar owns and operates more than 200 stations nationwide, including more than two dozen ABC affiliates. Nexstar has a deal pending to purchase Tegna, a smaller rival, for $6.2 billion, and needs the Federal Communications Commission to approve it. A Nexstar spokesperson told CBS News last week that the decision was \"made unilaterally by the senior executive team at Nexstar, and they had no communication with the FCC or any government agency prior to making that decision.\"",
      "Another major station owner, Sinclair Broadcast Group, also said last week that it was pulling Kimmel's show.",
      "\"Regardless of ABC's plans for the future of the program, Sinclair intends not to return 'Jimmy Kimmel Live!' to our air until we are confident that appropriate steps have been taken to uphold the standards expected of a national broadcast platform,\" Sinclair said last week in a statement.",
      "On Monday night, Sinclair posted a statement on X saying it will preempt \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" across its ABC affiliate stations and will be \"replacing it with news programming\" beginning Tuesday night. \"Discussions with ABC are ongoing as we evaluate the show's potential return,\" Sinclair said.",

    "published": "Fri, 26 Sep 2025 00:31:00 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump's announcement this week about an alleged link between Tylenol and autism has drawn pushback from medical experts.",
    "story": [
      "Dr. Mehmet Oz told CBS News chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett on \"The Takeout\" Thursday the Trump administration is not advising pregnant women to avoid taking Tylenol under any circumstances \u2014 as President Trump's announcement this week about an alleged link between the painkiller and fever reducer and autism draws pushback from medical experts.",
      "Oz \u2014 a former surgeon and television personality who leads the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, an agency that is under the Department of Health and Human Services \u2014 said that if a pregnant woman develops a high fever, a doctor will likely encourage her to take acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol, because fevers can pose health risks. And\u00a0studies show acetaminophen is the safest medication to treat fevers in pregnant women.",
      "\"The concern here is that I believe most women get low-grade fevers, they stub their toe, they have little aches and pains, and they think it's perfectly safe to throw a couple paracetamol or acetaminophen or Tylenol when they're pregnant, and I don't think that's the case,\" Oz said.",
      "On Monday, Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Marty Makary released an open letter to physicians that said acetaminophen use during pregnancy \"may be associated with\" an increased risk of conditions like autism.",
      "The letter noted that \"while an association between acetaminophen and autism has been described in many studies, a causal relationship has not been established.\"",
      "Makary's letter was also more tempered than Mr. Trump's comments during a news conference earlier this week in which the president said there's \"no downside in not taking\" Tylenol.",
      "\"Acetaminophen is the safest over-the-counter alternative in pregnancy among all analgesics and antipyretics,\" Makary wrote in his letter.",
      "There is concern among the medical community that, as a result of the FDA's announcement Monday, that some patients could turn to other pain medications that are proven to be unsafe during pregnancy.",
      "\"You should not, under any circumstances, avoid taking acetaminophen if you have a fever early in pregnancy, if you have a headache, if you have some other condition in pregnancy, we want you to take that medication,\" Dr. Steven Fleischman, president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, told CBS News following the FDA's announcement. \"The overwhelming evidence that we have seen over the last 20 years does not show causation for acetaminophen causing autism.\"",
      "In a statement in response to the FDA's announcement, Kenvue, the maker of Tylenol, said, \"Independent, sound science clearly shows that taking acetaminophen does not cause autism,\" calling it \"the safest pain reliever option for pregnant women as needed throughout their entire pregnancy.\"",
      "Oz also addressed Makary's announcement that the agency will approve the prescription drug leucovorin, which is derived from folic acid, to treat autism in children. Specialists say leucovorin can be helpful in treating some autism cases, but it is not a universal remedy.",
      "\"The key question is, if you, as a researcher on those trials, had a child, would you give that child leucovorin?\" Oz said he asked of researchers studying leucovorin. \"And when I asked the doctors on those trials, they said yes.\"",
      "Autism has become more prevalent in children born in the U.S. over the past 25 years,\u00a0according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but there is no scientific consensus as to why.",
      "Oz said that when he, Makary and Jay Bhattacharya, director of the National Institutes of Health, were asked by the White House to examine the issue, they found two \"clues,\" not conclusions, that pointed to leucovorin as a possible treatment option for autistic children, and acetaminophen as a medication pregnant women should be cautious about taking.",
      "\"These are things that we believe, that if you're fully transparent about, you'll rebuild trust with the American people,\" Oz said. \"Just tell people what you know.\"",
      "Oz argued that Mr. Trump was right in pushing for the FDA to both approve leucovorin and make its Tylenol recommendation \u2014 even though there is no consensus in the medical community and no definitive evidence supporting either move \u2014 because he believes the FDA has an obligation to be transparent.",
      "But Oz was clear that patients should consult their doctors first before making a decision.",
      "\"The Tylenol issue is whether or not we should warn moms, who are pregnant today, about a problem that we may not know fully the answer to \u2014 'Is Tylenol a problem during pregnancy?' \u2014 for another five years,\" Oz said. \"Well, what about the kid today? Are you going to take the Tylenol or not. Well I think the answer is, the best prudent answer, of course take it if a doctor says you need it. But don't take it on your own without thinking twice about it.\"",
      "Oz also indicated that he would not advise a pregnant family member to take Tylenol without talking to their physician first.",
      "\"We're guarded in saying we don't have all the answers,\" he said. \"But if it's my family, I'm not going to have my pregnant daughter take acetaminophen if she doesn't need to be on it without certainly talking to a doctor about it.\"",

      "In social media posts to Truth Social, Mr. Trump said the new tariffs would take effect Oct. 1.",
      "Mr. Trump said in his posts that the 100% tariff on \"any branded or patented Pharmaceutical Product\" would not apply to companies building manufacturing plants in the U.S., which he defined as either \"breaking ground\" or being \"under construction.\"",
      "In 2024, America imported nearly $233 billion in pharmaceutical and medicinal products, according to the Census Bureau. The prospect of prices doubling for some medicines could send shockwaves to voters as health care expenses, as well as the costs of Medicare and Medicaid, potentially increase.",
      "Still, some experts think the new pharma tariffs could end up having only a modest impact, noting that generic drugs are exempt. The loophole for drugmakers with operations in the U.S. is also likely to soften the blow, Neal Shearing, group chief economist with Capital Economics, said in a report.",
      "\"Many of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies either already have some production in the U.S. or have announced plans to build production in the near future,\" he said. \"Add in the fact that pharmaceuticals is the one area where we think there may have been significant inventory accumulation this year, as importers have sought to front-run potential tariffs, and the impact on the effective tariff rate is likely to be small.\"",
      "Higher costs for home furnishings?",
      "Trump argued that foreign manufacturers of furniture and cabinetry were \"flooding\" the U.S. with their products and that tariffs must be applied \"for National Security and other reasons.\"",
      "The new tariffs on cabinetry could further increase the costs for homebuilders at a time when many people seeking to buy a house feel priced out by the mix of housing shortages and high mortgage rates.",
      "Last month, Mr. Trump announced on social media that a \"major Tariff Investigation\" was being conducted on furniture coming into the U.S. and said that within the next 50 days, the investigation would be completed, and a tariff rate would be announced.",
      "The president said the 25% tariff on \"all 'Heavy (Big!) Trucks' made in other parts of the world\" was \"in order to protect our Great Heavy Truck Manufacturers from unfair outside competition.\"",
      "\"Large Truck Company Manufacturers, such as Peterbilt, Kenworth, Freightliner, Mack Trucks, and others, will be protected from the onslaught of outside interruptions,\" Trump posted.",
      "Throughout much of 2025, the Trump administration's broad tariffs defied predictions that they would fuel inflation, but that respite seems to have ended after economic data this month showed the duties are now driving prices upward. The Consumer Price Index in August rose at a rate of 2.9% from a year ago, up from an annual pace of 2.3% in April, when Mr. Trump first launched a sweeping set of import taxes.",
      "Nor is there evidence that the tariffs are creating factory jobs or more construction of manufacturing facilities. Since April, the Bureau of Labor Statistics has reported that manufacturers cut 42,000 jobs and builders have downsized by 8,000.",

They're triggered when Congress fails to pass a full-year spending bill or a continuing resolution to fund the government for the pending fiscal year, which begins on Wednesday. Oct. 1.",
      "\"We've been to this picnic before, unfortunately,\" Wayne Winegarden, a senior fellow in business and economics at Pacific Research Institute, told CBS News. Pacific Research is a think tank that focuses on free trade.",
      "\"In general, things like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, those will continue to go out, and we'll continue to pay interest on the debt,\" Winegarden said.",
      "But, he added, \"The general rule is that the longer it goes on, the bigger the disruption.\"",
      "What happens if there is a government shutdown?",
      "Without congressional approval for new spending, federal agencies are typically prohibited from doling out money. Activities at many agencies will be suspended until lawmakers agree on a new funding bill, with hundreds of thousands of federal workers likely to be furloughed during that time.",
      "Yet because the government must continue to provide services that protect life and property, agencies will determine which essential workers must continue working, although they won't receive pay until lawmakers resolve the funding gap.",
      "And while some federal employees would eventually receive back pay, others could experience financial strain while their paychecks are suspended, Daco noted.",
      "During the shutdown of 2018-2019, about 800,000 government workers missed several weeks of pay, creating financial hardships for many. Some turned to online fundraising campaigns for assistance, while others relied on food banks to help them get through the period.",
      "What is the economic impact of a government shutdown?",
      "While the biggest direct hit would be on government workers, followed by federal contractors who would also be shut off from funding, delayed federal procurement on goods and services could also ripple through the broader economy, Daco told CBS News.",
      "A shutdown could also undermine confidence in the economy at a time when some sectors, such as the labor market, are facing headwinds, he added. Markets could be rattled by the disruption, as well as consumer sentiment, some economists noted.",
      "\"We need more certainty in the rules of the game of the economy,\" Winegarden said. \"Uncertainty, at this moment, is the last thing we need.\"",
      "A halt in government functions could also complicate monetary policy decisions, potentially resulting in delays for key economic data next month, such as the Oct. 3 jobs report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. With the labor market stalling out over the summer, Federal Reserve officials are expected to closely scrutinize the latest jobs data when they make their next rate decision at the central bank's Oct. 29 meeting.",
      "\"A government shutdown at this economic juncture represent a graver risk than when the economy is running at full steam,\" Daco said.",
      "Would Social Security benefits be impacted?",
      "Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid are covered by mandatory spending, which means that funding for these programs has been approved by Congress to continue without an expiration date.",
      "Social Security benefits would be paid on time, while health care payments for seniors in Medicare and low- and middle-income Americans enrolled in Medicaid would continue.",
      "However, Social Security's administrative budget needs to receive approval from Congress, which means that some of its services could be impacted in a shutdown, some experts note.",
      "\"In the event of a government shutdown ... customer service at the Social Security Administration may be disrupted, including benefit verifications, earnings record corrections and updates, overpayments processing and replacing Medicare cards,\" Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare, said in a Friday email.",
      "Would other federal functions like the TSA be impacted?",
      "Air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration agents would be required to work without pay because they provide essential services.",
      "Unlike other government agencies. the U.S. Postal Service operates as a sefl-funded, independent agency. That means mail, packages and other shipments would still be delivered and post offices would remain open in the event of a shutdown.",
      "But there could be other impacts for consumers and businesses. For one, some mortgage processing could face delays because the flood insurance program would be closed to new policies until Congress agrees to a new spending deal, according to TD Cowen analyst Jaret Seiberg.",
      "\"That means no mortgages which require federal flood insurance will be originated,\" he noted.",
      "In previous shutdowns, other services were also suspended, such as the Food and Drug Administration's inspections, as well as the entry to the National Parks, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.",

    "summary": "President Trump on Thursday signed an executive order that paves the way for a deal brokered by his administration to keep TikTok operating in the U.S.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump on Thursday signed an executive order that paves the way for\u00a0a deal\u00a0brokered by his administration to keep TikTok operating in the U.S. under a new corporate structure with American investors.",
      "\"With this executive order, you will be effectively bringing into effect the agreement that will save TikTok and ensure that it can operate safely and securely,\" White House staff secretary Will Scharf said ahead of a signing ceremony in the Oval Office.",
      "The move declares that the deal represents a \"qualified divestiture\" that satisfies a law passed by Congress requiring TikTok's China-based parent company to divest or face a ban and pushes back enforcement of the bipartisan law by 120 days to allow for an agreement on how the app operates in the U.S. to be finalized.",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters that Chinese President Xi Jinping signed off on the deal during their call last week. \"He gave us the go-ahead,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "The TikTok deal",
      "Under the law, TikTok's China-based parent company ByteDance must sever ties with TikTok or lose access to U.S. app stores and web-hosting services. Earlier this month, the president extended the enforcement pause until Dec. 16. The new order extends the pause until Jan. 23, 2026.",
      "According to a senior White House official, under the deal, ByteDance's content recommendation algorithm that powers TikTok will be copied and retrained to run solely on the data of its U.S. user base. Cloud-computing firm Oracle will provide \"top to bottom security\" by hosting Americans' user data and reviewing the app's code to ensure \"the algorithm is behaving appropriately and it's secure,\" the official said.",
      "The deal will establish a \"joint venture\" based in the U.S., with a majority of U.S. investors and owners and a majority of Americans on its board of directors, according to the White House. The executive order says ByteDance and its affiliates will own less than 20% of the new entity, keeping it below the limit on foreign ownership set by the divest-or-ban law.",
      "Vice President JD Vance said at the White House that the new entity would have a valuation of about $14 billion.",
      "A consortium of American investors, including Oracle, will have a stake in the new TikTok, according to the White House. (Oracle was cofounded by Larry Ellison, whose son David Ellison is the chairman and CEO of Paramount Skydance, which is the parent company of CBS. The Ellison family owns a controlling interest in Paramount Skydance.)",
      "The full roster of U.S. investors and their stakes in the company remain unclear, but Vance said Thursday the administration is planning to announce the other investors in the coming days.",
      "\"We feel 100% confident that this proposal, if it's completed, complies with the law,\" the senior White House official said, adding that the White House believes it \"complies with all the relevant laws and policies on both sides.\"",
      "China's comments about what has been agreed to have been more vague.",
      "The law, which was upheld by the Supreme Court, took effect a day before Mr. Trump's inauguration in January. Mr. Trump, however, has issued\u00a0new orders every few months directing the Justice Department not to take action or impose penalties against companies like Apple and Google for failing to remove the widely popular app from their platforms.",
      "CBS News contributor Christopher Krebs, the former director of the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, said there are \"still some questions on how operationally ... it's going to play out and what the user is going to experience on a daily basis.\"",
      "There's been limited pushback from lawmakers, who for years raised concerns about TikTok's potential risks to national security if the Chinese government was able to access the vast amount of Americans' data collected by the app or carry out influence operations through it.",
      "Still, some are likely to see the deal as not going far enough when it comes to TikTok's algorithm. Republican Rep. John Moolenaar of Michigan, the chairman of the House China committee, expressed concern Friday and said he has asked for an \"urgent\" briefing from the Trump administration.",
      "\"Transitioning to a majority American-owned entity would mark an important step in that process that could mitigate some of the ByteDance threat depending on the details, but divestment was not the law's only requirement,\" Moolenaar said in a statement. \"The law also set firm guardrails that prohibit cooperation between ByteDance and any prospective TikTok successor on the all-important recommendation algorithm, as well as preclude operational ties between the new entity and ByteDance.\"",
      "The law says that there cannot be any operational relationship between the new owners and ByteDance, including any cooperation with respect to TikTok's algorithm and data sharing.",
      "Congress, however, left it up to the president to ultimately determine what constitutes a \"qualified divestiture.\" The law gives the president the power to decide, through an interagency process, whether \"the relevant foreign adversary controlled application [is] no longer being controlled by a foreign adversary.\" It defines \"controlled by a foreign adversary\" as a company headquartered in a foreign adversary country and owning at least a 20% stake.",
      "According to the executive order, the joint venture resolves national security concerns because ByteDance will have a minority stake; the joint venture will operate the algorithm and code and make content-moderation decisions; the data of U.S. users will be stored in a cloud environment run by an American company; and the arrangement includes \"intense monitoring\" of software updates, algorithms and data.",
      "\"These safeguards would protect the American people from the misuse of their data and the influence of a foreign adversary, while also allowing the millions of American viewers, creators, and businesses that rely on the TikTok application to continue using it,\" it says.",
      "The interagency process was led by Vance and included consultation with the National Security Council, the Office of Science and Technology Policy, the Treasury Department, the Justice Department, the Commerce Department and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.",
      "\"This process has included, among other things, significant interagency deliberations and consultations, numerous briefings by informed experts and national security officials, and extensive negotiations with outside parties,\" the executive order says.",
      "The senior White House official said the administration plans to engage \"vigorously\" with lawmakers \"to show them what a great deal this is\" for Americans while also making the app \"safe and secure.\"",
      "During the legal battle over the law, TikTok's lawyers said the app \"would be a fundamentally different platform\" if it was forced to cut ties with ByteDance because the new owner would have to rebuild the algorithm, which would take years. TikTok said the inability to share any data with ByteDance would mean that the app's 170 million American users would not be able to see videos shared by users from around the world and vice versa.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Monday that global content will still be accessible for American users.",
      "For that to happen, the U.S. algorithm would have to interact with the original algorithm that feeds the rest of the world content, according to Ari Lightman, a professor of digital media and marketing at Carnegie Mellon University.",
      "\"The semantics associated with how that'll work have not been disclosed at all,\" Lightman said.",
      "Lightman added that the level of complexity involved in retraining an algorithm to run off a smaller set of users and potentially weighting data sets differently while also maintaining the quality of the current user experience is \"huge.\"",
      "\"The TikTok algorithm has been optimized over a long period of time to understand its community's interests and what defines value for them,\" he said. \"It's kind of it's impossible to recreate.\"",

      "A pair of e-commerce entrepreneurs who bought a number of well-known retail brands \u2014 including RadioShack, Modell's Sporting Goods and Pier 1 Imports \u2014 out of bankruptcy are accused of running a Ponzi scheme.",
      "The Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday accused Alex Mehr and Tai Lopez, founders of the Miami-based Retail Ecommerce Ventures (REV), of defrauding investors out of approximately $112 million.",
      "Through their holding company, Mehr and Lopez acquired distressed brick-and-mortar companies in order to turn them into successful, online-only brands. Dress Barn and Linens 'n Things were also among their acquisitions.",
      "REV acquired RadioShack in 2020, three years after the nearly century-old electronics chain filed for its second bankruptcy. RadioShack first filed for Chapter 11 protection in 2015. In 2023, Unicomer Group acquired RadioShack, and in 2024, relaunched it as an e-commerce platform. RadioShack's current owners are not named in the lawsuit.",
      "Modell's Sporting Goods filed for bankruptcy in March 2020, when it also announced it would be closing all of its stores. REV bought the Modell's brand name and assets in August 2020. Pier 1 Imports \u2014 which still exists as an online store \u2014 declared bankruptcy in early 2020. REV acquired its trademark name and assets later that same year.",
      "The SEC's suit alleges that between 2020 and 2022, Mehr and Lopez, \"made material misrepresentations\" to hundreds of investors about the bankrupt retailers they had acquired. For example, to entice individuals to invest in their acquisitions, they said their portfolio companies were \"on fire\" and that \"cash flow is strong.\" They also told prospective backers that money raised for a company would only be invested in that specific firm. That proved not to be the case, according to the SEC's lawsuit, which was filed Monday in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida.",
      "\"Contrary to these representations, while some of the REV Retailer Brands generated revenue, none generated any profits,\" the suit states. \"Consequently, in order to pay interest, dividends and maturing note payments, Defendants resorted to using a combination of loans from outside lenders, merchant cash advances, money raised from new and existing investors, and transfers from other portfolio companies to cover obligations.\"",
      "Neither Mehr nor Lopez immediately responded to CBS News' request for comment.",
      "The SEC alleges that at least $5.9 million of returns paid to investors were actually Ponzi-like payments funded by other investors, as opposed to companies' profits.",
      "Additionally, the federal regulatory agency claims that Mehr and Lopez allocated $16 million worth of investments for their own use, according to the filing.",
      "REV Chief Operating Officer Maya Burkenroad is also accused of aiding Lopez and Mehr's alleged crimes. On REV's website, Burkenroad, who is Lopez's cousin, was described as having \"over 10 years of experience managing multi-million-dollar companies,\" according to the complaint.",
      "But the SEC claims Lopez and Mehr misrepresented her experience. Before joining REV, she had worked as a substitute preschool teacher, a promoter at a radio station, and as an assistant to Lopez at a prior endeavor, the complaint alleges.",

    "story": [
      "A federal judge on Thursday approved a $1.5 billion settlement between artificial intelligence company Anthropic and authors who allege nearly half a million books had been illegally pirated to train chatbots.",
      "U.S. District Judge William Alsup issued the preliminary approval in San Francisco federal court Thursday after the two sides worked to address his concerns about the settlement, which will pay authors and publishers about $3,000 for each of the books covered by the agreement. It does not apply to future works.",
      "\"This is a fair settlement,\" Alsup said, though he added that distributing it to all parties will be \"complicated.\" About 465,000 books are on the list of works pirated by Anthropic, according to Justin Nelson, an attorney for the authors.",
      "\"We have some of the best lawyers in America in this courtroom and if anyone can do it, you can,\" Alsup said.",
      "The Association of American Publishers called the settlement a \"major step in the right direction in holding AI developers accountable for reckless and unabashed infringement.\"",
      "\"Anthropic is hardly a special case when it comes to infringement. Every other major AI developer has trained their models on the backs of authors and publishers, and many have sourced those works from the most notorious infringing sites in the world,\" said Maria A. Pallante, president and CEO of the publisher group.",
      "San Francisco-based Anthropic said it is pleased with the preliminary approval.",
      "\"The decision will allow us to focus on developing safe AI systems that help people and organizations extend their capabilities, advance scientific discovery, and solve complex problems. As we've consistently maintained, the court's landmark June ruling that AI training constitutes transformative fair use remains intact. This settlement simply resolves narrow claims about how certain materials were obtained,\" said Aparna Sridhar, deputy general counsel at Anthropic.",
      "The Authors Guild, meanwhile, said the settlement \"marks a milestone in authors' fights against AI companies' theft of their works. It sends a clear signal to AI companies that infringement of authors' rights comes at a steep price and will undoubtedly push AI companies towards acquiring the books they want legally, through licensing.\"",
      "A Monday filing sought to convince the judge that the parties have set up a system designed to get out robust notice to all authors and publishers covered by the agreement, ensuring they get their cut of the pot if they want to sign off on the settlement or opt out to protect their legal rights moving forward.",
      "They also tried to assure him that the author and publishers group that cobbled the deal together are not doing any \"back room\" dealings that would hurt lesser-known authors.",
      "Alsup's main concern centered on how the claims process will be handled in an effort to ensure everyone eligible knows about it so the authors don't \"get the shaft.\" He had set a Sept. 22 deadline for submitting a claims form for him to review before Thursday's hearing to review the settlement again.",
      "The judge had raised worries about two big groups connected to the case \u2014 the Authors Guild and the Association of American Publishers \u2014 working \"behind the scenes\" in ways that could pressure some authors to accept the settlement without fully understanding it.",
      "Attorneys for the authors said in Monday's filing they believe the settlement will result in a high claims rate, respects existing contracts and is \"consistent with due process\" and the court's guidance.",
      "Alsup had dealt the case a mixed ruling in June, finding that training AI chatbots on copyrighted books wasn't illegal but that Anthropic wrongfully acquired millions of books through pirate websites to help improve its Claude chatbot.",
      "Bestselling thriller novelist Andrea Bartz, who sued Anthropic with two other authors last year, said in a court declaration ahead of the hearing that she strongly supports the settlement and will work to explain its significance to fellow writers.",
      "\"Together, authors and publishers are sending a message to AI companies: You are not above the law, and our intellectual property isn't yours for the taking,\" she wrote.",
      "Alsup also said in the courtroom Thursday that he plans to step down from the bench by the end of the year. President Bill Clinton nominated him for the federal bench in 1999.",

About $150 million will cover expenses for cutting the 900 employees, who Niccol said are \"nonretail\" workers.",
      "Niccol disclosed the plan in a letter to employees, but didn't specify how many locations would be shuttered. He did note that after adding some new locations over the last year, the company's overall store count in North America will decline by about 1% in fiscal year 2025.",

    "story": [
      "After 85 years of sending out paper checks to retirees, the Social Security Administration (SSA) is transitioning to electronic payments in what it says is an effort to modernize its services and improve efficiency.",
      "Starting Sept. 30, the SSA will no longer issue paper checks to its nearly 70 million recipients, instead sending benefits through either direct deposit or a prepaid debit card.",
      "\"We have been communicating directly with beneficiaries since July 1, and we have worked diligently to ensure that the less than one percent of individuals who receive paper checks have ample time to enroll in direct deposit or receive Direct Express cards,\" a Social Security spokesperson told CBS News in an email on Tuesday.",
      "\"By moving to electronic payments exclusively, we aim to improve efficiency, security, and ensure beneficiaries receive their monthly benefits promptly,\" they added.",
      "The Social Security Administration has emphasized that electronic payments provide a safer and more secure way to receive benefits compared with paper checks, which the agency says are 16 times more likely to be lost or stolen. Eliminating paper checks is also a cost-saving measure: Checks cost 50 cents each, compared with 15 cents for an electronic funds transfer.",
      "In an online post, the SSA said it was sending notices to people who receive paper checks to alert them of the change. The agency encouraged paper check recipients to switch to the new payment options before the deadline to ensure they receive their benefits in a timely fashion.",
      "The Social Security spokesperson declined to comment on how people were contacted or on the current status of its outreach.",
      "Exceptions for some paper checks",
      "While the agency is pulling away from paper checks, there are some exceptions. The spokesperson confirmed to CBS News that the agency will continue to issue paper checks to people who have no other way to receive payments, echoing what it\u00a0told CBS News\u00a0in July after it announced the move to electronic payments.",
      "\"The U.S. Department of the Treasury will grant exceptions to the rule for qualifying circumstances,\" the spokesperson said, without elaborating on what the qualifying circumstances are or the steps Social Security recipients would need to take to establish they qualify.",
      "President Trump set the shift away from paper checks in motion with a March executive order that mandated all federal payments be digitized. Paper-based checks, the White House said at the time, impose \"unnecessary costs; delays; and risks of fraud, lost payments, theft, and inefficiencies.\"",
      "Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, as well as advocates for seniors have noted that the roughly 600,000 people who rely on the SSA's original payment system often need paper checks because they're unable to receive electronic deposits.",
      "That includes people who are \"unbanked,\" or those who lack access to traditional bank accounts. According to an August report from Bankrate, the unbanked represent 4.6% of the U.S. population, and tend to rely more on check-cashing services and other alternative forms of payment to manage their finances.",
      "While the Social Security Act was signed into law in 1935 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, it wasn't until\u00a01940\u00a0that the agency began sending paper checks to retired workers and their dependents as well as to survivors of deceased insured workers. The first recipient of the monthly benefit was a woman named Ida M. Fuller.",
      "A Vermont native, Fuller worked as a teacher before becoming a legal secretary. After filing her retirement claim in 1939, she stopped by the Social Security office in Rutland, Vermont, the town where she once attended school, to inquire about her benefits. She had paid into the relatively new program for about three years, according to the Social Security Administration.",
      "\"It wasn't that I expected anything, mind you, but I knew I'd been paying for something called Social Security and I wanted to ask the people in Rutland about it,\" she said.",

      "In addition, the e-commerce giant was told to make it easier for Prime members to cancel their membership.",
      "\"The process cannot be difficult, costly, or time-consuming,\" the FTC said in its statement.",

      "The FTC's efforts to make it easier for customers to cancel subscriptions extend beyond Amazon. In 2024, the commission approved a \"click-to cancel rule,\" which would have allowed consumers to more quickly end streaming services, gym memberships, product deliveries and other subscriptions. The rule had been set to take effect July 14, but was blocked by a federal court that month.",
      "\"We hope the FTC resurrects the click-to-cancel rules to protect millions of consumers from shady sales tactics,\" said Teresa Murray, consumer watchdog director at U.S. PIRG Education Fund, a nonprofit public interest group, in en email. \"In the meantime, we hope this Amazon settlement sends a strong message to any company operating in ways that could conceivably confuse customers or thwart their efforts to not be customers any more.\"",
      "Thursday's settlement, which came\u00a0two days after a jury trial kicked off in Seattle, represents the culmination of a two-year case that the FTC began in June 2023.",

    "summary": "When you buy online, a robot could be helping to fill your order. A behind-the-scenes look at an Amazon fulfillment center shows how they impact jobs.",
    "story": [
      "With only three months until Christmas, companies are already planning for the holiday retail rush.",
      "When you go to buy online this holiday season, there's a good chance a robot is helping to fulfill your order.",
      "The National Retail Federation reports online holiday sales are expected to grow up to 9% over last year. Major retailers including Walmart and Amazon, along with shipping carriers like UPS and FedEx, are investing in robotics.",
      "Amazon's most advanced fulfillment center, called SHV1, is located in Shreveport, Louisiana. It's more than 3 million square feet and one of the company's largest facilities that utilizes nearly 1,000 robots at the center.",
      "\"We have a number of different types of new robotics that we're using to fulfill customer orders,\" said Scott Dresser, Amazon's vice president of robotics.",
      "Dresser explains the facility can run 24 hours a day.",
      "\"The robots we designed to run all day long, if they need to,\" he said. \"Certainly as we come into our peak holiday season, which we're already getting ready for, that's something we think about a lot because we will have to run the building almost all day round.\"",
      "How robots work in the facility",
      "When a customer orders a product, the robots get to work.",
      "Some move the item out of storage. Then, one of the 2,500 employees sorts it while another packs it before it travels along some of the nearly 15 miles of conveyor belts to get labeled.",
      "The robots have different functions to help move and lift the packages. For example, the robot Proteus hauls pallets and orders across the facility floor, while Cardinal lifts packages into pallets set for delivery.",
      "\"Cardinal is lifting packages that weigh up to 50 pounds. \u2026 And then we can use Proteus to take the container over to the docks. So a lot of it's less about performance, more about making sure that our employees are safe,\" Dresser said.",
      "The final step is a human loading the packages onto a truck.",
      "Dresser said SHV1 is 25% more efficient compared to other fulfillment centers.",
      "\"So if you're ordering an order here in Shreveport right before Christmas and you need that by Christmas, robots are going to help make sure we get that product to you fast, safely and accurately to your doorstep,\" he said.",
      "Impact on jobs",
      "Dresser said that while robots are replacing some jobs, they're also creating new ones.",
      "\"Every time we're able to grow and expand the network, which robotics has enabled over the last decade, we're able to add new jobs. \u2026 like our robotics maintenance engineers, people that we need in the operation now that we have these new robotics to help us run the building,\" he said.",
      "While Amazon's revenue has grown, its number of employees has held steady at around 1.5 million since 2022, according to the company's quarterly reports.",
      "\"I think the thing that we think of most when we're deploying a new fulfillment operation or a new process in a fulfillment operation, is how are people and robots best going to be able to do that together?\"",
      "Dresser added that Amazon is offering training for employees whose positions are being replaced and said those more advanced jobs pay better.",
      "When asked if those jobs could ever be replaced, Dresser said robots are always breaking down and need assistance -- saying humans will be needed for those roles.",

    "published": "Thu, 25 Sep 2025 11:04:57 -0400",
    "summary": "The U.S. economy's 3.8% growth from April through June represents a significant upgrade of the government's previous estimate.",
    "story": [
      "The U.S. economy grew at a strong 3.8% annualized pace in the second quarter, the government\u00a0reported Thursday in its final revision of gross domestic product data for April through June.",
      "U.S. GDP \u2014 the nation's output of goods and services \u2014 rebounded in the spring from a 0.6% first-quarter drop caused by fallout from President Donald Trump's trade wars, the Commerce Department said. The department had previously estimated second-quarter growth at 3.3%, and forecasters had expected a repeat of that figure.",
      "Consumer spending buoyed the economy in the second quarter, rising at a 2.5% pace, up from 0.6% in the first quarter and well above the 1.6% the government previously estimated. The data provides evidence that Americans continued to open their wallets despite broader economic headwinds such as tariffs and a slowing job market, economists noted.",
      "\"That was a meaningful bump-up from the previous estimate of 3.3% thanks to the mighty consumer,\" Priscilla Thiagamoorthy, senior economist at BMO, said in a Thursday report. \"Today's run of data suggest that the economy \u2014 which strongly rebounded after the pandemic recession \u2014 continues to hold up well, even as we anticipate some slowdown ahead.\"",
      "Spending on services advanced at a 2.6% annual pace, more than double the government's previous estimate of 1.2%.",
      "The stronger-than-expected GDP data provides evidence that the economy remains on a solid footing, which may dampen the Federal Reserve's enthusiasm for additional rate cuts in 2025 and early 2026, economists noted. The central bank last week issued its first rate cut of 2025 when it reduced\u00a0its benchmark rate by one-quarter point, with the Fed penciling in two additional cuts in 2025.",
      "When announcing the rate cut last week, Fed Chair Jerome Powell pointed to a weakening labor market as prompting the move. Because rate reductions make it cheaper for businesses to borrow and expand, they can help bolster hiring and support the labor market.",
      "\"The Fed's September dot plot indicated that additional rate cuts are likely at their next two decisions in late October and December, but the case for back-to-back cuts is no slam dunk\" after today's GDP data, said Bill Adams, chief economist for Comerica Bank, in a Thursday email.",
      "Fed officials will be watching even more closely than unusual when their favorite inflation gauge \u2014 the Commerce Department's personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index \u2014 comes out Friday.",
      "Rebound from first quarter",
      "The first-quarter GDP drop, the first retreat of the U.S. economy in three years, was mainly caused by a surge in imports \u2014 which are subtracted from GDP \u2014 as businesses hurried to bring in foreign goods before Trump could impose sweeping taxes on them. That trend reversed as expected in the second quarter: Imports fell at a 29.3% pace, boosting April-June growth by more than 5 percentage points.",
      "A category within the GDP data that measures the economy's underlying strength came in stronger than previously reported as well, growing 2.9% from April-June, up from 1.9% in the first quarter and in the government's previous estimate. This category includes consumer spending and private investment, but excludes volatile items like exports, inventories and government spending.",
      "But private investment fell, including a 5.1% drop in residential investment. Declining business inventories took more than 3.4 percentage points off second-quarter growth.",
      "Spending and investment by the federal government fell at a 5.3% annual pace on top of a 5.6% drop in the first quarter.",
      "Stephen Stanley, chief U.S. economist at Santander, noted that GDP growth averaged 1.6% in the first half of 2025 and consumer spending 1.5% \u2014 \"not great but much better than initially thought.''",
      "Since returning to the White House, Mr. Trump has added double-digit taxes \u2014 tariffs \u2014 on imports from almost every country and targeted specific products for tariffs, including steel, aluminum and autos. The president sees tariffs as a way to protect American industry, lure factories back to the U.S. and to help pay for the tax cuts he signed into law July 4.",
      "Thursday's GDP report was the Commerce Department's third and final look at second-quarter economic growth. It will release its initial estimate of July-September growth on Oct. 30.",
      "Forecasters surveyed by the data firm FactSet currently expect GDP growth to slow to an annual pace of just 1.5% in the third quarter.",

    "summary": "Retailers are expected to hire fewer seasonal workers this year as tariffs and inflationary pressures roil the economy.",
    "story": [
      "Retailers around the U.S. are expected to sharply reduce the number of workers they add for the holidays, a shift from their usual seasonal hiring sprees to help cope with the annual crush of customers.",
      "Outplacement firm Challenger, Gray and Christmas attributes the weak demand for extra workers this year to companies bearing the heavier costs from U.S. tariffs on foreign goods, as well as on rising inflation and their growing reliance on technology to improve efficiency.",
      "The firm expects retail hiring fo the holidays to fall to its lowest level since 2009, when the economy was emerging from a recession caused by the global financial crisis.",
      "\"Seasonal employers are facing a confluence of factors this year: tariffs loom, inflationary pressures linger, and many companies continue to rely on automation and permanent staff instead of large waves of seasonal hires,\" Andy Challenger, workplace expert and senior vice president of Challenger, Gray & Christmas, said in a statement.",
      "The weaker seasonal hiring forecast comes as the U.S. job market is faltering. Employers added only 22,000 jobs in August, falling far short of economists' expectations.",
      "Inflation has also edged up in recent months. The Consumer Price Index, which in March had sunk to an annual rate of 2.3%, in August\u00a0rose at a 2.9%\u00a0pace from a year ago.",
      "In the last quarter of 2024, retailers added just over 543,000 seasonal workers, down roughly 4% compared to 2023. Companies are projected to add fewer than 500,000 jobs during the last three months of 2025, according to Challenger. Such a figure would mark the smallest seasonal gain in 16 years.",
      "Challenger pointed to fewer seasonal hiring announcements than usual from retailers as a sign they plan to hire fewer workers for the holidays.",
      "\"While we could see a late hiring push if holiday sales surprise to the upside, the cautious pace of announcements so far suggests that companies are not betting on a big seasonal surge. This year may be more about doing more with less,\" Challenger said.",
      "Tariffs are causing some consumers to pull back on spending, recent data shows. An August survey\u00a0of consumers from the University of Michigan found that most U.S. adults plan to spend less on goods that see tariff-driven price hikes. Just 24% of consumers surveyed said they expected to spend as usual on items that rise substantially in price, according to the report.",
      "Tariffs have already driven up the cost of some categories of goods for U.S. consumers. For example, in August, audio equipment rose in price by 12% compared to one year earlier,\u00a0 while the cost of household goods rose 10%, the latest Consumer Price Index report\u00a0shows.",
      "\"A wave of uncertainty is impacting not just retailers, but also consumers heading into the final quarter of the year. With hiring slowing across the board, Retailers may hire fewer workers themselves, while many of their shoppers slow spending,\" Challenger added.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/h-1b-visa-new-fee-immigration-impact-american-workers/",
    "published": "Wed, 24 Sep 2025 15:23:33 -0400",
    "summary": "The large fee could help some U.S. workers find jobs, but there could be longer-term costs, economists say.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration says the new $100,000 fee for foreign employees to obtain an H-1B visa will spur companies to hire Americans instead of bringing in labor from overseas. Yet many economists predict the results will be more mixed, potentially fostering increased domestic hiring in some industries but slowing long-term economic growth with a knock-on effect on overall employment.",
      "\"I could envision a scenario in which otherwise available [American] employees see a large increase for their labor demand,\" Kirk Doran, associate professor of economics at the University of Notre Dame, said of the new visa policy. \"There is some evidence that for the kind of work H-1B employees do, there are available workers looking for jobs right now.\"",
      "In the near term, some technology industry workers in particular could see job gains as more companies seek to avoid the sharply higher costs of bringing in employees from overseas, Rutgers University labor economist Jennifer Hunt told CBS News.",
      "\"The winners would be U.S. native-born computer programmers,\" she said. \"If you're a native worker who is really similar to an immigrant, immigrants are usually bad for you. So we would expect current American, U.S. programmers to be helped.\"",
      "Yet the bigger picture is more complex. Other economic research shows that hiring immigrant workers often benefits companies, providing a ready source of skilled labor with the education and training that may not be widely available in the U.S.",
      "One 2024 study from the nonprofit IZA Institute of Labor Economics on the impact of U.S. immigration on employment said H-1B workers can \"help firms increase their employment, revenues and survival probabilities,\" while finding no evidence that hiring of foreign labor through the program displaced native-born American workers.",
      "The research \u2014 from economists at IZA, Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, University of Delaware, University of Michigan and Queens College, CUNY \u2014 also found that every H-1B worker a company hired helped produce additional job gains. \"High-wage, high-productivity firms expand more and even crowd-in natives with college degrees\" when able to add H-1B workers, they wrote.",
      "George Mason University economics professor Michael Clemens underlined that H-1B workers with specialized skills can help boost a company's revenue and profits, potentially spawning other kinds of jobs at the employer, such as in sales and marketing, that can be filled by U.S. workers.",
      "As a result, Clemens worries that the policy change would hurt Americans' job prospects over the long term. \"It is going to choke off job opportunities for the people it is supposed to help,\" he said.",
      "Cost of restricting immigration",
      "To receive an H-1B visa, which is awarded by lottery, an applicant needs to have at least a bachelor's degree in their field and have been offered a temporary job by a U.S. company. Congress caps the number of H-1B visas \u2014 which are valid for three years and which can be extended for an additional three years \u2014 at 85,000 annually. Roughly 700,000 workers in the U.S. hold H-1B visas, according to Capital Economics.",
      "\"The costs of restricting immigration are widespread,\" Gaurav Khanna, a University of California San Diego professor of economics focusing on migration, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"On net, it benefits U.S. workers more than it hurts them, such that the benefits outweigh the costs. The visas allow the IT companies to grow quite rapidly, and these IT firms start hiring other workers in management positions and in HR, so it leads to employment growth at these firms.\"",
      "The White House dismissed the notion that hiring workers from abroad also benefits U.S. workers.",
      "\"President Trump continues to prove to so-called 'experts' wrong time and time again \u2013 no 'economic study' can change the reality lived by many Americans across the country who bore the brunt of the massive abuse of the H-1B system,\" White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch. \"President Trump promised to put American workers first, and this commonsense action does just that by discouraging companies from spamming the system and driving down American wages.\"",
      "Rogers added that the visa fee protects \"Americans from cheap, foreign labor.\"",
      "In a\u00a0proclamation\u00a0last week, Mr. Trump said H-1B visas disadvantage Americans by allowing companies to exploit the program to \"replace, rather than supplement, American workers with lower-paid, lower-skilled labor.\" That has stunted job opportunities and undermined wages, he added.",
      "How much do H-1B workers earn?",
      "Some research supports this claim. For example, an August analysis\u00a0from The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, found that H-1B workers earn significantly less than their American counterparts.",
      "\"[M]any employers may be using the H-1B program not to attract top-tier global talent, but to fill roles at below-median wage levels\u2014raising questions about the program's alignment with its stated objectives,\" the report said.",
      "Other changes could be coming to the H-1B program, with the Trump administration aiming to tilt it toward better-paid foreign workers. On Monday, it proposed replacing the lottery with a system that would favor immigrants with advanced skills and higher incomes.",
      "The Heritage report also notes that the visas restrict worker mobility by tying a visa holder to a given company, preventing them from seeking other employment. That can make such workers more desirable to employers than native workers, who can leave their jobs at any time, the report explains.",
      "In this sense, companies' reliance on the program can hurt native workers, the group said.",
      "\"But this creates an uneven playing field: Native workers, who are free to switch jobs or negotiate better pay, may be overlooked not because they lack skills, but because they are not as easily retained or controlled,\" wrote Alexander Frei, the report's author and formerly a senior research associate at Heritage. \"As a result, employers may favor visa-bound workers who accept lower wages and fewer demands, driving down bargaining power and wage growth for equally or more qualified U.S. workers.\"",
      "Other groups have\u00a0criticized the H-1B program for disproportionately benefiting large, multinational firms that can enter thousands of visa applicants in the lottery and hire whomever is successful.",

      "Damian pointed out that while the consumers may have been disappointed by the chocolates' unwrapped appearances, the candies were not \"so flawed as to render them worthless.\" In other words, the chocolate still tasted like chocolate, even if they weren't as haunting as the purchasers had expected from the packaging.",
      "The lawsuit focused on several Hershey candies that are marketed around Halloween, including its Reese's Peanut Butter Pumpkins and its Reese's White Ghost, as well as a few other holiday-themed chocolates like its Reese's Peanut Butter Shapes Assortment Snowmen Stockings Bells.",
      "The original lawsuit, filed in 2024, claimed that Hershey used deceptive advertising because the \"artistic designs\" depicted on the wrappers were absent from the actual candies.",

    "published": "Wed, 24 Sep 2025 11:14:55 -0400",
    "summary": "The Republicans' \"big, beautiful\" spending and tax law will result in cuts to food stamp benefits for many Americans, experts say.",
    "story": [
      "Millions of people who receive food stamps could soon see smaller benefits or even get kicked out of the program due to changes that are starting to roll out from the Republicans' \"big, beautiful\" tax and spending law, according to several analyses from the federal government and public policy think tanks.",
      "About 2.4 million people, or about 6% of enrollees, could lose access to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), in an average month, because of the new law's changes, which include stricter work requirements, the Congressional Budget Office estimated last month.",
      "Millions more will see their monthly benefit amounts shrink because of other changes mandated by the law, such as a new restrictions on how an individual's benefits are calculated, it added. The total pool of people who will either be cut off from SNAP or see smaller monthly benefits could reach 22.3 million U.S. families, according to a July analysis from the Urban Institute.",
      "About 42 million individuals in 22.3 million households received food stamps in 2023, according to a U.S. Department of Agriculture report on the program.",
      "While SNAP is funded by the USDA, every U.S. state is in charge of administering the program to its residents, with those administrative costs split between the federal and state governments. Some states are already beginning to implement some of the new law's food stamp restrictions, such as Pennsylvania, which is mandating the stricter work rules starting Nov. 1.",
      "The changes are arriving at a precarious time for many, with grocery costs continuing to rise and poverty rates inching higher for senior citizens and Black Americans, according to new Census data. Anti-hunger advocates warn that reduced SNAP benefits could worsen food insecurity, undermining one of the nation's most effective safety nets credited with lifting 3.6 million people out of poverty last year, according to U.S. Census data.",
      "\"We are deeply concerned that the cuts to SNAP will lead to an increase in hunger,\" Carolyn Vega, associate director of policy analysis for Share Our Strength, an anti-hunger nonprofit, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"You are looking at households that don't have a lot of extra wiggle room in their budget, so that makes every SNAP dollar very precious in extending that food budget.\"",
      "Tracking the impact of those SNAP cuts on food insecurity as the changes unfurl over the coming months and years may be difficult, given the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Sept. 20 announcement that it is halting its annual Household Food Security Report, which measures whether American families have access to healthy food.",
      "The USDA said it is nixing the report because it is \"redundant, costly, politicized and extraneous\" and leads to \"fear mongering.\" But anti-hunger advocates say scrapping the report could ultimately obscure the impact of the Republicans' cuts to the food stamp program.",
      "\"I don't see how it's redundant \u2014 the USDA puts out the only report on food insecurity,\" Vega said. \"It just indicates to me that they don't want to see the results of the reconciliation bill,\" referring to the Republican's \"big, beautiful\" tax and spending law.",
      "The USDA didn't immediately respond to a request for comment about that claim.",
      "New work requirements",
      "New work requirements for SNAP recipients are taking effect as the labor market stalls, raising the risk that more people could lose access to food stamps under the stricter rules mandated by the Republican law, advocates say.",
      "\"It's a tough workforce right now, and the work requirements come without any support,\" Gina Plata-Nino, a food stamp expert at the anti-hunger advocacy group Food Research & Action Center, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"Our most vulnerable will have even less access to resources.\"",
      "The new work rules expand what the federal government considers so-called \"able-bodied adults without dependents,\" or ABAWDs, who are adults without young children who must prove they are either working, volunteering or engaged in an education or training program for at least 20 hours a week to qualify for food stamps.",
      "Previously, the work requirements only applied to people between 18 to 54 years old, but the new law pushes that to age 64. Additionally, people who are former foster youth between 18 to 24 years old, veterans or homeless are no longer exempt from the work requirements, as they were previously.",
      "People who don't meet the work requirements will be limited to receiving food stamps for three months within a three-year period.",
      "\"Just off the bat, those are veterans, youths aging out of foster care \u2014 think about what it means to be unhoused, trying to get a job when you don't have a place to shower,\" Plata-Nino said. \"Again, these populations are going to be worse off.\"",
      "Work requirements have been championed by Republican lawmakers because they say the rules encourage people to be gainfully employed or engaged in the community in exchange for food aid.",
      "But anti-hunger advocates argue the rules often bump people off the program because they may face difficulties in filing paperwork. Others point out that low-income workers may struggle to get enough hours from their employers to meet the new federal requirements, especially given the proliferation of \"just in time\" scheduling, which slots workers into short shifts to reduce costs for employers.",
      "Prior to the changes, most SNAP recipients who were required to work were doing so, according to the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities.",
      "Stricter aid calculations",
      "Under the new GOP tax and spending law, there are other changes going into the SNAP program that could reduce benefits for millions.",
      "For instance, SNAP applicants can deduct their utility costs from their incomes when calculating their benefits, which can help to increase their food-stamp allotments. But the new law now prevents food-stamp recipients from counting internet expenses as part of their household costs when determining benefits. That change went into effect as soon as the law was signed on July 4 by President Trump.",
      "\"Roughly 65% of participating households will see their benefit drop by an average of $10 a month\" because of the exclusion in using internet costs to calculate benefits, Vega said.",
      "\"It's a relatively small amount but for a household facing rising grocery cost and facing tough decisions, $10 can make a difference,\" she added.",
      "Longer-term, there are additional changes that could strain states' ability to provide food stamps, such as a shift in fiscal year 2027 requiring that states cover 75% of administrative costs, up from 50% now.

      "For car buyers interested in electric vehicles, the clock is ticking to take advantage of federal tax credits on new and used EVs before they expire on Sept. 30.",
      "Introduced in 2022 under the Inflation Reduction Act signed, the federal tax credits \u2014 $7,500 for new and $4,000 for used \u2014 are being phased out due to President Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which is also\u00a0ending a series\u00a0\u00a0of other clean energy credits over the next several months.",
      "With just one week to go until the expiration date of the Biden-era EV credit, customers are flocking to dealerships to cash in. EV sales reached a record high in August, with new EV sales up 17.7% year over year and used EV sales up 59% for the same period, data from Cox Automotive shows.",
      "\"As we approach the sunset of the IRA tax credit, we expect September to mirror August's elevated sales activity, driven by time-sensitive purchase and lease offers,\" Cox Automotive said in its report.",
      "The findings jibe with data from Cars Commerce \u2014 whose holdings include\u00a0Cars.com\u00a0\u2014 that shows\u00a0 a 33% surge in EV demand since last year as shoppers rush to take advantage of the credits. The automotive tech company also found that used EVs are on dealers' lots for 46 days on average, a nearly 30% decrease from last last year that indicates the sector of the EV market is rising in popularity.",
      "Deals to be had",

      "September 2025 could end up being the \"single biggest EV month in history,\" Tim Horvick, owner of the San Tan Ford dealership outside of Phoenix, told CBS' Van Cleave. But come October, when the EV credit is no longer in effect, the sales landscape could shift.",
      "\"It is the concern,\" Horvick said. \"It could be challenging.\"",
      "As a result of the coming end of the tax credit, along with other\u00a0policy changes introduced by the Trump administration, automakers have already slowed their production of electric vehicles, shifting their attention to more popular gas and hybrid models, CBS News reported.",
      "But not all experts believe the expiration of the tax credit will have a huge effect on future EV sales, and that's simply because sales were low to begin with.",
      "EV sales \"can't fall off a cliff because they're not very high,\" Patrick Anderson, CEO of Anderson Economic Group, a Michigan-based economic consultancy, told CBS News' Van Cleave. \"They're gonna fall off a small hill because that's as high as they got.\"",
      "Electric vehicles make up about 7% of new car sales, according to Anderson Economic Group. A recent analysis from Kelley Blue Book shows EV sales in August accounted for a record 9.9% of total car sales, up from 9.1% in July.",

      "Americans will dish out more money to heat their homes this winter as electricity and natural gas costs continue to soar.",
      "That's according to a new study from the National Energy Assistance Directors Association (NEADA) which predicts that\u00a0Americans will see their energy bill rise 7.6% to $976 on average this cold weather season. Those who rely on natural gas to heat their home could see an 8.4% jump in their bill, while those who use electricity could see a 10.2% increase.",
      "While electricity\u00a0prices vary\u00a0by state, overall the cost is rising. In August, prices increased by 6.2% compared with the same month last year, according to the latest inflation data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.",
      "Those costs will continue to escalate as much as 18% in the next few years, according to a May\u00a0report\u00a0from The U.S. Energy Information Administration.",
      "Natural gas prices are up 13.8% from last year, far outpacing the rate of inflation, which rose 2.9% in August on an annual basis.",
      "Not all Americans will see an increase in their winter energy bills. Heating oil and propane users \u2014 roughly only 10% of U.S. households \u2014 could see their energy bills decrease by 4% and 5% respectively.",
      "The overall rising home-heating costs follow greater summer air-conditioning use, amid warmer temperatures. \"The average summer household electricity bill reached an estimated $776 in 2025, the highest in at least 12 years compounding household strain,\" the report states.",
      "\"We had a period of relatively stable electric bills and then last year electricity went up twice the rate of inflation,\" Mark Wolfe, executive director of NEADA, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "As a result, more American households are falling behind on their energy bills.",
      "Since Dec. 31, 2023, energy arrearages \u2014 unpaid energy bills that homeowners owe to their utility company \u2014 have risen by about 31%, from approximately $17.5 billion to $23.0 billion by June 30, 2025, NEADA said in its report.",
      "The surge in energy arrearages comes as Americans are carrying\u00a0record amounts of debt. With inflation continuing to ramp up the cost of daily living, ahead of wages, total household debt reached $18.39 trillion in the second quarter of 2025, with unpaid credit card balances exceeding $1.21 trillion.",
      "Why are energy prices rising?",
      "The main factors driving up energy prices is the ongoing high cost of maintaining and upgrading the grid, along with rising natural gas prices and increasing electricity demand from data centers according to the NEADA report.",
      "\"As demand goes up and supply is not matching that, prices are going to go up,\" Abe Scarr, director of the Energy and Utilities Program at the Public Interest Research Group (PIRG), told CBS MoneyWatch",
      "Russia's invasion of Ukraine also\u00a0created volatility\u00a0in energy prices, government data shows.",
      "So far this year, approximately 60 utility companies have either increased electricity and gas prices or proposed further increases,\u00a0according to the Center for American Progress, a Washington D.C.-based think tank. With more rate hikes on the horizon, American households will have to try to stretch their income even further.",

      "How to lower your utility bills",
      "As winter approaches, what can Americans do to lower their utility bill?",
      "Scarr suggests that people check with their utility companies, which often offer incentive programs to help customers implement cost-saving measures. Offerings vary by utility, but many companies provide free home energy assessments and discounts for people who want to insulate their homes.",
      "For those interested in fortifying the envelope of their home to minimize heat loss, options include hiring a contractor for a professional retrofit or, for straightforward insulation projects, DIY tips, he said.",
      "When it comes to general energy conservation, experts suggest unplugging small appliances or electronics when you're not using them. While it might seem obvious, people can also turn down the temperature in the home a few degrees to save money, said Scarr.",

    "summary": "A federal grand jury indicted former FBI Director James Comey on two criminal counts. Comey has said he is innocent.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The indictment of former FBI Director James Comey on Thursday marked the culmination of President Trump's yearslong desire to see one of his political foes punished after the bureau's investigation into his 2016 presidential campaign and Russian meddling in that election.",
      "But the president's long-held ire toward Comey, coupled with his latest comments cheering the federal charges brought against the former FBI chief, could aid defense lawyers in a potential bid to have the case against Comey tossed.",
      "\"In this case, the facts before the indictment and even comments Trump made after the indictment provide strong factual evidence that Mr. Comey is the victim of either selective or vindictive prosecution,\" Gene Rossi, a former federal prosecutor who worked at the Justice Department for nearly 30 years, told CBS News.",
      "A federal grand jury returned an indictment against Comey charging him with two counts: making false statements to Congress and obstructing a congressional proceeding. It declined to indict him on an additional count of lying to Congress, a rare rejection of a proposed charge.",
      "The charges stem from Comey's September 2020 testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, during which he denied authorizing anyone at the FBI to be an anonymous source in news reports.",
      "Whether to seek an indictment had been met with pushback from career prosecutors in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Virginia, which is prosecuting the case. Staff in the office had circulated a \"declination\" memo explaining why criminal charges should not be filed against Comey, a Justice Department source told CBS News.",
      "But days before Comey was charged, and after the abrupt departure of Erik Siebert as the top prosecutor in the Virginia office, Mr. Trump installed a White House aide and his former personal defense lawyer Lindsey Halligan as Siebert's replacement.",
      "Halligan has no prosecutorial experience. Only she signed Comey's indictment, and Halligan remains the only attorney listed as representing the U.S.",
      "Comey denied any wrongdoing, and said in a video shared to social media, \"I'm innocent, so let's have a trial and keep the faith.\" His lawyer, Patrick Fitzgerald, said Comey will be vindicated in court.",
      "Legal experts expect Fitzgerald will seek to have the case dismissed on numerous grounds, including selective prosecution, which is when the prosecutor appears motivated by discriminatory intent, and vindictive prosecution, when the government acts out of \"genuine\" animus or seeks to punish a defendant for exercising a legal right.",
      "Carissa Byrne Hessick, a law professor at the University of North Carolina School of Law, said claims of selective or vindictive prosecution are difficult to prevail on, and it's tough to predict whether Comey will succeed in convincing a judge to dismiss his charges on those grounds.",
      "Courts are generally hostile to those claims \u2014 the legal standard is high for proving them and judges are concerned about opening the floodgates to these types of motions, Hessick said. But on the other hand, Comey's case may look different than others given the events leading up to his indictment, namely the appointment of Halligan and reports of internal disagreement over seeking charges, she said.",
      "\"The mixture of those two things \u2014 the fact that these sorts of cases are very hard to win, but also the unusual circumstances and the availability of evidence \u2014 I think makes it too difficult to predict what a court will do here,\" Hessick said.",
      "Mr. Trump has for years railed against Comey publicly, claiming he should be prosecuted for \"treason\" and calling him \"corrupt,\" \"stupid\" and a \"dirty cop,\" among other insults. In a social media post Saturday, the president made a direct appeal to Attorney General Pam Bondi for action against Comey and two other political opponents: New York Attorney General Letitia James and Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff of California.",
      "Mr. Trump wrote the three are \"guilty as hell\" and said, \"We can't delay any longer, it's killing our reputation and credibility. They impeached me twice, and indicted me (5 times!), OVER NOTHING. JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!\"",
      "The president then cheered Comey's indictment Thursday night.",
      "\"One of the worst human beings this Country has ever been exposed to is James Comey, the former Corrupt Head of the FBI,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social. \"Today he was indicted by a Grand Jury on two felony counts for various illegal and unlawful acts. He has been so bad for our Country, for so long, and is now at the beginning of being held responsible for his crimes against our Nation. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\"",
      "The attacks on Comey continued Friday, with Mr. Trump calling him a \"destroyer of lives\" who must pay a \"very big price\" for lying.",
      "\"Whether you like Corrupt James Comey or not, and I can't imagine too many people liking him, HE LIED!\" Mr. Trump wrote. \"It is not a complex lie, it's a very simple, but IMPORTANT one. There is no way he can explain his way out of it. He is a Dirty Cop, and always has been.\"",
      "Rossi said the years of comments made by Mr. Trump from the spring of 2017 \u2014 when the president fired Comey during his first term \u2014 to now, could bolster Comey's bid to have the charges dismissed.",
      "\"Whether vindictive or selective, this animus, the hatred, the prejudice toward who is charged, those emotions and factors become highly relevant,\" he said.",
      "But it's not just comments from Mr. Trump that could come into play. Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel also cheered the charges against Comey, with Patel claiming Comey and other top FBI officials weaponized federal law enforcement when they led the bureau.",
      "\"They are putting their thumb on the scale of justice instead of letting Lady Justice handle this matter blindly,\" Rossi said. \"That violates every norm \u2014 every norm \u2014 that a federal prosecutor is taught from the time they're born as baby prosecutors.\"",
      "He said the grand jury's rejection of the third count, lying to Congress, is \"another brick in the wall\" in support of Comey moving to dismiss the charges because of vindictive and selective prosecution, as is the opposition to pursuing an indictment by career prosecutors in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Virginia. Under Justice Department policy, prosecutors may pursue indictments only if they believe they can secure a conviction and that conviction will be sustained on appeal.",
      "\"That seasoned and career prosecutors, plus the former U.S. attorney for the EDVA, all said that this indictment doesn't have a legal and factual basis to present to the grand jury, and that [Halligan] was appointed three days before this charge was approved by the grand jury is all ample evidence that something is rotten in Denmark,\" Rossi said.",
      "Comey's case is unique compared to others where claims of selective or vindictive prosecution are raised for numerous reasons, Hessick said: It involves people who are newsworthy; there are media reports about the decision to bring charges; Mr. Trump has publicly spoken about action against Comey; and the charges against him appear to involve congressional testimony about investigations into Mr. Trump or Clinton.",
      "\"The case is also notable because this isn't just a question of the motives of the specific prosecutor who brought the charges,\" she said. \"It's also about the president's decisions to speak publicly about a case that's a high-profile political case.\"",
      "Hessick said that in previous administrations, presidents are often \u2014 but not always \u2014 careful not to comment about ongoing cases.",
      "Mr. Trump sought to have criminal charges brought against him by former special counsel Jack Smith in each of the two cases dismissed for vindictive and selective prosecution, but one of the requests was denied. The two cases, one involving the 2020 election and the other involving Mr. Trump's handling of sensitive government documents after his first term, were dismissed after he won a second term in the White House.",
      "Hunter Biden, former President Joe Biden's son, also unsuccessfully sought to have his indictment on tax charges dismissed on the same grounds, arguing the investigation into him was \"compromised by politics.\"",
      "Hunter Biden pleaded guilty to the charges last year.",

      "Attorney General Pam Bondi said late Friday she has ordered Justice Department agents to guard Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities \u2014 and directed counterterrorism task forces to look into attacks against federal authorities.",
      "The move by Bondi came after one detainee was killed and two others were injured in a shooting at an ICE field office in Dallas on Wednesday, the latest shooting or threat targeting an ICE facility or immigration agent in recent months.",
      "\"At my direction, I am deploying DOJ agents to ICE facilities\u2014and wherever ICE comes under siege\u2014to safeguard federal agents, protect federal property, and immediately arrest all individuals engaged in any federal crime,\" Bondi wrote on X.",

      "ICE has said attacks on its agents have spiked this year, as the Trump administration uses the agency to dramatically increase arrests and deportations of undocumented immigrants. In recent months, ICE operations in Los Angeles, Chicago, New York and elsewhere have drawn tense protests and clashes between agents and demonstrators.",

    "story": [
      "MyPillow founder Mike Lindell, an ally of President Trump, defamed the election technology company Smartmatic with false statements that its voting machines helped rig the 2020 presidential election, a federal judge in Minnesota ruled Friday.",
      "But U.S. District Judge Jeffrey Bryan deferred until future proceedings the question of whether Lindell \u2014 one of the country's most prominent propagators of false claims that the 2020 election was a fraud \u2014 acted with the \"actual malice\" that Smartmatic still needs to prove to collect any damages.",
      "The judge said there are \"genuine fact disputes\" as to whether Lindell's statements were made \"with knowledge that they were false or made with reckless disregard to their falsity.\" He noted that the defense says Lindell has an \"unwavering belief\" that his statements were truthful.",
      "The statements cited by the judge arose from Lindell's criticism of the results of the 2020 election in California's Los Angeles County, which former President Joe Biden carried with 71% of the vote over Mr. Trump and helped Biden secure the state's 55 electoral votes.",
      "The county used Smartmatic's computerized touchscreen ballot-marking devices and was the company's only customer for the 2020 election. Lindell alleged the machines were rigged to change Trump votes to Biden votes.",
      "The judge ruled there were 51 specific times when Lindell falsely claimed \u2014 in documentaries he produced and through various media and personal appearances \u2014 that Smartmatic interfered with the results.",
      "\"The Court concludes that, based on the record presented, no reasonable trier of fact could find that any of the statements at issue are true,\" Bryan wrote.",
      "Smartmatic attorney Erik Connolly said they will be seeking \"nine-figure damages\" from Lindell and MyPillow for \"spreading lies\" about the company.",
      "\"Smartmatic did not and could not have rigged the 2020 election,\" Connolly said in a statement. \"It was impossible, and everything that Mr. Lindell said about Smartmatic was false.\"",
      "Lindell told The Associated Press shortly after the Smartmatic ruling was filed Friday that he hadn't seen it, but that it was \"the most bizarre thing I've ever heard.\"",
      "Lindell went on to call Smartmatic \"one of the most corrupt companies in the world,\" and he vowed to keep fighting until its voting machines are \"melted down and turned into prison bars.\" He said he'll take his crusade to eliminate voting machines in favor of paper ballots all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court if he has to.",
      "Smartmatic has been on a winning streak, having reached settlements last year with two conservative news outlets,\u00a0including Newsmax\u00a0and One America News Network. The Florida-based company also still has an\u00a0active case against Fox News.",
      "Lindell also has made similar claims against Dominion Voting Systems. He lost a case involving the Denver-based company in June when a jury ruled that he defamed a former Dominion employee by accusing him of treason. The jury awarded $2.3 million in damages.",
      "Lindell, a Republican, also told CBS News in a text message Friday that he is considering a gubernatorial run in Minnesota, confirming local news reports in the state. Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz announced last week he is running for a third term.",
      "\"I am considering running,\" Lindell wrote. \"...We are doing our due-diligence and so far things are looking very good!\"",
      "He added, \"I will certainly be adding securing our elections to my platform! We polled Minnesota and secure our elections was the #3 concern!\"",
      "MyPillow is headquartered in the Minneapolis metropolitan area.",
      "Lindell and MyPillow have faced a number of legal and financial setbacks in recent years, but he won a victory in July when a federal appeals court ruled he didn't have to pay a $5 million arbitration award to a software engineer who disputed data that Lindell claimed proved China interfered in the 2020 election. The court said the arbitration panel overstepped its authority.",

      "U.S. Magistrate Judge Lindsey Vaala expressed confusion and surprise at some points during the seven-minute court session when a federal grand jury impaneled in Alexandria, Virginia,\u00a0 returned the indictment of former FBI Director James Comey Thursday night.",
      "According to a transcript of the proceedings obtained by CBS News, Judge Vaala asked the newly named interim U.S. Attorney Lindsey Halligan \u2014 a former Trump personal lawyer \u2014 why there were two versions of the indictment.",
      "A majority of the grand jury that reviewed the Comey matter voted not to charge him with one of the three counts presented by prosecutors, according to a form that was signed by the grand jury's foreperson and filed in court. He was indicted on two other counts \u2014 making false statements to Congress and obstructing a congressional proceeding \u2014 after 14 of 23 jurors voted in favor of them, the foreperson told the judge.",
      "But two versions of the indictment were published on the case docket: one with the dropped third count, and one without. The transcript reveals why this occurred.",
      "\"So this has never happened before. I've been handed two documents that are in the Mr. Comey case that are inconsistent with one another,\" Vaala said to Halligan. \"There seems to be a discrepancy. They're both signed by the (grand jury) foreperson.\"",
      "And she noted that one document did not clearly indicate what the grand jury had decided.",
      "\"The one that says it's a failure to concur in an indictment, it doesn't say with respect to one count,\" Vaala said. \"It looks like they failed to concur across all three counts, so I'm a little confused as to why I was handed two things with the same case number that are inconsistent.\"",
      "Halligan initially responded that she hadn't seen that version of the indictment.",
      "\"So I only reviewed the one with the two counts that our office redrafted when we found out about the two \u2014 two counts that were true billed, and I signed that one. I did not see the other one. I don't know where that came from,\" Halligan told the judge.",
      "Vaala responded, \"You didn't see it?\" And Halligan again told her, \"I did not see that one.\"",
      "Vaala seemed surprised: \"So your office didn't prepare the indictment that they \u2014\"",
      "Halligan then replied, \"No, no, no \u2014 I \u2014 no, I prepared three counts. I only signed the one \u2014 the two-count (indictment). I don't know which one with three counts you have in your hands.\"",
      "\"Okay. It has your signature on it,\" Vaala told Halligan, who responded, \"Okay. Well.\"",
      "Vaala also noted that the court session began unusually late, at 6:47 p.m. Thursday evening, telling the grand jurors \"I don't think we've ever met this late\" as she thanked them for their service.",
      "The charges against Comey \u2014 which accuse him of lying in testimony he gave to the Senate in 2020 \u2014 mark an unprecedented step for the Justice Department, after President Trump publicly urged prosecutors to look into the ex-FBI leader that he fired in 2017 and sparred with for years.",
      "In an unusual move, Comey's indictment was personally signed by Halligan, not a rank-and-file federal prosecutor. Halligan was sworn in on Monday, after days of upheaval in the U.S. attorney's office in Alexandria.",
      "The former head of the office, Erik Siebert, announced his resignation on Friday following worries among his staff that he could be fired for failing to criminally charge another Trump adversary, New York Attorney General Letitia James. A day later, Mr. Trump announced Siebert had been fired, and posted a message suggesting Attorney General Pam Bondi should look into Comey, James and a third longtime Trump foil, Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff of California.",
      "Before Comey was indicted, staff at the U.S. attorney's office circulated a memo that argued charges should not be brought against the former FBI director, a Justice Department source familiar with the matter told CBS News.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump announced Thursday that the U.S. would impose a new round of tariffs, including a 100% tariff on pharmaceutical drugs, a 30% tariff on upholstered furniture, a 50% tariff on kitchen cabinets and bathroom vanities, and a 30% tariff on heavy trucks.",
      "In social media posts to Truth Social, Mr. Trump said the new tariffs would take effect Oct. 1.",
      "Mr. Trump said in his posts that the 100% tariff on \"any branded or patented Pharmaceutical Product\" would not apply to companies building manufacturing plants in the U.S., which he defined as either \"breaking ground\" or being \"under construction.\"",
      "In 2024, America imported nearly $233 billion in pharmaceutical and medicinal products, according to the Census Bureau. The prospect of prices doubling for some medicines could send shockwaves to voters as health care expenses, as well as the costs of Medicare and Medicaid, potentially increase.",
      "Still, some experts think the new pharma tariffs could end up having only a modest impact, noting that generic drugs are exempt. The loophole for drugmakers with operations in the U.S. is also likely to soften the blow, Neal Shearing, group chief economist with Capital Economics, said in a report.",
      "\"Many of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies either already have some production in the U.S. or have announced plans to build production in the near future,\" he said. \"Add in the fact that pharmaceuticals is the one area where we think there may have been significant inventory accumulation this year, as importers have sought to front-run potential tariffs, and the impact on the effective tariff rate is likely to be small.\"",
      "Higher costs for home furnishings?",
      "Trump argued that foreign manufacturers of furniture and cabinetry were \"flooding\" the U.S. with their products and that tariffs must be applied \"for National Security and other reasons.\"",
      "The new tariffs on cabinetry could further increase the costs for homebuilders at a time when many people seeking to buy a house feel priced out by the mix of housing shortages and high mortgage rates.",
      "Last month, Mr. Trump announced on social media that a \"major Tariff Investigation\" was being conducted on furniture coming into the U.S. and said that within the next 50 days, the investigation would be completed, and a tariff rate would be announced.",
      "The president said the 25% tariff on \"all 'Heavy (Big!) Trucks' made in other parts of the world\" was \"in order to protect our Great Heavy Truck Manufacturers from unfair outside competition.\"",
      "\"Large Truck Company Manufacturers, such as Peterbilt, Kenworth, Freightliner, Mack Trucks, and others, will be protected from the onslaught of outside interruptions,\" Trump posted.",
      "Throughout much of 2025, the Trump administration's broad tariffs defied predictions that they would fuel inflation, but that respite seems to have ended after economic data this month showed the duties are now driving prices upward. The Consumer Price Index in August rose at a rate of 2.9% from a year ago, up from an annual pace of 2.3% in April, when Mr. Trump first launched a sweeping set of import taxes.",
      "Nor is there evidence that the tariffs are creating factory jobs or more construction of manufacturing facilities. Since April, the Bureau of Labor Statistics has reported that manufacturers cut 42,000 jobs and builders have downsized by 8,000.",
      "\"There's no inflation,\" Mr. Trump told reporters Thursday. \"We're having unbelievable success.\"",

      "President Trump told his administration on Friday to declassify any federal records about Amelia Earhart, the pilot whose 1937 disappearance over the Pacific Ocean has drawn decades of public fascination.",
      "\"Amelia made it almost three quarters around the World before she suddenly, and without notice, vanished, never to be seen again,\" the president wrote on Truth Social. \"Her disappearance, almost 90 years ago, has captivated millions.\"",
      "Earhart and navigator Fred Noonan disappeared as they flew toward Howland Island in the Pacific, part of her attempt to become the first female aviator to circumnavigate the world.",
      "It's widely believed that Earhart crashed into the ocean near Howland Island after running out of fuel, says Laurie Gwen Shapiro, a journalist who wrote a book on Earhart. But other theories about where she and her plane ended up have circulated for decades \u2014 many of which lack clear evidence. Researchers are planning an expedition to a remote island later this year.",
      "It's not clear what, if any, classified documents the government may have on Earhart.",
      "But a lawmaker who represents the Northern Mariana Islands territory in the U.S. House pushed Mr. Trump to declassify and release Earhart records earlier this year, referring to \"credible, firsthand accounts\" that the aviator was spotted on the Pacific island of Saipan.",
      "\"Despite these recollections, her disappearance and the possibility that she may have died on our islands remain matters of unresolved historical inquiry,\" Del. Kimberlyn King-Hinds, a Republican, wrote in a July letter to the president.",
      "One of the theories is that Earhart was on a spy mission for the U.S. government when she landed in Saipan and was taken into custody by the Japanese.",
      "Documents previously released by the FBI contain a 1967 request for a security review of a manuscript that cites Navy files on Earhart that were marked \"confidential,\" a level of classification. The manuscript's author, a senior officer in the Air Force, wrote that the conclusions in the Navy report were that Earhart was not on a spy mission, did not crash-land in Saipan, and was not held as a prisoner or executed as a spy.",
      "The FBI, in approving that manuscript for publication \u2014 which is a typical process for current and former government officials \u2014 noted that the Navy files did \"not warrant classification since the release of it would not be prejudicial to the national defense.\"",
      "Shapiro called the theory that Earhart was taken captive in Saipan \"nonsense.\"",
      "\"It's 99.9% that she ran out of gas,\" Shapiro told CBS News. She said Earhart and Noonan were low on fuel and \"very ill-prepared\" for their attempted flight to Howland Island, a tiny, difficult-to-find island in the middle of the ocean.",
      "\"It's very boring to tell people, you know what, she ran out of gas,\" Shapiro said. \"The fantasy around it is amazing.\"",
      "The National Archives and Records Administration has also previously\u00a0released documents\u00a0on the search for Earhart.",
      "In 1993, two Hawaiian lawmakers introduced bills in the House and Senate to require the government to release all records relating to Earhart's last flight and disappearance. The bills called for the declassification of any such relevant records that have been classified as government secrets.\u00a0The measures never made it out of the committees they were referred to.",
      "Mr. Trump's push to declassify Earhart records follows his decision to release records on the 1960s-era assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr., John F. Kennedy and Robert F. Kennedy. His administration is also under pressure to release records on the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.",

    "published": "Fri, 26 Sep 2025 18:09:43 -0400",
    "summary": "The economic impact of a government shutdown depends on its duration, economists say. Some payments, like Social Security, would continue to be issued.",
    "story": [
      "A government shutdown could begin within days, halting pay for hundreds of thousands of federal workers and delaying services, as lawmakers remain deadlocked over funding past Sept. 30.",
      "The financial impact of a shutdown typically depends on the length of the disruption, with each week costing the U.S. economy about $7 billion, according to a new analysis from EY-Parthenon Chief Economist Gregory Daco. A suspension could also weigh on investor and consumer confidence at a time when the U.S. economy is already facing headwinds, he told CBS News.",
      "Government shutdowns aren't new: The U.S. has experienced 14 of them since 1980, with the longest occurring over 34 days from December 2018 into January 2019, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center. They're triggered when Congress fails to pass a full-year spending bill or a continuing resolution to fund the government for the pending fiscal year, which begins on Wednesday. Oct. 1.",
      "\"We've been to this picnic before, unfortunately,\" Wayne Winegarden, a senior fellow in business and economics at Pacific Research Institute, told CBS News. Pacific Research is a think tank that focuses on free trade.",
      "\"In general, things like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, those will continue to go out, and we'll continue to pay interest on the debt,\" Winegarden said.",
      "But, he added, \"The general rule is that the longer it goes on, the bigger the disruption.\"",
      "What happens if there is a government shutdown?",
      "Without congressional approval for new spending, federal agencies are typically prohibited from doling out money. Activities at many agencies will be suspended until lawmakers agree on a new funding bill, with hundreds of thousands of federal workers likely to be furloughed during that time.",
      "Yet because the government must continue to provide services that protect life and property, agencies will determine which essential workers must continue working, although they won't receive pay until lawmakers resolve the funding gap.",
      "And while some federal employees would eventually receive back pay, others could experience financial strain while their paychecks are suspended, Daco noted.",
      "During the shutdown of 2018-2019, about 800,000 government workers missed several weeks of pay, creating financial hardships for many. Some turned to online fundraising campaigns for assistance, while others relied on food banks to help them get through the period.",
      "What is the economic impact of a government shutdown?",
      "While the biggest direct hit would be on government workers, followed by federal contractors who would also be shut off from funding, delayed federal procurement on goods and services could also ripple through the broader economy, Daco told CBS News.",
      "A shutdown could also undermine confidence in the economy at a time when some sectors, such as the labor market, are facing headwinds, he added. Markets could be rattled by the disruption, as well as consumer sentiment, some economists noted.",
      "\"We need more certainty in the rules of the game of the economy,\" Winegarden said. \"Uncertainty, at this moment, is the last thing we need.\"",
      "A halt in government functions could also complicate monetary policy decisions, potentially resulting in delays for key economic data next month, such as the Oct. 3 jobs report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. With the labor market stalling out over the summer, Federal Reserve officials are expected to closely scrutinize the latest jobs data when they make their next rate decision at the central bank's Oct. 29 meeting.",
      "\"A government shutdown at this economic juncture represent a graver risk than when the economy is running at full steam,\" Daco said.",

    "summary": "The Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to withhold more than $4 billion in foreign aid funding through a maneuver known as a \"pocket rescission.\"",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Friday allowed President Trump's administration to withhold more than $4 billion in foreign aid funding, granting its request for emergency relief in a dispute over money that Congress has already approved.",
      "The high court's decision follows an order that Chief Justice John Roberts had issued earlier this month, which temporarily froze a district court injunction requiring the Trump administration to spend the money Congress appropriated for foreign-aid projects by the end of September. The court appeared to divide 6-3, with Justices Elena Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson, the court's three liberals, dissenting.",
      "The Supreme Court said in an unsigned order that the harm to the executive branch's ability to conduct foreign affairs appears to outweigh the potential harm faced by the plaintiffs, which are organizations and businesses that receive funding for foreign aid projects. It added that the decision \"should not be read as a final determination on the merits. The relief granted by the Court today reflects our preliminary view, consistent with the standards for interim relief.\"",
      "The legal fight over foreign aid",
      "The dispute before the justices involves a tranche of more than $4 billion Congress approved last year for overseas development assistance, peacekeeping operations and to promote democracy globally, among other priorities. Mr. Trump notified Congress last month that he is seeking to claw back $4.9 billion before the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30 through a maneuver known as a \"pocket rescission.\"",
      "The Government Accountability Office has said the move is illegal.",
      "But the Supreme Court said in its decision that at this stage in the proceedings, the government \"has made a sufficient showing\" that the Impoundment Control Act, the mechanism for the president to move to cancel congressionally approved federal funding, precludes the plaintiffs' suit. That lawsuit sought to make the president comply with appropriations law passed last year.",
      "In a dissenting opinion, Kagan said the stakes in the case are high, as it involves the allocation of power between the executive branch and Congress.",
      "\"[T]he consequence of today's grant is significant. I appreciate that the majority refrains from offering a definitive view of this dispute and the questions raised in it,\" she wrote. \"But the effect of its ruling is to allow the Executive to cease obligating $4 billion in funds that Congress appropriated for foreign aid, and that will now never reach its intended recipients. Because that result conflicts with the separation of powers, I respectfully dissent.\"",
      "U.S. District Judge Amir Ali ruled in early September that the administration's refusal not to spend congressionally approved funds is likely illegal under a federal law governing the agency rule-making process. The judge said the Trump administration could withhold the funding only if Congress rescinded it through duly enacted legislation.",
      "The dispute was brought by nonprofit organizations and development companies in February after the Trump administration issued a 90-day pause of foreign development assistance to review whether programs were consistent with the president's foreign policy.",
      "It has since ping-ponged through the courts, including the Supreme Court back in March. Then, the high court split 5-4 in deciding to leave in place an order from Ali that required the Trump administration to pay roughly $2 billion in invoices for foreign-aid work that had already been performed.",
      "In the latest development in the case, a three-judge panel on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled last month that the nonprofits and businesses could not sue on grounds the administration violated the separation of powers by unilaterally declining to spend congressionally approved foreign-aid funds. The panel voted 2-1 to wipe away an order from Ali that had prohibited the government from withholding the money Congress appropriated last year for foreign assistance programs.",
      "But the D.C. Circuit panel later issued an amended opinion that opened up an avenue for the nonprofits and businesses to seek relief on different legal grounds. On the heels of that decision, Mr. Trump informed Congress of his plan to rescind the $4.9 billion in foreign aid funding, which he said supported \"wasteful\" programs that did not align with his \"America First\" foreign policy agenda.",
      "The plaintiffs then filed a new request for preliminary relief with Ali, and the judge found that the Trump administration had a duty to comply with Congress's directives by spending the $4 billion by the end of September, when the fiscal year ends.",
      "The Trump administration asked the D.C. Circuit to freeze Ali's latest order. After the appeals court declined to do so, the administration asked the Supreme Court to intervene.",
      "In a filing with the high court, Solicitor General D. John Sauer said the district court's injunction \"raises a grave and urgent threat to the separation of powers.\"",
      "\"The President can hardly speak with one voice in foreign affairs or in dealings with Congress when the district court is forcing the Executive Branch to advocate against its own objectives,\" Sauer wrote.",
      "The solicitor general said Ali's injunction \"puts the executive branch at war with itself\" by requiring it to spend the same $4 billion that the president wants to claw back.",
      "But lawyers for the plaintiffs said that the government has been obligated to spend the money approved by Congress for specific purposes since at least March 2024. They wrote in a filing that the appropriations legislation enacted by Congress last year remains binding on the executive branch.",
      "\"[T]he upshot of the government's theory is that Congress's signature law meant to control impoundments actually provided the President vast new powers to impound funds, and made it virtually impossible to challenge impoundments in court,\" the lawyers said. \"Congress would not have enacted such a self-defeating statute.\"",
      "The plaintiffs warned that allowing the president to withhold the money for foreign assistance would threaten the viability of groups that receive federal dollars for projects overseas. For one of the organizations, Democracy International, 98% of its revenues in 2024 came from awards from the U.S. Agency for International Development, according to court filings. Lawyers warned the company would be at risk of bankruptcy if the expiring appropriations are not spent.",
      "\"The pocket rescission of democracy promotion funds is an existential threat to Democracy International,\" the plaintiffs wrote.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump's Justice Department charged former FBI Director James Comey on Thursday with lying to Congress, an unprecedented step against a longtime Trump foe that revisits controversies over the FBI's Trump-Russia probe from nearly a decade ago.",
      "A grand jury in Northern Virginia voted to indict Comey on two counts: making a false statement to Congress and obstructing a congressional proceeding. In an unusual move, the grand jury voted against indicting him on an additional charge of making a false statement.",
      "The criminal charges revolve around a Senate hearing in September 2020, when lawmakers grilled Comey \u2014 who was fired by Mr. Trump three years earlier \u2014 about how he handled the FBI's 2016 investigations into pro-Trump election meddling by Russia and Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server. Both election-year probes have drawn Mr. Trump's ire for years.",
      "The five-year statute of limitations for charges out of that hearing would have expired next week.",
      "Comey asserted in an Instagram video that he is innocent.",
      "In a statement, Attorney General Pam Bondi said the indictment \"reflects this Department of Justice's commitment to holding those who abuse positions of power accountable for misleading the American people.\"",
      "Count 1: Comey accused of lying about media leaks",
      "The first count against Comey that was approved by the grand jury accuses him of breaking a federal law that makes it a crime to make \"any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation\" to a federal body, including Congress.",
      "The charge hinges on a combative back-and-forth between the former FBI director and Republican Sen.Ted Cruz of Texas during the Sept. 30, 2020, Senate hearing.",
      "In the hearing, Cruz pressed Comey on whether he had ever authorized another FBI staffer to serve as an anonymous source in any media reports about the bureau's 2016 investigations involving Mr. Trump and Hillary Clinton.",
      "Comey had answered no to a similar question during another Senate hearing in 2017. But Cruz said in the 2020 questioning that former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe \u2014 another Trump foe \u2014 has \"publicly and repeatedly stated that he leaked information to the Wall Street Journal and that you were directly aware of it and that you directly authorized it,\" referring to an article about an FBI investigation\u00a0into the Clinton Foundation.",
      "\"Now, what Mr. McCabe is saying and what you testified to this committee cannot both be true. One or the other is false,\" the senator said to Comey. \"Who's telling the truth?\"",
      "\"I can only speak to my testimony. I stand by the testimony,\" replied Comey.",
      "Thursday's indictment alleges that this statement is false because Comey \"then and there knew, he in fact had authorized [an unnamed person] to serve as an anonymous source in news reports regarding an FBI investigation.\"",
      "The indictment does not specify what alleged media leak led to the charges.",
      "A 2018 report by the Justice Department inspector general's office says Comey and McCabe discussed the Wall Street Journal article after it came out, but gave investigators competing stories about their meeting. Comey told the watchdog that McCabe \"led him to believe\" that McCabe hadn't authorized the release of any information to the Journal. But McCabe said he told Comey a day after the article was published that he'd approved the release himself, and Comey replied that it was a good idea.",
      "The report says \"the overwhelming weight of that evidence supported Comey's version of the conversation,\" and McCabe \"lacked candor\" in his conversation with Comey.",
      "McCabe later told \"60 Minutes\"\u00a0he did not intentionally mislead the inspector general. McCabe was fired in 2018, days before he was set to retire.",
      "In another incident separate from the McCabe controversy, the Justice Department's internal watchdog\u00a0found that Comey violated FBI policy by authorizing a friend, law professor Daniel Richman, to provide a reporter with the contents of a memo describing his interactions with Mr. Trump. It did not accuse Comey of releasing classified information.",
      "Count 2: Obstructing a congressional proceeding",
      "Comey was also indicted Thursday for allegedly trying to \"influence, obstruct and impede\" an investigation by the Senate Judiciary Committee by \"making false and misleading statements.\" The indictment does not say what alleged false statement led to the obstruction charge.",
      "Grand jury rejects a charge against Comey",
      "A majority of the Alexandria, Virginia-based grand jury that reviewed the Comey matter voted not to charge him with one of the three counts presented by prosecutors, according to a form that was signed by the grand jury's foreperson and filed in court.",
      "In order for federal prosecutors to criminally indict somebody, they need to convince most members of a 23-person grand jury that they have \"probable cause\" to believe a crime was committed \u2014 a much lower bar than the one needed to convict somebody.",
      "It's very rare for grand juries to decline an indictment.",
      "The unsuccessful count against Comey would have accused him of illegally making false statements to Congress during a line of questioning by Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina in September 2020.",
      "Graham had asked Comey if he remembered getting a lead from the intelligence community in September 2016 that alleged Hillary Clinton's campaign \"was going to create a scandal regarding Trump and Russia\" in order to distract from her use of a private email server.",
      "Comey replied: \"That doesn't ring a bell\" \u2014 which the Justice Department called false.",
      "The allegation about Clinton's campaign first surfaced in 2020, when it was\u00a0declassified\u00a0by Mr. Trump's Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe. Clinton campaign officials denied the accusation to Justice Department special counsel John Durham, a Trump-era prosecutor tasked with reviewing the Russia probe. But Durham said in a\u00a02023 report\u00a0that FBI investigators looking into possible Trump-Russia ties should've paid more attention to the claims.",
      "Justice Department data shows how unusual it is for grand juries to decline an indictment. In the 2016 fiscal year, federal prosecutors declined to bring charges against somebody because the grand jury didn't return an indictment only six times, out of more than 150,000 suspects who were investigated that year, according to a\u00a0Justice Department report.",
      "In recent months, however, grand juries in Washington, D.C., have rejected several requests for indictments by the Justice Department, including a possible felony charge against a person who was accused of throwing a sandwich at a federal agent. Former federal prosecutor Brendan Ballou told CBS News earlier this month that trend \"suggests that the administration has absolutely destroyed its credibility with jurors.\"",

      "During that hearing, GOP Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas asked Comey about earlier testimony in 2017 denying having been an anonymous source or authorizing another FBI official to be an anonymous source for news reports about the FBI's investigations into Mr. Trump or Hillary Clinton.

A lawyer for McCabe said in 2018 that McCabe authorized the disclosure of information to a Wall Street Journal reporter in 2016 about the Clinton investigation with Comey's knowledge. The lawyer made the claim in response to an investigation by the Justice Department's internal watchdog, which found McCabe \"lacked candor\" when he told Comey, or led Comey to believe, that he had not authorized the disclosure.",

I would not have authorized this. If someone says that I did, then we ought to have another conversation because I, it doesn't make a lot of sense to me,\" according to a report detailing the findings released in April 2018.",
      "The inspector general's report noted that while it was relying on the recollections only of McCabe and Comey about conversations about the leak, \"the overwhelming weight of that evidence supported Comey's version of the conversation. Indeed, none of the circumstantial evidence provided support for McCabe's account of the discussion; rather, we found that much of the available evidence undercut McCabe's claim.\"",
      "The internal watchdog concluded that McCabe \"lacked candor, including under oath, on multiple occasions\" when describing his role regarding the disclosure to the Journal in violation of FBI rules.",
      "Separately, the Justice Department's inspector general\u00a0found that Comey violated FBI policy\u00a0by taking home four unclassified memos memorializing interactions with Mr. Trump in 2017 and authorizing a friend, Daniel Richman, who is a law professor at Columbia University, to provide the contents of one of the memos to a reporter at The New York Times.",

    "summary": "Senate Democrats are escalating their demands for information about White House border czar Tom Homan and any involvement he has had in federal contracts.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Senate Democrats are escalating their demands for information about White House border czar Tom Homan and any involvement he has had in federal contracts, following allegations that he accepted $50,000 in cash from undercover FBI agents posing as businessmen last year.",
      "In a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem that was first obtained by CBS News, seven Democrats on the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee called for the release of Department of Homeland Security contracts, communications and other materials tied to the allegations. The group of lawmakers, which includes ranking member Sen. Gary Peters of Michigan, set an Oct. 10 deadline for the department to respond.",
      "CBS News reported earlier this week that investigators examined whether Homan took the money in September 2024 in return for promises of government action if President Trump returned to office. One source briefed on the matter said investigators were focused on a bag of money given to Homan. MSNBC first reported that the transaction was caught on video as part of an FBI sting, and that Homan indicated he could help the undercover agents win government contracts. Homan did not disclose any such payment on his White House ethics filings, and Justice Department sources told CBS News the probe involved FBI and public integrity investigators before it was closed by Trump appointees.",
      "\"If true, this alleged conduct by a senior government official is unacceptable,\" the Democratic senators wrote, warning that the administration's decision to end the case \"raises further concerns that the Administration is weaponizing our system of justice to protect the President's friends and to persecute his political foes.\" The letter also points to the $170 billion Congress recently appropriated for border security and immigration enforcement, stressing that \"our homeland security should not be for sale.\"",
      "Democrats noted that Homan previously worked as a consultant for GEO Group, a private prison company that is one of ICE's largest contractors, saying his relationship with the company could be a conflict of interest. Homan was an official with Immigration and Customs Enforcement during the first Trump term and was named border czar shortly after the 2024 election.",
      "In an appearance on Fox News this week, Homan insisted that he did nothing wrong.",
      "\"Look, I did nothing criminal. I did nothing illegal,\" he said. \"You're talking about a guy who spent 34 years enforcing the law.\"",
      "On Monday, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Homan never took the money. She called the investigation, which was initiated by the prior administration and dropped by the Trump administration, \"another example of the weaponization of the Biden Department of Justice against one of President Trump's strongest and most vocal supporters.\" Justice Department leaders have also said investigators found no credible evidence of wrongdoing.",
      "The Senate Democrats are asking DHS to hand over all contracts and grants Homan has been involved in since Jan. 20, 2025; his communications on contract awards; full GEO Group contract files; contacts between GEO Group and federal officials; and records of meetings with former clients while serving as border czar.",
      "A DHS spokesperson referred questions about the demand to the White House. A White House spokesperson pointed to statements defending Homan and saying he \"has not been involved with any contract award decisions.\"",
      "\"He is a career law enforcement officer and lifelong public servant who is doing a phenomenal job on behalf of President Trump and the country,\" said Abigail Jackson, the White House deputy press secretary.",
      "The letter follows a flurry of similar moves this week. Democrats on the House Homeland Security Committee called for Homan to testify, and Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee opened an inquiry into the closure of the investigation. The same group of Democrats on the Homeland Security Committee pressed Attorney General Pam Bondi to release information about the Homan investigation by Oct. 8.",
      "With Republicans in control of the House and Senate, the inquiries are unlikely to go far, since Democrats do not wield subpoena power in the minority. But the investigations could gain steam if Democrats win back either chamber in next year's midterm elections.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump tried to boost the spirits of Team USA at the 45th Ryder Cup in New York on Friday, where he was greeted with cheers from thousands of fans at arguably the most prestigious competition in golf.",
      "The competition got underway early in the morning at Bethpage Black on Long Island, one of the most challenging courses on the pro golf circuit. The Ryder Cup takes place every two years, alternating between a course in the U.S. and one in Europe. The tournament features two rounds of team matches on Friday and Saturday, before one-on-one matches on Sunday to close out the weekend.",
      "\"I'm going to go for a little while to represent the United States at the Ryder Cup, which is very exciting, and we'll be watching that,\" Mr. Trump told reporters before leaving the White House. He was accompanied by his eldest granddaughter Kai Trump, a\u00a0talented high school golfer\u00a0in her own right.",
      "Air Force One flew over the course in Farmingdale on Long Island before landing. Mr. Trump lamented that Team USA \"is not doing so well,\" and joked that he had to travel to Bethpage to help boost the American golfers.",
      "His arrival came as the Americans were on their way to losing three of the first four team matches. Team USA picked up a win in the fourth match on the 18th hole shortly before the president got to the course.",
      "He was introduced shortly after noon, with the crowd chanting \"U-S-A\" and singing along to the national anthem as fighter jets flew overhead.",
      "As the second round of matches got underway, the president emerged from his box behind the first tee to greet Team USA golfers Bryson DeChambeau, who Mr. Trump has\u00a0golfed with before, and Ben Griffin. The two Americans were in the first group to play in the afternoon, competing against Team Europe's Justin Rose and Tommy Fleetwood. The president stood behind the group as each golfer hit their first shot before returning to his seat.",
      "Mr. Trump remained at the course for about two and a half hours. The Americans were leading in two of the four afternoon matches, and tied in a third, at the time of his departure.",
      "Scottie Scheffler, the world's best player and the anchor of the American team, said this week that the president's presence would give the U.S. team a boost.",
      "\"It's been a tough few weeks for our country with some of the stuff that's been going on, and to have our president here and for us to represent the United States of America, albeit being in a golf tournament, is extremely important for us,\" Scheffler said, according to\u00a0The Athletic.",
      "An avid golfer himself and owner of several championship-level courses, Mr. Trump has been highly engaged with the sport since returning to office. His course in Florida, Trump National Doral Miami, hosted a tournament for the LIV Golf tour in April, which he attended. And he has been involved in negotiations aimed at completing a merger between LIV and the PGA Tour, which remains unresolved. His courses are scheduled to host both LIV and PGA events next year.",
      "The Europeans currently hold the Ryder Cup, having\u00a0defeated\u00a0the Americans handily in Rome in 2023. The\u00a0home team\u00a0has won the past four Ryder Cups, with the last\u00a0European win on U.S. soil\u00a0coming in 2012. The tournament is known for its raucous crowds, with thousands of spectators boosting the home squad and berating the visitors.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/national-archives-mikie-sherrill-military-record-jack-ciattarelli/",
    "published": "Fri, 26 Sep 2025 14:33:53 -0400",
    "summary": "The National Archives admitted a technician had erred in releasing Rep. Mikie Sherill's \"entire record.\"",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 A branch of the National Archives released a mostly unredacted version of Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill's military records to Nicholas De Gregorio, an ally of Jack Ciattarelli, her GOP opponent in the New Jersey governor's race. The disclosure potentially violates the Privacy Act of 1974 and exemptions established under the Freedom of Information Act.",
      "The documents, which were also obtained by CBS News, appear to show that the National Personnel Records Center, a wing of the National Archives and Records Administration charged with maintaining personnel records for service members and civil servants of the U.S. government, released Sherrill's full military file \u2014 almost completely unredacted. CBS News discovered the egregious blunder while investigating whether Sherrill was involved in the 1994 Naval Academy scandal, in which more than 100 midshipmen were implicated in cheating on an exam. Sherrill was not accused of cheating and said her only involvement was not informing on her fellow classmates.",
      "The documents included Sherrill's Social Security number, which appears on almost every page, home addresses for her and her parents, life insurance information, Sherrill's performance evaluations and the nondisclosure agreement between her and the U.S. government to safeguard classified information.",
      "The only details redacted in the document are the Social Security numbers of her former superiors. The files appear to be the same ones Sherrill requested in August 2017 from the National Personnel Records Center, or NPRC, according to a signature verification page in the documents.",
      "Contacted by CBS News, the NPRC told CBS News that a technician did not follow standard operating procedures for releasing records, and should only have released portions eligible under FOIA rules.",
      "\"The technician should NOT have released the entire record,\" Grace McCaffrey of the National Archives and Records Administration, said in an email to CBS News' questions.",
      "McCaffrey said the Archives became aware of the breach on Tuesday and immediately initiated a review of internal controls, including how and why the technician did not follow standard operating procedures. The National Personnel Records Center also alerted the agency's inspector general to the breach and said it contacted Sherrill's congressional office to apologize.",
      "Political campaigns, opposition research firms and news organizations often seek the military records of current or former service members running for elected office for both vetting purposes and to better inform voters. Military veterans and the next of kin of a deceased former member may request the full breadth of their military service records. The full file is only available to the general public 62 years after they finish their military service. When others request those records, only parts of the military file are released, and sections are redacted for privacy or national security reasons.",
      "During the tightening New Jersey governor's race \u2014 a new poll shows Sherrill and Ciattarelli tied \u2014 Republicans allied with Ciattarelli have been examining Sherrill's military record, looking for information about the Naval Academy cheating scandal, in which over a hundred midshipmen were implicated in cheating on the final electrical engineering exam, a notoriously difficult course required for all third-year students who are not engineering majors.",
      "Sherrill had an unblemished career in the Navy and as a midshipman received a Navy Achievement Medal in 1991 for saving the life of a fellow classmate.\u00a0 Neither the documents released by the National Archives to De Gregorio nor the documents released to CBS News under the Freedom of Information Act spoke to her role in the 1994 Naval Academy scandal.",
      "A document\u00a0obtained\u00a0by CBS News \u2014 which is not in the files released by the Archives \u2014 shows that Sherrill's name was omitted from a commencement program on May 25, 1994, the date of the Naval Academy graduation. The program was confirmed to be authentic by the U.S. Naval Academy.",
      "When asked by CBS News why her name does not appear in the commencement program, Sherrill said in a statement: \"When I was an undergraduate at the Naval Academy[,] I didn't turn in some of my classmates, so I didn't walk, but graduated and was commissioned as an officer in the U.S. Navy, serving for nearly ten years with the highest level of distinction and honor.\"",
      "She added: \"That Jack Ciattarelli and the Trump administration are illegally weaponizing my records for political gain is a violation of anyone who has ever served our country. No veteran's record is safe.\"",
      "While Ciattarelli did not respond for comment on the release of her records, he posted on social media about Sherrill not walking at graduation. He called it \"stunning and deeply disturbing\" that she was implicated in the scandal, although Sherrill said she did not walk because she refused to report classmates.",
      "The White House referred the matter to the National Archives.",
      "De Gregorio, a Marine veteran who unsuccessfully ran as a Republican for Congress in New Jersey, told CBS News: \"Given the charged political environment \u2026 Rep. Sherrill will no doubt seek to paint my actions as nefarious and the records as leaked by the Trump Administration to injure her, which as we both know is completely and totally false on both counts.\"",
      "De Gregorio told CBS News that Chris Russell, a Republican consultant in the state, had asked him to see what he could find on Sherrill.",
      "\"He [Russell] asked me if I could help him at all, and my first stop was, let me see what I can find from FOIA, and it was really the first time I'd ever done it,\" said De Gregorio.",
      "In May, De Gregorio, submitted a FOIA request to the NPRC for Sherrill's records. On June 11, De Gregorio received an email from the NPRC saying they had no records for a veteran named \"Sherill.\" The Archives had omitted the second \"r\" from Sherrill's last name.",
      "On June 12, De Gregorio told CBS News he called NPRC's customer service line, which routed him to a \"real, helpful person.\" CBS News has learned that the technician at NPRC accessed a system to retrieve Sherrill's Social Security number. And on June 30, her records were transmitted to De Gregorio, who said he gave the file to Ciattarelli's campaign but was surprised by what he received.",
      "\"When I saw [Sherrill's] Social (Security number), I was shocked,\" said De Gregorio. \"All of a sudden, the NPRC decides to give it to [me] a random guy. I made no bones like, I wasn't her, I wasn't a family member. There was no relationship there. And so I didn't know what to expect. So, I guess I'm a little shocked and kind of disgusted that the social was there.\"",
      "CBS News reviewed De Gregorio's request to the Archives and found it properly acknowledged that personal information and medical details would be redacted. The Archives told CBS News, \"We do not believe that there was any attempt to deceive NPRC staff in this case.\"",
      "De Gregorio later told CBS News that Ciattarelli's campaign did not hire or encourage him to access the files. Scott Levins, the NPRC director, on Monday sent a letter to De Gregorio admitting the Archives' \"serious error\" and said, \"I apologize for our mistake and ask that you please do NOT further disseminate the record that was sent to you in error.\"",
      "Sherrill's campaign was notified of the breach on Monday. In a letter to the congresswoman, NPRC apologized and said it was coordinating with the Navy, which is the legal custodian of the records. The records center also offered identity protection and free credit monitoring services.",
      "House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said Thursday that he supports a \"criminal investigation into the unauthorized and illegal release\" of Sherrill's records.\"It's outrageous that Donald Trump and his administration and political hacks connected to them continue to violate the law,\" Jeffries said. \"And they will be held accountable.\"",
      "Two years ago, Republican Reps. Don Bacon of Nebraska and Zach Nunn of Iowa were among 11 individuals whose records had been impacted by an unauthorized release from the Air Force Personnel Center Military Records Branch to a Democratic-aligned group. Politico reported Abraham Payton, of the research firm Due Diligence Group, had requested the records for the stated purpose of \"Benefits,\" \"Employment,\" and \"Other.\" Due Diligence was paid just over $110,000 by the House Democratic campaign, according to the Federal Election Commission records. The Air Force, in notifying Bacon of the breach, said Payton had requested the records \"inappropriately,\" and a House Judiciary subcommittee launched a probe in March 2023, but it is not clear whether it was completed.",
      "The unauthorized releases outraged Republicans in Congress. House Republicans attempted to stop the Defense Department from releasing summaries of the service records of current or former U.S. military members without the consent of the member, or if deceased, their next of kin, according to NBC News, but did not succeed.",
      "Journalists and veterans who investigate stolen valor claims said at the time the proposed legislation would effectively end independent examinations of individuals exaggerating their service record or violating the Stolen Valor Act of 2013, a federal law that makes it a crime to falsely claim to have received certain military decorations or awards with the intent of gaining a tangible benefit.",
      "Sherrill's political foes have also sought information about whether Sherrill had ever exaggerated her rank after leaving the Navy. Congressional records show she was selected for advancement to lieutenant commander in Sept. 2003. Records obtained through a FOIA request by CBS News and inquiries of the U.S. Naval Academy and Naval Personnel Command show Sherrill left the Navy at the rank of lieutenant in December 2003, before she received the promotion.",
      "CBS News found that in 2020, her campaign sent out political emails that incorrectly used the lieutenant commander rank. Also, former President Joe Biden referred to Sherrill as a \"lieutenant commander\" in his remarks in Oct. 2021 while touting his Build Back Better and infrastructure deal.",
      "But CBS News did not find any instances where Sherrill herself misrepresented her military rank. Anthony Anderson, an Army veteran who is one of the country's most prominent \"stolen valor\" detectives, told CBS News that the rank issue did not rise to the level of her stealing valor either under the Stolen Valor Act of 2013 or how the term is used within the military community.",

      "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has directed numerous generals and admirals, as well as some of their staff, from around the world to come to Quantico, Virginia, next week, U.S. officials confirmed to CBS News on Thursday.",
      "\"The Secretary of War will be addressing his senior military leaders early next week,\" said chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell. President Trump earlier this year signed an executive order renaming the Defense Department as the Department of War and Hegseth as Secretary of War, but the name can only officially be changed by Congress.",
      "The Pentagon has provided no other details about the meeting to either the military leaders or the press.",
      "The news of the meeting was first reported in The Washington Post.",
      "There are regularly scheduled meetings with senior military leaders, but a meeting of this size \u2014 in person and on such short notice \u2014 is rare, if not unprecedented.",
      "Asked Thursday about the planned meeting, Mr. Trump told reporters, \"I love it.\"",
      "\"Let them be friendly with the generals and admirals from all over the world,\" he said. \"Is there something wrong with it?\"",
      "Hegseth earlier this year said the Pentagon plans to cut down the number of generals and flag officers \u2014 that is, those holding the rank of at least rear admiral in the Navy or brigadier general in the Army, Air Force or Marines. The goal, according to a May memo, is to cut 20% of the four-star positions in the active-duty force and 20% of the generals in the National Guard.",
      "During his first few weeks on the job, Hegseth held a town hall at the Pentagon and promised to look into whether every four-star general or admiral is necessary.",
      "\"We won World War II with seven four-star generals,\" Hegseth said in February. \"Today, we have 44. Do all of those directly contribute to warfighting success? Maybe they do, I don't know, but it's worth reviewing to make sure they do.\"",
      "It's not clear whether Hegseth is expected to address reducing the general and admiral positions in this meeting.",
      "Some officials have raised other theories, like whether he will roll out the National Defense Strategy, released every four years, which details the priorities for the department. This year's National Defense Strategy is expected to place a heavier emphasis than previous ones on defending the homeland with operations in U.S. Southern Command, like the recent strikes destroying boats of alleged drug smugglers, and in U.S. Northern Command at the southwest border.",
      "The meeting also comes as Congress remains deadlocked over funding the government, teeing up a potential government shutdown on Oct. 1. If the government shuts down, paychecks for military personnel will be delayed, although they will still be required to report for duty.",

    "story": [
      "The Food and Drug Administration is reviewing the safety of the abortion pill mifepristone, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said in a recent letter to Republican state attorneys general.",
      "Conservatives and anti-abortion groups have criticized the drug, particularly after the Biden administration in 2023 made it possible for women to receive mifepristone via telehealth and by mail. The majority of women who terminate pregnancies do so through medication abortions.",
      "Republican attorneys general had written to Kennedy on the matter in July, and in response, Kennedy said the FDA is taking a look at the drug's Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy. Kennedy in June asked FDA Commissioner Martin Makary to \"review the latest data\" on the drug, an FDA spokesperson confirmed at the time. The spokesperson did not respond to further questions about when the review would start or what specifically it was reviewing about the drug.",
      "In their Sept. 19 letter to the states, Kennedy and Makary wrote, \"HHS \u2014 through the FDA \u2014 is conducting its own review of the evidence, including real-world outcomes and evidence, relating to the safety and efficacy of the drug.\"",
      "\"Recent studies \u2014 such as the study by the Ethics and Public Policy Center (EPPC), which you highlighted in your letter \u2014 indicate potential dangers that may attend offering mifepristone without sufficient medical support or supervision,\" the letter continued. \"FDA's own data collected between 2000 to 2012 indicated 2,740 adverse events, including 416 events involving blood loss requiring transfusions. Since then, safeguards for women regarding the administration of mifepristone have been significantly reduced.\"",
      "According to EPPC, its\u00a0study found nearly 11% of women \"experience sepsis, infection, hemorrhaging, or another serious adverse event within 45 days following a mifepristone abortion,\" but CBS News medical contributor Dr. Celine Gounder told \"CBS Evening News,\" \"Other data sources show the rate of serious complications to be much lower, at less than 1 in 200.\"",
      "The EPPC study cited by Kennedy and lawmakers like Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, is one that says it focuses on \"applying the Judeo-Christian moral tradition\" to public policy.",
      "Asked whether the review could lead to a ban on mifepristone, Gounder suggested it would be difficult for the FDA to withdraw approval, an extraordinary step that would quickly draw legal challenges, but said depending on what the safety review finds, it could make access more difficult, limiting the drug's availability through telehealth or by mail, or restricting the ability to prescribe it to doctors, rather than physician assistants or nurses who are also currently able to prescribe it.",
      "Kennedy and Makary did not say when their review would be completed, but told the states, \"We will keep you informed as the FDA's review of mifepristone progresses.\"",
      "Advocates of access to the abortion pill insist it's safe.",
      "\"More than 100 studies confirm mifepristone's exceptional safety record,\" the American Civil Liberties Union said in a statement in response to the mifepristone safety review. \"Today, medication abortion accounts for nearly two-thirds of abortions in the U.S, and the nation's leading medical associations now stress mifepristone's importance not only for abortion but for miscarriage care as well.\"",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump on Thursday signed an executive order that paves the way for\u00a0a deal\u00a0brokered by his administration to keep TikTok operating in the U.S. under a new corporate structure with American investors.",
      "\"With this executive order, you will be effectively bringing into effect the agreement that will save TikTok and ensure that it can operate safely and securely,\" White House staff secretary Will Scharf said ahead of a signing ceremony in the Oval Office.",
      "The move declares that the deal represents a \"qualified divestiture\" that satisfies a law passed by Congress requiring TikTok's China-based parent company to divest or face a ban and pushes back enforcement of the bipartisan law by 120 days to allow for an agreement on how the app operates in the U.S. to be finalized.",
      "Mr. Trump told reporters that Chinese President Xi Jinping signed off on the deal during their call last week. \"He gave us the go-ahead,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "The TikTok deal",
      "Under the law, TikTok's China-based parent company ByteDance must sever ties with TikTok or lose access to U.S. app stores and web-hosting services. Earlier this month, the president extended the enforcement pause until Dec. 16. The new order extends the pause until Jan. 23, 2026.",
      "According to a senior White House official, under the deal, ByteDance's content recommendation algorithm that powers TikTok will be copied and retrained to run solely on the data of its U.S. user base. Cloud-computing firm Oracle will provide \"top to bottom security\" by hosting Americans' user data and reviewing the app's code to ensure \"the algorithm is behaving appropriately and it's secure,\" the official said.",
      "The deal will establish a \"joint venture\" based in the U.S., with a majority of U.S. investors and owners and a majority of Americans on its board of directors, according to the White House. The executive order says ByteDance and its affiliates will own less than 20% of the new entity, keeping it below the limit on foreign ownership set by the divest-or-ban law.",
      "Vice President JD Vance said at the White House that the new entity would have a valuation of about $14 billion.",
      "A consortium of American investors, including Oracle, will have a stake in the new TikTok, according to the White House. (Oracle was cofounded by Larry Ellison, whose son David Ellison is the chairman and CEO of Paramount Skydance, which is the parent company of CBS. The Ellison family owns a controlling interest in Paramount Skydance.)",
      "The full roster of U.S. investors and their stakes in the company remain unclear, but Vance said Thursday the administration is planning to announce the other investors in the coming days.",
      "\"We feel 100% confident that this proposal, if it's completed, complies with the law,\" the senior White House official said, adding that the White House believes it \"complies with all the relevant laws and policies on both sides.\"",
      "China's comments about what has been agreed to have been more vague.",
      "The law, which was upheld by the Supreme Court, took effect a day before Mr. Trump's inauguration in January. Mr. Trump, however, has issued\u00a0new orders every few months directing the Justice Department not to take action or impose penalties against companies like Apple and Google for failing to remove the widely popular app from their platforms.",
      "CBS News contributor Christopher Krebs, the former director of the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, said there are \"still some questions on how operationally ... it's going to play out and what the user is going to experience on a daily basis.\"",
      "There's been limited pushback from lawmakers, who for years raised concerns about TikTok's potential risks to national security if the Chinese government was able to access the vast amount of Americans' data collected by the app or carry out influence operations through it.",
      "Still, some are likely to see the deal as not going far enough when it comes to TikTok's algorithm. Republican Rep. John Moolenaar of Michigan, the chairman of the House China committee, expressed concern Friday and said he has asked for an \"urgent\" briefing from the Trump administration.",
      "\"Transitioning to a majority American-owned entity would mark an important step in that process that could mitigate some of the ByteDance threat depending on the details, but divestment was not the law's only requirement,\" Moolenaar said in a statement. \"The law also set firm guardrails that prohibit cooperation between ByteDance and any prospective TikTok successor on the all-important recommendation algorithm, as well as preclude operational ties between the new entity and ByteDance.\"",
      "The law says that there cannot be any operational relationship between the new owners and ByteDance, including any cooperation with respect to TikTok's algorithm and data sharing.",
      "Congress, however, left it up to the president to ultimately determine what constitutes a \"qualified divestiture.\" The law gives the president the power to decide, through an interagency process, whether \"the relevant foreign adversary controlled application [is] no longer being controlled by a foreign adversary.\" It defines \"controlled by a foreign adversary\" as a company headquartered in a foreign adversary country and owning at least a 20% stake.",
      "According to the executive order, the joint venture resolves national security concerns because ByteDance will have a minority stake; the joint venture will operate the algorithm and code and make content-moderation decisions; the data of U.S. users will be stored in a cloud environment run by an American company; and the arrangement includes \"intense monitoring\" of software updates, algorithms and data.",
      "\"These safeguards would protect the American people from the misuse of their data and the influence of a foreign adversary, while also allowing the millions of American viewers, creators, and businesses that rely on the TikTok application to continue using it,\" it says.",
      "The interagency process was led by Vance and included consultation with the National Security Council, the Office of Science and Technology Policy, the Treasury Department, the Justice Department, the Commerce Department and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.",
      "\"This process has included, among other things, significant interagency deliberations and consultations, numerous briefings by informed experts and national security officials, and extensive negotiations with outside parties,\" the executive order says.",
      "The senior White House official said the administration plans to engage \"vigorously\" with lawmakers \"to show them what a great deal this is\" for Americans while also making the app \"safe and secure.\"",
      "During the legal battle over the law, TikTok's lawyers said the app \"would be a fundamentally different platform\" if it was forced to cut ties with ByteDance because the new owner would have to rebuild the algorithm, which would take years. TikTok said the inability to share any data with ByteDance would mean that the app's 170 million American users would not be able to see videos shared by users from around the world and vice versa.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Monday that global content will still be accessible for American users.",
      "For that to happen, the U.S. algorithm would have to interact with the original algorithm that feeds the rest of the world content, according to Ari Lightman, a professor of digital media and marketing at Carnegie Mellon University.",

      "Inflation has come down since rising prices prompted the Fed to raise its benchmark interest rate 11 times in 2022 and 2023. But annual price gains have remained stubbornly above the central bank's 2% target. The Consumer Price Index (CPI), another key measure of inflation that tracks the change in prices on everyday items, also ticked higher last month.",

Two-thirds of the 2,344 U.S. adults polled said prices are still going up, with the same amount saying they expect prices to keep escalating in the coming months.",
      "Last week, the Fed went ahead and reduced the rate for the first time this year, lowering borrowing costs to help a deteriorating U.S. job market. But it's been cautious about cutting, waiting to see what impact President Donald Trump's sweeping taxes on imports have on inflation and the broader economy.",
      "For months, Trump has relentlessly pushed the Fed to lower rates more aggressively, calling Fed Chair Jerome Powell \"Too Late\" and a \"moron\" and arguing that there is \"no inflation.\"",

      "The Fed tends to favor the PCE inflation gauge that the government issued Friday over the better-known consumer price index.

      "The findings, published Thursday, are based on a reconstruction of a crushed skull discovered in China in 1990 and have the potential to resolve the long-standing \"Muddle in the Middle\" of human evolution, researchers said.",
      "But experts not involved in the work cautioned that the findings were likely to be disputed and pointed to ongoing uncertainties in the timeline of human evolution.",
      "The skull, labelled Yunxian 2, was previously thought to belong to a human forerunner called Homo erectus.",
      "But modern reconstruction technologies revealed features closer to a species previously thought to have existed only later in human evolution, including the recently discovered Homo longi and our own Homo sapiens.",
      "\"This changes a lot of thinking,\" said Chris Stringer, an anthropologist at the Natural History Museum, London, who was part of the research team.",
      "\"It suggests that by 1 million years ago, our ancestors had already split into distinct groups, pointing to a much earlier and more complex human evolutionary split than previously believed,\" he added.",
      "The findings shocked the research team.",
      "\"From the very beginning, when we got the result, we thought it was unbelievable. How could that be so deep into the past?\" Xijun Ni, a professor at Fudan University who co-led the analysis, told BBC News. \"But we tested it again and again to test all the models, use all the methods, and we are now confident about the result, and we're actually very excited.\"",

      "The scientists relied in part on another similar skull to shape their model, and then compared it to over 100 other specimens.",
      "The resulting model \"shows a distinctive combination of traits,\" the researchers said, some of them similar to Homo erectus, including a projecting lower face.",
      "But other aspects, including its apparently larger brain capacity, are closer to Homo longi and Homo sapiens, according to the study.",
      "\"Yunxian 2 may help us resolve what's been called the 'Muddle in the Middle,' the confusing array of human fossils from between 1 million and 300,000 years ago,\" Stringer said in a press release.",

      "\"It's sound, but I think the jury's still out. I think there will be a lot of questions raised,\" he said.",
      "Andy Herries, an archeologist at La Trobe University, said he was not convinced by the conclusions and that genetic analysis had shown fossil morphology, or shape, was \"not always a perfect indicator for human evolution.\"",

      "\"That picture is still quite unclear to us, so if the conclusions of this research are supported by other analyses, ideally from some genetic data, then I think we would start to be increasingly confident about it,\" he told BBC News.",

      "There were roughly 40,000 animals per square meter \u2014 mostly marine worms \u2014 living on the munitions,\u00a0the scientists wrote\u00a0in the journal Communications Earth & Environment.",

      "The researchers were baffled to see that more than 40 starfishes had piled on to an exposed chunk of TNT.",
      "\"It looked really weird,\" said Vedenin, a scientist at Germany's Carl von Ossietzky University and the study's lead author.",
      "Exactly why the starfishes were there was unclear, but Vedenin theorized they could be eating bacterial film collecting on the corroding TNT.",

      "To find out what kind of bombs they were dealing with, he went online and found a manual from the Nazi air force Luftwaffe describing how to handle and store V-1 flying bombs. The cruise missile exactly matched the 10 bombs from the footage.",
      "Vedenin said \"there is some irony\" in the discovery that these \"things that are meant to kill everything are now attracting so much life.\"",

      "Animals once flocked to huge boulders that littered the Baltic Sea, however humans removed the stones to build infrastructure such as roads at the start of the 20th century.",

      "Scientists have discovered a new dinosaur from Argentina with powerful claws, feasting on an ancient crocodile bone.",
      "The new find was possibly 23 feet long and hailed from a mysterious group of dinosaurs called megaraptorans. They prowled across what's now South America, Australia and parts of Asia, splitting off into different species over millions of years.",
      "Megaraptorans were known for their stretched-out skulls and \"huge and very powerful claws,\" said Lucio Ibiricu with the Patagonian Institute of Geology and Paleontology, who was part of the discovery team.",
      "But it's not yet clear how these creatures hunted and where they fall on the evolutionary timeline \u2014 mainly because the fossils recovered so far were incomplete.",
      "\"Megaraptorans are among the least understood dinosaurs of all,\" Ibiricu told the Reuters news agency.",
      "In a new study, researchers said they uncovered part of a skull as well as arm, leg and tail bones from the Lago Colhu\u00e9 Huapi rock formation in Patagonia. They noticed unique features in the bones that made them realize this could be a new species.",
      "This latest member of the megaraptoran clan named Joaquinraptor casali \"fills a major gap by providing one of the most complete skeletons yet,\" Federico Agnolin with the Argentine Museum of Natural Science Bernardino Rivadavia said in an email. Agnolin was not involved with the research, which was published Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications.",
      "The creature likely lived between 66 and 70 million years ago \u2014 close to the time dinosaurs went extinct \u2014 and was at least 19 years old when it died, though scientists don't know what killed it.",
      "The front leg bone pressed against its jaws \u2014 belonging to an ancient relative of crocodiles \u2014 could yield some clues to its diet and whether it was the top predator on the humid prehistoric flood plains.",
      "Study co-author Matt Lamanna told Reuters that unlike the T. rex, which had massive teeth and small arms, the Joaquinraptor likely used its long arms to capture prey.",
      "\"This suggests that these two predatory dinosaur lineages evolved different adaptations to accomplish basically the same thing - that is, to capture, subdue, kill and eat other animals such as other dinosaurs,\" Lamanna told Reuters. \"Precisely why these groups evolved along these different evolutionary pathways remains a mystery, but it shows that, during the Cretaceous, there was more than one way to be a top predator.\"",
      "Ibiricu named the new dinosaur in memory of his son Joaquin. While Joaquin was very young and hadn't yet developed a fascination with dinosaurs, Ibiricu still thinks he would have appreciated being named after one.",
      "\"All children love dinosaurs so he would probably be a fan too,\" he said.",
      "The discovery comes just a few months after\u00a0 scientists identified the Khankhuuluu mongoliensis, a new T. rex ancestor that researchers called the \"missing link\" between apex predators.",

      "One source told The Guardian that during the planning of an airstrike on an individual in a densely populated area of Gaza, officers would use the system to examine calls made by other people in the immediate vicinity.",
      "Other sources told The Guardian that use of the data was initially focused on the West Bank, which Israel's military controls.",
      "\"When they need to arrest someone and there isn't a good enough reason to do so, that's where they find the excuse,\" one source told the British newspaper.",
      "The Guardian reported that leaked Microsoft files suggested a large proportion of the sensitive data was potentially being stored in Microsoft data centers in Ireland and the Netherlands.",
      "After the publication of its report, several sources told the newspaper that the repository of intercepted calls \u2014 as much as 8,000 terabytes of data \u2014 had been held in a Microsoft data center in the Netherlands, but within days of its report being published in early August, the data appeared to have been moved out of the country.",
      "\"We have found evidence that supports elements of The Guardian's reporting. This evidence includes information relating to IMOD consumption of Azure storage capacity in the Netherlands and the use of AI services,\" Microsoft said in a statement Thursday, without elaborating on what the evidence showed.",
      "Microsoft said it had informed the Israeli Ministry of Defense that it would be halting and disabling its use of some specific subscriptions and services.",
      "\"We have reviewed this decision with IMOD and the steps we are taking to ensure compliance with our terms of service, focused on ensuring our services are not used for mass surveillance of civilians,\" Microsoft said.",

    "summary": "YouTube will offer creators a way to rejoin the streaming platform if they were banned for violating COVID-19 and election misinformation policies that are no longer in effect.",
    "story": [
      "YouTube creators whose accounts were banned for violating previous policies against COVID-19 and election misinformation will be given the chance to rejoin the platform, said Alphabet, YouTube's parent company, on Tuesday.",
      "In a letter submitted in response to subpoenas from the House Judiciary Committee, attorneys for Alphabet said the decision to bring back banned accounts reflected the company's commitment to free speech.",
      "\"No matter the political atmosphere, YouTube will continue to enable free expression on its platform, particularly as it relates to issues subject to political debate,\" the letter read, noting that a number of accounts were kicked off the platform between 2023 and 2024 for violating misinformation rules that don't exist anymore. Now, it said, \"YouTube will provide an opportunity for all creators to rejoin the platform if the Company terminated their channels for repeated violations of COVID-19 and elections integrity policies that are no longer in effect.\"",
      "The company in its letter also said it \"values conservative voices on its platform and recognizes that these creators have extensive reach and play an important role in civic discourse\" and added that YouTube \"recognizes these creators are among those shaping today's online consumption, landing 'must-watch' interviews, giving viewers the chance to hear directly from politicians, celebrities, business leaders, and more.\"",
      "The move is the latest in a cascade of content moderation rollbacks from tech companies, who cracked down on false information during the pandemic and after the 2020 election but have since faced pressure from President Trump and other conservatives who argue they unlawfully stifled right-wing voices in the process.",
      "It comes as tech CEOs, including Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai, have sought a closer relationship with the Republican president, including through high-dollar donations to his campaign and attending events in Washington.",
      "YouTube in 2023 phased out its policy to remove content that falsely claims the 2020 election, or other past U.S. presidential elections, were marred by \"widespread fraud, errors or glitches.\" Claims of fraud in the 2020 election have been debunked.",
      "The platform in 2024 also retired its standalone COVID-19 content restrictions, allowing various treatments for the disease to be discussed. COVID-19 misinformation now falls under YouTube's broader medical misinformation policy.",
      "Among the creators who have been banned from YouTube under the now-expired policies are prominent conservative influencers, including Dan Bongino, who now serves as deputy director of the FBI. For people who make money on social media, access to monetization on YouTube can be significant, earning them large sums through ad revenue.",
      "House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan and other congressional Republicans have pressured tech companies to reverse content moderation policies created under former President Joe Biden and accused Biden's administration of unfairly wielding its power over the companies to chill lawful online speech.",
      "In Tuesday's letter, Alphabet's lawyers said senior Biden administration officials \"conducted repeated and sustained outreach\" to coerce the company to remove pandemic-related YouTube videos that did not violate company policies.",
      "\"It is unacceptable and wrong when any government, including the Biden Administration, attempts to dictate how the Company moderates content, and the Company has consistently fought against those efforts on First Amendment grounds,\" the letter said.",
      "Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has also accused the Biden administration of pressuring employees to inappropriately censor content during the COVID-19 pandemic. Elon Musk, the owner of the social platform X, has accused the FBI of illegally coercing Twitter before his tenure to suppress a story about Hunter Biden.",
      "The Supreme Court last year sided with the Biden administration in a dispute with Republican-led states over how far the federal government can go to combat controversial social media posts on topics including COVID-19 and election security.",

      "In the largest seizure of its kind, the U.S. Secret Service announced Tuesday that the agency found active SIM farms at abandoned apartment buildings located at more than five sites. In total, law enforcement discovered 300 SIM servers \u2013 over 100,000 SIM cards \u2013 enabling encrypted, anonymous communication and capable of sending 30 million text messages per minute. Officials say the servers were so powerful they could have disabled cell phone towers and launched distributed denial of services attacks with the ability to block emergency communications like EMS and police dispatch.",
      "\"This network had the potential to disable cell phone towers and essentially shut down the cellular network in New York City,\" U.S. Secret Service Special Agent in Charge Matt McCool said in a video released by the agency.",
      "An official briefed on the investigation told reporters that this week, the sophisticated network \"could text message the entire country within 12 minutes,\" later adding, \"This was well organized and well funded.\"",
      "Telephonic threats to multiple senior U.S. officials this past spring \u2013 including multiple people protected by the Secret Service \u2013 first triggered the investigation, but officials say the network was seized within the last three weeks.",
      "\"We cannot share which officials were targeted out of concerns for their privacy, but as the forensics investigation continues, we do expect that we will find more targeted officials once we get through that data,\" McCool said.",
      "Early analysis shows the network was used for communication between foreign governments and individuals known to U.S. law enforcement, including members of known organized crime gangs, drug cartels and human trafficking rings, according to multiple officials briefed on the investigation. The U.S. Secret Service says it is combing through the more than 100,000 SIM cards in an ongoing, exhaustive forensic analysis.",
      "\"Each SIM basically has the equivalent data of a cell phone. So we're working through every call, every text, every search made on those SIM cards,\" an official told CBS News, adding, \"Early analysis indicates that this network was used for communication between foreign governments and individuals that are known to federal law enforcement here in the U.S.\"",
      "The equipment was found within 35 miles of the United Nations in New York, ahead of the U.N. General Assembly. Investigators also found 80 grams of cocaine, illegal firearms, plus computers and phones.",
      "\"This isn't a group of people in a basement playing a video game and trying to play a prank,\" one official said. \"This was well organized and well funded.\"",
      "\"The timing, the location, the proximity of this network had the potential to impact the U.N. and that was clear and something that we had to consider,\" added McCool.",
      "The investigation was launched by a new division within the U.S. Secret Service established by Director Sean Curran and dubbed the \"Advanced Threat Interdiction Unit,\" in conjunction with Homeland Security Investigations.",
      "\"These devices no longer pose any threat to New York,\" an official said. \"We've taken care of and dismantled that threat\u2026There is currently no credible threat against the UN.\"",
      "Still, another official added that \"it would be unwise to assume\" there aren't other such networks in the U.S.",
      "The investigation remains ongoing, according to the U.S. Secret Service. There have been no arrests yet, but officials said, \"there could be arrests down the road,\" adding that \"from an operational perspective, we want those behind the network to know that the Secret Service is aware and that we're kind of coming for them.\"",

    "story": [
      "Robot umpires are getting called up to the big leagues next season.",
      "Major League Baseball's 11-man competition committee on Tuesday approved use of the Automated Ball/Strike System in the major leagues in 2026.",
      "Human plate umpires will still call balls and strikes, but teams can challenge two calls per game and get additional appeals in extra innings. Challenges must be made by a pitcher, catcher or batter \u2014 signaled by tapping their helmet or cap \u2014 and a team retains its challenge if successful. Reviews will be shown as digital graphics on outfield videoboards.",
      "Adding the robot umps is likely to cut down on ejections. MLB said 61.5% of ejections among players, managers and coaches last year were related to balls and strikes, as were 60.3% this season through Sunday. The figures include ejections for derogatory comments, throwing equipment while protesting calls and inappropriate conduct.",
      "Big league umpires call roughly 94% of pitches correctly, according to UmpScorecards.",
      "The Automated Ball-Strike Challenge System, powered by T-Mobile, is coming to MLB's Regular Season \u26be\ufe0f https://t.co/97raRHFtsT pic.twitter.com/SHxKuRTKu8",
      "ABS, which utilizes Hawk-Eye cameras, has been tested in the minor leagues since 2019. The independent Atlantic League trialed the system at its 2019 All-Star Game and MLB installed the technology for that year's Arizona Fall League of top prospects. The ABS was tried at eight of nine ballparks of the Low-A Southeast League in 2021, then moved up to Triple-A in 2022.",
      "In 2019, Fred DeJesus became the first umpire in a regular-season game to use ABS. He remembers the first pitch he tested \u2013 it was a strike \u2013 and how he was hesitant about the new technology at first.",
      "\"Initially, it was like, no way, we're not doing this. I spent way too much money trying to learn the craft of calling balls and strikes,\" he told CBS News in 2021.",
      "At Triple-A at the start of the 2023 season, half the games used the robots for ball/strike calls and half had a human making decisions subject to appeals by teams to the ABS.",
      "MLB switched Triple-A to an all-challenge system on June 26, 2024, then used the challenge system this year at 13 spring training ballparks hosting 19 teams for a total of 288 exhibition games. Teams won 52.2% of their ball/strike challenges (617 of 1,182) challenges.",
      "At Triple-A this season, the average challenges per game increased to 4.2 from 3.9 through Sunday and the success rate dropped to 49.5% from 50.6%. Defenses were successful in 53.7% of challenges this year and offenses in 45%.",
      "ABS was used in this year's All-Star Game as well and has generally received positive reviews, CBS Sports reported. Four of five challenges of plate umpire Dan Iassogna's calls were successful in July.",
      "Teams in Triple-A do not get additional challenges in extra innings. However, the proposal approved by the MLB on Tuesday included a provision granting teams one additional challenge each inning if they don't have challenges remaining.",
      "MLB has experimented with different shapes and interpretations of the strike zone with ABS, including versions that were three-dimensional. Currently, it calls strikes solely based on where the ball crosses the midpoint of the plate, 8.5 inches from the front and the back. The top of the strike zone is 53.5% of batter height and the bottom 27%.",
      "This will be MLB's first major rule change since sweeping adjustments in 2024. Those included a pitch clock, restrictions on defensive shifts, pitcher disengagements such as pickoff attempts and larger bases.",
      "The challenge system introduces ABS without eliminating pitch framing, a subtle art where catchers use their body and glove to try making borderline pitches look like strikes. Framing has become a critical skill for big league catchers. While there was concern that full-blown ABS would make some strong defensive catchers obsolete, not everyone considers the skill a good thing.",
      "\"The idea that people get paid for cheating, for stealing strikes, for moving a pitch that's not a strike into the zone to fool the official and make it a strike is beyond my comprehension,\" former manager Bobby Valentine said.",
      "Texas manager Bruce Bochy, a big league catcher from 1978-87, maintained old-school umpires such as Bruce Froemming and Billy Williams never would have accepted pitch framing. He said they would have told him: \"'If you do that again, you'll never get a strike.' I'm cutting out some words.\"",

    "summary": "TikTok's algorithm is the \"secret sauce\" behind the app's success, experts say. U.S.-China talks over the app's ownership must resolve who controls the technology.",
    "story": [
      "A deal between the U.S. and China over the ownership of TikTok includes new stipulations over who controls the social media company's algorithm, a closely guarded secret which has proved to be a major sticking point in negotiations between the countries.",
      "The Chinese government once vowed to block the sale of TikTok's algorithm, the technology that seems to intuit user preferences almost instantaneously and that has been a driving force for the video-sharing app's explosive growth in recent years.",
      "Previously, TikTok had also seemed unwilling to budge. In May, when the platform was challenging a 2024 law banning TikTok in the U.S., the company said in a legal filing that \"divesting TikTok Inc.'s U.S. business and completely severing it from the globally integrated platform of which it is a part is not commercially, technologically, or legally feasible.\"",
      "President Trump this week\u00a0again pushed back enforcement of the TikTok law, which would require its parent company, Beijing-based ByteDance, to sell its stake in the app or be cut off from the U.S. market.",
      "In the meantime, a senior White House official said Monday that the U.S. and China had reached agreement on the basic details of the app's ownership. The new structure will move TikTok's U.S. operations under a \"joint venture\" based in the U.S. that will control the algorithm and oversee security, the official said.",
      "ByteDance and TikTok did not respond to requests for comment.",
      "Who will control the TikTok algorithm?",
      "According to the White House official, the new arrangement will operate and control a copy of the algorithm. Software maker Oracle will \"provide sort of top to bottom security\" throughout the company, the official said, noting that will involve monitoring the technology as well as managing how American data is stored.",
      "\"It's going to be continuously monitored as it operates to ensure that it's behaving appropriately, that it's not being used for any kind of malicious purpose, and that it's not being unduly influenced,\" the White House official said.",
      "Oracle's chairman and chief technology officer is Larry Ellison, whose son, David Ellison, is the chairman and CEO of Paramount Skydance, which is the parent company of CBS. The Ellison family owns a controlling interest in Paramount Skydance.",
      "Mr. Trump, asked last week about what will happen with TikTok's algorithm, said, \"TikTok has tremendous value. The United States has that value in its hand since we're the ones that have to approve it.\"",
      "Chinese law\u00a0prohibits the export of TikTok's proprietary algorithm, including to the U.S., without government approval, according to experts. Last week, Wang Jingtao, deputy director of China's Central Cyberspace Affairs Commission, last week told reporters in Madrid that the arrangement included agreement over \"the use of intellectual property rights,\" according the Associated Press.",
      "Asked about this structure last week, Sarah Kreps, a nonresident senior fellow at the Brookings Institute, a nonpartisan policy research organization, told CBS MoneyWatch that as she understands it, ByteDance would give a U.S. entity legal permission to use the algorithm under certain terms.",
      "\"So it would be like they're renting the algorithm rather than selling it,\" she said.",
      "What makes TikTok's algorithm special?",
      "Algorithms are complex data systems that act as recommendation engines, ranking the content users ultimately see in their feeds. They also help companies gather information about their customers in order to serve them targeted advertisements, a key source of revenue.",
      "Like other social media players, TikTok's algorithm delivers content to users based on their interests and interactions on the platform. Lauryn Williams, a deputy director and senior fellow focused on technology at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, described the algorithm as TikTok's \"secret sauce.\"",
      "Kreps highlights the algorithm's ability to quickly pick up on user behavior, interests and preferences. \"There's something about it that is so well-tailored to what they understand people to want that it gets them on the platform and keeps them there in ways that don't seem to be the case with other platforms,\" she said.",
      "In its own explanation of how it recommends videos, TikTok says it considers a range of factors, such as how long someone stays on a video and personal user information, such as someone's language preference or country of origin. The algorithm then \"selects from a large collection of eligible content and ranks them based on the system's prediction of how likely you'll be interested in each one.\"",
      "A Supreme Court ruling\u00a0from January\u00a0upholding the TikTok ban\u00a0notes\u00a0that each interaction a user has on TikTok \u2014 whether watching a video, following an account or leaving a comment \u2014 enables the recommendation system to \"further tailor a personalized content feed.\"",
      "National security concerns",
      "In Madrid, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said last week that \"we want to ensure that the Chinese have a fair, invested environment in the United States, but always that U.S. national security comes first,\"\u00a0according\u00a0to CNN.",
      "But while a deal between the U.S. and China could address the ownership dispute, it might not resolve all of the national security concerns that led Congress to pass the TikTok ban with bipartisan support in April of 2024, experts told CBS MoneyWatch before details of the new structure were announced.",
      "To minimize any national security concerns, William Akoto, an assistant professor at American University, said the new arrangement has to ensure that the app's China-based engineers are unable to access the U.S. version of Tiktok. If the algorithm sends user data back to China or if the algorithm can be updated outside of the U.S, that could leave American users' data vulnerable, he said.",
      "The Justice Department last year accused TikTok of collecting sensitive data about U.S. users, warning that the Chinese government could use the information to manipulate the content that people see. It also said TikTok employees were able to communicate directly with ByteDance engineers in China via an internal messaging system called Lark.",
      "In 2022, TikTok acknowledged in a letter to U.S. senators that China-based employees could have access to American users' data in certain circumstances and said it was taking steps to strengthen data security.",
      "In its\u00a0decision to uphold the TikTok ban in January, the Supreme Court also noted that China can require TikTok's parent company \"to cooperate with [its] efforts to obtain personal data,\" and that \"there is little to stop all that information from ending up in the hands of a designated foreign adversary.\"",

      "\"The glasses make my life easier,\" said the 27 year old. \"They make things faster and they make me able to do more in the day because it's just quicker and easier to do things and I feel less tired at the end of the day.\"",
      "Meta originally designed the glasses for users to stream video on the go and interact with the world around them using AI. The newest iteration of the technology was unveiled last week and includes the Meta Ray-Ban Display glasses, the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 glasses\u00a0and a new model of smart Oakley glasses aimed at sports enthusiasts.",
      "Members of the blind community have found new ways to use the technology.",
      "Users are able to connect their glasses to the \"Be My Eyes\" app which connects blind and visually impaired users with volunteers to assist with recognizing objects and managing everyday tasks in real time. Such activities may include going through mail, or helping individuals grocery shop.",
      "The new AI glasses also use optical character recognition, or OCR, which can recognize and read aloud text for users on menus, receipts and mail. For Lakrout, having access to text-based information like signs in a subway station or on street corners is what makes AI technology useful. She says Meta's AI glasses are bringing blind communities one step closer to accessing this information.",
      "The glasses, however, are work in progress says Mark Riccobono, president of the National Federation of the Blind.",
      "\"(They) work well for some things, doesn't work well in other situations,\" he said.",
      "Lakrout discovered this for herself. When she tried the glasses on in a restaurant, they read the menu to her perfectly but couldn't tell her the price for a specific item on second prompt. When using some of the AI-powered features, the glasses' battery died, and so she regularly had to keep them in their case to charge.",
      "More importantly, Riccobono said, is that Meta has \"taken an interest in working with blind people to make the technology better, make it more accurate, make it more meaningful to the experience of blind people.\"",
      "Lakrout and Riccobono both agree that AI technology and Meta's glasses are a useful step in enhancing the blind and visually impaired community's independence. But in the end, the glasses do not \"replace the need for human capacity,\" Riccobo said. \"So we need to teach blind people and we still need to make sure that blind people develop the skills that blind people need to be successful.\"",

    "summary": "A federal grand jury indicted former FBI Director James Comey on two criminal counts. Comey has said he is innocent.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The indictment of former FBI Director James Comey on Thursday marked the culmination of President Trump's yearslong desire to see one of his political foes punished after the bureau's investigation into his 2016 presidential campaign and Russian meddling in that election.",
      "But the president's long-held ire toward Comey, coupled with his latest comments cheering the federal charges brought against the former FBI chief, could aid defense lawyers in a potential bid to have the case against Comey tossed.",
      "\"In this case, the facts before the indictment and even comments Trump made after the indictment provide strong factual evidence that Mr. Comey is the victim of either selective or vindictive prosecution,\" Gene Rossi, a former federal prosecutor who worked at the Justice Department for nearly 30 years, told CBS News.",
      "A federal grand jury returned an indictment against Comey charging him with two counts: making false statements to Congress and obstructing a congressional proceeding. It declined to indict him on an additional count of lying to Congress, a rare rejection of a proposed charge.",
      "The charges stem from Comey's September 2020 testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, during which he denied authorizing anyone at the FBI to be an anonymous source in news reports.",
      "Whether to seek an indictment had been met with pushback from career prosecutors in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Virginia, which is prosecuting the case. Staff in the office had circulated a \"declination\" memo explaining why criminal charges should not be filed against Comey, a Justice Department source told CBS News.",
      "But days before Comey was charged, and after the abrupt departure of Erik Siebert as the top prosecutor in the Virginia office, Mr. Trump installed a White House aide and his former personal defense lawyer Lindsey Halligan as Siebert's replacement.",
      "Halligan has no prosecutorial experience. Only she signed Comey's indictment, and Halligan remains the only attorney listed as representing the U.S.",
      "Comey denied any wrongdoing, and said in a video shared to social media, \"I'm innocent, so let's have a trial and keep the faith.\" His lawyer, Patrick Fitzgerald, said Comey will be vindicated in court.",
      "Legal experts expect Fitzgerald will seek to have the case dismissed on numerous grounds, including selective prosecution, which is when the prosecutor appears motivated by discriminatory intent, and vindictive prosecution, when the government acts out of \"genuine\" animus or seeks to punish a defendant for exercising a legal right.",
      "Carissa Byrne Hessick, a law professor at the University of North Carolina School of Law, said claims of selective or vindictive prosecution are difficult to prevail on, and it's tough to predict whether Comey will succeed in convincing a judge to dismiss his charges on those grounds.",
      "Courts are generally hostile to those claims \u2014 the legal standard is high for proving them and judges are concerned about opening the floodgates to these types of motions, Hessick said. But on the other hand, Comey's case may look different than others given the events leading up to his indictment, namely the appointment of Halligan and reports of internal disagreement over seeking charges, she said.",
      "\"The mixture of those two things \u2014 the fact that these sorts of cases are very hard to win, but also the unusual circumstances and the availability of evidence \u2014 I think makes it too difficult to predict what a court will do here,\" Hessick said.",
      "Mr. Trump has for years railed against Comey publicly, claiming he should be prosecuted for \"treason\" and calling him \"corrupt,\" \"stupid\" and a \"dirty cop,\" among other insults. In a social media post Saturday, the president made a direct appeal to Attorney General Pam Bondi for action against Comey and two other political opponents: New York Attorney General Letitia James and Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff of California.",
      "Mr. Trump wrote the three are \"guilty as hell\" and said, \"We can't delay any longer, it's killing our reputation and credibility. They impeached me twice, and indicted me (5 times!), OVER NOTHING. JUSTICE MUST BE SERVED, NOW!!!\"",
      "The president then cheered Comey's indictment Thursday night.",
      "\"One of the worst human beings this Country has ever been exposed to is James Comey, the former Corrupt Head of the FBI,\" Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social. \"Today he was indicted by a Grand Jury on two felony counts for various illegal and unlawful acts. He has been so bad for our Country, for so long, and is now at the beginning of being held responsible for his crimes against our Nation. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\"",
      "The attacks on Comey continued Friday, with Mr. Trump calling him a \"destroyer of lives\" who must pay a \"very big price\" for lying.",
      "\"Whether you like Corrupt James Comey or not, and I can't imagine too many people liking him, HE LIED!\" Mr. Trump wrote. \"It is not a complex lie, it's a very simple, but IMPORTANT one. There is no way he can explain his way out of it. He is a Dirty Cop, and always has been.\"",
      "Rossi said the years of comments made by Mr. Trump from the spring of 2017 \u2014 when the president fired Comey during his first term \u2014 to now, could bolster Comey's bid to have the charges dismissed.",
      "\"Whether vindictive or selective, this animus, the hatred, the prejudice toward who is charged, those emotions and factors become highly relevant,\" he said.",
      "But it's not just comments from Mr. Trump that could come into play. Bondi and FBI Director Kash Patel also cheered the charges against Comey, with Patel claiming Comey and other top FBI officials weaponized federal law enforcement when they led the bureau.",
      "\"They are putting their thumb on the scale of justice instead of letting Lady Justice handle this matter blindly,\" Rossi said. \"That violates every norm \u2014 every norm \u2014 that a federal prosecutor is taught from the time they're born as baby prosecutors.\"",
      "He said the grand jury's rejection of the third count, lying to Congress, is \"another brick in the wall\" in support of Comey moving to dismiss the charges because of vindictive and selective prosecution, as is the opposition to pursuing an indictment by career prosecutors in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Virginia. Under Justice Department policy, prosecutors may pursue indictments only if they believe they can secure a conviction and that conviction will be sustained on appeal.",
      "\"That seasoned and career prosecutors, plus the former U.S. attorney for the EDVA, all said that this indictment doesn't have a legal and factual basis to present to the grand jury, and that [Halligan] was appointed three days before this charge was approved by the grand jury is all ample evidence that something is rotten in Denmark,\" Rossi said.",
      "Comey's case is unique compared to others where claims of selective or vindictive prosecution are raised for numerous reasons, Hessick said: It involves people who are newsworthy; there are media reports about the decision to bring charges; Mr. Trump has publicly spoken about action against Comey; and the charges against him appear to involve congressional testimony about investigations into Mr. Trump or Clinton.",
      "\"The case is also notable because this isn't just a question of the motives of the specific prosecutor who brought the charges,\" she said. \"It's also about the president's decisions to speak publicly about a case that's a high-profile political case.\"",
      "Hessick said that in previous administrations, presidents are often \u2014 but not always \u2014 careful not to comment about ongoing cases.",
      "Mr. Trump sought to have criminal charges brought against him by former special counsel Jack Smith in each of the two cases dismissed for vindictive and selective prosecution, but one of the requests was denied. The two cases, one involving the 2020 election and the other involving Mr. Trump's handling of sensitive government documents after his first term, were dismissed after he won a second term in the White House.",
      "Hunter Biden, former President Joe Biden's son, also unsuccessfully sought to have his indictment on tax charges dismissed on the same grounds, arguing the investigation into him was \"compromised by politics.\"",
      "Hunter Biden pleaded guilty to the charges last year.",

    "published": "Sat, 27 Sep 2025 07:21:51 -0400",
    "summary": "Humberto became a hurricane on Friday over the central Atlantic, the National Hurricane Center said.",
    "story": [
      "Humberto, the eighth named storm to emerge this hurricane season, is currently swirling over waters just north of the Caribbean as a major hurricane. While forecasts as of Saturday predict Humberto won't ever touch land, there is a possibility it could interact with another system developing nearby in the western Atlantic.",
      "That's an unlikely outcome, said CBS News meteorologist Nikki Nolan. But if such a collision does occur, it could produce what's called\u00a0the Fujiwhara effect, a rare phenomenon in which two different storms merge and become entangled around a newly formed, common center.",
      "How the process plays out depends on the characteristics of the storms involved, according to the National Weather Service. The forecasting agency describes the Fujiwhara effect on its website as \"an intense dance\" between two tropical storms that can happen when they get close enough to each other on their respective tracks to reach a common point and either join together or spin around each other for a period of time before continuing along their individual paths.",
      "In the latter scenario, the storms involved must be comparably strong or large.",
      "\"Typically when one system is stronger than the other, the smaller and weaker system will get overrun by the larger, stronger one and completely eliminate it,\" Nolan said.",
      "Similar systems \"will dance around each other\" before going their separate ways, she continued, adding: \"Very rarely has a larger system absorbed a smaller one and become larger or stronger, but it is scientifically possible.\"",
      "\"With the two tropical troubles currently north of the Caribbean, these two may interact under the Fujiwhara effect in the days ahead,\" said Nolan. However, because the developing system \"appears to be much weaker than Humberto and several miles away from it,\" an interaction between the two \u2014 if one even takes place at all \u2014 may not result in a tangled gravitational \"dance.\"",
      "Humberto grew into a tropical storm Wednesday night while traveling over open waters in the central tropical Atlantic, and then gained hurricane status early Friday morning. Humberto was a\u00a0Category 4\u00a0storm as of early Saturday morning.",
      "Forecasters expect it to move northwest over the next few days and strengthen along the way, the National Hurricane Center said. It's one of two systems in the region that could potentially impact parts of the southeastern United States, including coastal areas from Florida to North Carolina, according to Michael Brennan, director of the hurricane center.",
      "Officials at the center said Wednesday that they were monitoring a second storm churning near Humberto over the northeastern Caribbean, which would likely become a tropical depression later in the week and a tropical storm, named Imelda, over the weekend. That system is expected to strengthen as it tracks toward the Bahamas \u2014 driving up the chances of storm surge, wind and rainfall striking coastal parts of the southeastern U.S.",
      "South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster declared a state of emergency regarding potential impacts from the storm system on Friday. McMaster said the state's residents should monitor the forecast.",
      "\"While the storm's arrival, speed, and intensity remain hard to predict, we do know that it will bring significant wind, heavy rainfall, and flooding across the entire state of South Carolina,\" McMaster said. \"We have seen this before. Now is the time to start paying attention to forecasts, updates, and alerts from official sources and begin making preparations.\"",
      "In the event Humberto and the second system do collide, it's possible the paths they're expected to travel will change, Nolan added, but only slightly.",

      "The judge said there are \"genuine fact disputes\" as to whether Lindell's statements were made \"with knowledge that they were false or made with reckless disregard to their falsity.\" He noted that the defense says Lindell has an \"unwavering belief\" that his statements were truthful.",
      "The statements cited by the judge arose from Lindell's criticism of the results of the 2020 election in California's Los Angeles County, which former President Joe Biden carried with 71% of the vote over Mr. Trump and helped Biden secure the state's 55 electoral votes.",
      "The county used Smartmatic's computerized touchscreen ballot-marking devices and was the company's only customer for the 2020 election. Lindell alleged the machines were rigged to change Trump votes to Biden votes.",

      "Lindell went on to call Smartmatic \"one of the most corrupt companies in the world,\" and he vowed to keep fighting until its voting machines are \"melted down and turned into prison bars.\" He said he'll take his crusade to eliminate voting machines in favor of paper ballots all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court if he has to.",

      "In an announcement Thursday, the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) issued a public health alert for Marketside Linguine with Beef Meatballs & Marinara Sauce sold at Walmart in refrigerated 12-ounce clear plastic trays. The products have best-by dates of Sept. 22 through Oct. 1 and may still be in consumers' refrigerators.",
      "In an update on Friday, the FSIS added to its public health alert some meals sold at Trader Joe's, the Trader Joe's Cajun Style Blackened Chicken Breast Fettuccine Alfredo, sold in 16-ounce plastic tray packages with \"best if used by\" dates of Sept. 20, Sept. 24 or Sept. 27. The products contain the establishment number \"P- 45288\" inside the USDA mark of inspection.",
      "The affected meals from Walmart contain the establishment numbers \"EST. 50784\" and \"EST. 47718\" inside the USDA mark of inspection on the label. They were sent to Walmart stores nationwide.",
      "\"The health and safety of our customers is always a top priority. We have removed this product from our impacted stores and we are working with the supplier to investigate,\" a Walmart spokesperson said in a statement to CBS News on Friday.",
      "There have been no reported illness complaints for the product in question, and consumers should discard the meals if they have them and can receive a full refund at any Walmart store.",
      "No recall has been issued, but FreshRealm, a large food producer that distributed the products, said they advised Walmart this week to pull the meals from store shelves. Additional products may be identified, according to the FSIS. Walmart officials said they put a stop to sales and removed the products from stores.",
      "The meals may be contaminated with the same strain of listeria that caused an outbreak tied to chicken fettuccine Alfredo meals sold at Walmart and Kroger stores.\u00a0Four people were killed and at least 20 were sickened in the outbreak, which federal health officials updated on Friday evening. The outbreak led to a large recall this summer.",
      "\"FreshRealm held beef meatball marinara linguine meals after they tested positive for the outbreak strain,\" the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u00a0said in its update Friday. \"Pasta that went into the beef meatball marinara linguine meals has tested positive for Listeria, but additional information is pending to determine if the samples taken from the pre-cooked pasta is the same strain making people sick. Do not eat affected foods, return them or throw them out.\"",
      "FreshRealm conducted tests that detected the listeria in linguine used in the meatball dish, company officials said. The strain matched the listeria identified in the chicken fettuccine Alfredo outbreak, the company said.",
      "\"We have long maintained that the source of the listeria was likely an ingredient supplied by a third party,\" the company said in a statement.",

Symptoms include fever, muscle aches, tiredness, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance and convulsions, according to the CDC.",
      "About 1,600 people get sick each year from listeria infections and about 260 die, the CDC says. Federal officials in December said they were revamping protocols to prevent listeria infections after several high-profile outbreaks, including one linked to Boar's Head deli meats that led to 10 deaths and more than 60 illnesses last year.",

    "published": "Fri, 26 Sep 2025 20:29:37 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump announced a 100% tariff on pharmaceutical drugs, a 50% tariff on kitchen cabinets and bathroom vanities, a 30% tariff on upholstered furniture and a 25% tariff on heavy trucks.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump announced Thursday that the U.S. would impose a new round of tariffs, including a 100% tariff on pharmaceutical drugs, a 30% tariff on upholstered furniture, a 50% tariff on kitchen cabinets and bathroom vanities, and a 30% tariff on heavy trucks.",
      "In social media posts to Truth Social, Mr. Trump said the new tariffs would take effect Oct. 1.",
      "Mr. Trump said in his posts that the 100% tariff on \"any branded or patented Pharmaceutical Product\" would not apply to companies building manufacturing plants in the U.S., which he defined as either \"breaking ground\" or being \"under construction.\"",
      "In 2024, America imported nearly $233 billion in pharmaceutical and medicinal products, according to the Census Bureau. The prospect of prices doubling for some medicines could send shockwaves to voters as health care expenses, as well as the costs of Medicare and Medicaid, potentially increase.",
      "Still, some experts think the new pharma tariffs could end up having only a modest impact, noting that generic drugs are exempt. The loophole for drugmakers with operations in the U.S. is also likely to soften the blow, Neal Shearing, group chief economist with Capital Economics, said in a report.",
      "\"Many of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies either already have some production in the U.S. or have announced plans to build production in the near future,\" he said. \"Add in the fact that pharmaceuticals is the one area where we think there may have been significant inventory accumulation this year, as importers have sought to front-run potential tariffs, and the impact on the effective tariff rate is likely to be small.\"",
      "Higher costs for home furnishings?",
      "Trump argued that foreign manufacturers of furniture and cabinetry were \"flooding\" the U.S. with their products and that tariffs must be applied \"for National Security and other reasons.\"",
      "The new tariffs on cabinetry could further increase the costs for homebuilders at a time when many people seeking to buy a house feel priced out by the mix of housing shortages and high mortgage rates.",
      "Last month, Mr. Trump announced on social media that a \"major Tariff Investigation\" was being conducted on furniture coming into the U.S. and said that within the next 50 days, the investigation would be completed, and a tariff rate would be announced.",
      "The president said the 25% tariff on \"all 'Heavy (Big!) Trucks' made in other parts of the world\" was \"in order to protect our Great Heavy Truck Manufacturers from unfair outside competition.\"",
      "\"Large Truck Company Manufacturers, such as Peterbilt, Kenworth, Freightliner, Mack Trucks, and others, will be protected from the onslaught of outside interruptions,\" Trump posted.",
      "Throughout much of 2025, the Trump administration's broad tariffs defied predictions that they would fuel inflation, but that respite seems to have ended after economic data this month showed the duties are now driving prices upward. The Consumer Price Index in August rose at a rate of 2.9% from a year ago, up from an annual pace of 2.3% in April, when Mr. Trump first launched a sweeping set of import taxes.",
      "Nor is there evidence that the tariffs are creating factory jobs or more construction of manufacturing facilities. Since April, the Bureau of Labor Statistics has reported that manufacturers cut 42,000 jobs and builders have downsized by 8,000.",
      "\"There's no inflation,\" Mr. Trump told reporters Thursday. \"We're having unbelievable success.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Trump told his administration on Friday to declassify any federal records about Amelia Earhart, the pilot whose 1937 disappearance over the Pacific Ocean has drawn decades of public fascination.",
      "\"Amelia made it almost three quarters around the World before she suddenly, and without notice, vanished, never to be seen again,\" the president wrote on Truth Social. \"Her disappearance, almost 90 years ago, has captivated millions.\"",
      "Earhart and navigator Fred Noonan disappeared as they flew toward Howland Island in the Pacific, part of her attempt to become the first female aviator to circumnavigate the world.",
      "It's widely believed that Earhart crashed into the ocean near Howland Island after running out of fuel, says Laurie Gwen Shapiro, a journalist who wrote a book on Earhart. But other theories about where she and her plane ended up have circulated for decades \u2014 many of which lack clear evidence. Researchers are planning an expedition to a remote island later this year.",
      "It's not clear what, if any, classified documents the government may have on Earhart.",
      "But a lawmaker who represents the Northern Mariana Islands territory in the U.S. House pushed Mr. Trump to declassify and release Earhart records earlier this year, referring to \"credible, firsthand accounts\" that the aviator was spotted on the Pacific island of Saipan.",
      "\"Despite these recollections, her disappearance and the possibility that she may have died on our islands remain matters of unresolved historical inquiry,\" Del. Kimberlyn King-Hinds, a Republican, wrote in a July letter to the president.",
      "One of the theories is that Earhart was on a spy mission for the U.S. government when she landed in Saipan and was taken into custody by the Japanese.",
      "Documents previously released by the FBI contain a 1967 request for a security review of a manuscript that cites Navy files on Earhart that were marked \"confidential,\" a level of classification. The manuscript's author, a senior officer in the Air Force, wrote that the conclusions in the Navy report were that Earhart was not on a spy mission, did not crash-land in Saipan, and was not held as a prisoner or executed as a spy.",
      "The FBI, in approving that manuscript for publication \u2014 which is a typical process for current and former government officials \u2014 noted that the Navy files did \"not warrant classification since the release of it would not be prejudicial to the national defense.\"",
      "Shapiro called the theory that Earhart was taken captive in Saipan \"nonsense.\"",
      "\"It's 99.9% that she ran out of gas,\" Shapiro told CBS News. She said Earhart and Noonan were low on fuel and \"very ill-prepared\" for their attempted flight to Howland Island, a tiny, difficult-to-find island in the middle of the ocean.",
      "\"It's very boring to tell people, you know what, she ran out of gas,\" Shapiro said. \"The fantasy around it is amazing.\"",
      "The National Archives and Records Administration has also previously\u00a0released documents\u00a0on the search for Earhart.",
      "In 1993, two Hawaiian lawmakers introduced bills in the House and Senate to require the government to release all records relating to Earhart's last flight and disappearance. The bills called for the declassification of any such relevant records that have been classified as government secrets.\u00a0The measures never made it out of the committees they were referred to.",
      "Mr. Trump's push to declassify Earhart records follows his decision to release records on the 1960s-era assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr., John F. Kennedy and Robert F. Kennedy. His administration is also under pressure to release records on the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.",

    "story": [
      "Prosecutors have moved to drop charges against Travis Decker, the man accused of killing his three young daughters earlier this year before disappearing and sparking a monthslong manhunt, after the U.S. Marshals Service informed them Decker is dead, court documents show.",
      "Local law enforcement confirmed Thursday that the human remains that were\u00a0found in Washington state\u00a0last week came back as a match for Decker after DNA testing.",
      "\"We are glad to say that those remains do come back as a positive match for Travis,\" Chelan County Sheriff Mike Morrison said Thursday during a news conference. \"We can finally bring a close to this dark chapter of Chelan County.\"",
      "On Friday, Chelan County Coroner Wayne Harris told CBS News in an email that Decker's \"cause and manner\" of death, along with the time of death, \"may never be known.\"",
      "Harris explained that because the coroner's office received \"minimal skeletal remains,\" and because of the time that has passed since his death, \"there is nothing to autopsy.\"",
      "\"The only examination done at this point was by a forensic anthropologist,\" Harris said Friday.",
      "The sheriff's office said last week the remains, which were discovered Sept. 18, were found in a remote wooded area south of Leavenworth, Washington.",
      "Using a drone, authorities found a decomposed body with bone fragments spread around the hillside, along with clothing and other personal items, Morrison said last week. He said the body was found in a \"mountainous area\" that was not along a trail, and it was about a three-hour hike to get to the remains on foot.",
      "Decker, a 32-year-old former Army soldier, was accused in May of killing his three daughters, 9-year-old Paityn Decker, 8-year-old Evelyn Decker and 5-year-old Olivia Decker. DNA testing confirmed he was the only suspect in the murders, police have said.",
      "The girls' mother alerted authorities on May 30 that he had not returned the three girls on time to her at her home in Wenatchee, Washington, following a scheduled visit, and a search was launched. The girls' bodies were found three days later at a campsite in the Cascade Mountains, along with Decker's truck.",
      "An autopsy determined their cause of death was suffocation, authorities said.",
      "In September 2024, Decker's ex-wife, Whitney Decker, filed to modify their custody agreement. In a petition, she wrote that Decker's mental health issues had worsened and that he had become increasingly unstable. She also said he was often living out of his truck.",
      "Decker, an Army infantryman from March 2013 to July 2021, had extensive training in navigation, survival and other survival skills, authorities previously said. Despite the continued search, police said in late June that they\u00a0believe he may have died\u00a0or left the area.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/suspect-identified-in-infamous-texas-yogurt-shop-murder-case-48-hours/",
    "published": "Fri, 26 Sep 2025 19:05:00 -0400",
    "summary": "\"48 Hours\" can exclusively report there has been a huge break in the 1991 murders of four teenage girls in a Texas yogurt shop.",
    "story": [
      "\"48 Hours\" correspondent Erin Moriarty has learned a suspect has been identified in the 1991 murders of four teenage girls in an Austin, Texas, yogurt shop. This is according to one of the original investigators who worked the case.",
      "That suspect is Robert Eugene Brashers, who is deceased, says retired Austin detective John Jones.",
      "Brashers is a serial killer and rapist who committed at least three murders between 1990 and 1998 in the states of South Carolina and Missouri. He died in January 1999 by suicide during a standoff with police. The gun he used to shoot himself is believed to be consistent with a bullet casing found in a drain inside the yogurt shop, says Jones.",
      "The connection between Brashers and the case was made through DNA, Jones told Moriarty.",
      "Moriarty has reported on the yogurt shop case since the very beginning.",
      "On Dec. 6, 1991, 17-year-old Eliza Thomas, 13-year-old Amy Ayers, and two sisters, 17-year-old Jennifer Harbison and 15-year-old Sarah Harbison, were found gagged, tied up with their own clothing, and shot in the head in an I Can't Believe It's Yogurt! shop in Austin. The person responsible had also set the shop on fire, compromising much of the evidence.",
      "Eliza and Jennifer had been working at the yogurt shop that night. They were getting ready to close when Jennifer's sister, Sarah, and their friend, Amy, met them there to head home.",
      "Following the crime, the Austin Police Department developed a task force dedicated solely to solving the case. Government agencies, including the FBI, were called in to assist, but the case ultimately went cold until 1999, when four men, Robert Springsteen, Michael Scott, Maurice Pierce and Forrest Welborn, were arrested and charged with the murders.'",
      "The men were only teenagers at the time of the crime. They were first questioned just days after the murders when one of them, Maurice Pierce, was arrested at a mall not far from the yogurt shop with a .22 caliber gun \u2014 one of the same types of weapons believed to have been used in the killings.",
      "All four were released back then for lack of evidence, but in 1999, when a new team of investigators were tasked with taking a fresh look at the old case, they obtained confessions from two of the four men, Robert Springsteen and Michael Scott. Those confessions would later be called into question after the two recanted, saying they were coerced.",
      "Charges were ultimately dropped against Maurice Pierce and Forrest Welborn due to lack of evidence, and Robert Springsteen and Michael Scott were the only two to go on trial. The sole evidence against them were their own words. They were both convicted, but a few years later, their convictions were overturned on constitutional grounds. The Sixth Amendment gives defendants the right to confront accusers and in Scott and Springsteen's trials, their confessions were used against one another, but they weren't allowed to question each other in court.",
      "Rosemary Lehmberg, the Travis County, Texas, district attorney at the time, was intent on retrying Springsteen and Scott. But before doing so, her office decided to take advantage of what was then a fairly new type of DNA testing called Y-STR testing. It was a way of searching for and extracting male DNA only. Y-STR testing was ordered on vaginal swabs taken from the victims at the time of the murders. By this point, investigators had come to believe that at least one of the victims had been sexually assaulted. As a result of the Y-STR testing, a partial male DNA profile was obtained from one of the girls, but to the surprise of the district attorney's office, the DNA sample did not match any of the four men who were arrested.",
      "Still, prosecutors were determined to retry Springsteen and Scott. But before doing so, they wanted to figure out who that mystery DNA belonged to. In 2009, with no matches, the charges against Springsteen and Scott were dropped. After nearly 10 years behind bars, they were released.",
      "For years, officials kept trying to track down the source of the mystery DNA and finally there was a match this month, according to original investigator John Jones.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/government-shutdown-september-2025-economic-impact-social-security-tsa/",
    "published": "Fri, 26 Sep 2025 18:09:43 -0400",
    "summary": "The economic impact of a government shutdown depends on its duration, economists say. Some payments, like Social Security, would continue to be issued.",
    "story": [
      "A government shutdown could begin within days, halting pay for hundreds of thousands of federal workers and delaying services, as lawmakers remain deadlocked over funding past Sept. 30.",
      "The financial impact of a shutdown typically depends on the length of the disruption, with each week costing the U.S. economy about $7 billion, according to a new analysis from EY-Parthenon Chief Economist Gregory Daco. A suspension could also weigh on investor and consumer confidence at a time when the U.S. economy is already facing headwinds, he told CBS News.",
      "Government shutdowns aren't new: The U.S. has experienced 14 of them since 1980, with the longest occurring over 34 days from December 2018 into January 2019, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center. They're triggered when Congress fails to pass a full-year spending bill or a continuing resolution to fund the government for the pending fiscal year, which begins on Wednesday. Oct. 1.",
      "\"We've been to this picnic before, unfortunately,\" Wayne Winegarden, a senior fellow in business and economics at Pacific Research Institute, told CBS News. Pacific Research is a think tank that focuses on free trade.",
      "\"In general, things like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, those will continue to go out, and we'll continue to pay interest on the debt,\" Winegarden said.",
      "But, he added, \"The general rule is that the longer it goes on, the bigger the disruption.\"",
      "What happens if there is a government shutdown?",
      "Without congressional approval for new spending, federal agencies are typically prohibited from doling out money. Activities at many agencies will be suspended until lawmakers agree on a new funding bill, with hundreds of thousands of federal workers likely to be furloughed during that time.",
      "Yet because the government must continue to provide services that protect life and property, agencies will determine which essential workers must continue working, although they won't receive pay until lawmakers resolve the funding gap.",
      "And while some federal employees would eventually receive back pay, others could experience financial strain while their paychecks are suspended, Daco noted.",
      "During the shutdown of 2018-2019, about 800,000 government workers missed several weeks of pay, creating financial hardships for many. Some turned to online fundraising campaigns for assistance, while others relied on food banks to help them get through the period.",
      "What is the economic impact of a government shutdown?",
      "While the biggest direct hit would be on government workers, followed by federal contractors who would also be shut off from funding, delayed federal procurement on goods and services could also ripple through the broader economy, Daco told CBS News.",
      "A shutdown could also undermine confidence in the economy at a time when some sectors, such as the labor market, are facing headwinds, he added. Markets could be rattled by the disruption, as well as consumer sentiment, some economists noted.",
      "\"We need more certainty in the rules of the game of the economy,\" Winegarden said. \"Uncertainty, at this moment, is the last thing we need.\"",
      "A halt in government functions could also complicate monetary policy decisions, potentially resulting in delays for key economic data next month, such as the Oct. 3 jobs report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. With the labor market stalling out over the summer, Federal Reserve officials are expected to closely scrutinize the latest jobs data when they make their next rate decision at the central bank's Oct. 29 meeting.",
      "\"A government shutdown at this economic juncture represent a graver risk than when the economy is running at full steam,\" Daco said.",
      "Would Social Security benefits be impacted?",
      "Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid are covered by mandatory spending, which means that funding for these programs has been approved by Congress to continue without an expiration date.",
      "Social Security benefits would be paid on time, while health care payments for seniors in Medicare and low- and middle-income Americans enrolled in Medicaid would continue.",
      "However, Social Security's administrative budget needs to receive approval from Congress, which means that some of its services could be impacted in a shutdown, some experts note.",
      "\"In the event of a government shutdown ... customer service at the Social Security Administration may be disrupted, including benefit verifications, earnings record corrections and updates, overpayments processing and replacing Medicare cards,\" Max Richtman, CEO of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security & Medicare, said in a Friday email.",
      "Would other federal functions like the TSA be impacted?",
      "Air traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration agents would be required to work without pay because they provide essential services.",
      "Unlike other government agencies. the U.S. Postal Service operates as a sefl-funded, independent agency. That means mail, packages and other shipments would still be delivered and post offices would remain open in the event of a shutdown.",
      "But there could be other impacts for consumers and businesses. For one, some mortgage processing could face delays because the flood insurance program would be closed to new policies until Congress agrees to a new spending deal, according to TD Cowen analyst Jaret Seiberg.",
      "\"That means no mortgages which require federal flood insurance will be originated,\" he noted.",
      "In previous shutdowns, other services were also suspended, such as the Food and Drug Administration's inspections, as well as the entry to the National Parks, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.",

In 2013, former FBI assistant director John Miller told CBS News that she was \"the soul of the Black Liberation Army\" and had been a leader of the group.",
      "She was charged with multiple crimes in the early 1970s, including a bank robbery. In 1973, she was involved in a shootout on the New Jersey Turnpike. The incident left state trooper Werner Foerster and Black Liberation Army member Zayd Malik Shakur dead. Assata Shakur was wounded in the incident. She was arrested and convicted of murdering Foerster, as well as seven other felony charges related to the shooting. She was sentenced to life in prison.",
      "In 1979, Shakur escaped the Clinton Correctional Facility for Women in New Jersey.

    "summary": "The Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to withhold more than $4 billion in foreign aid funding through a maneuver known as a \"pocket rescission.\"",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Friday allowed President Trump's administration to withhold more than $4 billion in foreign aid funding, granting its request for emergency relief in a dispute over money that Congress has already approved.",
      "The high court's decision follows an order that Chief Justice John Roberts had issued earlier this month, which temporarily froze a district court injunction requiring the Trump administration to spend the money Congress appropriated for foreign-aid projects by the end of September. The court appeared to divide 6-3, with Justices Elena Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson, the court's three liberals, dissenting.",
      "The Supreme Court said in an unsigned order that the harm to the executive branch's ability to conduct foreign affairs appears to outweigh the potential harm faced by the plaintiffs, which are organizations and businesses that receive funding for foreign aid projects. It added that the decision \"should not be read as a final determination on the merits. The relief granted by the Court today reflects our preliminary view, consistent with the standards for interim relief.\"",
      "The legal fight over foreign aid",
      "The dispute before the justices involves a tranche of more than $4 billion Congress approved last year for overseas development assistance, peacekeeping operations and to promote democracy globally, among other priorities. Mr. Trump notified Congress last month that he is seeking to claw back $4.9 billion before the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30 through a maneuver known as a \"pocket rescission.\"",
      "The Government Accountability Office has said the move is illegal.",
      "But the Supreme Court said in its decision that at this stage in the proceedings, the government \"has made a sufficient showing\" that the Impoundment Control Act, the mechanism for the president to move to cancel congressionally approved federal funding, precludes the plaintiffs' suit. That lawsuit sought to make the president comply with appropriations law passed last year.",
      "In a dissenting opinion, Kagan said the stakes in the case are high, as it involves the allocation of power between the executive branch and Congress.",
      "\"[T]he consequence of today's grant is significant. I appreciate that the majority refrains from offering a definitive view of this dispute and the questions raised in it,\" she wrote. \"But the effect of its ruling is to allow the Executive to cease obligating $4 billion in funds that Congress appropriated for foreign aid, and that will now never reach its intended recipients. Because that result conflicts with the separation of powers, I respectfully dissent.\"",
      "U.S. District Judge Amir Ali ruled in early September that the administration's refusal not to spend congressionally approved funds is likely illegal under a federal law governing the agency rule-making process. The judge said the Trump administration could withhold the funding only if Congress rescinded it through duly enacted legislation.",
      "The dispute was brought by nonprofit organizations and development companies in February after the Trump administration issued a 90-day pause of foreign development assistance to review whether programs were consistent with the president's foreign policy.",
      "It has since ping-ponged through the courts, including the Supreme Court back in March. Then, the high court split 5-4 in deciding to leave in place an order from Ali that required the Trump administration to pay roughly $2 billion in invoices for foreign-aid work that had already been performed.",
      "In the latest development in the case, a three-judge panel on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled last month that the nonprofits and businesses could not sue on grounds the administration violated the separation of powers by unilaterally declining to spend congressionally approved foreign-aid funds. The panel voted 2-1 to wipe away an order from Ali that had prohibited the government from withholding the money Congress appropriated last year for foreign assistance programs.",
      "But the D.C. Circuit panel later issued an amended opinion that opened up an avenue for the nonprofits and businesses to seek relief on different legal grounds. On the heels of that decision, Mr. Trump informed Congress of his plan to rescind the $4.9 billion in foreign aid funding, which he said supported \"wasteful\" programs that did not align with his \"America First\" foreign policy agenda.",
      "The plaintiffs then filed a new request for preliminary relief with Ali, and the judge found that the Trump administration had a duty to comply with Congress's directives by spending the $4 billion by the end of September, when the fiscal year ends.",
      "The Trump administration asked the D.C. Circuit to freeze Ali's latest order. After the appeals court declined to do so, the administration asked the Supreme Court to intervene.",
      "In a filing with the high court, Solicitor General D. John Sauer said the district court's injunction \"raises a grave and urgent threat to the separation of powers.\"",
      "\"The President can hardly speak with one voice in foreign affairs or in dealings with Congress when the district court is forcing the Executive Branch to advocate against its own objectives,\" Sauer wrote.",
      "The solicitor general said Ali's injunction \"puts the executive branch at war with itself\" by requiring it to spend the same $4 billion that the president wants to claw back.",
      "But lawyers for the plaintiffs said that the government has been obligated to spend the money approved by Congress for specific purposes since at least March 2024. They wrote in a filing that the appropriations legislation enacted by Congress last year remains binding on the executive branch.",
      "\"[T]he upshot of the government's theory is that Congress's signature law meant to control impoundments actually provided the President vast new powers to impound funds, and made it virtually impossible to challenge impoundments in court,\" the lawyers said. \"Congress would not have enacted such a self-defeating statute.\"",
      "The plaintiffs warned that allowing the president to withhold the money for foreign assistance would threaten the viability of groups that receive federal dollars for projects overseas. For one of the organizations, Democracy International, 98% of its revenues in 2024 came from awards from the U.S. Agency for International Development, according to court filings. Lawyers warned the company would be at risk of bankruptcy if the expiring appropriations are not spent.",
      "\"The pocket rescission of democracy promotion funds is an existential threat to Democracy International,\" the plaintiffs wrote.",

    "story": [
      "Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee are launching a review Friday of the ouster of federal prosecutor Erik Siebert, a week after he resigned as U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, and a day after Siebert's replacement signed an indictment\u00a0of former FBI Director James Comey. Prosecutors had expressed concern about Siebert's possible ouster over his failure to bring a case against another Trump adversary, New York Attorney General Letitia James.",
      "President Trump, in a social media post after Siebert's departure from the office, had pressed U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi about prosecutions against political foes including Comey, James and Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff of California, calling them \"guilty as hell.\"",
      "Mr. Trump praised one of his own former defense lawyers, Lindsey Halligan, calling her \"a really good lawyer,\" and told Bondi in the post, \"We can't delay any longer.\"",
      "Halligan was sworn in\u00a0as interim U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia on Monday, replacing Siebert in the office. She has no prior experience as a prosecutor.",
      "Three days after Halligan took over the key prosecutorial role, Comey was indicted on two counts \u2014 one count of making false statements and one count of obstruction of justice, related to Senate testimony he gave almost five years ago. The indictment bears Halligan's signature alone. Comey\u00a0denies wrongdoing.",
      "In a letter sent Friday to Bondi, House Judiciary Committee Democrats requested copies of Siebert's performance evaluations, and they're seeking records that would show any backchannel communication between the White House and Justice Department officials over the Comey matter.",
      "The letter from the panel's Democrats requests \"all communications between any official or employee at the Justice Department and any official or employee at the White House, including President Trump, regarding prosecution referrals to the Justice Department involving current or former public officials, including but not limited to Letitia James, James Comey, Senator Adam Schiff, and Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, from January 20, 2025, to the present.\"",
      "Before she became an interim U.S. attorney, Halligan was a Trump White House aide who was also his defense lawyer.",

      "Because they're in the minority and lack congressional subpoena authority, Democrats' requests for documents are not likely to be granted by the Trump administration. But their letter presents them with the opportunity to register their dismay with the administration's actions.",
      "In the letter to Bondi, House Judiciary Committee ranking member Jamie Raskin wrote, \"President Trump \u2014 with you as a willing partner \u2014 is obliterating centuries of prosecutorial independence and steering the Justice Department into dangerous new territory.\"",
      "Mr. Trump had expressed his displeasure with Siebert, saying Friday: \"I want him out.\"",
      "The president criticized Siebert because he had the support of both of Virginia's Democratic senators, Tim Kaine and Mark Warner.",
      "A U.S. attorney nominee requires the backing of the two senators who represent the state to advance through the Senate Judiciary Committee. It seems unlikely Kaine and Warner would support Halligan. Both senators told the Washington Post they'd review her nomination, but Kaine said that neither of them has backed a U.S. attorney nominee who lacks prosecutorial or Justice Department experience.",

      "In a letter submitted in response to subpoenas from the House Judiciary Committee, attorneys for Alphabet said the decision to bring back banned accounts reflected the company's commitment to free speech.",
      "\"No matter the political atmosphere, YouTube will continue to enable free expression on its platform, particularly as it relates to issues subject to political debate,\" the letter read, noting that a number of accounts were kicked off the platform between 2023 and 2024 for violating misinformation rules that don't exist anymore. Now, it said, \"YouTube will provide an opportunity for all creators to rejoin the platform if the Company terminated their channels for repeated violations of COVID-19 and elections integrity policies that are no longer in effect.\"",

      "YouTube in 2023 phased out its policy to remove content that falsely claims the 2020 election, or other past U.S. presidential elections, were marred by \"widespread fraud, errors or glitches.\" Claims of fraud in the 2020 election have been debunked.",
      "The platform in 2024 also retired its standalone COVID-19 content restrictions, allowing various treatments for the disease to be discussed. COVID-19 misinformation now falls under YouTube's broader medical misinformation policy.",
      "Among the creators who have been banned from YouTube under the now-expired policies are prominent conservative influencers, including Dan Bongino, who now serves as deputy director of the FBI. For people who make money on social media, access to monetization on YouTube can be significant, earning them large sums through ad revenue.",
      "House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan and other congressional Republicans have pressured tech companies to reverse content moderation policies created under former President Joe Biden and accused Biden's administration of unfairly wielding its power over the companies to chill lawful online speech.",
      "In Tuesday's letter, Alphabet's lawyers said senior Biden administration officials \"conducted repeated and sustained outreach\" to coerce the company to remove pandemic-related YouTube videos that did not violate company policies.",
      "\"It is unacceptable and wrong when any government, including the Biden Administration, attempts to dictate how the Company moderates content, and the Company has consistently fought against those efforts on First Amendment grounds,\" the letter said.",
      "Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has also accused the Biden administration of pressuring employees to inappropriately censor content during the COVID-19 pandemic. Elon Musk, the owner of the social platform X, has accused the FBI of illegally coercing Twitter before his tenure to suppress a story about Hunter Biden.",

    "story": [
      "The Danish defense ministry said Saturday that \"drones have been observed at several of Danish defense facilities\" overnight Friday into Saturday. The renewed drone sightings come after there were several drone sightings in the Nordic country earlier this week, with some of them temporarily shutting down Danish airports.",
      "The Danish defense ministry said in a statement that drone activity was noticed at Skrydstrup Air Base and the Jutland Dragoon Regiment.",
      "Several local media reported that one or more drones were also seen near or above the military Karup Air Base, which is Denmark's biggest military base.",
      "The Defense ministry refused to confirm the sighting at Karup and said later that \"for reasons of operational security and the ongoing investigation, the Defense Command Denmark does not wish to elaborate further on drone sightings.\"",

      "DR said that for a period of time the airspace was closed to civil air traffic, but that did not have much practical significance as there is currently no civil aviation in Karup.",
      "The repeated unexplained drone activity, including over four Danish airports overnight Wednesday into Thursday and a similar incident at Copenhagen Airport has raised concerns about security in northern Europe.",
      "Flights resumed early Tuesday at Copenhagen airport after being suspended or diverted overnight because of drone sightings. Police reported two to three large, unidentified drones were seen Monday night, forcing outgoing flights at Scandinavia's largest airport to be grounded and others diverted to airports nearby.",
      "Jens Jespersen of the Copenhagen Police said the those responsible seemed to be showing off their skills, adding that the number, large size and flight patterns of the unidentified drones combined indicated \"that it is a capable actor. Which capable actor, I do not know.\"",
      "Police in neighboring Norway said they had seized a drone near Oslo's airport, the AFP news agency reported. A public prosecutor in Norway said Thursday that there was nothing to immediately suggest any link between the Oslo incident and the drones seen in Denmark, according to AFP.",
      "Neither Danish nor Norwegian officials have accused anyone of responsibility. But the incidents come with many European nations on alert following Russian drone and fighter jet incursions into Poland, Romania and Estonia.",

The ministry is part of the Hamas-run government, but U.N. agencies and many independent experts consider its figures to be the most reliable estimate of wartime casualties.",

    "summary": "As Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu began speaking at the U.N. General Assembly in New York, dozens of people walked out of the room in protest.",
    "story": [
      "Encircled by critics and protesters at the United Nations, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told fellow world leaders on Friday that Israel \"must finish the job\" against Hamas in Gaza, giving a defiant speech despite growing international isolation over his refusal to end the devastating war in Gaza.",
      "\"Western leaders may have buckled under the pressure,\" he said. \"And I guarantee you one thing: Israel won't.\"",
      "He spoke after dozens of delegates from multiple nations walked out of the U.N. General Assembly hall en masse Friday as he began.",
      "Responding to countries' recent decisions to recognize Palestinian statehood, Netanyahu said: \"Your disgraceful decision will encourage terrorism against Jews and against innocent people everywhere.\"",
      "As the Israeli leader spoke, unintelligible shouts echoed around the hall. Applause rang out in other quarters as he spoke. The U.S. delegation, which has backed Netanyahu in his campaign against Hamas, stayed put. The few world powers in attendance, the United States and the United Kingdom, did not send their most senior officials or even their UN ambassador to their section. Instead, it was filled out with more junior, low-level diplomats.",
      "\"Anti-semitism dies hard. In fact, it doesn't die at all,\" Netanyahu said. Netanyahu routinely accuses his critics of antisemitism.",
      "Netanyahu faces international isolation, accusations of war crimes and growing pressure to end a conflict he has continued to escalate. Friday's speech was his chance to push back on the international community's biggest platform.",
      "As he has often in the past at the United Nations, Netanyahu held up a visual aid - a map of the region titled \"THE CURSE.\" He marked it up with a large marker. He ascended the podium wearing a special hostages pin with a QR code that leads to a site about Oct. 7 that was established specially for international public diplomacy needs. The members of the prime minister's delegation, ministers and those accompanying him also wore identical pins.",
      "Netanyahu also frequently praised President Donald Trump, his chief ally in his political and military approach in the region.",
      "On Iran, he thanked Mr. Trump \"for his bold and decisive action,\" and said the world \"must remain vigilant.\"",
      "Netanyahu said the changes across the Mideast have created new opportunities. He said Israel has begun negotiations with Syria aimed at reaching security arrangements with the country's new government.",
      "Back in the Mideast, Netanyahu said the Israeli government was taking steps to ensure that those in Gaza and others heard what he had to say.",
      "He said the military set up loudspeakers at the Israel-Gaza border to blast his words into the territory, and addressed the remaining Israeli hostages, who have been held in Gaza since Hamas' Oct. 7 terrorist attack nearly two years ago.",
      "\"Our brave heroes, this is Prime Minister Netanyahu speaking to you live from the United Nations. We have not forgotten you, not even for a second. The people of Israel are with you. We will not falter and we will not rest until we bring all of you home,\" he said.",
      "In an \"unprecedented operation,\" by Israeli intelligence, Netanyahu said his speech would also be streamed over the mobile phones of Gaza residents.",
      "It was not immediately clear if that happened, or to what extent. Neither CBS News nor AP journalists inside Gaza saw any immediate evidence of Netanyahu's speech being broadcast on phones there.",
      "Netanyahu's annual speech to the U.N. General Assembly is always closely watched, often protested, reliably emphatic and sometimes a venue for dramatic allegations. But this time, the stakes are higher than ever for the Israeli leader.",
      "In recent days, Australia, Canada, France, the United Kingdom and others announced their recognition of an independent Palestinian state.",
      "The European Union is considering tariffs and sanctions on Israel. The assembly this month passed a nonbinding resolution urging Israel to commit to an independent Palestinian nation, which Netanyahu has said is a non-starter.",
      "The International Criminal Court has issued an arrest warrant accusing Netanyahu of crimes against humanity, which he denies. And the U.N's highest court is weighing South Africa's allegation that Israel has committed genocide in Gaza, which it vehemently refutes.",
      "Earlier this month, an independent panel of experts commissioned by the United Nations Human Rights Council concluded \"the Israeli authorities and Israeli security forces have committed and are continuing to commit\" acts of genocide against Palestinians in Gaza.",
      "Against that backdrop, Netanyahu sounded resolute Thursday as he boarded a plane in Israel to head for the U.N.'s annual meeting of top-level leaders in New York.",
      "\"I will tell our truth,\" Netanyahu said. \"I will condemn those leaders who, instead of condemning the murderers, rapists and burners of children, want to give them a state in the heart of Israel.\"",
      "At a special session of the assembly this week, nation after nation expressed horror at the Oct. 7 2023 terrorist attack that killed about 1,200 people in Israel, saw 251 taken hostage and triggered the war. Many of the representatives went on to call for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and influx of aid.",
      "Israel's sweeping offensive has killed more than 65,000 Palestinians in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, and displaced 90 percent of its population, with an increasing number now starving, according to the World Health Organization.",
      "While more than 150 countries now recognize a Palestinian state, the United States has not, providing Israel with vociferous support. But Mr. Trump pointedly signaled Thursday there are limits, telling reporters in Washington that he wouldn't let Israel annex the occupied West Bank.",
      "Israel hasn't announced such a move, but several leading members in Netanyahu's government have advocated doing so. And officials recently approved a controversial settlement project that would effectively cut the West Bank in two, a move that critics say could doom chances for a Palestinian state. Mr. Trump and Netanyahu are scheduled to meet during his visit.",
      "Netanyahu's office also \"instructed civilian groups in cooperation with the army to place loudspeakers on trucks on the Israeli side of the border,\" it said in a statement, noting that the broadcasts would be arranged so they would not endanger soldiers.",
      "Netanyahu was preceded Thursday by Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas, who addressed the General Assembly via video, since the U.S. denied him a visa. He welcomed the announcements of recognition but said the world needs to do more to make statehood happen.",
      "\"The time has come for the international community to do right by the Palestinian people\" and help them realize \"their legitimate rights to be rid of the occupation and to not remain a hostage to the temperament of Israeli politics,\" he said.",
      "Abbas leads the internationally recognized Palestinian Authority, which administers portions of the West Bank. Hamas won legislative elections in Gaza in 2006 before seizing control from Abbas' forces the following year.",
      "Israel captured the West Bank, east Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip in the 1967 Mideast war, then withdrew from Gaza in 2005. The Palestinians want all three territories to form their envisioned state, part of a \"two-state solution\" that the international community has embraced for decades.",

    "story": [
      "A digital reconstruction of a million-year-old skull suggests humans may have diverged from our ancient ancestors 400,000 years earlier than thought and in Asia, not Africa, a study found.",
      "The findings, published Thursday, are based on a reconstruction of a crushed skull discovered in China in 1990 and have the potential to resolve the long-standing \"Muddle in the Middle\" of human evolution, researchers said.",
      "But experts not involved in the work cautioned that the findings were likely to be disputed and pointed to ongoing uncertainties in the timeline of human evolution.",
      "The skull, labelled Yunxian 2, was previously thought to belong to a human forerunner called Homo erectus.",
      "But modern reconstruction technologies revealed features closer to a species previously thought to have existed only later in human evolution, including the recently discovered Homo longi and our own Homo sapiens.",
      "\"This changes a lot of thinking,\" said Chris Stringer, an anthropologist at the Natural History Museum, London, who was part of the research team.",
      "\"It suggests that by 1 million years ago, our ancestors had already split into distinct groups, pointing to a much earlier and more complex human evolutionary split than previously believed,\" he added.",
      "The findings shocked the research team.",
      "\"From the very beginning, when we got the result, we thought it was unbelievable. How could that be so deep into the past?\" Xijun Ni, a professor at Fudan University who co-led the analysis, told BBC News. \"But we tested it again and again to test all the models, use all the methods, and we are now confident about the result, and we're actually very excited.\"",
      "If the findings are correct, it suggests there could have been much earlier members of other early hominins, including Neanderthals and Homo sapiens, the researchers said.",
      "It also \"muddies the waters\" on long-standing assumptions that early humans dispersed from Africa, said Michael Petraglia, director of Griffith University's Australian Research Centre for Human Evolution, who was not involved in the study.",
      "\"There's a big change potentially happening here, where east Asia is now playing a very key role in hominin evolution,\" he told the Agence France-Presse.",
      "\"A lot of questions\"",
      "The research, published in the journal Science, used advanced CT scanning, structure light imaging and virtual reconstruction techniques to model a complete Yunxian 2. The team then printed replicas on a 3D printer, according to BBC News.",
      "The scientists relied in part on another similar skull to shape their model, and then compared it to over 100 other specimens.",
      "The resulting model \"shows a distinctive combination of traits,\" the researchers said, some of them similar to Homo erectus, including a projecting lower face.",
      "But other aspects, including its apparently larger brain capacity, are closer to Homo longi and Homo sapiens, according to the study.",
      "\"Yunxian 2 may help us resolve what's been called the 'Muddle in the Middle,' the confusing array of human fossils from between 1 million and 300,000 years ago,\" Stringer said in a press release.",
      "Much about human evolution remains debated, and Petraglia said the study's findings were \"provocative\" though grounded in solid work.",
      "\"It's sound, but I think the jury's still out. I think there will be a lot of questions raised,\" he said.",
      "Andy Herries, an archeologist at La Trobe University, said he was not convinced by the conclusions and that genetic analysis had shown fossil morphology, or shape, was \"not always a perfect indicator for human evolution.\"",
      "\"They've got this interpretation that I just don't really think is taking into account the genetic histories of these things that we do know,\" he told AFP.",
      "Dr. Aylwyn Scally, an evolutionary geneticist at Cambridge University, told BBC News that although the study's conclusions were plausible, they were far from certain, and that more evidence was needed to be sure.",
      "\"That picture is still quite unclear to us, so if the conclusions of this research are supported by other analyses, ideally from some genetic data, then I think we would start to be increasingly confident about it,\" he told BBC News.",
      "The findings are only the latest in a string of recent research that has complicated what we thought we know about our origins.",
      "Homo longi, also known as \"Dragon Man,\" was itself only named as a new species and close human relative in 2021, by a team that included Stringer.",

      "The discovery, which was revealed in a study published Thursday, was \"one of those rare but remarkable eureka moments,\" marine biologist Andrey Vedenin told AFP.",
      "The waters off Germany's coast are estimated to be littered with 1.6 million tons of unexploded munitions left behind from both world wars.",
      "In October last year, a team of German scientists went to a previously uncharted dump site in the Baltic Sea's Luebeck Bay and sent an unmanned submersible 20 meters down to the seafloor.",
      "They were surprised when footage from the sub revealed 10 Nazi-era cruise missiles. Then they were stunned when they saw animals covering the surface of the bombs.",
      "There were roughly 40,000 animals per square meter \u2014 mostly marine worms \u2014 living on the munitions,\u00a0the scientists wrote\u00a0in the journal Communications Earth & Environment.",
      "\"Despite the potential negative effects of the toxic munition compounds, published underwater images show dense populations of algae, hydroids, mussels, and other epifauna on the munition objects, including mines, torpedo heads, bombs, and wooden crates,\" the study concludes.",
      "They also counted three species of fish, a crab, sea anemones, a jellyfish relative called hydroids and plenty of starfishes.",
      "While animals covered the hard casing of the bombs, they mostly avoided the yellow explosive material \u2014 except for one instance.",
      "The researchers were baffled to see that more than 40 starfishes had piled on to an exposed chunk of TNT.",
      "\"It looked really weird,\" said Vedenin, a scientist at Germany's Carl von Ossietzky University and the study's lead author.",
      "Exactly why the starfishes were there was unclear, but Vedenin theorized they could be eating bacterial film collecting on the corroding TNT.",
      "Life on deadly weapons",

      "Other than the death-wish starfishes, they did not seem to be behaving strangely.",
      "\"The crabs were just sitting and picking something with their claws,\" Vedenin said.",
      "To find out what kind of bombs they were dealing with, he went online and found a manual from the Nazi air force Luftwaffe describing how to handle and store V-1 flying bombs. The cruise missile exactly matched the 10 bombs from the footage.",
      "Vedenin said \"there is some irony\" in the discovery that these \"things that are meant to kill everything are now attracting so much life.\"",
      "He compared it to how animals such as deer now thrive in radioactive areas abandoned by humans near the site of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster.",

      "Animals once flocked to huge boulders that littered the Baltic Sea, however humans removed the stones to build infrastructure such as roads at the start of the 20th century.",
      "So when the Nazi bombs are eventually cleared from the bay, the researchers called for more stones \u2014 or concrete structures \u2014 to be put in place to continue supporting the sea life.",

    "story": [
      "President Trump said Thursday he will not let Israel annex the occupied West Bank, an idea that has circulated among members of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government.",
      "\"I will not allow Israel to annex the West Bank,\" the president told reporters during an Oval Office event. \"There's been enough. It's time to stop now.\"",
      "The president's comments come after several media outlets reported that Mr. Trump privately assured the leaders of Arab and majority-Muslim states this week that he would push back against any Israeli effort to annex the occupied territory.",
      "In recent days, several Western countries \u2014 including France, the United Kingdom and Canada \u2014 have moved to recognize a Palestinian state, leading Netanyahu to pledge some kind of response. Some hardline members of Netanyahu's governing coalition have pressed the Israeli government to react by annexing much of the West Bank, though it's unclear whether Netanyahu will seek to take that step.",
      "Netanyahu did not immediately publicly respond to Mr. Trump's comments.",
      "The West Bank \u2014 which Israel has occupied since 1967 \u2014 is home to millions of Palestinians and hundreds of thousands of Israeli settlers. Since the 1990s, the territory has been split up between areas where the Palestinian Authority has some degree of control and areas fully governed by the Israeli military. Most proposals for an independent Palestinian state have involved Israel ceding control over the vast majority of the West Bank.",
      "If Israel annexed some or all of the West Bank, formally entrenching its control over the territory, it could make forming a Palestinian state virtually impossible. The move could also upset U.S.-allied Arab countries, some of which have sought to improve their relations with Israel.",
      "Netanyahu has ruled out allowing a Palestinian state to be formed, calling the growing pressure on the issue an \"absurd prize for terrorism\" last weekend.",
      "Netanyahu's government has faced increasing international pressure over its handling of the Israel-Hamas war, which has destroyed much of the Gaza Strip's infrastructure and killed more than 60,000 people, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry, which does not specify how many of the dead were militants or civilians. The war began when Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people and taking 251 hostages.",

    "story": [
      "When Maria Branyas Morera died last year\u00a0at 117 years and 168 days old, she was the oldest known person in the world. Before she died, she asked doctors to study her.",
      "Dr. Manel Esteller, chairman of Genetics at the University of Barcelona's School of Medicine, spent three years analyzing Branyas' health. A study, published online Wednesday, by Esteller and a cohort of colleagues found that a mix of factors contributed to Branyas' longevity.",
      "\"The conclusion is that the clues for extreme longevity are a mix between what we inherited from our parents and what we do in our lives,\" Esteller said. \"And this mix, the percentage depends, but it can be ... half and half.\"",
      "Branyas \"had very good genes that protect against many disorders, many genetic variants that nobody has seen before,\" Esteller said. She also had \"very good habits.\" She didn't smoke or drink alcohol, and had a diet rich in fish, olive oil and yogurt \u2014 eating three yogurts each day, according to Esteller.",
      "The yogurt was plain without added sugar, which replenishes the gut with good bacteria, helping to combat inflammation, Esteller said.",
      "Chronic inflammation is one of the main causes of aging and disease, he said.",
      "\"These are good bacteria that provide an advantage to humans,\" Esteller added.",
      "The study noted that \"whether the dominance of the\u00a0Bifidobacterium [beneficial gut bacteria] related genus is fully attributable or not to the yogurt diet cannot be completely confirmed since that would have required a longitudinal study with sample collection over several years. However, we believe that it is likely that a beneficial effect of yogurt ingestion via modulation of the gut ecosystem could have contributed to her well-being and advanced age.\"",
      "Branyas once posted on social media about her love for yogurt, saying it \"gives life\" \u2014 and hers was a long one. She was born in 1907 in San Francisco and had lived in Spain since she was 8. She survived two world wars and two pandemics, and had three children and 13 great-grandchildren.",
      "In addition to living a long life, she also lived a healthy one \u2014 free of cancer, cardiovascular disease or dementia, according to Esteller.",
      "The picture that emerges from studying Branyas \"shows that extremely advanced age and poor health are not intrinsically linked and that both processes can be distinguished and dissected at the molecular level,\" the study, published in Cell Reports Medicine, says.",
      "Researchers said that to conduct the study, \"samples from the subject were obtained from four different sources: total peripheral blood, saliva, urine, and stool at different times.\"",
      "It also noted some limitations, including that aging and extreme longevity \"are probably highly individualized processes,\" so \"drawing broadly applicable conclusions from a single subject should be taken with caution.\""

      "The national police said the drones followed similar patterns to others that halted flights for four hours at Copenhagen Airport earlier in the week, according to Reuters. After that incident, Jens Jespersen of the Copenhagen Police said the those responsible seemed to be showing off their skills, adding that the number, large size and flight patterns of the unidentified drones combined indicated \"that it is a capable actor.

    "story": [
      "Paris \u2014\u00a0A Paris court on Thursday sentenced former French\u00a0President Nicolas Sarkozy to five years in prison after finding him guilty of criminal conspiracy in an alleged scheme to finance his 2007 campaign with funds from Libya. In a surprise decision, the court ruled that Sarkozy will be incarcerated even if he appeals, but it also said the date of the sentencing would come later, sparing the 70-year-old the humiliation of being led from the courtroom in handcuffs.",
      "The court found Sarkozy guilty of criminal association in a plot from 2005 to 2007 to finance his campaign with funds from Libya, in exchange for diplomatic favors. It cleared him of three other charges, including passive corruption, illegal campaign financing and concealment of the embezzlement of public funds.",
      "Sarkozy denounced the ruling and said he would appeal.",
      "\"This injustice is a scandal,\" he said.",
      "\"I ask the French people \u2014 whether they voted for me or not, whether they support me or not \u2014 to grasp what has just happened. Hatred truly knows no bounds,\" the former president said, adding that if he does end up behind bars, he'll do so, \"with my head held high.\"",
      "The court also found two of Sarkozy's closest associates when he was president \u2014 former government ministers Claude Gu\u00e9ant and Brice Hortefeux \u2014   guilty of criminal association, likewise acquitting them of some other charges.",
      "Overall, the ruling suggested that the court believed the men had conspired to seek Libyan funding for Sarkozy's 2007 campaign, but that judges weren't convinced the conservative leader himself was directly involved in the funding effort, or that any Libyan money ended up being used in his winning campaign.",
      "The chief judge, in an hours-long reading of the lengthy verdict, said Sarkozy had allowed his close associates to reach out to Libyan authorities, \"to obtain or try to obtain financial support in Libya for the purpose of securing campaign financing.\"",
      "The court said it couldn't determine with certainty that any Libyan money ended up financing Sarkozy's campaign.",
      "Sarkozy stood as the judge read out the verdict. He was accompanied by his wife, singer and model Carla Bruni-Sarkozy, in the courtroom, which was also filled with reporters and members of the public. Sarkozy sat in the front row of the defendant's section, and his three adult sons were also in the room.",
      "Sarkozy, who was elected in 2007 but lost a bid for reelection in 2012, denied all wrongdoing during a three-month trial earlier this year, which involved 11 co-defendants, including three former ministers.",
      "Despite multiple legal scandals that have clouded his presidential legacy, Sarkozy remains an influential figure in French right-wing politics\u00a0and in entertainment circles, by virtue of his marriage to Bruni-Sarkozy.",
      "The roots of a scandal",
      "The accusations against him go back to 2011, when a Libyan news agency and the country's former dictatorial leader\u00a0Muammar Qaddafi himself said the Libyan state had secretly funneled millions of euros into Sarkozy's 2007 election campaign.",
      "In 2012, French investigative outlet Mediapart published what it said was a Libyan intelligence memo referencing a 50 million-euro funding agreement. Sarkozy denounced the document as a forgery and sued for defamation. The court said Thursday that it \"now appears most likely that this document is a forgery.\"",
      "Investigators also looked into a series of trips to Libya made by people close to Sarkozy when he served as France's interior minister, from 2005 and 2007, including his chief of staff.",
      "In 2016, Franco-Lebanese businessman Ziad Takieddine told Mediapart that he had delivered suitcases filled with cash from Tripoli to the French Interior Ministry under Sarkozy. He later retracted his statement. That reversal is now the focus of a separate investigation into possible witness tampering.",
      "Both Sarkozy and his wife have been preliminarily charged with involvement in alleged efforts to pressure Takieddine. That case has not gone to trial yet.",
      "Takieddine, who was one of the co-defendants in the Sarkozy case, died Tuesday in Beirut at the age of 75. He fled to Lebanon in 2020 and did not attend the trial.",
      "Prosecutors alleged that Sarkozy had knowingly benefited from what they described as a \"corruption pact\" with Qaddafi's government.",
      "Libya's longtime dictator was toppled and killed in an uprising in 2011, ending his four-decade rule of the North African country.",
      "The trial shed light on France's back-channel talks with Libya in the 2000s, when Qaddafi  was seeking to restore diplomatic ties with the West. Before that, Libya was considered a pariah state.",
      "Sarkozy has dismissed the allegations as politically motivated and reliant on forged evidence. During the trial, he denounced a \"plot\" that he said was staged by \"liars and crooks,\" including the \"Qaddafi  clan.\"",
      "He suggested that the allegations of illegal campaign financing were retaliation for his call as France's president for Qaddafi's \u00a0 removal. Sarkozy was one of the first Western leaders to push for military intervention in Libya in 2011, when Arab Spring pro-democracy protests swept the Arab world.",
      "\"What credibility can be given to such statements marked by the seal of vengeance?\" Sarkozy asked in comments during the trial.",
      "In June, Sarkozy was stripped of his Legion of Honor medal, France's highest civilian award, after his conviction in a separate case.",

      "Fox News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram reports on Democratic reaction to a mass-firing warning from the White House on \u2018Special Report.\u2019",
      "A \"government shutdown\" in the federal wild is a rare sight.",
      "Oh, people talk a lot about government shutdowns. It\u2019s kind of like spotting an elusive species while on safari in Africa. Maybe spying the Aurora Borealis during a trip to Quebec. Perhaps finding yourself in the \"zone of totality\" for a solar eclipse.",
      "Many now toiling on Capitol Hill, serving in the federal government, working for the current Trump administration or as freshmen in Congress have never witnessed a government shutdown. You might not know exactly what to expect. After all, Congress and a presidential administration haven\u2019t had a dalliance with a government shutdown since the 35-day closure in late 2018 and early 2019.",

      "The U.S. Capitol Building is seen from Freedom Plaza on Sept. 7, 2025, in Washington, D.C. (Yasin Ozturk/Anadolu via Getty Images)",
      "Every shutdown is different. It\u2019s a near political certainty that the sides seize up periodically, compelling a government shutdown. Such was the case with the last one. President Donald Trump demanded money for his border wall. The same with the 16-day shutdown over repealing Obamacare in 2013. Or even with a couple of partial but significant shutdowns in late 1995, stretching into 1996, over cuts to health care and environmental spending.",
      "Here\u2019s what we know about past shutdowns:",
      "Federal employees not deemed essential don\u2019t go to work. The military and those in national security remain on the job. However, pay for everyone is in abeyance until the shutdown is settled. Anything not essential stops. National parks and museums usually close. However, the Postal Service continues to operate. Passport processing usually stops. Air traffic controllers continue to work.",
      "But they aren\u2019t paid until there\u2019s a resolution. The government continues to pay Social Security and other retirement or health benefits, but there\u2019s always the possibility that federal workers who process those checks could refuse to come to work if they\u2019re not getting paid and a shutdown drags on.",

      "There\u2019s often a tipping point in each government shutdown that triggers the sides to lay down their political swords and forge an agreement. That returns everyone to work.",
      "In 2013, U.S. Capitol Police officers were still on the job without pay when they got involved in a high-speed chase and shooting that started at the White House and wound up near the Hart Senate Office Building. Officers were injured in the mayhem. That prompted lawmakers from both sides to sober up and re-open the government.",
      "Growing concern about aviation safety helped end a 2019 shutdown. Air traffic controllers worked for more than a month without pay. A small group of controllers elected to stay home. That prompted a temporary shutdown at LaGuardia Airport in New York. Issues also materialized in Newark, N.J., Atlanta and Philadelphia. Fear of a major air disaster prompted lawmakers and the first Trump administration to terminate the shutdown.",
      "Congress is different from the rest of the federal government. That\u2019s because Article I, Section 5 of the Constitution allows it to make its own rules. The House and Senate usually meet during a shutdown. But major committee hearings are often postponed. Lawmakers continue earning their paychecks. That\u2019s because the 27th Amendment prohibits \"varying the compensation\" of lawmakers without an intervening election. Some lawmakers make a point of saying they won\u2019t accept pay during a shutdown. They may try to defer their compensation or even donate it to charity.",
      "The U.S. Capitol building in Washington, D.C. with an American flag flying. (Samuel Corum/Getty Images)",

Some lawmakers determine that only a top aide or two are \"essential.\" Others claim they represent 750,000 people in their congressional district. Therefore, all of their staffers are \"essential.\"",
      "But the institution of Congress makes decisions about Capitol Hill operations.",
      "U.S. Capitol Police stay on duty. But restaurants, cafeterias and barber shops close during a shutdown. Custodians are furloughed. That means garbage and trash around the Capitol isn\u2019t collected. Formal tours of the Capitol are suspended. The flag office \u2014 which handles requests from constituents to fly flags atop the Capitol on behalf of school groups or veterans \u2014 is shuttered.",
      "Who prevails in government shutdowns? It\u2019s hard to gauge the political benefit. It\u2019s widely believed that former President Bill Clinton won his standoff with former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., in 1995-1996. Clinton rode easily to reelection in the fall of 1996. Gingrich seemed to bleed support on Capitol Hill after the shutdown. But Gingrich secured significant spending reforms that ultimately resulted in a federal surplus a few years later. And Republicans maintained control of the House and Senate in 1996.",

      "The 2018-2019 shutdown started even before the House and Senate swore in freshmen elected in the 2018 midterms. So divining a political impact from that particular shutdown is challenging. A host of other factors \u2014 including the COVID-19 pandemic \u2014 were much bigger than the shutdown by the time we got to November 2020. Trump lost reelection that year. Democrats maintained control of the House in 2020, and Democrats narrowly flipped the Senate.",

      "The CyberGuy explains steps you can take to protect yourself from scams.",
      "Phishing attacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated, and the latest scam takes exploitation of a trusted platform to a new level. Instead of sending generic or suspicious-looking emails, attackers are now abusing Apple's iCloud Calendar invite system to deliver phishing content directly from Apple's own email servers.",
      "This clever tactic allows the fraudulent messages to bypass spam filters and appear more legitimate to unsuspecting users. The goal is to alarm you into calling a scammer's fake support number under the pretense of disputing a fraudulent PayPal transaction. Once contacted, you are manipulated into granting remote access to your devices or sharing sensitive data.",

      "NEW EVITE PHISHING SCAM USES EMOTIONAL EVENT INVITATIONS TO TARGET VICTIMS",
      "Scammers exploit Apple\u2019s iCloud Calendar to deliver phishing invites that bypass spam filters. (Brent Lewin/Bloomberg via Getty Images)",
      "How the scam uses iCloud Calendar invites to bypass security",
      "The heart of this scam lies in abusing Apple's official infrastructure to lend credibility to a phishing attempt. Instead of using a suspicious or easily flagged email address, the attackers send calendar invites from Apple's genuine domain, noreply@email.apple.com, as reported by Bleeping Computer.",
      "The attacker embeds the phishing message in the \"Notes\" section of the calendar event, making it appear as a legitimate notification. They send the calendar invite to a Microsoft 365 email address they control, which is part of a mailing list. As a result, the invite is automatically forwarded to multiple real targets, broadening the scam\u2019s reach.",
      "Typically, when emails are forwarded, SPF (Sender Policy Framework) checks fail because the forwarding server isn't listed as an authorized sender. However, Microsoft 365 uses a technique called the Sender Rewriting Scheme (SRS), which rewrites the return path so that the message still passes SPF checks.",
      "This makes the email appear fully legitimate to both the recipient's inbox and automated spam filters. As a result, the message is far more likely to reach a user's inbox without being flagged, increasing the chance the victim will take the bait.",
      "SCAMMERS ARE USING DOCUSIGN EMAILS TO PUSH APPLE PAY FRAUD",
      "Cybercriminals leverage Microsoft 365 forwarding and Apple\u2019s email domain to outsmart filters. (Lindsey Nicholson/UCG/Universal Images Group via Getty Images)",
      "Why these phishing scams are particularly dangerous",
      "What makes this campaign especially dangerous is the sense of legitimacy it conveys. Because Apple\u2019s official servers send the email directly, users are far less likely to suspect foul play. The message itself aims to panic the recipient by falsely claiming a large PayPal transaction occurred without the recipient's consent. The message includes a phone number to \"contact support\" and dispute the charge, but, in reality, it connects the victim to a scammer.",
      "Once the victim calls the number, the scammer poses as a technical support agent and attempts to convince the caller that the computer has been compromised. The next step is typically to ask the victim to download remote access software under the guise of issuing a refund or securing the account.",
      "In reality, this access is used to steal banking information, install malware or exfiltrate personal data. Because the original message passed security checks and seemed credible, victims often don't think twice before acting.",

      "Fraudsters are hijacking iCloud Calendar invites to trick users into calling fake support lines. (Jonathan Raa/NurPhoto via Getty Images)",
      "6 ways you can stay safe from iCloud Calendar scammers",
      "I have listed some useful steps you can take to protect yourself from falling victim to these increasingly sophisticated phishing scams:",
      "If you receive an unexpected calendar invite, especially one containing a strange message or alarming claims, don't open it or respond. Legitimate companies rarely send payment disputes or security warnings through calendar invites. Always verify suspicious claims by logging into your official account directly.",
      "Phishing scams often include phone numbers that connect you to fraudsters posing as support agents. Instead of calling the number in the message, use official contact details found on the company's official website.",
      "Antivirus programs protect your computer from malware and phishing sites by blocking suspicious downloads and warning you about unsafe websites.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe. Also, keeping your antivirus updated ensures it can defend against the latest threats.",
      "Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices at\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Hackers are able to send you these phishing emails because they have your data. Using a personal data removal service helps scrub your personal information from data broker websites. This makes it significantly harder for attackers to gather details about you and craft convincing, targeted phishing attacks.",
      "While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0 They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0 These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0 It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0 By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "A password manager helps you generate and securely store strong, unique passwords for every account. This reduces the risk of reusing weak passwords that scammers can easily exploit to gain unauthorized access to your accounts.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks. If you discover a match, immediately change any reused passwords and secure those accounts with new, unique credentials.",

      "Kurt's key takeaway",
      "Scammers are taking phishing attacks in a disturbing new direction by manipulating trusted platforms to deliver malicious content. The safest approach is to treat any unexpected calendar invite, especially those with alarming messages or strange contact numbers, with extreme caution. Never call the number provided in the message or click on any links. Instead, go directly to official websites or your account's official dashboard to verify suspicious activity.",

The Model A will drive, take off vertically, fly forward, land vertically and maneuver on both roads and runways. Alef will alert other aircraft before its carplanes move on the ground or in the air.

      "Overpayment scams are on the rise, and they can leave victims thousands of dollars in debt. The setup usually looks harmless: someone sends you a check for more than the agreed amount, asks you to forward the difference and disappears once the check bounces. Below are five of the most common overpayment scams you need to watch for today.",

      "FBI WARNS SENIORS ABOUT BILLION-DOLLAR SCAM DRAINING RETIREMENT FUNDS, EXPERT SAYS AI DRIVING IT",
      "1. The dog walker overpayment scam",
      "Bob from Harrison, Ohio, recently shared how he was nearly tricked by a scammer posing as a pet owner. The con began with a request for dog sitting. Bob was promised $250 for care and food, but then a fake check for $4,358 arrived.",
      "The scammer instructed Bob to send $4,000 of it to an \"appliance retailer.\" Why an appliance retailer when the service was for dog sitting? Scammers often use a third party to make the request sound more believable. If they simply asked for the money back, it would raise red flags. By inventing another company, whether a retailer, shipping service or contractor, they add urgency and legitimacy to the story. In reality, that \"retailer\" is just another front that the scammer controls. Here's the catch: the check appears to be real, but it's actually counterfeit. The bank may release the funds temporarily, but once it bounces, you're on the hook for the entire amount.",
      "Making a payment by scanning a QR code with a phone. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "Tip: If you're asked to forward money to a third party, especially one unrelated to the original deal, treat it as a scam. Keep the check and envelope as evidence, and report it to the FTC and your state attorney general.",
      "2. The online marketplace scam",
      "Selling a couch, bike or electronics online? Some buyers \"accidentally\" send too much. They then ask you to return the difference through Zelle, Venmo or a wire transfer. Once the check or payment reverses, you've lost both the product and the money you returned.",
      "Tip: Always insist on verified payment methods. If a buyer pushes you for a refund quickly, walk away.",
      "FAKE AGENT PHONE SCAMS ARE SPREADING FAST ACROSS THE US",
      "Scammers may try to recruit buyers into buying gift cards before a false check they provided bounces. (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "3. The mystery shopper scam",
      "You might get an email or letter offering a job as a mystery shopper. They send you a large check to \"test\" stores by buying gift cards. You're asked to send the gift card numbers back as proof of purchase. After the bank reverses the fake check, you've lost the money you spent on those gift cards.",
      "Tip: Real companies never pay upfront with extra funds or ask for gift card codes by email.",
      "4. The rental deposit scam",
      "Scammers target renters by mailing a check for more than the deposit or rent. They claim it was a mistake and ask you to refund the difference. The check later bounces, leaving you stuck.",
      "Tip: Only accept payments through secure online portals or in person with verified funds.",
      "5. The work-from-home equipment scam",
      "This one lures jobseekers. The \"employer\" sends a large check to buy office equipment, then directs you to forward the extra funds to a vendor. Of course, the check is fake, and the supposed vendor is also the scammer.",
      "Tip: Legitimate employers provide equipment directly or reimburse verified expenses, not through overpayments.",

      "Scammers target remote workers by promising to provide a stipend for work-from-home tech. (iStock)",
      "How to protect yourself from overpayment scams",
      "Now that you've seen how these scams play out, from fake dog sitting gigs to marketplace frauds and bogus job offers, it's clear they all follow the same playbook. Someone sends you too much money and pressures you to forward the extra. That \"extra\" never existed, and once the check bounces, you're left holding the bag. The good news is, there are clear steps you can take to protect yourself and keep your money safe.",
      "Every scam in this article, from the dog walker hoax to rental deposit tricks, begins with an overpayment that looks harmless. If someone pays you more than you're owed, it's not a mistake. It's a scam. Do not respond or send money to any third party. Save the check and envelope as evidence, then report it.",
      "Scammers count on you trusting what you see in your account. In Bob's case, his $4,358 check looked real because the bank showed it as \"available.\" But available isn't the same as cleared. Always ask your bank to confirm when funds are fully verified before you spend a dime.",
      "Urgency is the scammer's strongest weapon. Marketplace fraudsters, renters and fake employers will pressure you to \"fix\" the mistake right away. Slow down, double-check and don't let anyone force you into quick action.",
      "Whether it's for rent, freelance work or selling a used item, scammers prefer paper checks because they're easy to fake. Stick with secure, traceable payment platforms or in-person verified funds. That way, you don't get stuck when a check bounces.",
      "If you receive a suspicious check, save everything: the envelope, emails, texts and any names used. In the dog sitting scam, Bob's saved emails and the scammer's phone number became valuable evidence. This documentation helps law enforcement and protects you if the scammer tries again under another identity.",
      "Scammers often find victims by scraping personal details from online data brokers. That's how they target renters, pet sitters or jobseekers. Using a personal data removal service can limit your exposure and make you harder to target in the first place. While no service can guarantee the complete removal of your data from the internet, a data removal service is really a smart choice.\u00a0They aren\u2019t cheap, and neither is your privacy.\u00a0These services do all the work for you by actively monitoring and systematically erasing your personal information from hundreds of websites.\u00a0It\u2019s what gives me peace of mind and has proven to be the most effective way to erase your personal data from the internet.\u00a0By limiting the information available, you reduce the risk of scammers cross-referencing data from breaches with information they might find on the dark web, making it harder for them to target you.",

      "Get a free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web:\u00a0Cyberguy.com.",
      "Many banks let you set fraud alerts for large deposits or unusual transactions. Turning these on gives you a chance to review suspicious activity before a scammer pressures you into acting on it.",
      "Just like Bob did when he cut contact with the fake pet owner, reporting scams helps protect others. File with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) at reportfraud.ftc.gov and your state attorney general. You can also alert your local police and community groups to stop scammers from targeting someone else.",
      "Kurt's key takeaways",
      "Overpayment scams prey on trust and urgency. They can pop up in online sales, job offers, rental agreements and even friendly community boards. By knowing the warning signs, you can stop scammers before they reach your wallet. Stay cautious whenever you're asked to deposit more than expected and forward the extra. If it sounds strange, it's probably a scam.",

There is a partition between the driving cab and the main cabin. The star of the show is an L-shaped couch that runs over six feet long. And it's not just any couch. It is deep, plush and inviting. It's the kind of seating where you can stretch out on without bumping into a dinette table or a cabinet corner.",

      "Bedtime gets an upgrade",
      "When the sun goes down, that beautiful lounge transforms. A double bed lowers from the ceiling, turning the room into a proper bedroom without having to rearrange cushions or fold anything in a weird way. In the morning, it lifts right back up, making space for coffee and conversation. It is a smooth trick that makes the van feel more like a studio apartment than a rolling compromise. Neither the couch nor the bed needs to sacrifice comfort the way sofa beds typically do.",
      "Laundry on the road",
      "Let's talk about the washer and dryer. Yes, really. A compact Tiny Wash unit is built right into the wardrobe. It handles just enough for a quick refresh, and it actually dries, too. No more hanging socks from cabinet knobs or relying on campground and public laundromats. For extended trips, this little feature is a money saver and an absolute game changer.",

This setup is ready for real cooking, not just boiling water or reheating prepackaged meals. If you like to eat well on the road, this one is built with you in mind.",
      "A bathroom that feels like a bathroom",
      "At the rear of the van, the bathroom doesn't feel like an afterthought. It has a sink, a full-standing shower and a macerating toilet. Instead of cramming it all into a tiny box, Robeta gave it a soft curtain enclosure that keeps the look minimal and the space functional. It feels clean, intentional and refreshingly roomy.",
      "Power to keep you out there",
      "This luxury van even has the chops for off-roading. The Ananya packs a 10-kilowatt-hour EcoFlow power system with stackable batteries and 450 watts of solar. You can stay off the cord for days without blinking. Add in a 160-liter freshwater tank, diesel heat and hot water via Webasto, and the freedom to wander suddenly looks very comfortable. These amenities are remarkable for a camper van this size.",

This means you can explore remote places without giving up the little luxuries that make travel enjoyable. In short, you get the freedom of the open road with the comfort of a high-end apartment.",
      "Stay connected while you roam",
      "When you're traveling in a camper van, nothing kills the vibe faster than losing cell service, especially if you rely on your phone for maps, music, work or keeping in touch. Thankfully, there are two handy solutions to keep you connected: cell phone boosters and mobile hotspots.",
      "Cell phone boosters amplify weak signals from nearby towers, making calls clearer, boosting data speeds and reducing dropped calls. They're ideal for rural drives, national parks or even just passing through patchy areas. Installation typically involves an outside antenna to capture the signal, an amplifier to boost it and an inside antenna to rebroadcast it inside your van.",
      "Mobile hotspots, on the other hand, turn a cellular signal into a private Wi-Fi network for your devices. They're perfect for working remotely from the road, streaming movies or sharing the internet with multiple passengers. Many can run off your phone plan or use a dedicated SIM card for more robust coverage.",
      "Pro tip:\u00a0If your adventures often take you far from towns or highways, a cell phone booster is your best bet for call reliability. If you need strong Wi-Fi for work or entertainment, pair it with a mobile hotspot for the ultimate on-the-road connectivity.",

      "It is a fair concern, Marie. With scams becoming more polished, the line between real and fake accounts is harder to see. Let's break down why fraud is so common on social media, the red flags you should look out for, and the simple habits that can keep you from getting duped.",

      "Why social media is a playground for scammers",
      "Social platforms are built for speed and visibility. Anyone can create an account in minutes, post content instantly and connect with strangers worldwide. This openness is what makes social media engaging, but it is also what makes it ripe for abuse. Fraudsters exploit the fact that posts, comments and messages are consumed quickly and often without much scrutiny.",
      "Verification systems that were once meant to help users identify legitimate accounts have also lost some of their power. On platforms where checkmarks can be purchased, scammers can buy credibility without earning it. Add in the algorithms that reward viral content and sudden spikes in engagement, and you get the perfect environment for fraud to spread unnoticed.",
      "Scammers know people often lower their guard on social media. In these spaces, users share personal details, build emotional ties with influencers and trust posts that look familiar.

      "When people think of scams, they often imagine losing a one-time sum of money. The reality is far more damaging. Clicking a bad link or handing over credentials can snowball into long-term consequences. Once scammers get access to your information, it can be sold on dark web marketplaces, used to open fraudulent accounts or leveraged for identity theft.",

Scammers usually recycle generic profile photos or steal images from real people. Reverse image searches can help you confirm if a photo belongs to someone else.",

      "This is where having strong antivirus software comes in. Even if you accidentally land on a malicious site, a strong antivirus can block harmful downloads and warn you before malware runs. Think of it as a safety net for moments when curiosity gets the better of you.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices.

      "A password manager can be a lifesaver here. It only fills in your login details on the genuine site you have saved. If it does not recognize the page, that is a red flag that you are looking at a fake. On top of that, a password manager makes it easier to use strong, unique passwords for each account, which limits damage if one gets compromised.",
      "Next, see if your email has been exposed in past breaches. Our No. 1 password manager pick includes a built-in breach scanner that checks whether your email address or passwords have appeared in known leaks.

      "The Paris Solar-Battery Park reduces reliance on fossil fuels while strengthening Wisconsin's grid. It also provides a model other states can follow.",

      "Earlier this year, Australian police arrested a passenger for running a malicious Wi-Fi network both at an airport and during a flight. The setup looked just like the airline's own Wi-Fi service, but it wasn't. Instead, it was what cybersecurity researchers call an \"evil twin,\" a fake hotspot designed to trick people into handing over their credentials.",
      "The idea isn't new, but the setting is. For years, fake Wi-Fi networks have been a common trick in cafes, hotels, and airports. What makes this case stand out is that the attacker took it to the skies, exploiting the growing reliance on in-flight Wi-Fi for entertainment and internet access.",

      "What is an evil twin Wi-Fi attack?",
      "An evil twin hotspot is a wireless network that impersonates a legitimate one by copying its name, also known as the SSID. When multiple networks with the same name exist, your phone or laptop often connects to the one with the stronger signal, which is usually the attacker's.",
      "Travelers check their phones while navigating delays and flight cancellations at the Austin-Bergstrom International Airport on July 19, 2024, in Austin, Texas. (Brandon Bell/Getty Images)",
      "Once connected, victims are often redirected to a fake login or landing page. In this case, the malicious portal requested passengers' email addresses, passwords, or even social media credentials under the pretense of granting access to the airline's entertainment system. The stolen information could then be used for account takeovers, identity theft, or further attacks.",
      "Why travel Wi-Fi is a prime target",
      "Travel creates a perfect storm for these kinds of attacks. Whether you're in a hotel, airport, cruise ship or airplane, you often have limited choices for getting online. Mobile data may be patchy or expensive, which pushes people toward the available Wi-Fi networks. Because these services feel official and are tied to trusted brands, travelers tend to assume they're safe and let their guard down when login requests pop up.",
      "Another trend adds to the risk. Travel providers are increasingly moving entertainment and services onto personal devices instead of offering built-in options. Airlines replace seatback screens with streaming portals, cruise lines promote app-based services and hotels direct guests to digital check-in platforms. All of these require a Wi-Fi connection, which means more people are logging on than ever before.",

      "YOUR DISCARDED LUGGAGE TAGS ARE WORTH MONEY TO SCAMMERS",
      "Why you need a VPN for in-flight Wi-Fi security",
      "One of the best defenses against rogue Wi-Fi is a Virtual Private Network, or VPN. A VPN creates an encrypted tunnel between your device and the internet, making it far harder for attackers to intercept your data even if you connect to the wrong hotspot.",
      "There is a catch, though. In-flight Wi-Fi systems often require you to disable your VPN temporarily to access the onboard portal. Even then, a VPN remains an important safeguard. Once you have cleared the login page and, if you have paid, connected to the internet, enabling your VPN ensures that any browsing, messaging, or app traffic stays private.",

      "A VPN is important, but it isn't the only defense you should rely on. Here are some other ways to stay safe when connecting midair:",
      "Before you even think about connecting to in-flight Wi-Fi, make sure your device has a strong antivirus installed. It's your first line of defense against malicious sites and apps that attackers may try to push through fake portals. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe.",

      "Most phones and laptops are set to reconnect automatically to familiar networks. This makes it easier for a fake hotspot with the same name to trick your device. Before you board, switch off auto-connect and manually choose the correct airline Wi-Fi.",
      "When browsing in-flight, check for the padlock icon in your browser's address bar. HTTPS encrypts the connection between your device and the website, making it harder for attackers on public Wi-Fi to intercept your data.",
      "Even with precautions, in-flight Wi-Fi should be treated as untrusted. Avoid logging in to sensitive accounts like online banking or work systems. Stick to light browsing, streaming or messaging until you're back on a secure connection.",
      "Outdated operating systems and apps often have security holes attackers exploit. Before your trip, install the latest updates on your phone, tablet or laptop. Many updates include security patches that protect you against known vulnerabilities.",
      "When possible, switch your device to airplane mode and then enable only Wi-Fi. This reduces exposure from other radios (like Bluetooth or cellular roaming) that attackers sometimes target on flights.",
      "Some fake in-flight portals use pop-ups or redirects designed to trick you into entering login details or clicking on malicious links. If a page asks for unnecessary information, like your full Social Security number, banking details or unrelated logins, treat it as a red flag. Close the page immediately and don\u2019t click.",

      "A young Gazan boy dubbed \"Amir,\" who traveled to a Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) distribution site and was reported as having been killed by Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) in May, has been found alive hiding out with his mother.",
      "Both were safely extracted from the Gaza Strip earlier this month, though the location has not been disclosed for their security.",
      "The boy, whose full name was later discovered to be Abdul Rahim Muhammad Hamden, nicknamed Abboud, and who is 8 years old but will turn 9 in October, appeared with his mother, Najlaa, at GHF Secure Distribution Site (SDS) 3 late last month in a heavy disguise to avoid detection, a GHF representative involved in the operation confirmed to Fox News Digital.",
      "An extensive internal operation by the GHF was launched to uncover the identity of the boy in late July after a former GHF employee, Anthony Aguilar, a 25-year veteran of the U.S. Army and retired Green Beret Lt. Col. turned alleged \"whistleblower,\" gave a series of explosive interviews in which he said a 10-year-old boy he called Amir had been killed by IDF forces after leaving a GHF aid site on May 28.",

      "In his account, Aguilar showed images taken using his cellphone of the boy approaching himself and another contractor clutching bags of food and barefoot.",
      "The former Green Beret turned GHF contractor for UG Solutions \u2014 a subcontractor of the GHF which received $30 million in U.S. government funding to support its \"critical work\" \u2014 described to multiple outlets an emotional encounter he had had with the Palestinian child, in which he claimed the boy had kissed his hand, touched Aguilar's face, and thanked him for the supplies of rice and lentils he had found.",
      "But the footage taken by Aguilar and handed over to GHF officials before it was obtained by Fox News Digital, did not show this interaction ever took place.",
      "The GHF contested Aguilar's account on several fronts and pointed out the hand the boy kissed was that of Aguilar's colleague standing to his left, which the footage also showed.",
      "Abdul Rahim Muhammad Hamden and his mother appeared at the GHF SDS 3 ending a weeks-long search for him on Aug. 23, 2025. (Gaza Humanitarian Foundation)",
      "When asked by Fox News Digital why he said the boy engaged with him in this manner despite what the footage shows, he maintained his story and said, \"Amir kissed my right hand. He kissed my forehead, too. He thanked us and told us he was very hungry and thankful.\"",
      "In multiple interviews with various outlets, Aguilar described how the boy then returned to the group where other Palestinians were gathered at the distribution site before they were then dispersed by GHF contractors through the use of pepper spray, tear gas, stun grenades and bullets fired into the air, forcing them to flee the compound.",
      "However, Fox News Digital was told that the GHF did not yet have access to non-lethal arms in the early days of the operations, according to a GHF colleague who was aware of Aguilar's position at SDS 3 on May 28.",
      "Additionally, Aguilar claimed that once the Palestinian civilians had been pushed out of the SDS center, IDF forces then opened fire on the crowd and killed \"Amir,\" along with other Palestinians. He reiterated this claim in an interview late last month in which he had told Dialogue Works that the boy had received a \"shot to the torso, a shot to the leg \u2014 dead.\"",
      "But the GHF challenged Aguilar\u2019s story \u2014 including the location of where he claimed the event had occurred.",
      "In one of his first accounts of the incident on July 29 to Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., Aguilar claimed the killing happened first outside GHF aid site SDS 1 before telling MSNBC on Aug. 2 that the shooting happened near SDS 2, and then telling Dialogue Works last month the events had occurred outside SDS 3.",
      "On Sept. 9, Chris Hayes gave an update on the report, telling viewers that the boy who was reported dead was, in fact, found to be alive. He said NBC producers had confirmed that the boy was now out of Gaza in an unnamed country.",
      "Multiple GHF sources confirmed that no such incident was reported at or outside SDS 1 or SDS 3, and SDS 2 was not yet even operational on May 28.",
      "Fox News Digital confirmed in speaking with multiple sources that Aguilar was on SDS 3 on May 28.",
      "Abdul Rahim Muhammad Hamden, 8 years old, has been discovered with his mother in the Gaza Strip following a GHF investigation that concluded when they appeared as Secure Distribution Site (SDS) 3 on Aug. 23, 2025. (Gaza Humanitarian Foundation\u00a0)",
      "In comments to Fox News Digital, Aguilar said, \"I sincerely, and with bated breath and joy, hope that Amir is alive. I\u2019ve always said as much. I have been in contact with his family and others, and Amir\u2019s family is not aware that he is alive, only that he is 'gone.'",
      "\"I have always said that due to GHF and IDF restrictions from UG S[olutions] personnel moving beyond the concentration camp style corals extending from the North entrance, that I was NOT, say again, NOT able to verify Amir\u2019s death,\" he said. \"But I did in fact see Palestinians gunned down by IDF machine gun fire at the intersection of the SDS 3 exit and the military corridor, north of SDS 3, where an IDF Merkava tank was located.\"",
      "ISRAEL SAYS UN MISLEADS WORLD AS GAZA AID STOLEN AND DIVERTED FROM CIVILIANS",
      "Abboud\u2019s stepmother also later told the GHF that the boy hadn't gone missing until July 28, two months after Aguilar said he had been killed.",
      "Abboud ran away to be with his birth mother on July 28 amid a rift with his stepmother's family, whose custody he was put in following the death of his father, per Palestinian law.",
      "A GHF representative involved in the operation explained the search to find Abboud became not only a matter necessary to uncover what allegedly happened on May 28, but because there was increasing concern regarding threats posed by Hamas as traction picked up around the story.",
      "The official explained that Hamas had a vested interest in making sure this child was not found, as it would discredit Aguilar\u2019s story that a Palestinian boy had been gunned down by Israeli forces outside a GHF site.",
      "Ultimately, the GHF were able to locate the boy and his birth mother by speaking with local Palestinians and later, a family member who agreed to speak with the team before connecting them with Najlaa.",
      "ISRAEL, HAMAS TALKS DRAG AS AID GROUP CHAIR TELLS UN TO STOP ACTING LIKE THE \u2018MAFIA\u2019",
      "She then brought Abboud to the GHF site so that she, her son and four other male family members whose identities Fox News Digital has agreed to conceal, could be extracted from the Gaza Strip, after at least one of the male family members received direct threats from the Hamas terrorist network.",
      "In an interview shared with Fox News Digital, Najlaa is seen sitting with Abboud and another young male, who was also set to be extracted with them, speaking with GHF officials.",
      "In the video, which Fox News Digital did not post to protect multiple identities, Abboud refers to Najlaa as his \"mama\" and, according to a translation of the comments, he says he is happy to be with her while smiling and sitting next to her.",
      "The identities of Abboud, his mother and his relatives were verified by GHF using facial recognition software that compared the images of the boy with those captured by Aguilar.",
      "Facial recognition software, biometric data and the death certificate of Abboud\u2019s father were used by GHF to verify the family members' identities and relationships, and were also shared with Fox News Digital.",
      "Abboud also brought the shirt he was wearing in the footage taken by Aguilar, which is what the former GHF contractor said the boy was wearing when he was allegedly gunned down.",
      "Abdul Rahim Muhammad Hamden, 8 years old, arrived with the T-shirt he was wearing on May 28, 2025, in the footage taken by Anthony Aguilar at GHF Secure Distribution Site (SDS) 3 on Aug. 23, 2025. (Gaza Humanitarian Foundation\u00a0)",
      "Aguilar did not respond to Fox News Digital regarding the intact shirt, and said, \"The new pictures are not Amir.\"",
      "When pressed on where specifically he thought there were discrepancies in the images of the boy, he said, \"Amir in my photos had a scar on his left clavicle. The boy featured by GHF does not. The Amir in my photos from SDS 3, does not have a scar on the right side of his forehead as the GHF\u2019s photos show.\"",
      "The GHF representative confirmed that the boy's scars were in fact used to verify his identity.",
      "\"I believe that is a boy of similar appearance,\" Aguilar said, noting he believes the outcome of the investigation \"is a lie.\"",
      "The GHF spokesperson for the organization, Chapin Fay, called Aguilar's story regarding the boy and his alleged murder by the IDF \"false\" during a press conference earlier this month.",
      "Aguilar told Fox News Digital that the GHF statements made against him during a July 29 press conference were \"libel and slanderous.\"",
      "Fay described him as a \"disgruntled former employee\" who was \"terminated for cause\" after he engaged in \"volatile conflicts with staff and erratic behavior.\"",
      "According to text messages shared with Fox News Digital, Aguilar also did not handle being removed from his role well, and threatened in a text exchange with a GHF official that he \"could be your best friend, or your worst nightmare\" if they didn\u2019t \"put [him] back to work.\"",

      "\"Since termination, Mr. Aguilar has spread a false narrative to media outlets around the world, all at the same time begging UG Solutions to hire him back,\" Panzer added. \"Mr. Aguilar\u2019s activities in the last several weeks make clear that he\u2019s making good on his threats to, in his own words\u2026be UG Solutions\u2019s \u2018worst nightmare\u2019 if they didn\u2019t hire him back.\"",

      "Economic anxiety is high. The August jobs report showed 22,000 new jobs \u2014 a paltry total compared to recent years. Prices on a variety of goods and services rose more than expected in August, with year-over-year inflation growing to 2.9%, the highest rate since January.",
      "The cost of household staples like coffee and beef are soaring even as the rise in food prices has slowed from the decades-high inflation seen in 2022. Overall, grocery prices were up 2.7% in August compared to a year earlier, the biggest increase in two years. Electricity costs are rising, too, driven in part by the growth of AI data centers. The August NBC News poll found that 45% of voters said rising costs are their top economic concern.",
      "Trump has sought to reshape much of the economy, with sweeping tariffs, large tax cuts and pressure on the Federal Reserve and private companies. There are economic bright spots Trump and his allies have promoted: The stock market has seen substantial gains, in part because of the AI boom that Trump\u2019s administration has sought to bolster. U.S. gross domestic product grew at a 3.8% annual pace between April and June after shrinking earlier this year, the Department of Commerce said in its second upward revision on Thursday.",
      "The White House argued that the economy is in better shape than other measures indicate, pointing to wage increases, a lower rate of inflation than in Biden\u2019s term, a job market they say favors native-born workers, and surging stock, among other measures. The economy, some allies say, can't turn on a dime.",
      "\u201cJoe Biden\u2019s reckless policies destroyed the economy, but President Trump is fixing it in record time to usher in the Golden Age of America \u2014 inflation has cooled, wages are on the rise, real consumer spending rose in July, manufacturing jobs are being reshored, and over half a million good-paying jobs have been created in the private sector,\u201d White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said, adding that Americans \u201cwill continue to feel economic relief in the months ahead as \u2026 massive tax cuts, deregulation, and energy dominance continue to materialize.\u201d",
      "Yet his opponents say that the president is now trying to shift attention away from the topic. At a White House event on Monday about autism, Trump discouraged reporters from talking about the economy.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s just make it on this subject,\u201d Trump said, referring to the autism announcement. \u201cI\u2019d rather not talk about some nonsense on the economy. I will say this: The economy is unbelievable.\u201d",
      "The headwinds have cut into what was long one of Trump\u2019s advantages: Voters trusted him to strengthen the economy. It was a dynamic that helped boost his campaign with voters who were angry with price increases under President Joe Biden and wanted a return to Trump\u2019s pre-Covid economy.",
      "Recent polls show voters have soured on Trump\u2019s handling of the economy. A Fox News poll this month found that 52% of voters believe the administration has made the economy worse \u2014 the same number who said in January the Biden administration was doing so. Trump\u2019s performance on cost of living was his worst issue, with 67% of voters disapproving. What\u2019s more, 63% disapprove of his handling of tariffs, and 60% of his economic efforts.",
      "Now, Democrats are seeking to unify around an economic message they think can bring together their fractured party.  Republicans, though, expressed confidence that once their \u201cbig, beautiful bill\u201d starts to sink in, and as uncertainty around tariffs dies down, economic sentiment will turn in their favor.",
      "Michigan state Sen. Mallory McMorrow, a Democratic Senate candidate, said she\u2019s hearing economic concerns \u201call over the state right now.\u201d",
      "\u201cI\u2019m hearing this most acutely with young people, people who might have recently graduated from college, have degrees, who just cannot find a job right now, and [are] certainly feeling the tightening economy, but also the impacts of AI,\u201d McMorrow said, adding that she is telling people: \u201cThis is not a global pandemic that we\u2019re in right now. This is also not a recession like we saw in 2007-09. The inflation that we are seeing right now is entirely man-made, and it\u2019s caused by Donald Trump.\u201d",
      "'Waiting and seeing'",
      "There are other potential problems for Republicans.",
      "Consumer spending is holding steady but is being driven by the top 10% of earners. Young men \u2014 a population that played a huge role in Trump\u2019s victory \u2014 have been hit hard in the slowing job market. Labor Department data showed initial jobless claims for the week ending Sept. 6 jumped by 263,000 \u2014 the most since October 2021 \u2014 though initial jobless claims fell to 218,000 for the week ending Sept. 20.",
      "Americans\u2019 view of capitalism is falling too. A Gallup survey this month showed 54% of Americans hold a positive view of the economic system, the lowest level the poll has recorded.",
      "\u201cThere is a big cohort of people who voted for Donald Trump because they really, sincerely believed that he was going to bring down the price of their daily necessities,\u201d Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, said. \u201cAnd almost everything is significantly more expensive.\u201d",
      "Sen. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyo., said it\u2019s too early to grade Republicans\u2019 performance on lowering costs because \u201cthe economy doesn\u2019t move on a dime.\u201d But she acknowledged that they need to make tangible progress by the 2026 midterms.",
      "\u201cThe problem right now is the people who are doing well, the people who are consuming the most, are the very wealthy,\u201d Lummis said. \u201cIt is the middle class and lower middle class that is not buying because their salaries aren\u2019t keeping up with inflation or interest rates are too high to buy a home. They\u2019re treading water, and so we have to focus on the middle class in order to alleviate concerns about a bad outcome in the 2026 elections.\u201d",
      "The White House has also highlighted a major revision this month from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showing job growth was much slower than originally reported between April 2024 and March 2025, saying it shows slower job growth dates back to Biden. Trump fired the head of the BLS \u2014 and nominated a MAGA ally in her place \u2014 after a particularly weak July jobs report.",
      "There has been a steep decline in the immigrant workforce under Trump\u2019s aggressive deportation agenda. Vice President JD Vance and other conservatives have said the exodus of foreign-born workers can explain the weaker job growth, but that it creates more employment opportunities for native-born Americans. The Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank, argued Trump\u2019s job market has been worse for U.S.-born workers, pointing to BLS data showing an increased unemployment rate among this group.",
      "Jared Bernstein, chair of the Council of Economic Advisers under Biden, said he sees the economy \u201cslowing in ways that are concerning\u201d and warned of the potential for stagflation.",
      "\u201cEmployers and businesses are in a bit of a hiring freeze and investment freeze,\u201d Bernstein said. \u201cThey\u2019re sitting on their hands, waiting and seeing what\u2019s going to come of the trade war, the deportations, the chaos, the Federal Reserve badgering, the DOGE cuts. It\u2019s all unsettling for businesses who like a much calmer environment as a backdrop.\u201d",
      "In a move Trump long pushed for, the Federal Reserve last week cut interest rates by 0.2 percentage points. In his news conference after lowering interest rates, Fed Chair Jerome Powell tied the cut directly to issues in the labor market.",
      "\u201cYou see people who are sort of more at the margins, and younger people, minorities are having a hard time finding jobs,\u201d Powell said.",
      "He added that the economy is being bolstered by \u201cunusually large amounts of economic activity through the AI build-out and corporate investment.\u201d And he said that while consumer spending numbers exceeded expectations, they appear skewed toward high earners.",
      "\u201cSo it\u2019s not a bad economy or anything like that,\u201d Powell said, adding: \u201cBut from a policy standpoint \u2026 of what we\u2019re trying to accomplish, it\u2019s challenging to know what to do.\u201d",
      "Trump's tariffs",
      "Much of the existing economic uncertainty has centered on the president\u2019s tariff agenda. The dust appears to be more settled now: Some tariffs have been lowered, new trade agreements have been reached with key partners, and a number of categories, including some electronics, have been exempted.",
      "A White House official said uncertainty on passage of the \u201cbig, beautiful bill\u201d and on tariffs has \u201clargely been resolved.\u201d",
      "\u201cYou can now plan around what the tariff rate is going to be,\u201d this person said. \u201cWe\u2019re not in flux anymore.\u201d",
      "So far, Trump\u2019s vow to bring manufacturing jobs back to the U.S. has yet to materialize, with industry continuing to cut back on the number of workers. The U.S. lost 12,000 manufacturing jobs in August amid a wider slowdown in the labor market, according to BLS data. The Trump administration has pointed to manufacturing investments, noting factories can\u2019t open overnight.",
      "Trump\u2019s tariffs have weighed on manufacturing companies now having to pay tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, along with imported machinery and parts. Companies have also continued to ramp up automation, requiring fewer workers to make the same amount of goods.",
      "Federal Reserve data released Sept. 16 showed a mixed picture for the manufacturing sector last month, with factory production ticking up in August after declining in July. The increase was driven by a rebound in auto production while other areas, like companies making machinery and metal products, saw declines.",
      "Steve Moore, a senior economic adviser to Trump in his first term, believes the economy is in a good spot, pointing to similar data points as the White House. But he cautioned that \u201cat some point, some of these [tariff] costs are going to be passed down to consumers, no question about it,\u201d though he said the country could still see benefits down the road.",
      "There is an economic uncertainty that has the president and his allies concerned: a case before the Supreme Court that could lead to his tariffs being overturned. Moore said the White House is \u201cvery keyed into\u201d the case.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s going to be disruptive,\u201d Moore said if the court overturns the tariffs. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t think anybody really knows what would happen. Will they have to return the money to the people who paid that? Will they pay the taxes? And what happens to trade deals? It would be havoc.\u201d",
      "'You can't fool people on the economy'",
      "Democrats want to frame a straightforward economic argument for the midterm elections: Trump promised to lower prices immediately upon taking office, and yet costs are rising.",
      "\u201cWhat we must do is not just compare this economy to Biden\u2019s,\u201d Beyer said, \u201cbut compare it to what Trump said he was going to do.\u201d",
      "In a memo marking Trump\u2019s first six months in office, the Democratic National Committee mentioned lowering prices as the top promise Trump had broken upon taking office. A memo this month from the Bipartisan Cost Coalition, an anti-Trump group launched by former aides to Biden and President George W. Bush, said 2026 candidates \u201ccan succeed in this environment by having the courage to challenge Trump\u2019s dishonest narratives and draw a line between chaos and the rising cost of living.\u201d",
      "Sen. Mike Rounds, R-S.D., said GOP prospects in 2026 will turn on whether they can sell Trump\u2019s \u201cbig, beautiful bill\u201d and improve voters\u2019 confidence in their finances.",
      "Republicans are eager to promote the bill\u2019s new tax cuts and credits, including tax breaks on overtime and tipped wages as well as expensing and deduction provisions they believe will encourage new investment in the U.S. and grow the job market.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s going to depend on whether or not we can actually see the benefits and get the information on the benefits out about what the reconciliation package did,\u201d Rounds said.",
      "So far, Trump himself has not taken to the trail to promote the landmark legislation, though Vice President JD Vance has been visiting key battlegrounds to do so.",
      "The legislation\u2019s cuts to health insurance programs already threaten hundreds of thousands of jobs. This month, a hospital chain in Virginia announced a consolidation it said is in part necessitated by \u201cthe One Big Beautiful Bill Act and the resulting realities for healthcare delivery.\u201d",
      "A Republican operative working on Senate races said Trump\u2019s legislative package will give business leaders certainty on taxes over the next few years. But this person was mindful of how the job market looks now, particularly for younger voters struggling to find entry-level jobs.",
      "\u201cTrump realizes that you really need to gas this thing up to get people hiring and get confidence in the market,\u201d this person said. \u201cSo it\u2019s not an overnight switch that the president could flip to get people hiring young men into the economy.\u201d",
      "A Washington Post-Ipsos poll conducted this month found that while just 40% of voters approved of Trump\u2019s handling of the economy, Republicans still held a 7-point edge over Democrats on which party voters trust more on the issue.",
      "Pennsylvania\u2019s new Democratic Party Chairman Eugene DePasquale said he wants to get Keystone State Democrats to \u201cfocus like a laser\u201d on economic issues.",
      "\u201cBut it\u2019s one thing to have people be upset about Trump,\u201d DePasquale said. \u201cIt\u2019s another thing for them to vote for us. \u2026 We\u2019ve also got to show we\u2019re listening and putting real ideas on the table to try to win him back.\u201d",
      "Moore said Republicans will need \u201cto remind people of how bad things were under Biden\u201d while framing the president\u2019s signature legislation not as a tax cut but as a job creation bill.",
      "\u201cLook, you can\u2019t fool people on the economy,\u201d Moore said. \u201cPeople know what\u2019s going on. They know what it costs to buy groceries. They know what jobs are available. When Biden was saying, \u2018Oh, [inflation is] transitory,\u2019 and so on, it didn\u2019t fool people. So these policies have to be shown to be working.\u201d"

      "For people who rely on certain prescription drugs, including weight loss, asthma and cancer medications, President Donald Trump\u2019s post announcing 100% tariffs on foreign brand-name drugs offers little clarity on when \u2014 or if \u2014 medications might see price hikes.",
      "\u201cStarting October 1st, 2025, we will be imposing a 100% Tariff on any branded or patented Pharmaceutical Product, unless a Company IS BUILDING their Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Plant in America,\u201d Trump said on Truth Social late Thursday. \u201c\u2018IS BUILDING\u2019 will be defined as, \u2018breaking ground\u2019 and/or \u2018under construction.\u2019 There will, therefore, be no Tariff on these Pharmaceutical Products if construction has started.\u201d",
      "Experts say Trump\u2019s post raises a lot of questions. Here are five major ones.",
      "What drugs will be impacted?",
      "Trump\u2019s post doesn\u2019t specify whether brand-name drugmakers with an existing U.S. plant would be exempt, whether that exemption would include all their products, or whether it would only be for the drugs manufactured at the U.S. site.",
      "Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly, makers of the weight loss drugs Wegovy and Zepound, respectively, have announced plans to invest in U.S. manufacturing. But it\u2019s unclear if their intent to invest will warrant an exemption.",
      "On Tuesday, Lilly announced plans for a $6.5 billion manufacturing facility in Houston that will produce Zepbound and its other GLP-1 drug, Mounjaro, following a recent commitment to build a $5 billion plant near Richmond, Virginia. Novo Nordisk, a Danish company, said in June it would spend $4.1 billion to construct a second GLP-1 fill-finish plant in Clayton, North Carolina.",
      "AstraZeneca, which makes the asthma drug Symbicort, also announced in July that it will invest $50 billion over the next five years to expand its research and development and manufacturing footprint in the U.S.",
      "Many other popular brand-name drugs, however, are primarily manufactured overseas, particularly in Europe, said Rena Conti, an associate professor at Boston University\u2019s Questrom School of Business.",
      "Botox, made by Allergen, and the cancer drug Keytruda from drugmaker Merck are made in Ireland. (Keytruda\u2019s manufacturing has increasingly moved to the United States in recent years, but it\u2019s not clear if that would earn an exemption from Trump\u2019s tariffs.)",
      "Others, including some for blood and lung cancers, as well as vaccines, are made in places like India and China, Conti said.",
      "\u201cI think what\u2019s most at risk here are branded products that come from China and India,\u201d she said. The E.U. and Japan already have trade agreements in place that cover pharmaceuticals, she added, and it\u2019s unclear whether the new tariff will supersede that.",
      "Will patients see prices increase?",
      "Only 1 in 10 of the prescriptions filled in the U.S. are for brand-name drugs; the vast majority are for generics, which are much cheaper and will not be affected by these tariffs.",
      "Whether patients see price increases will depend on how many drugmakers receive exemptions \u2014 and on whether companies choose to pass those costs on to patients at the pharmacy counter, said Dr. Aaron Kesselheim, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. \u200b\u200b",
      "\u201cUltimately, tariffs are taxes on patients,\u201d Kesselheim said, \u201cand to the extent that drug companies see increases in cost due to tariffs, they will pass those costs on to patients.\u201d",
      "Some companies may decide not to pass the costs along. So far, the 15% tariffs on imports from the E.U. haven\u2019t translated into big price hikes for U.S. patients, Conti noted. To be sure, a 100% tariff would be far more costly for a company.",
      "Price hikes may not start right away, as drugmakers find out whether they qualify for an exemption. There also might be a lag since U.S. law prevents drugmakers from increasing the price of drugs faster than inflation.",
      "\u201cWhat if you\u2019re doing updates to the plant you currently have? What if you\u2019re planning a facility? Do those count?\u201d Kesselheim said. \u201cIt\u2019s all very ambiguous.\u201d",
      "Some patients may not notice additional price hikes at all, given how costly brand-name drugs already are in the U.S., said Arthur Caplan, the head of the Division of Medical Ethics at NYU Langone Medical Center in New York City.",
      "\u201cI can certainly predict that some patients will immediately feel price increases that will shock them on some of these drugs,\u201d Caplan said.",
      "Could insurers absorb the costs?",
      "Insurers and middlemen, known as pharmacy benefit managers, could try to negotiate drugmakers or absorb some of the tariff-related costs, Caplan said.",
      "It\u2019s more likely, however, that they\u2019d pass it on to patients in the short term, potentially in the form of a larger copay, he said.",
      "It\u2019s not only patients with private insurance that should be worried about price hikes, Kesselheim said. Those who get their drugs covered through government health programs could also see price increases.",
      "\u201cThe government is the largest purchaser of prescription drugs in the market, through Medicare, Medicaid and the VA, so it\u2019s really the government or government payers that are going to see the largest impact on price increases,\u201d he said.",
      "Will tariffs spur more U.S. drug manufacturing?",
      "It\u2019s unlikely, Kesselheim said. The decision to build a plant \u201cis a complicated and expensive one\u201d that requires several regulatory hurdles and years of planning.",
      "Conti noted that by the time new manufacturing plants are completed, Trump would likely be out of office.",
      "\u201cIt is somewhere between two years and five years to get new production facilities built,\u201d she said, \u201cand it can be in the millions of dollars depending on whether the product that you\u2019re making is a small molecule drug or a biologic.\u201d",
      "Even putting money back into an existing plant isn\u2019t quick.",
      "\u201cIf you want to switch a line or retool a factory to make a product, then we\u2019re talking about somewhere between 18 to 36 months to do that,\u201d Conti said, \u201cbecause you have to show the U.S. regulator that you can make it at this factory at scale, and the product is what it says it is, or is high quality and meets the quality standards of the U.S.\u201d",
      "In a statement, Alex Schriver, a spokesperson for the trade group the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, said \u201cmost innovative medicines prescribed in America are already made in America\u201d and companies continue to invest in the U.S.",
      "\u201cTariffs risk those plans because every dollar spent on tariffs is a dollar that cannot be invested in American manufacturing or the development of future treatments and cures,\u201d Schriver said. \u201cMedicines have historically been exempt from tariffs because they raise costs and could lead to shortages.\u201d",
      "What about shortages?",
      "If Trump keeps his focus solely on brand-name drugs, U.S. patients are unlikely to face shortages, Kesselheim said.",
      "\u201cTheir profits are just so, so far beyond this tariff cost that they could probably be OK or raise the prices of the drugs,\u201d he said. \u201cThey would probably not stop production as a result.\u201d",
      "But that excludes, he added, some smaller companies who may make niche brand-name products and may not have the resources to take on the extra costs. If tariffs extend to generics, the risk is far greater, Caplan added.",
      "Unlike brand-name drugs, generic drugs are typically sold at close to the cost they\u2019re made, he said, which makes it difficult for companies to justify the cost of building a new facility. They\u2019d likely be forced to walk away from production or close their plants altogether."

      "While Kratsios shot down the idea of combined AI governance, President Donald Trump said in his speech to the General Assembly on Tuesday that the White House will be \u201cpioneering an AI verification system that everyone can trust\u201d to enforce the Biological Weapons Convention.",
      "\u201cHopefully, the U.N. can play a constructive role, and it will also be one of the early projects under AI,\u201d Trump said. AI \u201ccould be one of the great things ever, but it also can be dangerous, but it can be put to tremendous use and tremendous good.\u201d.",
      "In a statement to NBC News, a State Department spokesperson said, \u201cThe United States supports like-minded nations working together to encourage the development of AI in line with our shared values. The US position in international bodies is to vigorously advocate for international AI governance approaches that promote innovation, reflect American values, and counter authoritarian influence.\u201d",
      "The comments rejecting collaborative efforts around AI governance stood in stark contrast to many of the initiatives being launched at the General Assembly.",
      "On Thursday, the U.N. introduced the Global Dialogue on AI Governance, the U.N.\u2019s first body dedicated to AI governance involving all member states. U.N. Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said the body would \u201clay the cornerstones of a global AI ecosystem that can keep pace with the fastest-moving technology in human history.\u201d Speaking after Guterres, Nobel Prize recipient Daron Acemoglu outlined the growing stakes of AI\u2019s rapid development, arguing that \u201cAI is the biggest threat that humanity has faced.\u201d",
      "But in an interview with NBC News, Amandeep Singh Gill, the U.N.\u2019s special envoy for digital and emerging technologies, told NBC News that the United States\u2019 critical perception of the U.N.\u2019s role in international AI governance was misconstrued.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s a misrepresentation to say that the U.N. is somehow getting into the regulation of AI,\u201d Gill said. \u201cThese are not top-down power grabs in terms of regulation. The regulation stays where regulation can be done in sovereign jurisdictions.\u201d",
      "Instead, the U.N.\u2019s mechanisms \u201cwill provide platforms for international cooperation on AI governance,\u201d Gill said.",
      "In remarks immediately following Kratsios\u2019 comments, China\u2019s Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Ma Zhaoxu said, \u201cIt is vital to jointly foster an open, inclusive, fair and nondiscriminatory environment for technological development and firmly oppose unilateralism and protectionism.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe support the U.N. playing a central role in AI governance,\u201d Ma said.",
      "One day after Kratsios\u2019 remarks at the Security Council, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez seemed to push back on Kratsios and gave full-throated support for international cooperation on AI and the U.N.\u2019s role in AI governance.",
      "\u201cWe need to coordinate a shared vision of AI at a global level, with the U.N. as the legitimate and inclusive forum to forge consensus around common interests,\u201d S\u00e1nchez said. \u201cThe time is now, when multilateralism is being most questioned and attacked, that we need to reaffirm how suitable it is in addressing challenges such as those represented by AI.\u201d",
      "Reacting to the week\u2019s developments, Renan Araujo, director of programs for the Washington, D.C.-based Institute for AI Policy and Strategy, told NBC News that \u201cno one wants to see a burdensome, bureaucratic governance structure, and the U.S. has succeeded in starting bilateral and minilateral coalitions. At the same time, we should expect AI-related challenges to become more transnational in nature as AI capabilities become more advanced.\u201d",
      "This is not the first time the U.N. has addressed AI, having passed the Global Digital Compact last year. The compact laid the foundation for the AI dialogue and for an independent international scientific panel to evaluate AI\u2019s abilities, risks and pathways forward. Guterres announced that nominations to this panel are now open.",
      "While Thursday\u2019s event marked the launch of the global dialogue and panel, the dialogue will have its first full meeting in Geneva in summer 2026, in tandem with the International Telecommunication Union\u2019s annual AI for Good summit. The dialogue\u2019s exact functions and first actions will be charted out over the coming months."

    "story": [
      "Jesse Williams is stepping out of the \u201cGrey\u2019s\u201d and into the light with his new Prime Video series, \u201cHotel Costiera.\u201d",
      "Filmed at a real-life luxury hotel on Italy\u2019s Amalfi Coast, Williams throws away his bedside manner to embody Daniel De Luca, a U.S. Marine intelligence officer who now works to solve crimes as fixer for the hotel\u2019s owner, Augusto (Tommaso Ragno), and his daughter Adele (Maria Chiara Giannetta).",
      "In an interview with TODAY.com, Williams, 44, admits it was refreshing to take a step back from \u201cserious subjects\u201d and jump into something more \u201ccomedic\u201d and \u201clight.\u201d",
      "\u201cThat\u2019s a big part of the appeal. It was a place to play, be light, fun, funny, creative \u2026 amidst all the chaos in the world,\u201d he says.",
      "\u201cA lot of my life is around serious subjects. So it was nice to be able to have my work be a little bit different, something where we can kind of take an old school format and do some action. I like to be physical and do something comedic, as well as something with a little bit of stakes.\u201d",
      "Taking big swings is not something new to Williams. The actor made a lasting impression during his Broadway debut in the 2022 revival of the play \u201cTake Me Out.\u201d The production, which also starred Jesse Tyler Ferguson, Patrick J. Adams and Michael Oberholtzer, among others, won a Tony Award for best revival of a play that year, and gave Ferguson his first Tony for best featured actor in a play.",
      "That same year, Williams also took a turn on another murder mystery series when he was cast as a guest star on Season 3 of \u201cOnly Murders in the Building\u201d and played Tobert, a cameraman and documentary filmmaker.",
      "But his time around, Williams, who fans came to know and love as Dr. Jackson Avery on \"Grey\u2019s Anatomy\" for 12 seasons, says he was focused on doing something across the pond.",
      "\u201cI was really interested in storytelling outside of the country, like traveling somewhere and putting together a cast from other countries and having this kind of cultural melange to play with. I thought that it was a good time for this,\u201d he tells TODAY.com.",
      "To accomplish this feat, Williams enlisted a dialect coach to help him learn the romance language.",
      "\u201cI had somebody on Zoom, before I left the country, and then there was somebody on set, just helping me,\u201d he says of his processes to speak the language in occasional scenes. \u201cI kind of had to learn the fundamentals of the language, learn the language, syntax construction, and then my lines, which are always changing, and have to be malleable.\u201d",
      "But don\u2019t expect the actor to be fluent in the millennium-old tongue. \u201cI\u2019m no good with languages,\u201d Williams says laughing, adding \u201cSome people can just adjust and pick it up pretty quickly. I would not say that\u2019s a strong suit for me ... it was work.\u201d",
      "Over the course of six episodes, viewers will see Williams solve different cases as he simultaneously looks into the disappearance of the hotel owner\u2019s younger daughter, Alice (Amanda Campana). Though her family doubts something\u2019s amiss, Daniel believes that she\u2019s in trouble.",
      "While Williams\u2019 character appears to have no issues solving mysteries and being the disarming sleuth, the \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy\u201d alum says he doesn\u2019t have much in common with the Marine-turned-fixer.",
      "\u201cI think he\u2019s so institutionally trained, it\u2019s very opposite of me,\u201d he tells TODAY.com. \u201cI couldn\u2019t imagine putting myself through the things that he\u2019s put himself through in terms of working his way up the ranks of the military and the culture there. So that\u2019s where we differ. I think a willingness to find the humor in things is, probably, a place that we overlap.\u201d",
      "As for solving crimes? Williams says he\u2019s \u201cobservant\u201d \u2014 but it's going to be a stretch if you expect him to solve an actual murder.",
      "\u201cI think I do pick up on body language and certainly attention to detail,\u201d he says thoughtfully, before emphasizing that he\u2019d only make a \u201cdecent detective.\u201d",
      "Shorter than the traditional 10 or 12 episode series, \u201cHotel Costiera\u201d is an sufficient tease for fans who love murder mysteries and crime dramas, but it will undoubtedly leave them wanting for more. Williams says there\u2019s an easy fix for that. He tells TODAY.com that while the limited series closes the loop in the final episode, the show is \u201cpoised for a whole lot of story.\u201d",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of mysterious, interesting material in that coastline, in the history of a country that\u2019s thousands of years old and still has the structures to prove it,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot we could be doing there.\u201d",
      "\u201cSo binge away and we\u2019ll have a chance to keep telling you stories,\u201d he quips.",
      "\u201cHotel Costiera,\u201d also starring Jordan Alexandra and Antonio Gerardi, is now available to stream on Prime Video."

      "Van Der Beek was replaced by Lin-Manuel Miranda after he had to miss the event due to stomach viruses. His wife, Kimberly, and kids turned out, however, with his oldest child, Olivia, helping to sing the show\u2019s popular theme, Paula Cole\u2019s \u201cI Don\u2019t Want to Wait,\u201d onstage surrounded by several of the drama\u2019s stars. Van Der Beek was moved, emotions magnified as she celebrated her birthday just a few days later.",
      "\u201cMy oldest turned 15 today,\u201d he wrote Sept. 25 alongside video of the moment on Instagram. \u201cSame age that Dawson was in the pilot. To watch you stand there in that red dress, so confidently taking center stage amidst all those people I\u2019ve known so long and cherish so deeply\u2026 I\u2019m just left in awe.\u201d",
      "Van Der Beek, who announced last November that he had been diagnosed with colorectal cancer, applauded how she has grown.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve always joked that you came out \u2018parent proof,\u2019 but this last year, as I\u2019ve watched you accelerate into so many big decisions, jump into so many activities, budget your time, do your homework and your hair (which, from my point of view, seem to require roughly the same amount of time & focus \ud83d\ude02)\u2026 the less I think the parent-proof thing is a joke,\u201d he wrote.",
      "Van Der Beek, who has six kids with his wife, then recalled how Olivia handled matters when she once \u201cscrewed up\u201d getting his ticket for her high school football game.",
      "\u201cYou did something remarkable. Something I\u2019d like to THINK you learned from me (but recognize that might be wishful thinking): You immediately took responsibility. Told me it was your first time doing all of it. Apologized succinctly, then did what you could to fix it,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI was more proud of how you handled the mess-up than if you\u2019d done it all perfectly the start.\u201d",
      "Van Der Beek, 48, then encouraged her to aim high in life.",
      "\u201cKeep taking big swings, kiddo. Risk imperfection,\u201d he wrote. \u201cKeep dreaming big and most importantly, be true to who you are. Because, while only YOU will know exactly who your most authentic self will be, as someone who\u2019s known you your whole life\u2026 I can guarantee you\u2019re going to love her. Happy birthday kiddo. I love you.\u201d",
      "While Van Der Beek couldn\u2019t make it to the \u201cDawson\u2019s Creek\u201d reading, he did make his presence felt with a prerecorded video.",
      "\u201cI have been looking forward to this night for months and months ever since my angel Michelle Williams said she was putting it together,\u201d he said, according to People. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m not there. I can\u2019t believe I don\u2019t get to see my castmates, my beautiful cast in person.",
      "\u201cAnd just I want to stand on that stage and thank every single person in the theater for being here tonight,\u201d he continued. \u201cFrom the cast to the crew to everybody who\u2019s doing anything and has been so generous, and especially every single last one of you \u2014 you are the best fans in the world.\u201d"

      "It\u2019s a \u201cLaw & Order\u201d tale as old as time \u2014 what is going on with Olivia Benson and Elliot Stabler?",
      "The Season 27 premiere of \u201cLaw & Order: SVU\u201d featured a scene with Mariska Hargitay and Chris Meloni\u2019s characters that is seemingly open to interpretation when it comes to their current relationship status.",
      "Meloni made a guest appearance at the beginning of the episode in honor of Benson and Stabler\u2019s former captain, Donald Cragen (Dann Florek), who viewers learn in the opening moments has died.",
      "After visiting with mourners inside a bar, Benson walks to her car and sees Stabler leaning against it.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t like funerals,\u201d he says to her.",
      "Benson agrees and says they\u2019re entering their \u201call our friends are dying era.\u201d",
      "Stabler references their 12-plus years as partners under Cragen, who put up with a lot of their personal and professional antics as two of his detectives, saying, \u201cNot that you can go back and not that I\u2019d want to, but \u2014 we had a pretty good run there for a minute.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe still do,\u201d Benson answers. \u201cJust different.\u201d",
      "Then they hug beside Benson\u2019s car. (This marks just their fifth hug in 27 seasons, but who\u2019s counting?)",
      "\u201cNow, get off my car,\u201d Benson jokes before she pulls away from Stabler.",
      "Stabler Tells Benson He Loves Her in the \u2018Law & Order: SVU\u2019 Season 27 Premiere",
      "He opens the car door for her, but before he closes it, he looks at her and says something that will send Benson and Stabler fans into a frenzy.",
      "\u201cLove you,\u201d Stabler tells her. \u201cNight.\u201d",
      "Many fans have been hoping for years that the two work partners would become romantic partners.",
      "Taking things past friendship was never really an option for Benson and Stabler when they worked under Cragen, as they were paired up at work and Stabler had a wife at home. Despite Stabler separating from, and nearly divorcing, his wife, nothing romantic ever happened between him and Benson back then.",
      "Cragen was the one who broke the news to Benson in the show\u2019s 13th season that Stabler resigned and wasn\u2019t coming back. Ten years later, Stabler returned to Benson\u2019s life, and his wife died. Since then, the two have shared a few close moments, including a near-kiss in Benson\u2019s kitchen.",
      "Now, \u201clove you\u201d is not something these two casually say to each other. In fact, the only other time Stabler said \u201cI love you\u201d to Benson was during a PTSD spiral on \u201cLaw & Order: Organized Crime\u201d after his wife died from injuries sustained in a car bombing.",
      "At the time, his children and Benson staged an intervention for Stabler amid his erratic behavior following Kathy\u2019s death. Stabler pushed away their concerns, and Benson asked, \u201cElliot, tell us what you need.\u201d",
      "\u201cI love you,\u201d he said, while staring at Benson as his kids watched.",
      "Benson looked shocked as his kids just stared. After a few seconds, he added, \u201cI love all of you.\u201d",
      "In a later season of \u201cOrganized Crime,\u201d Stabler drunkenly confessed to an old friend that there is a woman he is in love with. While he never shared her name, Benson really was the only person he could\u2019ve been talking about, since he hasn\u2019t seriously dated anyone since Kathy died. She also hasn\u2019t dated anyone since Stabler returned to her life.",
      "The closest Benson came to opening up about her feelings for Stabler was during a chat in Season 24 with friend Amanda Rollins (Kelli Giddish) after they relaxed with wine for some girl talk during a case.",
      "Benson told Rollins she felt like Stabler was her \u201chome,\u201d but she couldn\u2019t move past how he left her and that he was always somebody else\u2019s husband.",
      "\u201cWith her gone it\u2019s like there\u2019s nothing but possibility, which is paralyzing,\u201d she said.",
      "Benson\u2019s response in this week\u2019s episode after Stabler says \u201clove you\u201d is quite different from her reaction in that intervention scene. This time around, she seems calm, as if he says it to her on a regular basis.",
      "Hargitay shared a message in a recent interview for fans of a Benson-Stabler romance: \u201cYou can never give up hope.\u201d",
      "\u201cI think when people see two humans devoted and loyal and having each other\u2019s back, it\u2019s all any of us want \u2014 is that person that always has your back,\u201d she said."

      "The new season of \u201cLaw & Order\u201d picked up where last season\u2019s shocking ending left off \u2014 with trouble for Maroun (Odelya Halevi).",
      "Season 24 concluded in May with the murder of a man named Carter Mills, who was acquitted in the death of a model. Mills\u2019 DNA on the victim also happened to match evidence from an unsolved 12-year-old case: the murder of ADA Samantha Maroun\u2019s sister, Christina.",
      "After Mills was shot and killed following the acquittal, which came after EADA Nolan Price (Hugh Dancy) didn\u2019t look the other way on a key piece of evidence, the police turned its focus to Maroun.",
      "Halevi tells TODAY.com she \u201cloved\u201d being a person of interest.",
      "\u201cI think at the end of the day, I love playing \u2014 finally playing or showing \u2014 a side of Maroun that is maybe a bit more dark and not all out there,\u201d she says, \u201cbecause I think that she\u2019s very opinionated and very emotional. And it\u2019s all out there. She doesn\u2019t hide it.",
      "\u201cAnd it\u2019s the first time that we are seeing her really dark, really on the gray human side.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd concealing things, potentially,\u201d Dancy chimes in.",
      "Dancy and Halevi\u2019s characters butted heads over the case in last season\u2019s finale, and Price questioned Maroun\u2019s innocence. That mistrust is a theme that continues in the Season 25 premiere on Sept. 25.",
      "In last season's finale, their boss, District Attorney Nicholas Baxter (Tony Goldwyn), even used a personal story as an example during a conversation with Price about looking the other way on a piece of evidence in a case that may have cleared the suspect \u2014 trying to teach Price, a stickler for following the rules of law, that sometimes it\u2019s OK to be human in the job.",
      "Price later tells Baxter he researched the personal story and couldn\u2019t find any evidence it ever happened (more on this later).",
      "\u201cI had urged, as gently as I can, Nolan to not be so narrow in his view, to think with empathy,\u201d Goldwyn says about his character. \u201cAnd we\u2019re really seeing the consequences of his not doing that.\u201d",
      "Those consequences are a result of Price sticking to the law. That piece of evidence he turned over was also a personal betrayal to Maroun, as he had to report she tampered with the witness identification process in the case against Mills.",
      "\u201cI can\u2019t help but judge Nolan for his rigidity, because the consequences are so stark,\u201d Goldwyn says. \u201cThat\u2019s an interesting kind of wrinkle in our relationship.\u201d",
      "\u201cI feel like it\u2019s surprisingly difficult to step outside of your own, from outside of your own perspective, and see anything a little bit differently. We all think that we\u2019re really open-minded, but actually, we\u2019re mostly blinking,\u201d Dancy says, as Halevi agrees.",
      "Dancy likes that \u201ceverybody gets nudged a little bit out of their comfort zone\u201d in the debut episode and is \u201cforced to look at the law from a slightly (different) angle.\u201d",
      "Halevi says she didn\u2019t form an opinion about her character\u2019s potential innocence or guilt.",
      "\u201cIf she did it, I like her. If she didn\u2019t do it, I like her,\u201d she explains. \u201cI think being guilty and being likable \u2026 could go together.\u201d",
      "\u201cCould be compatible,\u201d Dancy says.",

      "'Law & Order' Stars React to Ending of Season 25 Premiere",
      "In the closing minutes, Price does step outside of his comfort zone and looks at the law differently. He overhears Maroun speaking to Mills\u2019 girlfriend, Julia, a lawyer who stood by his side through his trial and becomes the police\u2019s suspect in the shooting after Maroun is cleared. The girlfriend\u2019s legal team argues Julia killed her boyfriend in advance as an act of self-defense because \u201che was going to kill her that night\u201d and she \u201cdid what she had to do\u201d by killing him first.",
      "Julia later says Mills raped her, which leads Price to tell her and her lawyer they\u2019d accept a guilty plea for man 1, which is also a move Baxter asked Price about: Was he doing this to \u201cplacate\u201d Maroun after the Mills acquittal or because it\u2019s \u201cthe right legal move\u201d?",
      "When Maroun and Julia are left in a moment alone, Maroun says she feels \u201cterrible\u201d about everything and Julia acknowledges she knows what Mills did to Maroun\u2019s sister.",
      "Julia gets emotional and apologizes, saying, \u201cHe thought that he could do whatever he wanted. He thought that he was above the law. That\u2019s why I did what I did. That\u2019s why I waited outside his damn condo, so that I could \u2014\u201d Maroun tells her to stop talking as Price overhears them from outside the room.",
      "Maroun eventually tells Price what Julia said, aware that this would change everything about the case \u2014 just like Price choosing to turn over the evidence in the case against Mills led to an acquittal.",
      "In a scene mirroring his earlier conversation with Baxter, Price asks Maroun what she thinks they should do. Maroun says they could share what she overheard, or they could both pretend not to have heard what Julia said and \u201caccept the damn plea and move on.\u201d",
      "\u201cJust because we can win the case based on a letter of the law, doesn\u2019t mean we need to,\u201d she adds.",
      "Price ultimately agrees, thanking Maroun for \u201cbeing so honest.\u201d",
      "Halevi says she believes her character \u201creally taps into\u201d Price\u2019s heart, which is a sentiment Dancy agrees with, and \u201cmakes him explore the law\u201d from a different angle.",
      "She also sees Maroun as \u201cthe extreme of empathy\u201d and Price as \u201cthe extreme of the letter of the law\u201d and that the two \u201cmeet in the middle.\u201d",
      "The case brings the legal team of Baxter, Price and Maroun together in a way, but also introduces a new sort of dynamic into the group.",
      "\u201cI feel like that\u2019s what happens in real life,\u201d Halevi says. \u201cYou build really strong relationships with the people that challenged the relationship. Then you get disappointed, and you are forced to build trust.\u201d",
      "Goldwyn points out the events of the Mills case created \u201cthis strange tension\u201d between Baxter and Price, that they \u201cboth kind of see the world quite differently.\u201d",
      "Dancy agrees, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s a little less resolved between the two of us, because even going back to that story that he told me, which is supposedly a story about his own personal experience. So, it was kind of a human connection, turned out to be a fabrication.",
      "\u201cSo from my perspective, it\u2019s like, \u2018Wait, so you just made something up so that I would cut corners in order to win the case.\u2019\u201d",

      "\u201cHowever, Finneas comes from a family who holds strong values around sustainability and ethics, which means it\u2019s very possible he chose a lab-grown diamond, which would bring the value closer to ($40,000 to $55,000),\u201d Taylor says.",
      "Sulewski, 29, said she met O'Connell, the brother of Billie Eilish who performs under the name Finneas, on Raya in September 2018.",
      "Sulewski discussed matching with Finneas on the celebrity dating app on \u201cThe Skinny Confidential Him & Her Podcast\u201d in 2020.",
      "\u201cEverything fell into place so perfectly and so quickly,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause we already knew so many people in the same friend group.\u201d",
      "In 2019, the pair bought a home together, and Finneas has dedicated songs to Sulewski, including his 2019 track, \"Claudia.\"",
      "Sulewski, who rose to fame with her beauty YouTube channel in the early 2010s and later founded body care brand Cyklar, told TODAY.com about her relationship with Finneas in 2023.",
      "\u201cFinneas is just so wonderful and one of, like, the most creative brains \u2014 so I feel lucky just to get to pick his brain whenever, and he does the same with me,\u201d she said.",
      "\u201cI feel really lucky to have a supportive partner that I really respect and that goes mutually both ways,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd so I couldn\u2019t ask for a better best friend to get to bounce ideas off of.\u201d",
      "Sulewski has also directed music videos for Finneas, including the visual for his track \"2001,\" which dropped in May 2025 and starred Kate Hudson alongside the singer."

    "story": [
      "The unsettling \u201cWayward,\u201d a new limited series created by and starring Mae Martin, has just dropped on Netflix and we have a lot of questions.",
      "The eight episodes of \u201cWayward\u201d focus on the small New England town of Tall Pines and a mysterious, cult-like institute called Tall Pines Academy.",
      "The Academy isn\u2019t really a school \u2014 it\u2019s a behavior modifying institute run by the charismatic Evelyn (Toni Collette) where wayward teens are sent for correction. But it\u2019s also about new local cop Alex (Martin, whose pronouns are they/them) and his pregnant wife Laura (Sarah Gadon), and how they discover and reveal the secrets of the Academy and the town itself.",
      "The fact that the series raises a lot of questions \u2014 and doesn\u2019t provide a pat ending, is a good sign, as Martin told TODAY.com. \u201cThe questions are more important than the answers, and the conversations we want to start about how we should help young people that are in crisis \u2026 and what we are doing that\u2019s not working and how do we reconcile our relationships with our parents,\u201d they said.",
      "But what happens in \u201cWayward\u201d \u2014 especially in those last few moments? Here\u2019s what we know!",
      "Warning: Spoilers for the entire season of \u201cWayward.\u201d",
      "What happens in \u2018Wayward\u2019?",
      "Several stories converge during the series\u2019 eight episodes. There are two best friends \u2014 Leila (Alyvia Alyn Lind) and Abby (Sydney Topliffe), whose behavior and incipient drug use leads them to Tall Pines Academy. Leila is still reeling from the death of her sister, while Abby is more caught up in the whirlwind of her BFF\u2019s escapades and increasingly risky behavior.",
      "Meanwhile, Alex takes on a new position with the Tall Pines police department, arriving after a harrowing incident in his last job. Laura, who is expecting the couple\u2019s first child, spent many years in the small town and was drawn back during her pregnancy to familiar territory. But as is slowly revealed, being \u201cfrom\u201d Tall Pines seems to mean \u201cI was once incarcerated in the Academy where I was brainwashed into a strange concept of family and motherhood.\u201d Alex has no idea about any of this.",
      "Then there\u2019s Leanne, who rules over the Academy with a soothing tone and an iron fist \u2014 and has a watery basement where select individuals are encouraged to confront their demons by opening a \u201cdoor.\u201d Those who find a way to open the door are changed by the experience \u2014 and often mentally tied to Leanne, possibly forever. She\u2019s surrounded at the Academy by some of the teens she used to incarcerate there, and others now live in \u2014 and run \u2014 Tall Pines. And she\u2019s very, very interested in Laura and Alex\u2019s baby-to-be.",
      "After a teen escapes the institution, Alex starts digging into the real purpose of the Academy \u2014 and slowly uncovers Laura\u2019s association with it, both then and now. Leila and Abby risk everything to try and escape more than once, with Abby connecting with Alex for help, but only one of them manages to get away in the last minutes of the series.",
      "\u201cI was surprised at how brave it is to end each character the way that you chose to,\u201d Gadon told Martin while speaking with TODAY. \u201cYou could have taken a much easier route, but you didn\u2019t.\u201d",
      "How does \u2018Wayward\u2019 end?",
      "In the final episode, what\u2019s been a reasonably spooky look at the underbelly of an institution and the weird graduates who now live in Tall Pines veers more deeply into the cult the Academy has created in town, and even some body horror.",
      "Several characters\u2019 endings go unresolved. Does Alex brain his partner on the force Dwayne (Brandon Jay McLaren) with a huge rock? What happens to Laura and Alex\u2019s baby? Was Leila responsible for her sister\u2019s death, or are those false memories Evelyn induces in her? Does Evelyn, whom Alex overdosed with her own drug, survive the watery basement? Does the Academy survive all this? What about the best friends, Leila and Abby?",
      "That last one is tied up with the show\u2019s final scenes, which revolve around Alex and Laura\u2019s baby\u2019s arrival. The girls do get out of the Academy, but the memories about her sister\u2019s death, and her role in it, lead Leila to apparently allow herself to be captured again. What\u2019ll happen to her now remains unclear. But Abby, who had arranged with Alex to use Alex\u2019s car to escape, makes it to the car.",
      "Meanwhile, Alex bursts in on the baby\u2019s birth at the last moment, which is being witnessed by several townspeople. When the baby is born, the little girl is almost immediately passed around the townspeople for skin-on-skin contact with everyone. See, this isn\u2019t just Alex and Laura\u2019s baby \u2014 \u201cit\u2019s everyone\u2019s,\u201d says an exhausted Laura.",
      "Is Alex on board with this cultish, weird world? Yes and no \u2014 because the show provides two endings. In one, Alex waits until Laura is asleep and takes the baby to where Abby is about to drive off with the car. The two leave together, escaping the clutches of Tall Pines.",
      "But wait! Not so fast. What we\u2019ve seen is \u2014 almost certainly \u2014 a possible future. Just as it seems that Alex, Abbie and the newborn are going to run off to a new, more sane world, the scene returns to Alex and Laura\u2019s home. We see Alex looking troubled and uncertain, but he walks to the open front door, and closes it rather than leave. Tall Pines has now acquired a new resident, it seems. But Abby, at least, does get away in the car \u2014 with Alex and Laura\u2019s dog Toast in tow.",
      "\u201cI like people who make bad choices,\u201d Martin told TODAY, \u201cbut I also relate to all of their choices.\u201d"

      "Trump did not provide any details about the agreement being discussed, but he has previously insisted that Hamas return all of the remaining Israeli hostages kept in Gaza as part of any deal. In his post he called for \u201cPERMANENT AND LONGLASTING PEACE!\u201d",

      "Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian has spoken out against forcing women to wear the hijab and recent crackdowns in his country, pitting him against hard-line rivals in the Islamic Republic.",
      "\u201cHuman beings have a right to choose,\u201d Pezeshkian said Friday in an interview with Tom Llamas, anchor of \u201cNBC Nightly News,\u201d  when asked about Mahsa Amini, whose death three years ago after being detained by Iran\u2019s morality police triggered nationwide protests that shook the government\u2019s hold on power.",
      "\u201cWe didn\u2019t have appropriate management of our internal issues and implementation,\u201d he added during the extensive interview, during which he warned President Donald Trump\u2019s actions could \u201cset fire\u201d to the region and said international nuclear inspectors were welcome to visit his country.",
      "\u201cI took very crystal-clear positions in speeches that I gave in certain places in mosques, I clearly said this should not have occurred,\u201d Pezeshkian said.",
      "While this is not the first time Pezeshkian, who is considered a moderate and has criticized officials and security forces, has spoken out about the implementation of Iran\u2019s hijab laws and subsequent crackdowns, he also said the rest of the world was \u201cblowing things out of proportion.\u201d",
      "\u201cOf course, each human life is priceless,\u201d he said. But, \u201con a daily basis, hundreds of people are being killed in Lebanon, in Gaza, in all over Palestine, in Yemen and Syria, yet no one bats an eye? Why? These are less human beings?\u201d",
      "Despite Pezeshkian\u2019s moderate position on the issue of hijab, observers say he has little power to stop security forces who have used the war with Israel last June as a pretext to carry out mass arrests of ethnic and religious minorities as well as Afghan migrants, according to human rights groups.",
      "The interview was conducted with a government interpreter present and translating in real time, and NBC News reviewed the translation independently.",
      "Nuclear program",
      "Iran has renewed construction work at an underground site dug into the side of a mountain since the United States and Israel bombed the country\u2019s nuclear facilities, in a sign that Tehran is likely trying to rebuild its heavily damaged nuclear program, according to commercial satellite imagery and experts.",
      "In the three months since U.S. and Israeli warplanes struck three main nuclear facilities in Iran, satellite photos from Maxar indicate significant construction activity at Kuh-e Kolang Gaz La, or Pickaxe Mountain, which was not targeted in the air war. The site is near Natanz, a key nuclear facility that the U.S. military hammered with massive \u201cbunker buster\u201d bombs in June.",
      "The images show the construction of an elaborate security fence encircling the mountain, a concrete frame built around a tunnel entrance and a growing pile of excavated soil \u2014 suggesting continued tunneling, analysts said.",
      "The Washington Post first reported on the satellite imagery.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s clear that Iran is trying to rapidly construct a very deep underground facility just about a mile south of their uranium enrichment facility,\u201d said Joseph Rodgers, a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank.",
      "\u201cThe construction has really doubled down at Pickaxe Mountain, and they\u2019ve definitely continued to drill,\u201d said Rodgers, who recently produced a report about work at the site.",
      "The White House and CIA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "Llamas asked about the Washington Post report and whether the regime was building another nuclear facility. Pezeshkian said nuclear inspectors were welcome to visit his country.",
      "\u201cIf they are really telling the truth, we have been \u2026 we have come to an agreement, most recently, with the IAEA. They can come and inspect on the ground,\u201d Pezeshkian said, referring to the International Atomic Energy Agency, a watchdog body.",
      "\u201cTo put something out based on purported satellite photography, it\u2019s not pertinent in order to create frameworks that are not based in reality. In fact, would it not be easier and much more tangible and verifiable to have inspections in person on the ground?\u201d he added.",
      "The purpose of the site remains unknown. The latest satellite photos suggest Iran may be cautiously developing the location as an option for uranium enrichment or other nuclear work beyond the reach of America\u2019s powerful \u201cbunker-buster\u201d munitions, analysts said.",
      "\u201cIf they were planning on giving up their nuclear program, I don\u2019t think we would see this construction,\u201d said Jeffrey Lewis of the Center for Nonproliferation Studies. \u201cThey are going underground. Maybe they\u2019re coming to the table, but they are definitely going underground.\u201d",
      "Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the highest authority in Iran, limited the scope of what Pezeshkian could accomplish during his time in New York when he said in an address on Tuesday that Iran would not talk directly to the U.S. about its nuclear program and would not negotiate on the issue of ballistic missiles or uranium enrichment.",
      "While Iran maintains that its nuclear program is peaceful, hard-line parliamentarians have called for the building of a nuclear weapon. The country now enriches uranium to near-weapons-grade levels \u2014 the only country in the world without a nuclear weapons program known to do so.",
      "Asked about the high level of enrichment, Pezeshkian said, \u201cThe religious leader of the country issued fatwa and repeated ... multiple times that it is unholy, or haram, to seek weaponization, to seek nuclear weapons, to seek any type of weapons of mass destruction. This is rooted in our ideology. It is unambiguous. And it is not changeable. So nothing has prevented us from having ... the fullest cooperation with the IAEA.\u201d",
      "On Friday, the United Nations Security Council voted against a Russian and Chinese resolution to delay reimposing sanctions, which, despite the diplomatic push from Pezeshkian and his foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, will very likely lead to penalties being reimposed after the Saturday deadline.",
      "Without a diplomatic breakthrough on the sanctions, critics will likely blast Pezeshkian for coming home empty-handed.",
      "\u201cPezeshkian\u2019s presidential campaign was premised on diplomatic engagement abroad and attempts to moderate the regime\u2019s heavy hand at home,\u201d said Ali Vaez, Iran project director at the International Crisis Group. \u201cMore than a year into office, the limits of significant shifts within a system trapped in half-measures are clear.\u201d",
      "\u2018Set fire\u2019 to the region",
      "Before traveling to the U.S., Pezeshkian was urged by prominent intellectuals and former officials to meet with Trump directly to reduce tension and prevent another attack from the U.S. or Israel. Asked if he was concerned about more war coming to Iran and an expected meeting between Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Pezeshkian struck a defiant tone.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not afraid of war. We do not seek war,\u201d he said. \u201cPresident Trump has said that his administration has come to create peace, but the path that they have embarked upon will set fire to the entire region.\u201d",
      "He went on to say that while Iran has \u201cnever started a war. We  will never be starting any wars.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut whomever attacks us, we will do our utmost to give them the strongest answer. We will certainly augment our capabilities on a daily basis so as to prevent anyone from attacking us,\u201d Pezeshkian added.",
      "Injury during an airstrike",
      "Pezeshkian, who practiced as a doctor before entering politics, addressed an injury he sustained during the 12-day war with Israel in June, during which senior military leaders, scientists and hundreds of Iranian civilians were killed. Twenty-eight Israelis died during the conflict.",
      "\u201cThey hit us because they were seeking to martyr us like everyone else. We are not afraid of death and martyrdom. We have lived our lives. I have lived my life,\u201d he said.",
      "As for his wounded leg, Pezeshkian said, \u201cit wasn\u2019t anything special.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe can just say that it was a hematoma formed in the region of the knee. We dropped the needed liquid and blood, and after that, we got over it,\u201d he added."

      "ABOARD THE USS GERALD R. FORD, The North Sea \u2014 America\u2019s newest and largest aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R. Ford, may be in an undisclosed location in the North Sea off the coast of Norway, but this week it is at the center of one of NATO\u2019s largest deployments.",
      "With a series of unprecedented Russian incursions into NATO countries\u2019 airspace setting off alarm bells throughout Europe, the nuclear-powered carrier has been launching squadron after squadron of fighter jets as part of a multinational operation known as Neptune Strike.",
      "Two NATO officials, who asked for anonymity to discuss sensitive operational matters, told NBC News that the jets were taking off for assignments somewhere in Eastern Europe, where tensions have been high after a spate of Russian incursions.",
      "Nerves jangled further on Wednesday when German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius told his country\u2019s parliament, the Bundestag, that Russia continued to test the line and overflew a German warship in recent days.",
      "A German military official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the person was not allowed to publicly discuss sensitive military matters, confirmed that Russian jets flew close to the frigate called Hamburg. He added that the ship, which is currently operating in the Baltic Sea, was taking part in Neptune Strike, among other things.",
      "The flyby came two days after NATO met to discuss Russia\u2019s recent violation of Estonian airspace with three MiG-31 fighter aircraft. The meeting was convened after Estonia requested consultations under Article 4, a mechanism that prompts urgent talks among allies.",
      "Earlier this month, there was also widespread anger after a number of Russian drones entered Polish airspace during an attack on Ukraine, where President Vladimir Putin\u2019s forces have been at war for more than three and a half  years. A drone also reportedly entered Romanian airspace.",
      "The U.S. and its allies have been weighing a tougher response toward the Kremlin; NATO leaders gathered at the United Nations General Assembly in New York this week condemned the Kremlin for a spate of \u201cescalatory\u201d incidents and vowed to defend the alliance.",
      "President Donald Trump also said Tuesday that NATO countries should shoot down Russian military aircraft if they enter their airspace as he met with his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Pressed on whether the U.S. would back up NATO allies in such a situation, Trump said \u201cit depends on the circumstance.\u201d",
      "Heading to a summit with Putin in Alaska last month, Trump said he wanted a ceasefire. Since then, Moscow has expanded its drone and missile attacks on Ukrainian cities, while seemingly ignoring his overtures for further dialogue to end the conflict.",
      "Meanwhile, out at sea, the level of military cooperation seems unimpeded by political currents, as the Ford takes part in Neptune Strike. NATO has said it is not a military exercise, instead calling it an \u201cenhanced vigilance activity.\u201d",
      "On the Ford, it was all-systems-go as squadron after squadron of F-18 fighter jets took off and landed within minutes of each other. The pace on the flight deck was frenetic aboard the nuclear-powered ship, which weighs around 100,000 tons and has a crew of between 4,500 and 4,700.",
      "No ship in the U.S. fleet can launch more jets faster. The dramatic thump of the ship\u2019s four electromagnetic catapults which shoot them into the sky is constant and can be heard throughout the ship.",
      "\u201cSeveral of those aircraft are going a long distance to drop live weapons on a close air support range that is to the northeast of here,\u201d the Ford carrier strike group commander, Rear Adm. Paul Lanzilotta, said after a squadron took off.",
      "The purpose of the \u201cactivity\u201d is to demonstrate large-scale coordination in multiple theaters, NATO says. It has been run several times a year since it started in 2020.",
      "Lanzilotta also stressed that this week\u2019s maneuvers were not a response to recent events in Eastern Europe, but had been planned long in advance. This is part of the core message that NATO intends to send, he said.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not in an action-reaction mode,\u201d he said. \u201cNATO, as you know, is a defensive alliance and that is what we are doing. We\u2019re proving that out and showing it in the way that we planned months ago.\u201d",
      "Protected by Navy F-18 and Dutch air force F-35 fighter jets overhead and French and other Allied ships nearby, as well as launching planes quickly, the Ford can also land them within minutes of clearing the runway.",
      "As they come in to land, the 20-ton jets hook onto a series of wires on the aft end of the deck, before they are quickly moved out of the way by tow trucks and other machinery as another one sets down.",
      "Teams in green, yellow and white vests scurry around orchestrating the operation, which can be extremely dangerous with so much hardware around.",
      "At a briefing, a model of a Russian Sukhoi Su-27 fighter jet hung behind Capt. David Dartez, commander of the Ford\u2019s air wing. Asked if that meant Russia was on their minds, he said they trained for any possible adversary.",
      "He also said he had conducted flights as far as Finland, which shares an 800-mile border with Russia.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s kind of fuel-dependent, but we have lots of friendly allies,\u201d he said, adding that he had refueled from a Finnish aircraft while on NATO maneuvers.",
      "\u201cI won\u2019t say where I was, but he gave me gas because I was very far away from the aircraft carrier\u2026 at that moment, over 1,000 miles,\u201d he said."

      "Palestinian statehood, which would see an internationally recognized state in territories seized by Israel in the 1967 Mideast War, is now formally recognized by around 75% of U.N. member countries. But that recognition remains largely symbolic.",
      "Gershon Baskin, an Israeli who has acted as a mediator with Hamas for decades and a staunch advocate of a two-state solution, said that he welcomed the growing recognition. But without further action, including sanctions against Israel, he said the move will do little to \"change the lives of Palestinians\" on the ground.",
      "\"It's really a step in the right direction,\" Baskin said in a phone interview Monday of the summit at the General Assembly. But, calling Israel's offensive in Gaza \"a genocide,\" he said, \"the most important thing now ... is to end the war in Gaza and that comes before everything else.\"",
      "It is unclear how effective Monday\u2019s summit will be in advancing efforts to end the war in the face of furious opposition from Israel and the U.S., which blocked Palestinian officials from even attending the U.N. gathering.",
      "Baskin noted the possibility of retaliation from Israel in response to the diplomatic moves by France, the U.K. and others, with far-right members of Netanyahu's government pushing for the annexation of part of the occupied West Bank.",

      "Though the fast-moving diplomatic events are mostly symbolic, the resentment across Israel\u2019s political class shows just how isolated the Jewish state has become two years into its war with Hamas that has upended much of the Middle East.",
      "The Trump administration has also warned of possible repercussions for countries taking measures against Israel, including France. But European leaders defended their decisions, calling them a strike against Hamas rather than a pledge of support for what Israeli leaders called a potential \u201cterrorist state.\u201d",
      "\u201cRecognizing Palestine is a categorical disavowal of Hamas, and it permanently isolates it,\u201d French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot said on French channel TF1. \u201cIt vindicates those among the Palestinians who have chosen to renounce violence and terrorism.\u201d",

      "The prime minister faces substantial pressure from his right-wing ideological flank, particularly hard-line ministers in his government, to retaliate by annexing the whole of the occupied West Bank.",
      "But the United Arab Emirates, one of a handful of Arab nations that maintain diplomatic relations with Israel, already warned Israel earlier this month that annexation would be a \u201cred line.\u201d",
      "The UAE did not specify what action it might take, but officials told Reuters they were considering downgrading the UAE\u2019s diplomatic ties with Israel, potentially damaging the U.S.-brokered Abraham Accords, one of Israel\u2019s most important diplomatic victories in recent memory.",
      "British Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper told the BBC that she had warned the Israelis against annexing all or part of the West Bank.",
      "Short of taking over the West Bank in full, senior Israeli officials also discussed the possibility of bringing more West Bank territory now governed by the Palestinians under full Israeli control, according to media reports in the country.",
      "Israel may also decide to shutter France\u2019s consulate in Jerusalem, which tends to deal with issues related to the Palestinians, the reports said. Israeli leaders are focusing their outrage on France because it was the first in a series of Western countries to announce that it would recognize a Palestinian state last summer.",
      "For Palestinians in the Gaza Strip, the decisions were met with cheer and relief \u2014 a sign that the West is finally ready to treat Palestinians as equal.",
      "\u201cThis is a beginning, or a glimmer of hope for the Palestinian people,\u201d said Fawzi Nour Al-Deen, a displaced person from the north of Gaza. \u201cWe are a people who deserve to have a state.\u201d",

      "\u201cWhere is the state? In the street? Or in the tents? What state is this that [they] recognize?\u201d said Mohammed al-Yazigi, a displaced person in central Gaza. \u201cAre we able to find something to eat or a place to stay? Leave it to God.\u201d"

    "story": [
      "NEW YORK \u2014 The United States clashed with world leaders over artificial intelligence at the United Nations General Assembly this week, rejecting calls for global oversight as many pushed for new collaborative frameworks.",
      "While many heads of state, corporate leaders and prominent figures endorsed a need for urgent international collaboration on AI, the U.S. delegation criticized the role of the U.N. and pushed back on the idea of centralized governance of AI.",
      "Representing the U.S. in Wednesday\u2019s Security Council meeting on AI, Michael Kratsios, the director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, said, \u201cWe totally reject all efforts by international bodies to assert centralized control and global governance of AI.\u201d",
      "The path to a flourishing future powered by AI does not lie in \u201cbureaucratic management,\u201d Kratsios said, but instead in \u201cthe independence and sovereignty of nations.\u201d",
      "While Kratsios shot down the idea of combined AI governance, President Donald Trump said in his speech to the General Assembly on Tuesday that the White House will be \u201cpioneering an AI verification system that everyone can trust\u201d to enforce the Biological Weapons Convention.",
      "\u201cHopefully, the U.N. can play a constructive role, and it will also be one of the early projects under AI,\u201d Trump said. AI \u201ccould be one of the great things ever, but it also can be dangerous, but it can be put to tremendous use and tremendous good.\u201d.",
      "In a statement to NBC News, a State Department spokesperson said, \u201cThe United States supports like-minded nations working together to encourage the development of AI in line with our shared values. The US position in international bodies is to vigorously advocate for international AI governance approaches that promote innovation, reflect American values, and counter authoritarian influence.\u201d",
      "The comments rejecting collaborative efforts around AI governance stood in stark contrast to many of the initiatives being launched at the General Assembly.",
      "On Thursday, the U.N. introduced the Global Dialogue on AI Governance, the U.N.\u2019s first body dedicated to AI governance involving all member states. U.N. Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said the body would \u201clay the cornerstones of a global AI ecosystem that can keep pace with the fastest-moving technology in human history.\u201d Speaking after Guterres, Nobel Prize recipient Daron Acemoglu outlined the growing stakes of AI\u2019s rapid development, arguing that \u201cAI is the biggest threat that humanity has faced.\u201d",
      "But in an interview with NBC News, Amandeep Singh Gill, the U.N.\u2019s special envoy for digital and emerging technologies, told NBC News that the United States\u2019 critical perception of the U.N.\u2019s role in international AI governance was misconstrued.",
      "\u201cI think it\u2019s a misrepresentation to say that the U.N. is somehow getting into the regulation of AI,\u201d Gill said. \u201cThese are not top-down power grabs in terms of regulation. The regulation stays where regulation can be done in sovereign jurisdictions.\u201d",
      "Instead, the U.N.\u2019s mechanisms \u201cwill provide platforms for international cooperation on AI governance,\u201d Gill said.",
      "In remarks immediately following Kratsios\u2019 comments, China\u2019s Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Ma Zhaoxu said, \u201cIt is vital to jointly foster an open, inclusive, fair and nondiscriminatory environment for technological development and firmly oppose unilateralism and protectionism.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe support the U.N. playing a central role in AI governance,\u201d Ma said.",
      "One day after Kratsios\u2019 remarks at the Security Council, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez seemed to push back on Kratsios and gave full-throated support for international cooperation on AI and the U.N.\u2019s role in AI governance.",
      "\u201cWe need to coordinate a shared vision of AI at a global level, with the U.N. as the legitimate and inclusive forum to forge consensus around common interests,\u201d S\u00e1nchez said. \u201cThe time is now, when multilateralism is being most questioned and attacked, that we need to reaffirm how suitable it is in addressing challenges such as those represented by AI.\u201d",
      "Reacting to the week\u2019s developments, Renan Araujo, director of programs for the Washington, D.C.-based Institute for AI Policy and Strategy, told NBC News that \u201cno one wants to see a burdensome, bureaucratic governance structure, and the U.S. has succeeded in starting bilateral and minilateral coalitions. At the same time, we should expect AI-related challenges to become more transnational in nature as AI capabilities become more advanced.\u201d",
      "This is not the first time the U.N. has addressed AI, having passed the Global Digital Compact last year. The compact laid the foundation for the AI dialogue and for an independent international scientific panel to evaluate AI\u2019s abilities, risks and pathways forward. Guterres announced that nominations to this panel are now open.",
      "While Thursday\u2019s event marked the launch of the global dialogue and panel, the dialogue will have its first full meeting in Geneva in summer 2026, in tandem with the International Telecommunication Union\u2019s annual AI for Good summit. The dialogue\u2019s exact functions and first actions will be charted out over the coming months."

    "story": [
      "WASHINGTON \u2014 The Supreme Court on Friday handed another win to the Trump administration by allowing it to withhold $4 billion in spending on foreign aid that was appropriated by Congress.",
      "A federal judge had ruled that the administration would have to spend the funds by the end of the month, but the Supreme Court's decision puts that on hold.",
      "\u201cThis result further erodes separation of powers principles that are fundamental to our constitutional order. It will also have a grave humanitarian impact,\" said Nicolas Sansome, a lawyer with Public Citizen Litigation Group, which represents nonprofit groups that sued.",
      "The brief order noted that the government has made a \"sufficient showing\" that the groups that sued were barred from bringing the lawsuit in question under a law called the Impoundment Control Act.",
      "The court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, also noted that \"the asserted harms to the Executive\u2019s conduct of foreign affairs appear to outweigh the potential harm\" to the plaintiffs, which are various groups that receive foreign aid funds.",
      "The court has now granted 20 emergency applications filed by the administration since President Donald Trump\u2019s second term began in January. The volume of emergency filings and the rate at which the court has ruled in the administration's favor are both unprecedented. The latter has sparked criticism from within the legal community, including lower court judges.",
      "A Justice Department spokesman did not immediately respond to a request seeking comment.",
      "The three liberals on the court dissented, with Justice Elena Kagan writing that the legal issue in the case has not been presented before, meaning the court was working in \"uncharted territory.\"",
      "Yet again, the majority nevertheless granted the emergency request made by the government without hearing oral arguments or issuing a fully reasoned decision, she added.",
      "\"We therefore should have denied this application, allowed the lower courts to go forward, and ensured that the weighty question presented here receives the consideration it deserves,\" Kagan wrote.",
      "Chief Justice John Roberts had on Sept. 9 issued a temporary stay that put the lower court ruling on hold while the Supreme Court decided what next steps to take.",
      "The Trump administration, which has aggressively sought to exert its power over Congress in recent months, has notified lawmakers of its intention not to spend the funds.",
      "This action has sparked a debate over whether the president has such authority, as under the Constitution, it is the role of Congress to allocate money for the president to spend.",
      "After the Supreme Court decision, Democrats quickly urged Congress to reassert its authority to control spending even as lawmakers are engaged in a budget fight that could lead to a government shutdown.",
      "\"Republicans should join Democrats to stand up for our power of the purse,\" Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wa. and Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn. said in a joint statement.",
      "The Trump administration has already taken swift action to unravel the U.S. Agency for International Development, the government department that traditionally handed out billions of dollars a year in foreign aid to tackle such issues as access to water and disease prevention.",
      "The money at issue was appropriated by Congress for the current fiscal year, which ends on Sept. 30. The Trump administration has said it wants to withhold $4 billion in foreign aid, but will spend another $6.5 billion that Congress appropriated.",
      "The Impoundment Control Act was passed in 1974 to regulate the president\u2019s control over the budget. That followed efforts by then-President Richard Nixon to withhold spending on programs he did not support.",
      "The Trump administration says it can withhold the money via a process known as \"rescission,\" in which the president informs Congress of his intention not to spend certain funds.",
      "But with little time left before the funds expire, Congress is unlikely to respond, even if it wanted to. Republicans who broadly support Trump's policies control both chambers and are in the process of trying to fund the government for the next fiscal year before Oct. 1; otherwise, the government will shut down.",
      "The administration's decision to wait until the end of the fiscal year to notify Congress is a legally questionable tactic that has been called a \"pocket rescission\" and has not been used in nearly 50 years.",
      "Washington-based U.S. District Judge Amir Ali had ruled on Sept. 3 that the administration must spend the money unless Congress acts to withdraw it.",
      "Solicitor General D. John Sauer said in a court filing that Ali's ruling imposed unacceptable restrictions on the president by, among other things, forcing the administration to engage in diplomatic discussions with other countries over how to spend the money",
      "The underlying lawsuit challenging Trump's rescission was brought by various groups led by the Global Health Council.",
      "Their lawyers said in court papers that the administration's legal arguments would turn the Impoundment Control Act on its head by reaching the conclusion that \"Congress\u2019s signature law meant to control impoundments actually provided the President vast new powers to impound funds, and made it virtually impossible to challenge impoundments in court.\""

      "Black liberation activist and American fugitive Assata Shakur, who escaped to Cuba more than 45 years ago after she was convicted of killing a New Jersey state trooper, died in Havana, the government announced Friday.",
      "She was 78.",
      "Shakur, who changed her name from Joanne Chesimard, died Thursday from health ailments and advanced age, according to a short statement released by the Cuban Foreign Ministry.",
      "\u201cWords cannot describe the depth of loss that I am feeling at this time. I want to thank you for your loving prayers,\u201d her daughter Kakuya Shakur wrote in a Facebook post.",
      "Shakur was involved in a shootout during a traffic stop on the New Jersey Turnpike in 1973. State Trooper Werner Foerster, the second officer responding to the scene, found a loaded gun on the driver of the car, according to previous NBC News reporting. Shakur was in the front passenger seat and another man was seated behind her.",
      "There was an exchange of gunfire. James Harper, the state trooper who initially pulled the group over, said he saw Shakur shoot Foerster in the stomach with the officer's gun after he tussled with the driver, who also shot Foerster in the arm.",
      "Shakur and two men she was with returned to the car and drove five miles down the New Jersey Turnpike. One of the men with them, James Coston, died in the car. As they dumped Coston's body on the side of the road, police caught up to the group. Shakur was arrested while the driver fled and was found nearly two days later.",
      "Shakur, who was sentenced to life in prison, denied shooting Foerster. To supporters, she was an activist jailed for crimes she did not commit.",
      "In a statement, Foerster's family said her death did not bring any joy to them, but did bring \"a measure of closure to a tragedy that has deeply affected our family and community.\"",
      "\"While this development marks the end of a long and painful chapter, it does not erase the profound loss we continue to feel each day,\" the family said. \"The pain of losing Werner is something we carry every single day. His absence is felt in every quiet moment, every family gathering, and every milestone he should have been here to witness.\"",
      "Shakur was born Joanne Deborah Byron in Queens, New York, on July 16, 1947. After what she described in her autobiography as a troubled childhood, she became involved in political activism at the Borough of Manhattan Community College and City College of New York. She was a member of the revolutionary Black Liberation Army, as well as the Black Panther Party. At 21, she married Louis Chesimard, though their marriage lasted only a year.",
      "Shakur was serving a life sentence at the Clinton Correctional Facility for Women in New Jersey after being convicted in 1977 of murder in Foerster's death. She had also been implicated in armed robbery and other crimes. She escaped from prison on Nov. 2, 1979, with the help of members of the Black Liberation Army who posed as visitors. She turned up a few years later in Cuba, where the island\u2019s leader at the time, Fidel Castro, granted her political asylum. She published an autobiography in 1987.",
      "Because Cuba repeatedly refused to extradite her to the U.S., Shakur and other fugitives living in Cuba became a major sticking point in negotiations between the U.S. and the communist-run island after President Barack Obama re-established diplomatic relations between the two countries.",
      "Then-New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said Shakur should be returned to New Jersey after the ceremonial reopening of the U.S. Embassy in Cuba in 2015.",
      "Gov. Phil Murphy and state Police Superintendent Col. Patrick Callahan said in a statement Friday that their offices have worked with the State Department in previous attempts to bring Shakur back to New Jersey to face accountability for Foerster's killing and for fleeing the country.",
      "\"We will vigorously oppose any attempt to repatriate Chesimard's remains to the United States,\" they wrote.",
      "Shakur became the first woman on the FBI\u2019s list of most wanted terrorists in 2013. She was added to the list on the anniversary of Foerster\u2019s death. There was a $2 million reward for information leading to her arrest.",
      "Supporters of Shakur, who was rapper Tupac Shakur's godmother through her brother Mutulu Shakur, believed she was a target of law enforcement for her involvement with the Black Liberation Army.",
      "In a 1998 interview with NBC New York in Havana, Shakur said she had never killed anyone and was found guilty in an \u201cunfair trial\u201d by an all-white jury.",
      "\u201cI was shot with my arms in the air, then shot again in the back and left on the ground to die,\u201d she said. \u201cNext thing I knew, they were coming by me and saying, \u2018Is she dead yet, is she dead yet?\u2019\u201d",
      "She said she was later taken to a hospital, where she was beaten and tortured by state troopers who she said would stick their hands in her wounds and ask if it hurt.",
      "\u201cAmerican racism has done to another Black person what it has done to Black people down through the years,\u201d Shakur\u2019s defense attorney William Kunstler said in 1977. \u201cThe reality is, this beautiful young Black woman never had a chance, but we, like liberal fools, still had hopes.\u201d"

      "Facing down a mass walkout and mounting diplomatic pressure, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed Friday to \u201cfinish the job\u201d as he defied growing isolation over his military\u2019s  devastating assault on the Gaza Strip.",
      "Netanyahu was met by a mix of jeers and applause as he spoke to a half-empty room at the United Nations General Assembly in New York. He instead directed his address to Israeli hostages still held in Gaza, Hamas fighters battling his troops and the host of world leaders who have moved to recognize Palestine as a state.",
      "He reserved praise for President Donald Trump, who told reporters moments after Netanyahu finished his speech: \u201cI think we have maybe a deal on Gaza.\u201d The president, who will meet with his close ally next week, offered little further detail on talks, which have frequently broken down in the past.",
      "The United States has stood by Israel while a growing list of countries have condemned its offensive in the besieged Palestinian territory. Netanyahu also branded as \u201cshameful\u201d the decision by a wave of countries to formally recognize a Palestinian state.",
      "He touted Israel\u2019s military operations across the Middle East and vowed to press ahead with the assault on Gaza.",
      "\u201cThe final remnants of Hamas are holed up in Gaza City,\u201d the Israeli leader said of his military\u2019s ground offensive in the famine-stricken area. \u201cThey vow to repeat the atrocities of Oct. 7 again and again and again. This is why Israel must finish the job.\u201d",
      "Netanyahu added that while \u201cWestern leaders may have buckled under the pressure,\u201d he guaranteed that \u201cIsrael won\u2019t.\u201d",
      "He spoke after scores of delegates walked out of the room as he approached the podium.",
      "Netanyahu said his speech was being broadcast through loudspeakers across Israel\u2019s border with Gaza, in hopes of reaching hostages who remain held in the enclave \u2014 and claimed it was being carried on cellphones of Palestinians across the territory after they were taken over by Israel\u2019s intelligence services.",
      "\u201cWe have not forgotten you, not even for a second. The people of Israel are with you,\u201d Netanyahu said to the hostages, whose families have staged angry protests accusing him of endangering their loved ones by refusing to agree to a peace deal.",
      "In a message to any Hamas members who might see the broadcast, he said, \u201cLay down your arms. Let my people go.\u201d",
      "\u201cIf you do, you will live. If you don\u2019t, Israel will hunt you down,\u201d he said.",
      "Netanyahu also hit out during his speech at the string of countries that have moved to recognize Palestinian statehood in recent days, saying their \u201cdisgraceful decision\u201d would \u201cencourage terrorism against Jews and against innocent people everywhere.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt will be a mark of shame on all of you,\u201d he said.",
      "Netanyahu also rejected the growing condemnation of Israel, which sees his country facing the allegation of genocide before the International Court of Justice as well as from a growing number of experts and rights groups.",
      "In a sign of that isolation the Israeli leader took an unusual route to New York, with his flight path appearing to avoid countries that could enforce an international arrest warrant against him for alleged war crimes in Gaza.",
      "Israeli forces have ramped up their assault on Gaza City, forcing the displacement of hundreds of thousands of people while others stay put under near-daily deadly strikes.",
      "In response countries including France and the United Kingdom have formally recognized Palestine as a state, leading Trump to issue a firm warning.",
      "\u201cI will not allow Israel to annex the West Bank. No, I will not allow it. It\u2019s not going to happen,\u201d Trump told reporters Thursday, having earlier privately assured Arab leaders on the subject.",
      "Asked whether he had discussed the issue with Netanyahu, Trump said, \u201cWhether I spoke to him or not, I did, but I\u2019m not allowing Israel to annex the West Bank.\"",
      "\"There\u2019s been enough. It\u2019s time to stop now,\" he said.",
      "Trump issued the rare admonishment after far-right members of Netanyahu's fragile government coalition called for the move.",
      "Palestinians envision the West Bank as a key territory for an internationally recognized state, alongside Gaza and east Jerusalem. Annexation of the territory, which has been occupied by Israel since 1967, would further imperil that cause.",
      "Trump also presented his 21-point plan for peace to Arab leaders, with his special envoy Steve Witkoff saying the meeting was \u201cproductive\" and that a breakthrough could be imminent.",
      "Tony Blair, the former British prime minister, is looking to play a senior role in running postwar Gaza under a peace plan, the Financial Times newspaper reported.",
      "Blair's office declined to comment on the matter.",
      "Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas was among the leaders to address the U.N. General Assembly, though he was forced to deliver his address by video after the U.S. last month revoked his visa, along with those of other Palestinian Authority officials.",
      "In his video address on Wednesday, Abbas said Palestinians in Gaza \u201chave been facing a war of genocide, destruction, starvation and displacement\u201d by Israel, adding that \u201cdespite all what our people have suffered, we reject what Hamas carried out on the 7th of October.\u201d",
      "Abbas said Hamas would have \u201cno role to play in governance\u201d in the future he envisioned for Gaza.",
      "That future is at stake in peace talks, and Netanyahu's address to world leaders comes as he continues to defy the mounting pressure from his closest ally and the families of hostages still held in Gaza to end the war."

      "North Korea is close to developing an intercontinental ballistic missile that could hit the United States with a nuclear weapon, South Korea\u2019s president said Thursday \u2014 though he added that it has yet to master the last, crucial step.",
      "North Korea has been ramping up its missile testing since talks between President Donald Trump and leader Kim Jong Un collapsed in 2019 amid disagreements over U.S.-led sanctions on the isolated state. Trump has said repeatedly since returning to office that he would like to resume diplomacy with Kim.",
      "Speaking in New York on Thursday, South Korean President Lee Jae Myung said North Korea appears to already have enough nuclear weapons for \u201cregime survival,\u201d and that it continues to produce nuclear material and develop ICBMs capable of delivering nuclear warheads to the continental U.S.",
      "\u201cIt seems not to have succeeded yet, but only one final step remains \u2014 so-called atmospheric re-entry technology,\u201d Lee said at an investment summit at the New York Stock Exchange. \u201cThat, too, is likely to be solved soon.\u201d",
      "If the status quo is allowed to continue, North Korea will add roughly 15 to 20 nuclear warheads each year, Lee said, and its ICBM technology will advance to the point where it has more warheads than it needs to defend itself.",
      "\u201cWhat then of the excess? The concern is that they will export them,\u201d he said.",
      "Lee reiterated a proposal he made in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday, calling for a phased solution to the North Korean nuclear issue that recognizes that denuclearization is not going to be achieved in the near future.",
      "Instead, he said, the goal should be for North Korea to first freeze its nuclear weapons program, then reduce it and ultimately dismantle it.",
      "Achieving this will require Kim to negotiate with someone he trusts, and Trump \u201cis uniquely positioned to be that counterpart,\u201d Lee said.",
      "\u201cIf peace can be forged on the world\u2019s last divided peninsula, it will be a truly world-historical achievement in peacebuilding \u2014 a genuine peacemaker\u2019s accomplishment,\u201d he said.",
      "North Korea has made significant advances in its nuclear and ballistic missile programs in the absence of talks.",
      "Last year, it tested its biggest ICBM yet, the Hwasong-19, which experts say could reach anywhere in the U.S. \u2014 although they are skeptical that North Korea has the ability to guide the missile and protect a nuclear warhead as it re-enters the atmosphere.",
      "Kim has also deepened his country\u2019s military cooperation with Russia, sending artillery and thousands of troops to support President Vladimir Putin\u2019s war against Ukraine.",
      "The North Korean regime now says the U.S. and others have no choice but to accept it as a nuclear weapons state.",
      "On Thursday, South Korean Unification Minister Chung Dong-young said North Korea was operating a total of four uranium enrichment facilities, including the only declared site at Yongbyon, about 60 miles north of Pyongyang, the North Korean capital.",
      "Chung also said North Korea appeared to have sharply increased its stockpile of highly enriched uranium for use in building nuclear weapons.",
      "Kim said Sunday that while he had \u201cgood personal memories\u201d of his meetings with Trump, there was no reason to resume talks unless the U.S. \u201cabandons its delusional obsession with denuclearization.\u201d",
      "He has also dismissed Lee\u2019s overtures toward peace, including the   suspension of propaganda leaflet drops from the air and loudspeaker broadcasts along the border between the two Koreas, which technically remain at war after the 1950-53 Korean War ended with an armistice rather than a peace treaty.",
      "Lee\u2019s phased solution of exchange, normalization and denuclearization \u2014 known as \u201cEND\u201d \u2014 is a clear departure from the international community\u2019s previous approach of \u201cdenuclearization first,\u201d said Yang Moo-jin, distinguished chair professor at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul, South Korea.",
      "His proposal is \u201cthe last meaningful attempt at peace under the current circumstances,\u201d Yang said in a text message to NBC News.",
      "It comes after a White House meeting between Lee and Trump last month that was generally considered successful, with Trump telling reporters he would like to meet with Kim this year.",
      "\u201cThe chemistry between President Trump and President Lee could create the most favorable conditions for North Korea to come to the negotiating table and engage in rational dialogue,\u201d Yang said."

      "Laying out his vision for what government would look like once the war was over, Abbas said Hamas would have \"no role to play in governance\" in Gaza. Abbas, as the head of the Palestinian Authority, has been at odds with Hamas since the Islamist militants won municipal elections and forced their more moderate rivals out of Gaza in 2007.",

      "Microsoft has cut off some services to a unit in Israel\u2019s Defense Ministry after investigating allegations that it was using Microsoft cloud products for the mass surveillance of Palestinians.",
      "In a blog post published Thursday, Microsoft President Brad Smith said the move came after reviewing an Aug. 6 report from The Guardian that said an Israel Defense Forces intelligence unit had used the company\u2019s Azure storage service to collect and store recordings of Palestinian civilians\u2019 phone calls.",
      "Azure is Microsoft\u2019s primary cloud-computing service, with millions of monthly active users around the globe. However, the Guardian \u2014 citing interviews with 11 sources, including at Microsoft and among Israeli intelligence officials \u2014 alleged that the unit had access to \u201ca customised and segregated area\u201d within Azure\u2019s cloud platform.",
      "Smith did not directly corroborate that assertion but said the company\u2019s review had found evidence that \u201csupports elements of the Guardian\u2019s reporting,\u201d including the use of Azure storage capacity in the Netherlands and of certain artificial intelligence services. Smith did not provide additional details.",
      "Microsoft has since informed Israel\u2019s Defense Ministry, which oversees the IDF and its intelligence units, that it was disabling the unit\u2019s ability to use parts of Azure\u2019s cloud storage service. Microsoft did not name the unit it was targeting in its action, but The Guardian report was centered on Unit 8200, seen as Israel\u2019s equivalent to the U.S. National Security Agency. NBC News has not confirmed that report.",
      "\u201cWe do not provide technology to facilitate mass surveillance of civilians,\u201d Smith said. \u201cWe have applied this principle in every country around the world, and we have insisted on it repeatedly for more than two decades.\u201d",
      "Smith said Microsoft would continue other work designed to \u201cprotect the cybersecurity of Israel and other countries in the Middle East.\u201d",
      "A spokesperson for Israel\u2019s Defense Ministry said it had no comment. In response to The Guardian\u2019s August report, an Israeli official first said its work with companies such as Microsoft was based on \u201clegally supervised agreements,\u201d but then later stated that \u201cMicrosoft is not and has not been working with the IDF on the storage or processing of data.\u201d",
      "The Guardian article was the latest in a yearslong series of media reports alleging that the IDF has been using software products created by U.S. tech giants, including Microsoft, in its war in the Gaza Strip. The reports have led to internal protests by Microsoft employees, some of whom have subsequently been terminated, according to documents reviewed by CNBC. Late last month, Microsoft said it asked police to remove people it said had improperly entered its headquarters as part of a protest action.",
      "Microsoft has said it doesn\u2019t retaliate against employees who express their views but would respond to anyone deemed to have made threats.",
      "The reports about the use of Microsoft products by Israel\u2019s military have helped fuel a protest group, No Tech for Apartheid, created in 2021, aimed at pressuring Silicon Valley businesses to cut ties with Israel. The group includes a Microsoft-focused offshoot, No Azure for Apartheid, that has focused on the Redmond, Washington-based corporation.",
      "In a statement, a representative for No Azure for Apartheid celebrated the announcement, calling it \u201csignificant and unprecedented,\u201d but noting that \u201cMicrosoft has only disabled a small subset of services to only one unit in the Israeli military. The vast majority of Microsoft\u2019s contract with the Israeli military remains intact.\u201d",
      "Israel\u2019s military campaign in response to Hamas\u2019 Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attacks \u2014 which it has said killed approximately 1,200 Israelis and foreign nationals and led to some 251 hostages being taken \u2014 has killed nearly 65,000 Palestinians, according to Palestinian health officials."

At least 10 scenes with gay references were also dropped from the Chinese version of the 2018 biopic \u201cBohemian Rhapsody,\u201d about the rock musician and Queen frontman Freddie Mercury.",

      "\u201cThis wasn\u2019t a coincidence, this was triple sabotage at the UN,\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cThey ought to be ashamed of themselves. I\u2019m sending a copy of this letter to the Secretary General, and I demand an immediate investigation.\u201d",
      "In what has become a fraught back-and-forth between the White House and the General Assembly, U.N. spokesman St\u00e9phane Dujarric detailed the sequence of events that caused the escalator to halt.",
      "\"A readout of the machine's central processing unit indicated that the escalator had stopped after a built-in safety mechanism\" was \"triggered at the top of the escalator,\" likely by the White House videographer who had boarded before the president and first lady, Dujarric said. That safety mechanism \"is designed to prevent people or objects accidentally being caught and stuck in or pulled into the gearing,\" he said.",
      "That did not appear to satisfy Trump, who described the escalator as coming to a \u201cscreeching halt.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt stopped on a dime. It\u2019s amazing that Melania and I didn\u2019t fall forward onto the sharp edges of these steel steps, face first,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt was only that we were each holding the handrail tightly or, it would have been a disaster.\u201d",
      "He referenced reporting in Britain\u2019s Sunday Times newspaper that had said that U.N. staff had been overheard joking about turning off the building\u2019s escalators and elevators to highlight a funding shortfall caused by White House cuts. This reporting has not been confirmed by NBC News.",
      "\u201cThis was absolutely sabotage,\u201d Trump said, adding that the Secret Service were now involved. \u201cThe people that did it should be arrested!\u201d",
      "The is just the latest show of hostility by Trump and his supporters toward the U.N. and other such global bodies.",
      "During his speech Tuesday, he accused the U.N. of leading a \u201cglobalist migration agenda\u201d and \u201cfunding an assault on Western countries and their borders,\u201d adding that \u201cthe U.N. is supposed to stop invasions, not create them and finance them.\u201d"
