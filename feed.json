    "story": [
      "The long-running gang case involving Atlanta rapper Young Thug will end without a single murder conviction",
      "ATLANTA -- Three years after Atlanta rapper Young Thug and 27 others were indicted on gang and racketeering charges, followed by a long, problem-plagued trial, nobody will be convicted of murder.",
      "When Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis announced the indictment in May 2022, she said her office was cracking down on a violent street gang responsible for multiple killings run by Young Thug, whose real name is Jeffery Williams.",
      "But Willis dropped the only remaining murder charge Monday after defendant Demise McMullen pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of aggravated assault. Young Thug went home Oct. 31 after pleading guilty to gang, drug and gun charges and remains on probation.",
      "Prosecutors alleged that Young Thug and two others founded the street gang Young Slime Life, which was associated with the Bloods street gang, in 2012. The 33-year-old artist has a record label called Young Stoner Life, which prosecutors alleged was tied to Young Slime Life.",
      "Prosecutors drew ire for using song lyrics and social media posts in their case. Attorney Doug Weinstein, who represented defendant Deamonte Kendrick, who raps under the name Yak Gotti, said prosecutors targeted men who pursued music as a way out of hardship in economically \u201cdeprived\u201d Atlanta areas and tried to \u201cclaw them back in, hold them back down.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhatever they may have done in their youth, and I would argue most of them didn't do anything, to be targeted in this way by the prosecutors is just wrong,\u201d said Weinstein. \u201cWhatever you think of their music \u2014 the violence, the misogynistic lyrics \u2014 that is not a reason to go after these guys.\u201d",
      "Weinstein continued, adding, \u201cPeople like my client, Mr. Kendrick, had to be incarcerated for 2 1/2 years or more, in the case of some of these defendants, for a crime that they didn\u2019t do.\"",
      "Kendrick was stabbed in jail. He was one of two defendants who didn\u2019t take plea deals, and the only one cleared of all charges, including a murder charge in the 2015 drive-by shooting death of rival gang member Donovan Thomas Jr., known as \u201cBig Nut.\u201d",
      "In a statement to The Associated Press, Willis spokesperson Jeff DiSantis said \u201canti-gang efforts\u201d have yielded \u201cover 400 convictions of gang members\" since Willis became district attorney, including 19 people in this case. Those efforts were \u201ckey\u201d in making Fulton County \"safer, taking dangerous offenders off the streets and sending a message that gang activity will not be tolerated in our community,\u201d he said.",
      "Willis prosecuted the case using Georgia's broad anti-racketeering law. Critics say using that law caused a messy trial by roping in dozens of people with varying levels of alleged culpability. The anti-racketeering law allows prosecutors to present evidence that might otherwise not be allowed, which some defense attorneys say lets prosecutors present irrelevant material to the jury. It also often leads to people being held in jail longer for multiple reasons.",
      "\u201cIt made everything so much more complicated and cumbersome,\u201d said Max Schardt, defense attorney for defendant Shannon Stillwell.",
      "Stillwell was among five codefendants who stood trial alongside Young Thug beginning in November 2023.",
      "After Young Thug and the others entered guilty pleas, Stillwell and Kendrick were the only ones who took their chances with a jury. They were found not guilty of racketeering, murder and gang-related charges in December. Stillwell was found guilty only of gun possession. The verdict came nearly two years after jury selection began.",
      "Nine other defendants, including the rapper Gunna, accepted plea deals before the trial began. Prosecutors dropped charges against one defendant after he was convicted of murder in an unrelated case. Twelve defendants were split from the original trial, and charges against six of them were dismissed in early December. Another recently got a murder charge dismissed after entering an Alford plea, which allows him to maintain his innocence while acknowledging that it is in his best interest to plead guilty.",
      "McMullen, who was also charged with murder in Thomas' killing, entered an Alford plea to a lesser aggravated assault charge and another count of violating the anti-racketeering law. A judge in this case sentenced him to 40 years, with 20 to be served in confinement at the same time as the sentence he's already serving, and 20 suspended for time served. That leaves one remaining defendant who is accused of shooting and wounding an Atlanta police officer in February 2022 while on probation. His fate is expected to be determined soon.",
      "Atlanta defense attorney Andrew Fleischman, who was not involved in the case, said Willis could have secured guilty pleas years ago without a long, expensive trial if she hadn't used the anti-racketeering law.",
      "\u201cShe went for a home run, and she didn\u2019t get it,\u201d said Fleischman.",

      "As if a movie about sharks wasn't scary enough, the filmmakers behind \u201cDangerous Animals\u201d have upped the screams by adding what every thriller needs \u2014 a serial killer.",
      "While that may sound like very dangerous moviemaking, the result is actually taut and well crafted, a worthy birthday present to \u201cJaws,\u201d celebrating its 50th anniversary this summer.",
      "\u201cDangerous Animals\u201d stars Jai Courtney as an Australian boat captain who likes feeding his female customers to sharks and videotaping it, while also offering little brainy speeches about the nature of makos, mosquitos or sailfish while toying with his prey.",
      "He meets what seems like his match in Hassie Harrison's Zephyr, an American antisocial surf queen who lives in a van and refuses to be tied down. \u201cThere was nothing for me on land,\u201d she says. She's kind of a handful for any serial killer, For instance, she can pick locks with the underwire from a bikini top.",
      "Nick Lepard's screenplay is muscular and satisfying, with nods to \u201cJaws,\u201d of course, but also to \u201cPoint Break,\u201d \u201cHannibal\u201d and even the song \u201cBaby Shark.\u201d He says he was inspired to write \u201cDangerous Animals\u201d by seeing a surfboard bag and imagining it carrying a body, which says something about how Lepard's mind works, though we're not judging.",
      "Director Sean Byrnes has a super ability to build dread and his scenes are crisp without being exploitative. The movie was shot on Queensland\u2019s Gold Coast, but may take a bite out of the region's shark cage diving fleets. I'm looking twice even before taking showers now.",
      "Zephyr and the serial killer play an engaging game of chess for most of the movie, if by chess is meant she's fighting to stay alive by wriggling out of handcuffs and running or swimming away and he's determined for her to be shark food.",
      "\u201cOh, you're a fighter. I love fighters. It makes for a better show,\u201d he says, biting into the scenery almost as viciously as the sharks chomp on chum.",
      "He also does that thing that all serial killers do \u2014 saying he and his victim are similar. \u201cYou're hard as nails. Like me. You and me, we're sharks,\u201d he tells her. She tells him to stop talking so much and calls him ocean scum.",
      "The music department has a fun wink with the soundtrack. One scene uses Steve Wright's \u201cEvie (Part One)\u201d \u2014 in which the singer begs his love to let her hair hang down \u2014 as the serial killer makes mementos out of his victims' hair. Another moment, astonishingly, plays Etta James' \u201cAt Last,\u201d the ultimate wedding song, just as the bad guy finally captures his quarry inches from rescue.",
      "The setting of a boat in the middle of the Coral Sea unlocks a delicious new home for terror. Sealable hatches and no one for miles means screaming is no good. And the serial killer has weaponized Vegemite.",
      "One thing Zephyr has up her sleeve is a boy, smitten after a meet-cute in which she tries to shoplift ice cream. He's played by the hunky Josh Heuston and they're perfect for each other but she resists until she's snatched by our nasty boat captain. But even though she blew him off, her boy is suspicious about her disappearance and is on the hunt.",
      "\u201cDangerous Animals,\u201d thankfully, doesn't try to be more than it is, although the quite beautiful images of sharks sliding through the ocean show, naturally, that we are the species that inspired the title. After all, sharks don't see a surfboard bag and wonder if they can put a body in it.",
      "\u201cDangerous Animals,\u201d an IFC Films release in theaters Friday, is rated R for \u201cstrong, bloody violent content, grisly images, sexuality, language and brief drug use.\u201d Running time: 98 minutes. Three stars out of four.",

      "NEW YORK -- Kimberly Belflower knew \u201cJohn Proctor is the Villain\u201d needed its final cathartic scene to work \u2014 and, for that, it needed Lorde's \u201cGreen Light.\u201d",
      "\u201cI literally told my agent, \u2018I would rather the play just not get done if it can\u2019t use that song,\u2019\u201d the playwright laughed. She wrote Lorde a letter, explaining what the song meant, and got her green light.",
      "Starring Sadie Sink, the staggering play about high schoolers studying \u201cThe Crucible\u201d as the #MeToo movement arrives in their small Georgia town, earned seven Tony nominations, including best new play \u2014 the most of any this season. It\u2019s among a group of Broadway shows that have centered the stories of young people and attracted audiences to match.",
      "Sam Gold\u2019s Brooklyn-rave take on \u201cRomeo + Juliet,\u201d nominated for best revival of a play and led by Kit Connor and Rachel Zegler with music from Jack Antonoff, drew the youngest ticket-buying audience recorded on Broadway, producers reported, with 14% of ticket purchasers aged 18-24, compared to the industry average of 3%.",
      "The shows share some DNA: pop music (specifically the stylings of Antonoff, who also produced \u201cGreen Light\u201d), Hollywood stars with established fanbases and stories that reflect the complexity of young adulthood.",
      "\u201cIt was very clear that young people found our show because it was doing what theater\u2019s supposed to do,\u201d Gold said. \u201cBe a mirror.\u201d",
      "The themes \u201cJohn Proctor\u201d investigates aren't danced around (until they literally are). The girls are quick to discuss #MeToo's impact, intersectional feminism and sexual autonomy. Their conversations, true to teenage girlhood, are laced with comedy and pop culture references \u2014 Taylor Swift, Beyonc\u00e9, \u201cTwilight,\u201d and, of course, Lorde.",
      "Fina Strazza, 19, portrays Beth, a leader who is whip-smart and well-intentioned \u2014 but whose friendships and belief system are shaken by the play's revelations.",
      "\u201cYou have so much empathy and are so invested in her, but she still has these mishaps and slip-ups that young people often have,\u201d said Strazza, nominated for best featured actor in a play. Some audience members have given her letters detailing how Beth helped them forgive themselves for how they handled similar experiences.",
      "The script is written in prose, with frequent line breaks and infrequent capital letters. Director Danya Taymor, nominated for best direction of a play a year after winning a Tony for another teenage canon classic, \u201cThe Outsiders, \u201d was drawn to that rhythm \u2014 and how Belflower's depiction of adolescence captured its intensity, just as S.E. Hinton had.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s something about the teenage years that is so raw,\u201d Taymor said. \u201cNone of us can escape it.\u201d",
      "During his Tony-winning production of \u201cAn Enemy of the People,\u201d Gold found himself having conversations with young actors and theatergoers about climate change, politics and how \u201ctheater was something that people their age and younger really need in a different way, as the world is becoming so addicted to technology,\u201d he said.",
      "That conjured \u201cRomeo and Juliet.\u201d The original text \u201chas it all in terms of what it means to inherit the future that people older than you have created,\u201d Gold said.",
      "Building the world of this show, with an ensemble under 30, was not unlike building \u201cAn Enemy of the People,\u201d set in 19th century Norway, Gold said: \u201cI think the difference is that the world that I made for this show is something that a very hungry audience had not gotten to see.\u201d",
      "Fans, Gold correctly predicted, were ravenous. Demand ahead of the first preview prompted a preemptive extension. Word (and bootleg video) of Connor doing a pullup to kiss Zegler made the rounds. \u201cMan of the House,\u201d an Antonoff-produced ballad sung by Zegler mid-show, was released as a single. With the show premiering just before the U.S. presidential election, Voters of Tomorrow even registered new voters in the lobby.",
      "Audiences proved willing to pay: Average ticket prices hovered around $150. Cheaper rush and lottery tickets drew lines hours before the box office opened. Every week but one sold out.",
      "\u201cThe show was initially really well sold because we had a cast that appealed to a really specific audience,\u201d said producer Greg Nobile of Seaview Productions. \u201cWe continued to see the houses sell out because these audiences came, and they were all over online talking about the ways in which they actually felt seen.\u201d",
      "Thomas Laub, 28, and Alyah Chanelle Scott, 27, started Runyonland Productions for that very reason.",
      "\u201cWe both felt a lot of frustration with the industry, and the ways that we were boxed out of it as students in Michigan who were able to come to New York sparingly,\u201d Laub said. Runyonland was launched in 2018 with the premise that highlighting new, bold voices would bring change.",
      "This spring, Scott, known for playing Whitney in HBO\u2019s \u201cSex Lives of College Girls,\u201d acted off-Broadway in Natalie Margolin's \u201cAll Nighter.\u201d",
      "\u201cI was standing onstage and looking out and seeing the college kids that I was playing,\u201d Scott said. \u201cI was like, \u2018I respect you so much. I want to do you proud. I want to show you a story that represents you in a way that doesn\u2019t belittle or demean you, but uplifts you.\u2019\u201d",
      "Co-producing \u201cJohn Proctor,\u201d Scott said, gave Runyonland the opportunity to target that audience on a Broadway scale. Belflower developed the show with students as part of a The Farm College Collaboration Project. It's been licensed over 100 times for high school and college productions. The Broadway production's social and influencer marketing is run by 20-somethings, too.",
      "Previews attracted fans with a $29 ticket lottery. While average prices jumped to over $100 last week (still below the Broadway-wide average), $40 rush, lottery and standing room tickets have sold out most nights, pushing capacity over 100%. The success is validating Runyonland's mission, Laub said.",
      "\u201cAlyah doesn\u2019t believe me that I cry every time at the end,\u201d Laub said. Scott laughs. \u201cI just want to assure you, on the record, that I do indeed cry every time.\u201d",
      "The final scene of \u201cJohn Proctor\u201d is a reclamation fueled by rage and \u201cGreen Light.\u201d Capturing that electricity has been key to the show's marketing.",
      "\u201cThe pullup (in \u2018Romeo + Juliet\u2019) is so impactful because it's so real. It's like so exactly what a teenage boy would do,\u201d Taymor said. \u201cI think when you see the girls in \u2018John Proctor\u2019 screaming ... it hits you in a visceral way.\u201d That screaming made the Playbill cover.",
      "\u201cIn my opinion, the look and feel of that campaign feels different from a traditional theatrical campaign, and it feels a lot closer to a film campaign,\u201d Laub said. The show's team indeed considered the zeitgeist-infiltrating work of their sister industries, specifically studios like Neon and A24.",
      "In May, \u201cJohn Proctor is the Villain\u201d finished its second \u201cspirit week\u201d with a school spirit day. Earlier events included an ice cream social \u2014 actors served Van Leeuwen \u2014 a silent disco and a banned book giveaway. For those not in their own school's colors, the merch stand offered T-shirts, including one printed with the Walt Whitman-channeling line said by Sink's Shelby: \u201cI contain frickin' multitudes.\u201d",
      "Julia Lawrence, 26, designed the shirt after the show's team saw her TikTok video reimagining their traditional merch into something more like a concert tee.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s just so incredible to bring Gen Z into the theater that way, especially at a time when theater has never been more important,\u201d Lawrence said. \u201cIn a world that\u2019s overpowered by screens, live art can be such a powerful way to find understanding.\u201d",

      "So vividly drawn is King\u2019s fiction that it\u2019s offered the basis for some 50 feature films. For half a century, since Brian De Palma\u2019s 1976 film \u201cCarrie,\u201d Hollywood has turned, and turned again, to King\u2019s books for their richness of character, nightmare and sheer entertainment.",
      "Open any of those books up at random, and there\u2019s a decent chance you\u2019ll encounter a movie reference, too. Rita Hayworth. \u201cThe Wizard of Oz.\u201d \u201cSingin\u2019 in the Rain.\u201d Sometimes even movies based on King\u2019s books turn up in his novels. That King\u2019s books have been such fodder for the movies is owed, in part, to how much of a moviegoer their author is.",
      "\u201cI love anything from \u2018The 400 Blows\u2019 to something with that guy Jason Statham,\u201d King says, speaking by phone from his home in Maine. \u201cThe worst movie I ever saw was still a great way to spend an afternoon. The only movie I ever walked out on was \u2018Transformers.\u2019 At a certain point I said, \u2018This is just ridiculous.\u2019\u201d",
      "Over time, King has developed a personal policy in how he talks about the adaptations of his books. \u201cMy idea is: If you can\u2019t say something nice, keep your mouth shut,\u201d he says.",
      "The most notable exception was Stanley Kubrick\u2019s \u201cThe Shining,\u201d which King famously called \u201ca big beautiful Cadillac with no engine inside.\u201d But every now and then, King is such a fan of an adaptation that he\u2019s excited to talk about it. That\u2019s very much the case with \u201cThe Life of Chuck,\u201d Mike Flanagan\u2019s new adaptation of King\u2019s novella of the same name published in the 2020 collection \u201cIf It Bleeds.\u201d",
      "In \u201cThe Life of Chuck,\u201d which Neon releases in theaters Friday (nationwide June 13), there are separate storylines but the tone-setting opening is apocalyptic. The internet, like a dazed prize fighter, wobbles on its last legs before going down. California is said to be peeling away from the mainland like \u201clike old wallpaper.\u201d",
      "And yet in this doomsday tale, King is at his most sincere. \u201cThe Life of Chuck,\u201d the book and the movie, is about what matters in life when everything else is lost. There is dancing, Walt Whitman and joy.",
      "\u201cIn \u2018The Life of Chuck,\u2019 we understand that this guy\u2019s life is cut short, but that doesn\u2019t mean he doesn\u2019t experience joy,\u201d says King. \u201cExistential dread and grief and things are part of the human experience, but so is joy.\u201d",
      "It\u2019s telling that when King, our preeminent purveyor of horror, writes about doom times, he ends up scaling it down to a single life. While darkness and doom have, and probably always will, mark his work, King \u2014 a more playful, instinctual, genre-skipping writer than he\u2019s often credited as \u2014 \u201cThe Life of Chuck\u201d is a prime example of King, the humanist.",
      "\u201cAn awful lot of people assume, because he writes so much stuff that\u2019s so scary, they kind of forget the reason his horror works so well is he\u2019s always juxtaposing it with light and with love and with empathy,\u201d says Flanagan, who has twice before adapted King (\u201cDoctor Sleep,\u201d \u201cGerald\u2019s Game\u201d) and is in the midst of making a \u201cCarrie\u201d series for Amazon.",
      "\u201cYou forget that \u2018It\u2019 isn\u2019t about the clown, it\u2019s about the kids and their friendship,\" adds Flanagan. \u201c\u2018The Stand\u2019 isn\u2019t about the virus or the demon taking over the world, it\u2019s ordinary people who have to come together and stand against a force they cannot defeat.\u201d",
      "King, 77, has now written somewhere around 80 books, including the just released \u201cNever Flinch.\u201d The mystery thriller brings back King\u2019s recent favorite protagonist, the private investigator Holly Gibney, who made her stand-alone debut in \u201cIf It Bleeds.\u201d It\u2019s Gibney\u2019s insecurities, and her willingness to push against them, that has kept King returning to her.",
      "\u201cIt gave me great pleasure to see Holly grow into a more confident person,\u201d King says. \u201cShe never outgrows all of her insecurities, though. None of us do.\u201d",
      "\u201cNever Flinch\u201d is a reminder that King has always been less of a genre-first writer than a character-first one. He tends to fall in love with a character and follow them through thick and thin.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m always happy writing. That\u2019s why I do it so much,\u201d King says, chuckling. \u201cI\u2019m a very chipper guy because I get rid of all that dark stuff in the books.\u201d",
      "Dark stuff, as King says, hasn\u2019t been hard to come by lately, he grants. The kind of climate change disaster found in \u201cThe Life of Chuck,\u201d King says, often dominates his anxieties.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re creeping up little by little on being the one country who does not acknowledge it\u2019s a real problem with carbon in the atmosphere,\u201d King says. \u201cThat\u2019s crazy. Certain right wing politicians can talk all they want about how we\u2019re saving the world for our grandchildren. They don\u2019t care about that. They care about money.\u201d",
      "On social media, King has been a sometimes critic of President Donald Trump, whose second term has included battles with the arts, academia and public financing for PBS and NPR. Over the next four years, King predicts, \u201cCulture is going to go underground.\u201d",
      "In \u201cNever Finch,\u201d Holly Gibney is hired as a bodyguard by a women\u2019s rights activist whose lecture tour is being plagued by mysterious acts of violence. In the afterward of the book, King includes a tribute to \u201csupporters of women\u2019s right to choose who have been murdered for doing their duty.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sure they\u2019re not going to like that,\u201d King says of right-wing critics.",
      "The original germ for \u201cThe Life of Chuck\u201d had nothing to do with current events. One day in Boston, King noticed a drummer busking on Boylston Street. He had the vision of a businessman in a suit who, walking by, can\u2019t resist dancing with abandon to the drummer\u2019s beat.",
      "King, a self-acknowledged dancer (though only in private, he notes), latched onto a story that would turn on the unpredictable nature of people, tracing the inner life of that imagined passerby. In the film, he\u2019s played by Tom Hiddleston. Chuck first appears, oddly, on a billboard that haunts and confuses a local teacher (Chiwetel Ejiofor) who's struggling to get his students to care about literature or education with the possible end of the world encroaching.",
      "It\u2019s a funny but maybe not coincidental irony that many of the best King adaptations, like \u201cStand By Me\u201d and \u201cThe Shawshank Redemption,\" have come from the author\u2019s more warm-hearted tales. \u201cThe Life of Chuck,\u201d which won the People\u2019s Choice Award last fall at the Toronto International Film Festival, is after a similar spirit.",
      "When King reached out about attending the TIFF world premiere, Flanagan was shocked. The last time King had done that for one of his own adaptations was 26 years ago, for \u201cThe Green Mile.\u201d That movie, like \u201cThe Shawshank Redemption\u201d were box-office disappointments, King recalls, a fate he's hoping \u201cThe Life of Chuck\u201d can avoid.",
      "\u201cHe views this movie as something that\u2019s a bit precious,\u201d says Flanagan. \u201cHe\u2019s said a few things to me in the past about how earnest it is, how this is a story without an ounce of cynicism. As it was being released into a cynical world, I think he felt protective of it. I think this one really means something to him.\u201d",
      "The Stephen King industrial complex, meanwhile, keeps rolling along. Coming just this year are series of \u201cWelcome to Derry\u201d and \u201cThe Institute\u201d and a film of \u201cThe Long Walk.\u201d King, himself, just finished a draft of \u201cTalisman 3.\u201d",
      "If \u201cThe Life of Chuck\u201d has particular meaning to King, it could be because it represents something intrinsic about his own life. Chuck's small, seemingly unremarkable existence has grace and meaning because, as Whitman is quoted, he \"contains multitudes\u201d that surprise and delight him. King's fiction is evidence \u2014 heaps of it \u2014 that he does, too.",
      "\u201cThere are some days where I sit down and I think, \u2018This is going to be a really good day,\u2019 and it\u2019s not, at all,\u201d says King. \u201cThen other days I sit down and think to myself, \u2018I\u2019m really tired and don\u2019t feel like doing this,\u2019 and then it catches fire. You never know what you\u2019re going to get.\u201d",

      "\u201cWicked\u201d star Cynthia Erivo will release her sophomore solo album on Friday",
      "NEW YORK -- It began as it always should, with her voice.",
      "The second solo album from Cynthia Erivo, fresh off a herculean press run with the success of the first \u201cWicked\u201d film, was always meant to be \u201cvocal-focused,\u201d she told The Associated Press recently. It may be the understatement of a lifetime: to know her is to know her instrument \u2014 that range, the notes few else can hit but many attempt.",
      "And Erivo's new soulful album, the evocatively titled \u201cI Forgive You,\" hits the mark.",
      "In the studio, that meant using her vocals \u201cas the pads, as the stacking,\u201d like an artist might with a guitar or piano. \u201cThe meat of each of the pieces that you listen to is the voice,\u201d she says, \u201cSo that you can hear the lyrics, you can hear the song, you can hear the emotion in it,\u201d she explains. The other instruments, too, were performed live. \"Everything you hear in there is real and tangible.\u201d",
      "For that reason \u2014 and other expressions of autonomy take across the album \u2014 she says it felt like her first. For the listener, it evokes a real feeling of intimacy.",
      "Erivo spoke to the AP about \u201cI Forgive You,\u201d life after \u201cWicked\" and the forthcoming \u201cWicked: For Good,\u201d and the ways in which acting, singing and writing inform one another.",
      "This interview has been edited for length and clarity.",
      "ERIVO: This album is a collection of stories and songs that are both personal for things that are happening now, things that have happened in the past, and I think some of which I have had to forgive people for. And honestly, some of which I\u2019ve had to forgive myself for. And I loved the idea of calling it this title, because it\u2019s a simple concept, but not an easy one. And not one that we as humans are very good at, often.",
      "A part of me was feeling, like, \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be wonderful if people had to keep repeating the words, 'I forgive you?'\u201d So even if you\u2019re finding it difficult to say this album will give you the permission to actually say the words, even if you\u2019re not quite ready.",
      "ERIVO: The concept of being a work in progress \u2014 who still gets scared of things, who still has to deal with things \u2014 that won\u2019t ever necessarily stop. It might get quiet, but that feeling doesn\u2019t necessarily always go away. I just wanted to be honest, and I think that \u201cReplay\u201d was probably the first song that I put out was because I felt like it was sort of a reintroduction to the inner part of me that most people might not really know.",
      "But it\u2019s also a tricky song in that it\u2019s fun, it\u2019s kind of upbeat, and if you actually listen, you hear that there\u2019s like a person who\u2019s a little bit fragile, a person whose trying to figure some things out, a person who\u2019s been through some things, who\u2019s dealt with things, who has abandonment issues, who has fear, who an inferiority complex sometimes, who wants to help everyone, who wants to save everyone, but gets it wrong.",
      "Those are human, human things that I want to share.",
      "ERIVO: No apprehension about writing it, a little apprehension about sharing it, because it\u2019s honest. But once it\u2019s done, what can you do? It\u2019s time to share.",
      "ERIVO: They feed each other. When I sing, I feel free and I feel open, which means that when I go and act \u2014 because I\u2019ve given myself that experience \u2014 the want to close off again sort of goes away. So, when I\u2019m on a set, I\u2019m as open as I am when I am singing. I\u2019m waiting to receive whatever I\u2019m getting from my counterpart or whoever\u2019s opposite me so I can actually listen. Because the act of writing and singing actually is also the act of listening.",
      "ERIVO: I had a sort of level of anonymity that I think I got used to and I really kind of enjoyed. That isn\u2019t necessarily there anymore, which is still really lovely because people are kind and sweet, and I\u2019m really grateful for it. But that\u2019s an adjustment, to realize that you can\u2019t just walk into a store and no one will know who you are, or you can\u2019t get on a plane, and no one will there you are. That\u2019s a new thing that I didn\u2019t expect or wasn't seeking.",
      "ERIVO: We have a couple pickups and then we\u2019re done.",
      "ERIVO: I\u2019m so proud of it. We spent a lot of time on it. We worked really, really hard on it. There was no stone unturned on it because I love what I do, and I love music, and I loved making it.",
      "So just know that this was made with a lot of love.",

      "Getting to call a Stanley Cup Final for the third time on national television would qualify as the top moment of the year for most announcers.",
      "For TNT's Kenny Albert, it is another accomplishment in a year that has been filled with many, especially over the past nine months.",
      "Wednesday's Game 1 between the Florida Panthers and Edmonton Oilers will be Albert's 1,483rd call in hockey, football or baseball for a national network. He moved past his father, the legendary Marv Albert, into fourth place among North American announcers during last Wednesday's Game 5 of the Eastern Conference final between Florida and Carolina.",
      "\u201cTo be listed along with some of the all-time greats who I watched growing up and then got to know a lot of them personally, it\u2019s a proud moment when you see that you\u2019re included in that group,\u201d Albert said. \u201cMy schedule definitely is a bit of a jigsaw puzzle between the various sports and networks, but very fortunate to work for and with so many great people.\u201d",
      "Albert surpassed the 500 games mark in both the NFL and NHL within a six-month period.",
      "He became the first NFL play-by-play announcer to reach 500 games on one network last October when the Philadelphia Eagles hosted the Cleveland Browns in a game televised by Fox. He has been with Fox Sports since its beginning in 1994.",
      "He surpassed 500 national NHL games on Dec. 18 when the Philadelphia Flyers faced the Detroit Red Wings on TNT. Albert has been TNT's top hockey announcer since it got the rights in 2021.",
      "All told, Albert has done 534 NHL, 512 NFL, 421 baseball and 15 NBA games on a national broadcast or cable network. That is on top of his other duties as New York Rangers radio voice and backup for New York Knicks television games on MSG Network.",
      "Albert's versatility to do a plethora of different sports was something he picked up from his father. Even though Marv Albert's signature sport was the NBA, he also did the NFL and NHL along with hosting the baseball pregame show during the late 1980s on NBC.",
      "\u201cI've always loved the variety,\u201d Kenny Albert said.",
      "For all of the aforementioned accomplishments, though, the highlight of Albert's year so far was calling Alex Ovechkin's 895th NHL goal on April 6 to break Wayne Gretzky's career record. Albert's call during the second period, when the Washington Capitals star set the record against the New York Islanders, relayed excitement while also mentioning the goal number and then going silent so that the crowd and scenes from the crowd could take over.",
      "\u201cIn a championship situation or big moment, I don't usually write something out, but I do throw some words around in my mind just to be ready,\u201d Albert said. \"I was thinking something with his nickname, the Great Eight, the great Gretzky. When he tied the record, Joe Beninati (the Capitals TV announcer) used something similar to that, so I wanted to shift over to something else and not use some of the same words he did.",
      "\u201cWhen it happened, it just came out naturally. I mentioned No. 895 and then I just got out of the way. It was very important after the call to just lay out and let the production folks do their thing. Let the pictures and sound tell the story.\u201d",
      "According to TV database research compiled by Un/Necessary Sports Research, the late Bob Cole, who called the games for CBC\u2019s \u201cHockey Night in Canada\u201d for 50 years, leads the way at 1,722 (all hockey) games; followed by Dick Stockton, who did basketball, baseball and football for CBS and Fox, with 1,544; and Canadian play-by-play announcer Chris Cuthbert with 1,539. Cuthbert, the current lead voice for \u201cHockey Night in Canada\u201d will surpass Stockton if the Stanley Cup Final goes six games.",
      "Kevin Harlan is sixth at 1,477 and should surpass Marv Albert (1,481) for fifth during Week 5 of the upcoming NFL season.",
      "This will be the 11th Stanley Cup Final for Albert, including eight on radio, but the first where he has called a rematch from the previous year. This is the first final rematch since the Detroit Red Wings and Pittsburgh Penguins in 2009 and the second over the past 40 years.",
      "\u201cIt has a chance to be one of the all-time great championship series,\" Albert said. \"These same teams played a scintillating seven-game series last June. Star power on both sides. Edmonton attempting to win Canada\u2019s first Cup since 1993. Florida looking to repeat. Can Connor McDavid match Wayne Gretzky and Sidney Crosby and win his first Stanley Cup against the team that beat his club in the Cup Final the year before? I can\u2019t wait.\u201d",

      "British writer Bernardine Evaristo has won the Women\u2019s Prize Outstanding Contribution Award for her \u201ctransformative impact on literature.\u201d",
      "LONDON -- LONDON (AP) \u2014 Bernardine Evaristo doesn't like boundaries.",
      "For the Booker Prize -winning novelist, rules about genre, grammar or what a working-class biracial woman can achieve are all to be challenged and swept away.",
      "Evaristo was announced Wednesday as recipient of the 100,000-pound ($135,000) Women\u2019s Prize Outstanding Contribution Award for her \u201ctransformative impact on literature and her unwavering dedication to uplifting under-represented voices.\"",
      "Evaristo, 66, received the prize both for her work to help promote women and writers of color, and for writing that takes in poetry, a memoir and seven novels including the Booker-winning \u201cGirl, Woman, Other.\u201d",
      "\u201cI just go wherever my imagination takes me,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to write the kind of novels that would take you on a predictable emotional or moral journey.\u201d",
      "Evaristo had already explored autobiographical fiction, historical settings and alternate realities when she won the Booker in 2019 for \u201cGirl Woman, Other,\u201d a polyphonic novel told from the point of view of a dozen characters, largely Black women, with widely varying ages, experiences and sexualities.",
      "She was the first woman of African heritage to be awarded the prize, which was founded in 1969 and has a reputation for transforming writers\u2019 careers.",
      "When she won, Evaristo was 60 and had been a writer for decades. She says the recognition \u201ccame at the right time for me.\u201d",
      "\u201cMaybe I wouldn\u2019t have handled it so well if I was younger,\u201d she told The Associated Press at her London home. \u201cIt changed my career \u2013- in terms of book sales, foreign rights, translation, the way in which I was viewed as a writer. Various other opportunities came my way. And I felt that I had the foundations to handle that.\u201d",
      "Evaristo\u2019s house on a quiet suburban street is bright and comfortable, with wooden floors, vibrant textiles and a large wooden writing desk by the front window. Large photos of her Nigerian paternal grandparents hang on one wall. Her work often draws on her roots as the London-born child of a Nigerian father and white British mother.",
      "Like much of Evaristo\u2019s work, \u201cGirl, Woman, Other\u201d eludes classification. She calls it \u201cfusion fiction\u201d for its melding of poetry and prose into a novel that relishes the texture and rhythm of language.",
      "\u201cI kind of dispense with the rules of grammar,\u201d she said. \u201cI think I have 12 full stops in the novel.\u201d",
      "If that sounds dauntingly experimental, readers didn\u2019t think so. \u201cGirl, Woman, Other\u201d has sold more than 1 million copies and was chosen as one of Barack Obama\u2019s books of the year.",
      "Evaristo traces her love of poetry to the church services of her Catholic childhood, where she soaked up the rhythms of the Bible and sermons, \u201cwithout realizing I was absorbing poetry.\u201d",
      "When she started writing novels, the love of poetry remained, along with a desire to tell stories of the African diaspora. One of her first major successes, \u201cThe Emperor\u2019s Babe,\u201d is a verse novel set in Roman Britain.",
      "\u201cMost people think the Black history of Britain only began in the 20th century,\u201d Evaristo said. \u201cI wanted to write about a Black presence in Roman Britain -\u2013 because there was a Black presence in Roman Britain 1,800 years ago.\u201d",
      "Another novel, \u201cBlonde Roots,\u201d is set in an alternative historical timeline in which Africans have enslaved Europeans, and was nominated for a major science-fiction award.",
      "\u201cMr Loverman,\u201d which centers on a closeted gay 70-something Antiguan Londoner, was an attempt to move beyond cliched images of Britain\u2019s postwar Caribbean immigrants. It was recently made into a BBC television series starring Lennie James and Sharon D. Clarke.",
      "Her latest award is a one-off accolade marking the 30th anniversary of the annual Women\u2019s Prizes for English-language fiction and nonfiction.",
      "Women\u2019s Prize founder Kate Mosse said Evaristo\u2019s \u201cdazzling skill and imagination, and her courage to take risks and offer readers a pathway into diverse and multifarious worlds over a 40-year career made her the ideal recipient.\u201d",
      "Evaristo, who teaches creative writing at Brunel University of London, plans to use the prize money to help other women writers through an as-yet undisclosed project.",
      "She has long been involved with projects to level the playing field for under-represented writers, and is especially proud of Complete Works, a mentoring program for poets of color that she ran for a decade.",
      "\u201cI set that up because I initiated research into how many poets of color were getting published in Britain at that time, and it was under 1%\u201d of the total, she said. A decade later, it was 10%.",
      "\"It really has helped shift the poetry landscape in the U.K.,\" she said.",
      "Evaristo followed \u201cGirl, Woman, Other\u201d with \u201cManifesto,\u201d a memoir that recounts the stark racism of her 1960s London childhood, as well as her lifelong battle for creative expression and freedom.",
      "If Evaristo grew up as an outsider, these days she is ensconced in the arts establishment: professor, Booker winner, Officer of the Order of the British Empire, or OBE, and president of the 200-year-old Royal Society of Literature.",
      "That milestone -\u2013 she\u2019s the first person of color and the second woman to head the RSL -\u2013 has not been trouble-free. The society has been ruffled by free speech tows and arguments over attempts to bring in younger writers and diversify its ranks -\u2013 moves seen by some as watering down the accolade of membership.",
      "Evaristo doesn\u2019t want to talk about the controversy, but notes that as figurehead president she does not run the society.",

      "While Joss\u2019 husband has claimed the person who killed the actor yelled \u201cviolent homophobic slurs\u201d before opening fire, San Antonio police have said they\u2019ve found \u201cno evidence whatsoever to indicate that Mr. Joss\u2019 murder was related to his sexual orientation.\u201d Police did not respond to multiple emails on Tuesday seeking additional information on the cause of the shooting.",

      "Joss' childhood home, where he still lived, burned down in January. He lost all his belongings and his three dogs were killed in the blaze. A GoFundMe account had been set up to help Joss and his husband, Tristan Kern de Gonzales, get back on their feet.",
      "\u201cWe may have lost our home, but not our hope. We\u2019re moving forward with love, humor, and a little elbow grease\u2026and we\u2019re incredibly grateful for every ounce of support,\u201d Joss said in a May 14 Facebook post in which he indicated he was in Los Angeles looking for a new home.",

      "In a statement, de Gonzales alleged that when Ceja Alvarez opened fire, Joss pushed his husband out of the way and saved his life.",

      "Actor Chris Pratt, who worked with Joss on \u201cParks and Recreation,\u201d fondly remembered the actor in an Instagram story on Monday. Both actors had also appeared in the 2016 remake of \u201cThe Magnificent Seven.\u201d",

      "LOS ANGELES -- A federal judge sentenced disbarred celebrity lawyer Tom Girardi to seven years and three months in prison on Tuesday for embezzling tens of millions of dollars from his clients, including several with severe physical injuries and families of people killed in accidents.",
      "U.S. District Judge Josephine L. Staton also ordered Girardi, 86, to pay a $35,000 fine and $2.3 million in restitution to former clients. A jury in August found him guilty of four counts of wire fraud, and he could have been sentenced to up to 80 years in prison.",
      "Girardi is the estranged husband of \u201cThe Real Housewives of Beverly Hills\u201d star Erika Jayne and appeared on the show himself dozens of times between 2015 and 2020.",
      "He was once among the most prominent lawyers in the nation, often representing victims of major disasters against powerful companies. One lawsuit against California\u2019s Pacific Gas and Electric utility led to a $333 million settlement and was portrayed in the 2000 Julia Roberts film \u201cErin Brockovich.\u201d",
      "But his law empire collapsed, and he was disbarred in California in 2022 over client thefts.",
      "Girardi has been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, and issues with his memory led another court to put him in a conservatorship under his brother. But on Monday, Staton ruled that he was mentally competent to be sentenced, just as she had previously found him mentally competent to stand trial.",
      "The judge had allowed him to remain free until his sentencing but ordered him to surrender to authorities by July 17.",
      "An email to Girardi\u2019s attorney seeking comment on the conviction was not immediately answered.",
      "Former clients who testified against Girardi at his trial included an Arizona woman whose husband was killed in a boat accident and victims who were burned in a 2010 gas pipeline explosion in San Bruno, south of San Francisco.",
      "Prosecutors played jurors voicemails in which Girardi gave a litany of false reasons money that a court had awarded could not be paid, including tax and debt obligations and judge authorizations. He frequently told them, \u201cDon't be mad at me.\u201d",

      "\u201cThere\u2019s so much in this play,\u201d says Young, who plays an outsider who witnesses the implosion. \u201cLike a lot of the great writers, he creates these universes in a line or the space between the words.\u201d",
      "\u201cPurpose\u201d is set in the Jasper family\u2019s living room in an upper-middle-class neighborhood in Chicago. The patriarch is Pastor Solomon Jasper, a Civil Rights legend, and his steely wife, Claudine.",

      "\u201cI feel connected to that core of her,\u201d says Young. \u201cEvery single play I've done since my 10-minute play festivals, I\u2019m always like, \u2018Wow, this feels like this can change the world,\u2019 you know?

She approaches every day with joy and curiosity and enthusiasm.\u201d",
      "If there's one story that shows who Young is, it would be from the day of the Met Gala, which she and cast members of \u201cPurpose\u201d were invited, along with its playwright. That same day, Jacobs-Jenkins won the Pulitzer Prize for drama.",
      "Young found out while getting her makeup done and began screaming. When she got to the gala \u2014 a look-at-me moment, if there ever was one \u2014 she was a walking advertisement for the play. \u201cI told everybody, \u2018You have to come and see this play.

      "The content has drawn a mix of praise from fans for working with local nonprofits to support previously unfunded projects and pushback from critics who accused Donaldson of exploiting vulnerable people for clickbait \u201cinspiration porn.\u201d Campaigns have involved treating rheumatic heart disease in Nigeria and protecting endangered animals in Kenya. Other examples include building wells in countries across Africa and covering the cost of cataract surgery for 1,000 people.",
      "The call also signals Donaldson\u2019s continued philanthropic presence after comments suggesting he would get \u201cless hate\u201d if he stepped away from philanthropy altogether. Responding to allegations that he uses philanthropy as a shield, Donaldson said he thinks \u201cit paints a negative spotlight on me.\u201d",
      "\u201cPeople hate me more because I do good,\u201d Donaldson said in a conversation uploaded last November on the YouTube channel oompaville. \u201cMaybe that\u2019s too crazy of a statement. I\u2019m not trying to sound like a victim here or anything.\u201d",

      "Monday\u2019s announcement comes shortly after Amazon Prime Video renewed Beast Games for two more seasons. The reality competition series pitted 1,000 contestants against each other for a $5 million grand prize that doubled in the Feb. 13 finale.

      "When he was first asked to lead the Broadway hit musical \u201cDeath Becomes Her,\u201d director and choreographer Christopher Gattelli loved it, but refused to work on the big, splashy opening number",
      "NEW YORK -- When he was first asked to helm the Broadway hit musical \u201cDeath Becomes Her,\u201d director and choreographer Christopher Gattelli loved it, but refused to work on the big, splashy opening number. It was just too delicious.",
      "\u201cWhen they sent it to me, I was cooking and I burnt dinner because my mind was spinning,\" he says. \"I was, like, \u2018This is a gift. I will never get an opening number like this again.\u2019\u201d",
      "So Gattelli worked out everything else about how to put Robert Zemeckis\u2019 1992 comic cult classic onto a stage and only then turned to the big, brassy song, \u201cFor the Gaze,\u201d a winking valentine to gay men, punning along the way.",
      "\u201cI was able to do the show and then have my full brain on that number because I knew the potential of what it could be,\u201d he says.",
      "What Gattelli crafted is an opening number for the ages, led by Megan Hilty: There are mid-song costume changes, dance breaks, chorus boys hoisting Hilty, spangly jumpsuits and tuxedos, high-kicking Vegas showgirls with feather headdresses, a body double doing somersaults, a rainbow flag of top-hatted dancers, and Hilty doing a Liza Minnelli cameo, all ending with the grand finale of Hilty as Judy Garland's Dorothy from \u201cThe Wizard of Oz,\u201d complete with a little stuffed dog.",
      "\u201cI heard the pocket in that song, and I was like, \u2018I know there\u2019s a giant laugh there. I can hear giant laughs, what\u2019s that giant laugh?'\u201d says Gattelli. \u201cWhat\u2019s the biggest gay reference? Then I literally I just worked backwards.\u201d",
      "That number telegraphs to the audience exactly what to expect for the rest of the night \u2014 a perfectly rehearsed, lushly costumed, silly, self-aware comedy.",
      "\u201cOnce we hit \u2018For the Gaze,\u2019 the audience knows exactly what the show is,\" he says. \"And then I think they\u2019re in for the ride.\u201d",
      "The work on \u201cFor the Gaze\u201d has helped Gattelli see his show earn 10 Tony Award nominations, including one for his Broadway debut as a director and another for his choreography.",
      "The musical is based on the film, which starred Meryl Streep as a self-centered actor and Goldie Hawn as her suffering-in-the-shadows writer friend. Their mutual desperate measures for achieving eternal youth turn comically grotesque. Hilty plays the Streep role, while Jennifer Simard plays the Hawn one.",
      "\u201cIt felt like just the perfect fit for what I do and what I love to do,\" Gattelli says. \"I love comedy and I love to direct comedy and I love to do these big splashy numbers. It felt like everything I\u2019ve been itching to do.\u201d",
      "Gattelli \u2014 who was a dancer in the original \u201cCats\u201d \u2014 has been a mainstay on Broadway of late, able to choreograph such venerable works as \u201cThe King and I\u201d and \u201cMy Fair Lady\u201d but also irreverent musicals as \u201cSpongeBob SquarePants\u201d and the jukebox variety, like \u201cThe Cher Show.\u201d",
      "He made his directing debut off-Broadway in 2011 with \u201cSilence!\u201d a parody musical of \u201cThe Silence of the Lambs,\u201d complete with a chorus of dancing lambs running across the stage.",
      "Lowe Cunningham, lead producer of \u201cDeath Becomes Her,\u201d saw it in Los Angeles and later asked Gattelli about the experience, how he collaborated and his approach to the work. She was impressed by his openness to all ideas and his caring.",
      "\u201cI think first and foremost, his talent is clear and it\u2019s been out there in the world of choreography for a long time. He is innovative, he does things other people aren\u2019t doing, but the other thing is that he\u2019s renowned as being an incredibly kind human being,\u201d she says.",
      "Gattelli, who won a 2012 Tony for choreographing \u201cNewsies the Musical\u201d \u2014 one of his show-stopping moments was dancers sliding on newspapers \u2014 was brought in relatively late to \u201cDeath Becomes Her,\u201d only a year and half before opening on Broadway.",
      "\u201cIt was a great lesson in trusting your instincts,\u201d he says. \u201cThey said, \u2018We want a lush, opulent, sexy, magical sparkling evening.\u2019 And we just started taking big swings.\u201d",
      "It started with \u2014 of all things \u2014 the curtain. The audience filing into the theater is greeted by a purple, royal fabric. \u201cWhen people walk in, they immediately feel like that it\u2019s lush and sexy and mysterious.\u201d",
      "The musical is filled with very funny special effects that are decidedly low-tech. At one point, the two leading ladies are replaced by two men duking it out in dresses and wigs. The audience roars at the deception and Gattelli even advised one of the male combatants not to shave his arm hair.",
      "\u201cThe audience is in on the joke,\u201d he says. \u201cI love that they go on that ride with us. They\u2019re laughing with us. We\u2019re all laughing together and it feels good.\u201d",
      "One scene from the movie needed a lot of planning to make it on stage: The tumble down the elegant mansion stairs by Hilty's character. Hollywood CGI magic would have to be replicated by Broadway ingenuity.",
      "\u201cThe people that know the movie and the fans especially are going to go, \u2018How are they going to do it?\u2019 It was keeping me up at night forever because we tried everything,\u201d says Gattelli.",
      "The creative team \u2014 which also included set designer Derek McLane, lighting designer Justin Townsend and sound designer Peter Hylenski \u2014 decided to make it a dance punctuated by sound effects.",
      "Warren Yang \u2014 an actor with a gymnastics background \u2014 wears Hilty's outfit and a wig as he tumbles slowly, acrobatically and theatrically down the stairs, somersaulting as thunder sounds crash and we hear what seems like bones cracking. (The stairs were made of the rubber Neoprene for safety.)",
      "\u201cThere are very simple techniques that make a big impact,\u201d says Gattelli. \u201cI just went back to it\u2019s a beautiful, lush, gorgeous show, but, at the core, it\u2019s just theatrical magic and stagecraft.\u201d",

      "Disney\u2019s live-action hybrid \u201cLilo & Stitch\u201d took first place again with $63 million from 4,410 locations in North America. It was enough to pass \u201cSinners\u201d to become the second-highest grossing movie of the year with $280.1 million in domestic ticket sales. Globally, its running total is $610.8 million. \u201cSinners,\u201d meanwhile, is still going strong in its seventh weekend with another $5.2 million, bumping it to $267.1 million domestically and $350.1 million globally.",

With $122.6 million in domestic tickets sold, it\u2019s performing in line with the two previous installments. But with a reported production budget of $400 million, profitability is a ways off.

      "Canada\u2019s wildfire season is off to an intense start",
      "While images of wildfires capture their ferocity, data can provide insight into how bad a fire season is.",
      "Such is the case with two graphics, powered by satellite data, that showcase a Canadian wildfire season off to a wild \u2014 and scary \u2014 start.",
      "Twice a day a NASA satellite sends images to the ground, giving a real-time view of where fires are burning. This is especially useful for remote areas where no sensors are stationed.",
      "As of Tuesday that satellite had picked up four times as many fire hot spots across Canada than is typical for early June. That\u2019s more than any year since the satellite began transmitting in 2012, except 2023, according to data from Global Forest Watch.",
      "Though the satellite has recorded thousands of hot spots so far this year, that does not mean there are actually that many active fires. Each hot spot could be detected repeatedly over the course of days. And because each detection is about the size of 26 football fields, it can represent part of a much larger blaze, said James MacCarthy, wildfire research manager at Global Forest Watch.",
      "Based on data from the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre, about 200 fires are actively burning in Canada and have consumed about 7,700 square miles (19,900 square kilometers) of terrain, most of it in the last week.",
      "Only 2023 saw such high numbers so early in Canada's fire season, which runs from April through October. That year wildfires burned a record 67,000 square miles \u2014 more than twice the surface area of Lake Superior, the largest of the Great Lakes.",
      "Taken together, the hot spots and acres burned mean 2025 is the second-worst start to the season in years.",
      "\u201cA warm and dry finish to May and early June has created a significant fire season,\u201d said Liam Buchart, a fire weather specialist with the Canadian Forest Service.",
      "The weather conditions are made more likely by climate change and encourage wildfires to start. That means even though 90% of wildfires in Manitoba this year have been human-caused, according to the provincial government, climate change helps enable their spread.",
      "\u201cClimate change is creating the conditions that make it more likely that human-caused fires are going to spread, or even start,\u201d MacCarthy said. \u201cIt might be a human starting it, but it\u2019s going to spread quickly because now there\u2019s hot and dry conditions that are occurring more frequently and more intensely than they have in the past.\u201d",
      "The hot and dry weather is likely to to continue for at least the next week across Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta, according to Natural Resources Canada. The agency\u2019s forecasts also call for \u201ca warmer and drier than normal July and August for large portions of Canada,\u201d Buchart said.",
      "\u201cThe remainder of the fire season looks to remain above normal, especially over the northern prairie provinces and southern British Columbia,\u201d he said.",

      "Lubbock County \u2014 which has seen 53 cases and is the closest metro area to Gaines County \u2014 was just below 95% before the pandemic, but dropped three percentage points after to 91.8%.",
      "El Paso County on the border of Mexico has had the third-most measles cases in Texas this year with 57. Its vaccination rate is higher than 95% but saw a 2.1 percentage-point decline to 96.5%.",

      "Haskell County dropped 18 percentage points to 65%. And Stevens County dropped 0.5 percentage points to 90.5%.",
      "Colorado's outbreak, which is linked to an international flight that landed at the Denver airport in mid-May, involves six cases: five in state residents and one out-of-state traveler.",
      "Two people who got measles live in Arapahoe County in the Denver metro, where the vaccination rate dropped 3.5 percentage points to 88.4%. Three others live in El Paso County, home to Colorado Springs, where the vaccination rate dropped 3.8 percentage points to 80% post-pandemic.",

      "It might start when you realize you can\u2019t hear the doorbell, or certain ringtones",
      "NEW YORK -- My first tip-off were the little things, the high-pitched little things: the doorbell and ringtones my kids could hear but I could not.",
      "Then it was the garbled-sounding conversations, and the accompanying annoyance of having to ask people to repeat themselves. Or worse, giving up and just playing along without being able to follow everything that was being said.",
      "Even then, I stalled for years before finally going through the process of getting a hearing aid. How do you even begin? Will it look clunky and make me feel like a dinosaur? And the cost!",
      "Getting a hearing test, and confirmation that I needed a hearing aid, was just the beginning.",
      "The doctor handed me a list of places I could go to get fitted. I made some calls and narrowed it down to the places that took my insurance and my zero-interest health care credit card.",
      "The first couple places were demoralizing: I walked in, was told it\u2019d be $7,000 for the \u201cbest\u201d option (they mysteriously didn\u2019t happen to have any other options handy), then marched right back out the door, utterly discouraged.",
      "I started asking friends and neighbors whether they wore a hearing aid, or knew anyone at all with a hearing aid, and could point me to a good audiologist.",
      "It took a lot of poking around, but I found one \u2014 and it made all the difference.",
      "I\u2019ve been wearing my hearing aids for several months now, and they are as easy as slipping on a pair of glasses, are almost invisible, have reconnected me with the world, and, as crazy as this may sound, they bring me joy.",
      "After talking with a few audiologists around the country, it turns out that my experience is pretty typical.",
      "\u201cThere are a lot of people who stall before getting one,\u201d says Meagan P. Bachmann, director of audiology at Atrium Health Wake Forest Baptist, in North Carolina.",
      "\u201cHearing is important because it connects us with people,\u201d she says. \u201cMultiple studies show that not hearing can affect your ability to connect with others and participate in life, so you have to think of it in terms of overall health. Maybe you no longer go to family events, or you don\u2019t understand your doctor. People start to withdraw. A lot of people come in because it\u2019s gotten so bad that it is impacting their relationships.\u201d",
      "To speed up the process and make it less frustrating, here\u2019s what the pros recommend:",
      "1. Get tested, take the results seriously, and know that many if not most hearing aids these days are small, nearly invisible, rechargeable, and pretty easy to wear and maintain. And believe it or not, hearing aids can be fun \u2014 these days, there are colors to choose from and ways to bejewel them. One company, Deafmetal, makes jazzy-looking \u201csafety rings\u201d to help keep hearing aids in place.",
      "2. Shop for an expert audiologist. Look for someone who takes your insurance or any sort of medical credit card you might have, or has a payment plan of some kind, if needed. This is a world at the awkward juncture of consumerism and medical care, but a good audiologist should come across as a medical provider, not a salesperson. And a good audiologist should take the time to work with you to find a hearing aid that meets your individual needs, and also fits your budget.",
      "A good place to start is often with your doctor; with the American Academy of Audiologists, which lists providers on its website; or by word of mouth.",
      "\u201cAlthough all hearing aids are amplifiers, not everybody needs the same thing,\u201d says Bachmann. \u201cFitting a hearing aid is an art. It changes the acoustics, and everyone is different. You want someone who listens to your lifestyle needs. Do you have a lot of difficulty with noise? Are you mostly in quiet situations? How much technology do you need, and what kind?\u201d",
      "Greta Stamper, an audiologist at the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida, agrees. \u201cHearing loss is not a one-time thing. It\u2019s a chronic health condition. It should be a partnership between you and your audiologist,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s someone asking you what you\u2019re looking for and how it\u2019s going. You shouldn\u2019t feel pressured or pushed.\u201d",
      "3. A note on cost. Although hearing aids can be pricey, there are affordable options, and a good audiologist should be able to let you try out options at several price points. Insurance often covers much of the cost, and there are ways to pay for the remaining cost in installments. Also, avoidance has pretty high costs as well, audiologists say, and the longer the wait, the harder it may be to solve the problem with a hearing aid. Although there are cheaper hearing aids at big box stores, Bachmann warns that it\u2019s good to check with your audiologist before taking that route. \u201cSome of those hearing aids are locked, so that you\u2019re not allowed to have them programmed by an outside audiologist,\u201d she says.",
      "Remember, says Stamper, that hearing aids are an investment, and usually last between five and six years.",
      "4. Know your rights. \u201cWe select what is the most likely to be successful, and if it doesn\u2019t work out you come back and do something else,\u201d says Stamper. She said most states mandate a trial period. In some cases, hearing-aid companies also cover the cost of multiple visits to your audiologist while you are getting used to your new hearing aid and get training in how to use and maintain it.",
      "5. Embrace the process, and expect it to take a little time and a few expert tweaks. Audiologists say your brain needs time to adjust to a hearing aid, and that hearing-aid settings should be adjusted little by little as your brain adapts to them.",
      "\u201cA big misconception is that you can just wear them a couple hours a day. Your brain does better with it if you use them most of the day. Your brain needs to adapt to hearing sounds it hasn't heard for a while, and it takes the brain awhile to relearn how to process all those sounds,\u201d says Stamper.",
      "6. Be realistic. \u201cAlthough hearing aids can be enormously beneficial, they may not give you back your normal hearing,\u201d says Stamper. Depending on the situation, there might be limitations to what a hearing aid can do.",
      "\u201cIt might just be lots of improvement in the key areas in which you\u2019re struggling,\u201d said Stamper.",
      "Using hearing aids is a process, the audiologists say, and although it requires some patience, it can be well worth the journey.",

      "The government's findings, which have not been previously reported, were a small victory for 36-year-old Kyleigh Thurman, who ultimately lost part of her reproductive system after being discharged without any help from her hometown emergency room for her dangerous ectopic pregnancy.",
      "But a new policy the Trump administration announced on Tuesday has thrown into doubt the federal government's oversight of hospitals that deny women emergency abortions, even when they are at risk for serious infection, organ loss or severe hemorrhaging.",

      "\u201cI didn\u2019t want anyone else to have to go through this,\u201d Thurman said in an interview with the Associated Press from her Texas home this week. \u201cI put a lot of the responsibility on the state of Texas and policy makers and the legislators that set this chain of events off.\u201d",
      "Women around the country have been denied emergency abortions for their life-threatening pregnancies after states swiftly enacted abortion restrictions in response to a 2022 ruling from the U.S. Supreme Court, which includes three appointees of President Donald Trump.",
      "The guidance issued by the Biden administration in 2022 was an effort to preserve access to emergency abortions for extreme cases in which women were experiencing medical emergencies. It directed hospitals \u2014 even ones in states with severe restrictions \u2014 to provide abortions in those emergency cases. If hospitals did not comply, they would be in violation of a federal law and risk losing some federal funds.",
      "On Tuesday, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the federal agency responsible for enforcing the law and inspecting hospitals, announced it would revoke the Biden-era guidance around emergency abortions.",
      "The law, which requires doctors to provide stabilizing treatment, was one of the few ways that Thurman was able to hold the emergency room accountable after she didn't receive any help from staff at Ascension Seton Williamson in Round Rock, Texas in February of 2023, a few months after Texas enacted its strict abortion ban.",
      "Emergency room staff observed that Thurman's hormone levels had dropped, a pregnancy was not visible in her uterus and a structure was blocking her fallopian tube \u2014 all telltale signs of an ectopic pregnancy, when a fetus implants outside of the uterus and has no room to grow. If left untreated, ectopic pregnancies can rupture, causing organ damage, hemorrhage or even death.",
      "Thurman, however, was sent home and given a pamphlet on miscarriage for her first pregnancy. She returned three days later, still bleeding, and was given an injected drug intended to end the pregnancy, but it was too late. Days later, she showed up again at the emergency room, bleeding out because the fertilized egg growing on Thurman\u2019s fallopian tube ruptured it. She underwent an emergency surgery that removed part of her reproductive system.",
      "CMS launched its investigation of how Ascension Seton Williamson handled Thurman\u2019s case late last year, shortly after she filed a complaint. Investigators concluded the hospital failed to give her a proper medical screening exam, including an evaluation with an OB-GYN. The hospital violated the federal Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, which requires emergency rooms to provide stabilizing treatment to all patients. Thurman was \u201cat risk for deterioration of her health and wellbeing as a result of an untreated medical condition,\u201d the investigation said in its report, which was publicly released last month.",
      "Ascension, a vast hospital system that has facilities across multiple states, did not respond to questions about Thurman\u2019s case, saying only that it is \u201cis committed to providing high-quality care to all who seek our services.\u201d",
      "Doctors and legal experts have warned abortion restrictions like the one Texas enacted have discouraged emergency room staff from aborting dangerous and nonviable pregnancies, even when a woman's life is imperiled. The stakes are especially high in Texas, where doctors face up to 99 years in prison if convicted of performing an illegal abortion. Lawmakers in the state are weighing a law that would remove criminal penalties for doctors who provide abortions in certain medical emergencies.",
      "\u201cWe see patients with miscarriages being denied care, bleeding out in parking lots. We see patients with nonviable pregnancies being told to continue those to term,\u201d said Molly Duane, an attorney at the Center for Reproductive Rights that represented Thurman. \u201cThis is not, maybe, what some people thought abortion bans would look like, but this is the reality.\u201d",
      "The Biden administration routinely warned hospitals that they need to provide abortions when a woman\u2019s health was in jeopardy, even suing Idaho over its state law that initially prohibited nearly all abortions, unless a woman\u2019s life was on the line.",
      "But CMS\u2019 announcement on Tuesday raises questions about whether such investigations will continue if hospitals do not provide abortions for women in medical emergencies.",
      "The agency said it will still enforce the law, \u201cincluding for identified emergency medical conditions that place the health of a pregnant woman or her unborn child in serious jeopardy.\u201d",
      "While states like Texas have clarified that ectopic pregnancies can legally be treated with abortions, the laws do not provide for every complication that might arise during a pregnancy. Several women in Texas have sued the state for its law, which has prevented women from terminating pregnancies in cases where their fetuses had deadly fetal anomalies or they went into labor too early for the fetus to survive.",
      "Thurman worries pregnant patients with serious complications still won't be able to get the help they may need in Texas emergency rooms.",
      "\u201cYou cannot predict the ways a pregnancy can go,\u201d Thurman said. \u201cIt can happen to anyone, still. There\u2019s still so many ways in which pregnancies that aren\u2019t ectopic can be deadly.\u201d",

      "The fact that the COVID-19 vaccine is not available for newborn babies is shielding a group of prisoners on Georgia\u2019s death row from execution",
      "ATLANTA -- The fact that the COVID-19 vaccine is not available for newborn babies is shielding a group of prisoners on Georgia's death row from execution.",
      "Executions in Georgia were halted during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the state attorney general's office entered into an agreement with lawyers for people on death row to set the terms under which they could resume for a specific group of prisoners. At least one of those conditions, having to do with the availability of the COVID-19 vaccine, has not been met, and seeking an execution date for a prisoner covered by the agreement would breach the agreement, Fulton County Superior Court Judge Shukura Ingram ruled.",
      "The agreement includes three conditions that had to be met before executions could be set for the affected prisoners: the expiration of the state\u2019s COVID-19 judicial emergency, the resumption of normal visitation at state prisons and the availability of a COVID-19 vaccine \u201cto all members of the public.\u201d Once those conditions were met, the state agreed to give three months' notice before pursuing an execution warrant for one of the prisoners covered by the agreement and six months' notice for the rest.",
      "The state has argued that the agreement should no longer apply, contending the conditions have been met. But defense attorneys say it's still valid because the vaccine isn't yet available to infants under 6 months old, and visitation at state prisons has not returned to normal.",
      "Ingram's ruling, issued Friday, addressed only the vaccination question. She plans to handle the visitation issue separately.",
      "Ingram wrote that the state's arguments \u201call boil down to an attempt to rewrite the Agreement.\u201d The state is \u201c(u)nhappy with the language it drafted\u201d and wants to change it so that the condition would be satisfied once vaccines are available to \u201cmost members of the public.\u201d",
      "\u201cBut courts cannot rewrite contracts to relieve a party of their regrets,\u201d she wrote. She ruled that the agreement is \u201cbinding and enforceable,\u201d that the vaccination condition hasn't been met and that seeking an execution warrant before the requirements have been met would breach the agreement.",
      "The state attorney general's office plans to appeal, a spokesperson said Tuesday.",
      "Ingram noted that the Food and Drug Administration has approved clinical trials for infants under 6 months old, and newborns receive other vaccines. That shows it is possible for the COVID-19 vaccine to ultimately be available for that age group, and the state should have foreseen that that could take years, she wrote.",
      "Experts for both sides had testified that it was probable that the COVID-19 vaccine would eventually become available to babies under the age of 6 months, Ingram wrote.",
      "That was before Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was appointed U.S. health secretary. Kennedy last week announced that COVID-19 vaccines are no longer recommended for healthy children and pregnant women. A few days later, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's website, which had said those groups should get the shots, was revised to say the vaccinations \u201cmay\u201d be given to those groups.",
      "The agreement covers fewer than 10 of the 34 people currently on Georgia's death row.",
      "While Georgia stopped carrying out executions during the pandemic, death penalty cases continued to wind their way through the court system, and as people exhausted their appeals, they became eligible for execution.",
      "A committee of a judicial task force on COVID-19 in early 2021 instructed lawyers for people on death row and the state attorney general\u2019s office to come up with terms under which executions could safely resume. The two sides reached the agreement in April 2021.",
      "The agreement only applied to people on death row whose requests to have their appeals reheard were denied by the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals while the judicial emergency was in place. The agreement was to remain in effect through Aug. 1, 2022, or one year from the date on which the conditions were met \u2014 whichever was later.",
      "The legal fight arose from a lawsuit filed when officials set a May 2022 execution date for Virgil Delano Presnell Jr. The Federal Defender Program, which represents Presnell, said the state had violated the agreement because the conditions hadn\u2019t all been met.",
      "Based on that argument, a Fulton County Superior Court judge halted the execution less than 24 hours before it was to take place, and the Georgia Supreme Court ruled in December 2022 that the agreement was a binding contract.",
      "People on death row who are not covered by the agreement have since become eligible for execution. One of them, Willie James Pye, was put to death in March 2024.",

    "story": [
      "A judge says the federal Bureau of Prisons must keep providing hormone therapy to hundreds of transgender inmates following an executive order signed by President Donald Trump that led to a disruption in medical treatment",
      "WASHINGTON -- The federal Bureau of Prisons must continue providing hormone therapy and social accommodations to hundreds of transgender inmates following an executive order signed by President Donald Trump that led to a disruption in medical treatment, a federal judge ruled Tuesday.",
      "U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth said in his ruling a federal law prohibits prison officials from arbitrarily depriving inmates of medications and other lifestyle accommodations that the bureau's own medical staff has deemed appropriate.",
      "The judge said the transgender inmates who sued to block Trump\u2019s executive order are trying to lessen the personal anguish caused by their gender dysphoria, the distress that a person feels because their assigned gender and gender identity don\u2019t match.",
      "\u201cIn light of the plaintiffs\u2019 largely personal motives for undergoing gender-affirming care, neither the BOP nor the Executive Order provides any serious explanation as to why the treatment modalities covered by the Executive Order or implementing memoranda should be handled differently than any other mental health intervention,\u201d the judge wrote.",
      "The Bureau of Prisons is providing hormone therapy to more than 600 inmates diagnosed with gender dysphoria. The bureau doesn\u2019t dispute that gender dysphoria can cause severe side effects, including depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts, the judge said.",
      "The Republican president\u2019s executive order required the bureau to revise its medical care policies so that federal funds aren\u2019t spent \u201cfor the purpose of conforming an inmate\u2019s appearance to that of the opposite sex.\u201d",
      "Lamberth\u2019s ruling isn\u2019t limited to the plaintiffs named in the lawsuit. He agreed to certify a class of plaintiffs consisting of anyone who is or will be incarcerated in federal prisons.",
      "The lawsuit\u2019s named plaintiffs include Alishea Kingdom, a transgender woman who was prescribed hormone therapy injections and approved to receive social accommodations, including women\u2019s undergarments and cosmetics. Kingdom was denied her hormone shot three times after Trump signed his order, but she had it restored roughly a week after she sued. Her access to feminine undergarments hasn\u2019t been restored, according to the judge\u2019s ruling.",
      "\u201cIn Ms. Kingdom\u2019s case, there is no indication at all that the BOP means to leave her hormone therapy in place long-term; indeed, as noted above, she was informed by BOP personnel that the decision to resume her treatment was a consequence of this litigation itself, raising the specter that her treatments might be discontinued as soon as the litigation has concluded,\u201d Lamberth wrote.",
      "Trump\u2019s order also directed the Bureau of Prisons to ensure that \u201cmales are not detained in women\u2019s prisons.\u201d In February, however, Lamberth agreed to temporarily block prison officials from transferring three incarcerated transgender women to men\u2019s facilities and terminating their access to hormone therapy.",
      "The judge said there's no evidence Trump or prison officials considered the harm the new polices could do to transgender inmates.",
      "\u201cThe defendants argue that the plaintiffs have not alleged irreparable harm because they are all currently receiving hormone medications. But it suffices to say that all three plaintiffs\u2019 access to hormone therapy is, as best the Court can tell, tenuous,\u201d Lamberth wrote.",
      "The plaintiffs are represented by attorneys from the Transgender Law Center and the American Civil Liberties Union.",
      "Lamberth, a senior judge, was nominated to the bench by President Ronald Reagan, a Republican, in 1987.",

      "The number of former rugby players taking legal action against sports governing bodies on claims they suffered brain injuries during their careers has grown to more than 1,000, a British law firm said on Monday.",
      "Rylands Garth, based in London, said more than 520 ex-players from rugby union and rugby league joined the lawsuit by Friday last week, which was the deadline for new applicants set by a court ahead of a hearing in July and before the case potentially goes to trial next year.",
      "It takes the total number of players who are part of the lawsuit to approximately 1,100, Rylands Garth said in a statement.",
      "The former players contend, according to Rylands Garth, that \u201crugby governing bodies failed to take reasonable action to protect them from the impacts of concussive and sub-concussive blows during their playing careers, despite knowing of the risks.\u201d",
      "Claimants are seeking compensation from World Rugby, the English Rugby Football Union and Welsh Rugby Union \u2014 governing bodies in 15-a-side rugby \u2014 and the English Rugby Football League and British Amateur Rugby League Association \u2014 from 13-a-side rugby league \u2014 for lost earnings, medical bills and care costs associated with their injuries, the firm said.",
      "\u201cRylands Garth is also calling for urgent and substantive reform of the game to better protect the safety of current and future players \u2014 including the creation of an independent brain health ombudsman for the sport,\u201d it said.",
      "Among those to have previously joined the class action was World Cup-winning former England hooker Steve Thompson, former New Zealand prop Carl Hayman and former Wales flanker Alix Popham.",
      "\u201cThis surge in claimants exposes the deep-rooted issues in rugby,\u201d Rylands Garth said, adding: \"Players continue to play almost all-year round, with many elite players soon to embark on extremely physical summer tours across the rugby world. We will continue to fight for justice for those who gave so much to the game.\u201d",
      "In a joint statement issued by World Rugby, the RFU and the WRU, the governing bodies said they \u201care aware of the latest update shared by the claimants\u2019 legal representatives with the final number of claimants.\u201d",
      "\u201cWe now await full details of their diagnosis and the claims being made. Our thoughts are with any former player facing challenges.",
      "\u201cAcross the game, we continue to build on a strong foundation of world-leading initiatives designed to make rugby union as safe as possible.\"",
      "That includes \u201csmart mouthguard technology in the elite game, trials of lower tackle height in the community game, and the continued rollout of brain health services to support former players.\u201d",
      "Rylands Garth said it also represents approximately 130 former soccer players who are taking similar legal action against soccer governing bodies. The next court hearing for the soccer case is due on June 26.",

      "U.S. Health Secretary Robert F",
      "WASHINGTON -- Emery Eversoll and her mother shared a good laugh when Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said that some autistic children will never write poems.",
      "The 16-year-old\u2019s bedroom is full of notebooks featuring her prose. Sometimes, she quietly recites poetry to get through an outburst of anger. Her mother began suspecting she may have autism, in part, because she had memorized every word from a favorite book by age 2.",
      "Still, this Kansas family is optimistic about Kennedy\u2019s plans to launch a broad-based study of what causes autism, the complex developmental disorder that impacts the brain and causes delays in language or learning, social withdrawal and an unusual need for routine. Kennedy has vowed to identify some of the causes of autism, which has been studied for decades, by September.",
      "Kennedy has said autism \u201ddestroys families.\u201d He said children with autism \u201cwill never pay taxes, they\u2019ll never hold a job, they\u2019ll never play baseball, they\u2019ll never write a poem, they\u2019ll never go out on a date. Many of them will never use a toilet unassisted.\u201d",
      "His comments and his plan to swiftly study its causes, have splintered a community of millions of people living with autism. For some, they were an overdue recognition of the day-to-day difficulties for families with autistic loved ones. To others, Kennedy deeply misrepresented the realities of their disability, provoking concern about his ability to handle a sweeping assessment of the disorder.",
      "Some worry, too, that Kennedy has spent years suggesting that vaccines might cause autism, despite decades of scientific research that shows no such link.",
      "Ohio father Scott Copeland, himself autistic and a parent to two autistic children, does not trust that Kennedy will conduct a legitimate study.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019d be like standing up and saying you\u2019re going to have the cure for cancer in six months,\u201d said Copeland, who's 56. \u201cAngry isn\u2019t a sufficient word.\u201d",
      "While announcing plans to study the causes of autism, Kennedy described a grim life for those who have to cope with it.",
      "For Kelly Van Den Berghe, Kennedy\u2019s comments reflect a painful reality for the son she loves. The Massachusetts mom of five has an 18-year-old son, Daniel, who has profound autism.",
      "Daniel cannot speak, although a tablet helps him communicate. He frequently punches himself so hard that he\u2019s at risk for fracture or concussion. About a decade ago, doctors recommended he enter a full-time residential facility for his safety. It took years for his mother to agree to that, and, even now, tears well up in her eyes as she talks about that decision.",
      "\u201cMy child, I do truly believe, that if he were able to tell us, he would not want autism because this has not affected him in a positive way,\u201d Van Den Berghe said. \u201cSo, for me, having someone finally recognize my son and his population is amazing.\u201d",
      "The Eversolls viewed Kennedy\u2019s comments that way, too. Emery Eversoll struggles with fits of anger. Loud noises can bug her. And clothes can feel weird, especially jeans or socks, which often need to be worn inside out.",
      "\u201cIt is hard if your child has any kind of thing that they have to work through or deal with that\u2019s extra,\u201d said Jessica Eversoll. \u201cJust like if your child had lost their hand, it\u2019s still the same child, but they\u2019re going to have struggles navigating the world around them.\u201d",
      "Eileen Lamb knows those struggles well. She was diagnosed with autism after she started noticing signs a decade ago that her first son, Charlie, may have autism.",
      "Days in Austin, Texas, can be daunting with Charlie, younger brother Jude, a 9-year-old who also has autism, and a 2-year-old sister, Billie.",
      "At 12, Charlie still requires constant supervision, especially with his habit of eating non-food items; last year he swallowed a screw. At night, she monitors Charlie with a video camera, a motion detector and a tent-like safety bed to make sure that he does not bang his head or try to eat the walls. On a blog, Eileen Lamb shares therapy tips, family wins \u2014 like taking all three kids to a little league soccer game \u2014 and mourns some of the milestones that Charlie has missed.",
      "Lamb said it\u2019s unlikely Charlie will ever play baseball or go on a date \u2014 as Kennedy said last month when describing autism \u2014 but she also doesn\u2019t only view her child\u2019s limitations.",
      "\u201cI see where he was going with his comments,\u201d Lamb said. \u201cBut I also think that\u2019s not how you measure the value of our children\u2019s lives. The language we use matters.\u201d",
      "Copeland, the Ohio father, also believes his 21-year-old son fit Kennedy\u2019s description of autism. His son is non-verbal, lives at home and requires around-the-clock care because he doesn\u2019t sense danger.",
      "Kennedy\u2019s comments, however, made it clear to Copeland that he\u2019s had little experience with the disorder.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t appreciate people presenting themselves as experts when they don\u2019t know a damn thing about something,\u201d he said.",
      "Kennedy has described autism as a \u201cpreventable disease.\u201d",
      "That\u2019s rattled families that see a clear-cut answer for the cause of autism: genetics. Scientists, too, have concluded that genetics play a significant factor.",
      "Ashley Seliquini, a 40-year-old mom and speech pathologist living in Greensboro, North Carolina, can clearly see the connections in her family. She and her 5-year-old daughter have both been diagnosed with the disorder. Both sometimes lose their ability to speak. Her daughter, too, gets overwhelmed by loud noises.",
      "\u201cYou see it run in families,\u201d Seliquini said. \u201cSometimes the parents are not aware that they are autistic. After their child gets diagnosed they go, \u2018Oh, my goodness, I\u2019m autistic, too.\u2019\u201d",
      "Doctors and medical experts have attributed the rise in autism cases \u2014 about 1 in 31 U.S. kids are now diagnosed with it \u2014 to increased awareness, especially around milder forms of the disorder.",
      "Kennedy has flatly rejected that explanation.",
      "Both he and President Donald Trump have suggested that vaccines could be to blame for rising rates of autism, despite longstanding research that says otherwise. The National Institutes of Health has identified other environmental risk factors such as prenatal exposure to pesticides or air pollution, extreme prematurity or parents who conceive at an older age.",
      "Last week, Kennedy said in an interview with CNN that the health department would start awarding grants to a team of 15 scientists who will study autism, although he has provided no details about who will lead the studies.",
      "Eileen Lamb hopes that the studies do not look into vaccines because researchers have already firmly concluded there is no link. Instead, she'd like to see a focus on ways to support families like hers.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s not just about what\u2019s the cause but how do we help,\u201d she said.",
      "For Van Den Berghe, Kennedy\u2019s study may hold answers she\u2019s wrestled with since Daniel was diagnosed many years ago. She\u2019s aware that research has found no link between vaccines and autism, but she\u2019s still not convinced. Daniel\u2019s severe reaction to the shots all those years ago is the only thing she can point to as a cause; no one else in her family has been diagnosed with autism.",
      "\u201cWhy did this happen to him?\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve been searching for years and years and years.\u201d",

    "story": [
      "In Uganda, where more than 40% of the population live in extreme poverty, many families live in homes with dirt floors",
      "JINJA, Uganda -- Simon Tigawalana dreamed for years of doing something about the dirt floors in his small house, blaming them for making his family sick. But in a rural area in one of the world's poorest countries, making them over with concrete was simply out of reach.",
      "Then a company called EarthEnable approached him to offer an alternative: a clay-based earthen floor that could give him a durable, sealed floor for less than half the cost of concrete. Tigawalana now has the new floor in two rooms and hopes to add it soon in the last room.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m happy that we now have a decent home and can also comfortably host visitors,\" said Tigawalana, a 56-year-old father of 16. \"Ever since we got a clay floor my kids no longer get cough and flu that used to come from the dust raised while sweeping the dirt floors.\u201d",
      "EarthEnable, which seeks to upgrade housing across Africa, has been promoting and installing the clay-based floors in Uganda since 2017. Besides eliminating dust that can irritate breathing, they're credited with reducing infestations of jiggers \u2014 a parasitic flea that can burrow into the skin and lead to pain, itching and infection. Uganda's health ministry says poor hygiene due to dirt floors contributes to such infestations.",
      "\u201cOur floors help to prevent pathogens and other illnesses linked to dust floors, since most of these families can\u2019t afford hospital care,\u201d said Noeline Mutesi, a sales and marketing manager for EarthEnable.",
      "The first step in building the floor is digging and leveling the surface. Then murram \u2014 local red soil rich in iron and aluminum oxides \u2014 is mixed with sand and water and then compacted. After two weeks of drying time, masons use wooden floats to smooth and further compact the surface. Next is pasting: applying a fine clay screed to further smooth the surface and prepare it for a final sealant, a flaxseed-based varnish that hardens into a durable plastic-like resin.",
      "A typical floor costs around 240,000 Uganda shillings (about $65), which Earth Enable says is about 70% cheaper than concrete. Buyers can pay in installments. EarthEnable, a U.S.-based nonprofit, operates for-profit subsidiaries in Uganda, Rwanda and Kenya, and says any profits are invested into startup costs in new markets as well as research and development.",
      "EarthEnable said it's installed about 5,000 floors in Uganda, more than 39,000 in Rwanda and more than 100 in Kenya. The company also does wall plastering to help reduce dust, moisture and insect infestations common in mud homes.",
      "In Jinja, the company's program employs more than 100 masons from within the community. Many are disadvantaged boys who have dropped out of school because they can't afford fees, said Alex Wanda, a construction officer at the company.",
      "\u201cWe focus on employing these young village boys that we train in skills to build these earthen floors, thus creating for them employment opportunities,\u201d Wanda said in an interview.",
      "About 42% of Ugandans live in extreme poverty. Its Bureau of Statistics says the country has a housing deficit of 2.6 million units, and it's growing. The country needs to add 300,000 housing units per year to make up the deficit, mainly in rural areas, where many Ugandans live and where housing quality and availability remain pressing concerns.",
      "The company also touts the clay floors as a more sustainable alternative to concrete, which besides being more expensive generates major carbon emissions in production.",
      "The cement industry is one of Uganda's biggest contributors to carbon emissions, accounting for about 628,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide in 2023, its highest recorded level. More broadly, building and construction accounts for 37% of global emissions, according to the United Nations Environment Programme.",
      "Uganda, like much of the rest of the world, has seen a rise in extreme weather events made more likely by climate change, including flooding and prolonged drought.",
      "\u201cInitiatives like this are crucial in the global effort to decarbonize the construction sector,\u201d said Penina Atwine, a program officer at the Uganda-based organization Environmental Alert. \u201cSuch innovative local solutions that address both climate change and social needs like EarthEnable\u2019s model could inspire similar approaches across the globe.\"",
      "In the village of Budima, Rehema Namukose spent most of her family's savings to build a house. She couldn't afford a cleaner floor until she worked through EarthEnable to pay for a clay floor in installments. She lives there with her three children and credits the new floor for improving the health of a sickly daughter.",
      "\u201cThis is affordable for my family and will help us maintain hygiene,\u201d she says \u201cWe are now living a better life.\u201d",

      "A ban on disposable vapes has come into force across the U.K. as the British government aims to stem their illegal use by children, reduce litter and prevent the leaking of harmful chemicals into the environment",
      "LONDON -- A ban on disposable vapes came into force across the U.K. on Sunday as the British government aims to stem their use by children, reduce litter and prevent the leaking of harmful chemicals into the environment.",
      "The ban makes it illegal for any retailer \u2014 online or in-store \u2014 to sell vapes, whether they contain nicotine or not. They will still be able to sell reusable vapes.",
      "The crackdown follows the soaring use of disposable vapes in schools and a rising tide of trash as users dispose of the vapes. It is estimated that as many as 5 million disposable vapes are thrown in bins or littered every week across the U.K., rather than being recycled.",
      "A number of countries are seeking to regulate the vape market, which has grown exponentially over the past decade or so. Australia outlawed the sale of vapes outside pharmacies last year in some of the world\u2019s toughest restrictions on electronic cigarettes, while Belgium became the first European Country to ban the use of disposable vapes at the start of this year. California has been at the forefront of bringing in new regulations in the U.S.",
      "The U.K.'s Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said usage among young people remained too high, and the ban would \u201cput an end to their alarming rise in school playgrounds and the avalanche of rubbish flooding the nation\u2019s streets.\u201d",
      "Also known as single-use vapes, disposable vapes are non-refillable and unable to be recharged, and are typically thrown away with general waste or just thrown on the street. Even when they are recycled, they need to be taken apart by hand, while their batteries are a fire risk to recycling facilities and can leak harmful chemicals into the environment and potentially harming wildlife.",
      "Businesses were given six months to prepare for the change by selling any existing stock. Rogue traders who continue to sell them risk a fine of 200 ($260) in the first instance, followed by an unlimited fine or jail time for repeat offending.",
      "The U.K. Vaping Industry Association said its members had moved quickly to comply with the June 1 deadline, but warned of \u201cserious unintended consequences\u201d emanating from too much regulation.",
      "\u201cWe are concerned that this ban will encourage former smokers who have already transitioned from cigarettes, which kill 220 people every day in the U.K, to return to combustible tobacco or opt for unregulated vapes,\" said its director general, John Dunne.",
      "Separately, the British government is legislating to potentially restrict the packaging, marketing and flavors of e-cigarettes.",

      "ROME -- French scientist Etienne-Emile Baulieu, best known as the inventor of the abortion pill, died on Friday aged 98 at his home in Paris, his institute said in a statement.",
      "Both a doctor and a researcher, Baulieu was known around the world for the scientific, medical and social significance of his work on steroid hormones.",
      "\u201cHis research was guided by his attachment to the progress made possible by science, his commitment to women\u2019s freedom, and his desire to enable everyone to live better, longer lives,\u201d the Institut Baulieu said in the statement posted on its website.",
      "Born Etienne Blum in Strasbourg on Dec. 12, 1926, he took the name \u201c\u00c9mile Baulieu\u201d when he joined the French Resistance against the Nazi occupation at the age of 15.",
      "An endocrinologist with a doctorate in medicine completed in 1955 and one in science eight years later, in 1963 Baulieu founded a pioneering research unit working on hormones at INSERM, the French institute for health and medical research. He remained as head of the unit until 1997.",
      "He is best known for his development, in 1982, of RU 486, the so-called \u201cabortion pill\u201d that changed the lives of millions of women throughout the world, offering them the possibility of voluntary medical termination of pregnancy, in physical and psychological safety.",
      "The Institut Baulieu said it was \u201ca non-invasive method, less aggressive and less delayed than surgery,\u201d noting that following his discovery the researcher faced fierce criticism and even threats from opponents of women's abortion rights.",
      "\u201cEven today, access to this method is opposed, banned in some countries, and is currently being challenged in the United States, where it is the most widely used abortion method,\u201d the institute added.",
      "Baulieu\u2019s research into DHEA, a hormone whose secretion and anti-aging activity he had discovered, led him to work on neurosteroids -- or steroids of the nervous system. He also developed an original treatment to combat depression, for which a clinical trial is currently underway in several university hospitals.",
      "In 2008, he founded the Institut Baulieu to understand, prevent and treat neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's.",
      "Honored with the grand crosses of the L\u00e9gion d\u2019honneur (legion of honor) and the Ordre national du M\u00e9rite (national order of merit), he was elected to the French Academy of Sciences in 1982, which he chaired in 2003 and 2004.",
      "He was a member of the national advisory committee on life sciences and health (1996-2002) and received numerous awards, both in France and abroad.",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron paid tribute to Baulieu in a post on X, calling him \u201ca beacon of courage\u201d and \u201ca progressive mind who enabled women to win their freedom.\u201d",
      "\u201cFew French people have changed the world to such an extent,\u201d he added.",

      "The attorneys filed a motion Friday to voluntarily dismiss the lawsuit, but did not give a reason for seeking to drop the case. The lawsuit had been filed last year in state court in Louisville on behalf of a woman who was seven weeks pregnant at the time and identified only by the pseudonym Mary Poe to protect her privacy.",

      "\u201cPeople have the right to control their own bodies without government interference, and we will never stop fighting to restore abortion access in Kentucky,\u201d said Amber Duke, executive director of the ACLU of Kentucky. \u201cWe are strategizing our next steps in this fight.\u201d",

      "Americans are losing an array of people and programs dedicated to keeping them healthy",
      "CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Americans are losing a vast array of people and programs dedicated to keeping them healthy. Gone are specialists who were confronting a measles outbreak in Ohio, workers who drove a van to schools in North Carolina to offer vaccinations and a program that provided free tests to sick people in Tennessee.",
      "State and local health departments responsible for invisible but critical work such as inspecting restaurants, monitoring wastewater for new and harmful germs, responding to outbreaks before they get too big \u2014 and a host of other tasks to protect both individuals and communities \u2014 are being hollowed out.",
      "\u201cNobody wants to go swim in a community pool and come out of it with a rash or a disease from it. Nobody wants to walk out their door and take a fresh breath of air and start wheezing,\" said Lori Tremmel Freeman, executive director of the National Association of County and City Health Officials.",
      "But local health officials say they now have no choice but to do a lot less of it. The Trump administration is cutting health spending on an unprecedented scale, experts say, including pulling $11 billion of direct federal support because the pandemic is over and eliminating 20,000 jobs at national health agencies that in part assist and support local public health work. It\u2019s proposing billions more be slashed.",
      "Together, public health leaders said, the cuts are reducing the entire system to a shadow of what it once was, threatening to undermine even routine work at a time when the nation faces the deadliest measles outbreak since at least the 1990s, rising whooping cough cases and the risk that bird flu could spread widely among people.",
      "The moves reflect a shift that Americans may not fully realize, away from the very idea of public health: doing the work that no individual can do alone to safeguard the population as a whole. That's one of the most critical responsibilities of government, notes James Williams, county executive in Santa Clara County, California. And it goes beyond having police and fire departments.",
      "\"It means not having babies suffering from diseases that you vanquished. It means making sure that people have access to the most accurate and up-to-date information and decisions that help their longevity,\u201d Williams said. \u201cIt means having a society and communities able to actually prosper, with people living healthy and full lives.\u201d",
      "Just outside a Charlotte, North Carolina, high school in March, nurse Kim Cristino set out five vaccines as a 17-year-old girl in ripped jeans stepped onto a health department van. The patient barely flinched as Cristino gave her three shots in one arm and two in the other to prevent diseases including measles, diphtheria and polio.",
      "Like many other teens that morning, the girl was getting some shots years later than recommended. The clinic\u2019s appearance at Independence High School gave her a convenient way to get up to date.",
      "\u201cIt lessens the barriers for parents who would have to be taking off from work and trying to get their kids to a provider,\u201d Cristino said.",
      "The vaccinations also help the community around her. The teen won\u2019t come down with a life-threatening disease and the whole community is protected from outbreaks \u2014 if enough people are vaccinated.",
      "The Mecklenburg County department, with \"Protecting and Promoting the Public\u2019s Health\u201d emblazoned on its van, is similar to other U.S. health departments. They run programs to reduce suicides and drug overdoses, improve prenatal health and help people stop smoking. They educate people about health and test for and treat diseases such as HIV and tuberculosis. Some, including Mecklenburg, operate medical and dental clinics too.",
      "\u201cYou come to work every day and think: What\u2019s going to be my challenge today? Sometimes it\u2019s a new disease,\u201d said Raynard Washington, Mecklenburg\u2019s director. \u201cThat\u2019s why having a backbone infrastructure is so important.\u201d",
      "What they do is cost-effective, experts have found. For every dollar spent on childhood immunizations, the country is estimated to save $11; on tobacco cessation, $2-$3; on asthma control, $70.",
      "Critical care can be glamorous \u2014 surgeons, cardiologists and cancer doctors can pull off breathtaking medical feats to save lives at the last possible moment. Prevention work is low key. It\u2019s impossible to identify who was saved because, if it goes well, the person never knows when they\u2019ve fended off a mortal threat with the invisible shield of public health.",
      "\u201cPeople don\u2019t appreciate it,\u201d said Dr. Umair Shah, former health director for Washington state. \u201cTherefore, they don\u2019t invest in it.\u201d",
      "State health departments are funded by a varying mix of federal and state tax money. Some states deliver services in a centralized way while others provide resources to local departments, which generally also get money from counties, cities or towns. Some large cities get direct federal funding for their health departments.",
      "Mecklenburg \u2014 a large department with around 1,000 workers serving 1.2 million people \u2014 has an annual budget of around $135 million, while some metro hospitals have operating expenses in the billions. About 70% of the department's budget comes from local funds, which helps fill gaps in state and federal money. But Mecklenburg is still strapped for cash and resources.",
      "At times, employees work 12- to 14-hour days, especially during outbreaks. Nurse Carmel Jenkins recalled responding to mpox exposures at a day care center \u2014 arriving before 5:30 a.m. to alert the children\u2019s parents and working late into the evening.",
      "\u201cEven though there may be limited resources, we still have a service to provide,\u201d said Jenkins, a director of clinical services for the department. \u201cWe don\u2019t mind going above and beyond to be able to do that.\u201d",
      "In March, the Trump administration pulled $11 billion from state and local health departments without warning under the leadership of Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime anti-vaccine activist and public health critic. The cuts abruptly ended COVID-era grants, which had also been approved for non-COVID work including vaccination and disease detection, tracking and testing.",
      "A week later, thousands of people were laid off at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Many had worked closely with state and local health departments to provide information, grants and other support.",
      "The sudden, one-two punch delivered a serious blow to the system, public health leaders said in interviews, court filings and public testimony.",
      "A Kennedy spokesman said in an email that America remains unhealthy compared with other developed nations and HHS is reorganizing what he said were \u201cbroken systems\u201d and reprioritizing resources to \u201ccentralize programs and functions that will improve our service to the American people.\u201d",
      "\u201cThese cuts are not about abandoning public health \u2014 they\u2019re about reforming it,\u201d spokesman Andrew Nixon said, adding: \u201cWe reject the implication that HHS has turned its back on urgent health threats.\u201d",
      "HHS justified the grant cancellations by saying the money was for COVID and the pandemic is over. But most of the cuts were in areas that are especially important given today\u2019s health threats. The biggest chunk, more than $8.9 billion, involved epidemiology and laboratory capacity related to infectious diseases, while another $2 billion was related to immunizations. In some places, the cuts are on hold due to a federal judge\u2019s order in a lawsuit by states. But elsewhere, cuts are continuing.",
      "In Mecklenburg, for example, 11 community health workers lost their jobs, meaning less outreach to groups like the Hispanic community. All eight employees dedicated to the mobile vaccine program were laid off.",
      "In Columbus, Ohio \u2014 one of several communities in Republican-led states suing over the cuts \u2014 the health department had to lay off nine disease intervention specialists. This left it operating at 25% capacity in its disease tracing and investigation work just as it prepared to address a measles outbreak.",
      "Kansas City, Missouri, will not be able to do its own testing for infectious diseases because the cut came just as the city was about to buy $500,000 worth of equipment. And Nashville had to end a program offering free flu and COVID tests and cancel plans to buy a van to deliver vaccinations.",
      "The cities complained the cuts had created \u201csevere budget uncertainty\u201d and forced them to redirect their limited resources \u201cto respond to the resulting chaos.\u201d",
      "CDC staff cuts are also having a ripple effect on state and local departments. Children who are deaf or hard of hearing will no longer benefit from an early intervention program run by states after everyone who worked on the program at CDC was laid off. The team in the Office on Smoking and Health, which funds state tobacco hotlines that help people quit, was let go.",
      "So was the CDC team that worked to reduce drownings, partly through funding low-cost swimming lessons in local communities. Drownings kill 4,000 people a year in the U.S.",
      "\u201cThe experts who know the things that can be done to help prevent the No. 1 cause of death from children ages 1 to 4 have been eliminated,\u201d Connecticut state health commissioner Dr. Manisha Juthani told a Democratic congressional hearing in April, referring to drownings.",
      "She said the abrupt and disorganized nature of the cuts leaves her department scrambling as officials try to understand what is being cut and to close important programs on the federal government\u2019s impractical timelines.",
      "\u201cThe current uncertainty puts lives at risk,\u201d she said.",
      "The new cuts are especially damaging because health departments are funded differently than other government agencies meant to protect the public: Funding pours in during emergencies and slows to a relative trickle when they subside. Mecklenburg\u2019s Washington notes the contrast with fire departments, which are kept ready at all times, not scrambling to find firefighters and fire trucks when houses are already burning.",
      "With health departments, \u201cthere\u2019s a long-established pattern of boom-and-bust funding,\u201d said Dr. Steven Stack, Kentucky\u2019s public health commissioner and past president of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials.",
      "A temporary surge of money during the pandemic allowed some health departments to expand and strengthen programs. In Alabama, the influx of COVID money allowed the state to reopen a health department in largely rural Coosa County that closed a decade ago due to a lack of money. In California\u2019s Santa Clara County, a COVID-era lab grant paved the way for a new science branch with nearly 50 positions.",
      "But by early this year, most of that money had disappeared, along with other COVID-era grants across the nation \u2014 some because they ended and some because the government rescinded them. Departments were again left brittle and vulnerable.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re facing funding cliff after funding cliff after funding cliff,\u201d said Dr. Sara Cody, Santa Clara County\u2019s health director. \u201cWhat really worries me is I felt that we had finally built the infrastructure in the public health department. ... We were still pretty trim, but we weren\u2019t just, like, bones.\u201d",
      "In Chicago, one-time COVID grants made up 51% of the health department budget, and their ending will push staff numbers below the pre-pandemic level of 588 \u2014 slowing responses to outbreaks and forcing officials to scale back food safety, violence prevention and other programs.",
      "In Mecklenburg, the department lost 180 employees as COVID funds dried up. It also lost a wastewater monitoring partnership with the University of North Carolina at Charlotte that helped the county react quickly to changing COVID variants and could have also been used to detect new threats like bird flu.",
      "The cuts are not over.",
      "The Trump administration has proposed cutting billions more from CDC\u2019s budget, enough to cut the agency\u2019s spending in half. CDC sends about 80 percent of its budget to states and local communities.",
      "Michael Eby, director of clinical services in Mecklenburg, said the relentless cuts to the system leave departments unable to respond to new pandemics and old diseases returning across the United States.",
      "\u201cWithout the appropriate funding, we can\u2019t properly address these threats,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re at risk of them getting out of control and really causing a lot of damage and death to individuals that we could have saved, that we could have protected.\u201d",

      "The nation\u2019s top public health agency has posted new recommendations that healthy children and pregnant women may \u2014 but no longer should \u2014 get COVID-19 vaccinations",
      "NEW YORK -- The nation's top public health agency posted new recommendations that say healthy children and pregnant women may get COVID-19 vaccinations, removing stronger language that those groups should get the shots.",
      "The change comes days after U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced that COVID-19 vaccines will no longer be recommended for healthy children and pregnant women.",
      "But the updated guidance on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's website sends a more nuanced message, saying shots \u201cmay\u201d be given to those groups.",
      "\u201cThe announcement from earlier this week sounded like CDC was going to fully withdraw any statement that could be construed as a recommendation for these vaccines in these populations,\u201d said Jason Schwartz, a Yale University health policy researcher. \u201cIt's not as bad as it could have been.\"",
      "Kennedy announced the coming changes in a 58-second video posted on the social media site X on Tuesday. No one from the CDC was in the video, and CDC officials have referred questions about the announcement to Kennedy and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.",
      "On Thursday, the CDC updated its website. The agency said that shots may be given to children ages 6 months to 17 years who do not have moderate or severe problems with their immune systems. Instead of recommending the shots, the CDC now says parents may decide to get their children vaccinated in consultation with a doctor.",
      "A subtle update to a CDC page on the adult immunization schedule indicated a similar change for the recommendation for pregnant women, excluding them from the routine recommendation made for other adults.",
      "\u201cThe old COVID-19 vaccine recommendations for healthy children under 18 and for pregnant women have been removed from the CDC vaccine schedule,\u201d a HHS spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cThe CDC and HHS encourage individuals to talk with their healthcare provider about any personal medical decision.\"",
      "That kind of recommendation, known as shared decision-making, still means health insurers must pay for the vaccinations, according to the CDC. However, experts say vaccination rates tend to be lower when health authorities use that language and doctors are less emphatic with patients about getting shots.",
      "Childhood vaccination rates for COVID-19 are already low \u2014 just 13% of children and 23% of adults have received the 2024-25 COVID-19 vaccine, according to CDC data.",
      "Talk of changing the recommendations has been brewing. As the COVID-19 pandemic has waned, experts have discussed the possibility of focusing vaccination efforts on people 65 and older \u2014 who are among those most as risk for death and hospitalization.",
      "A CDC advisory panel is set to meet in June to make recommendations about the fall shots. Among its options are suggesting shots for high-risk groups but still giving lower-risk people the choice to get vaccinated. A committee work group has endorsed the idea.",
      "But Kennedy, a leading anti-vaccine advocate before becoming health secretary, decided not to wait for the scientific panel\u2019s review.",
      "The new vaccine recommendation changes, their timing and the way there were announced have created confusion that can be \"incredibly harmful to the success of vaccination programs,\u201d Schwartz said.",
      "\u201cIt would be understandable if the public is completely baffled in terms of what the federal government thinks and what the science suggests ... about the evidence for the safety and value of these vaccines,\u201d he added.",

      "Carlos Alcaraz has been wearing nasal strips in some matches since last season",
      "PARIS -- If more tennis players find themselves breathing easier, it might just be thanks to Carlos Alcaraz.",
      "The four-time Grand Slam champion, whose bid for a second consecutive French Open title was scheduled to continue with a third-round match Friday night, has often worn a nasal strip in matches since last season \u2014 although not during his first two contests at Roland-Garros this week \u2014 and the sport's other athletes took note.",
      "After all, if Alcaraz finds something useful on the court, their thinking goes, maybe it makes sense to give the adhesive bands a shot.",
      "\u201cI saw Carlos playing in it,\u201d said 18-year-old Mirra Andreeva, a semifinalist in Paris last year and the No. 6 women's seed this time. \u201cI\u2019d be pretty interested to try and see if there is really a difference. If he plays matches in it, then probably there is.\u201d",
      "At the 2024 season-ending ATP Finals last November, Alcaraz said: \u201cIt is something that I\u2019m going to wear more often. I could recover better between points.\u201d",
      "Once associated with Pro Football Hall of Famer Jerry Rice and soccer stars like Cristiano Ronaldo and Neymar, the bands, which essentially look like a Band-Aid worn across the bridge of the nose, are popping up on tennis courts \u2014 sometimes out of necessity, sometimes out of curiosity.",
      "They are designed to open the nostrils slightly, making it easier to breathe through the nose. Originally marketed to reduce snoring, they\u2019re being embraced to enhance air intake during physical exertion.",
      "The idea is simple: Better breathing could mean better oxygen intake.",
      "In practice, the science is less convincing.",
      "In 2021, Brazilian academic Ricardo Dinardi reviewed more than 600 studies on nasal strips and found they didn\u2019t make a real difference in how much air athletes took in, their heart rate or how strenuous exercise felt.",
      "\u201cThe effect on athletic performance is mostly placebo,\u201d Dinardi said. \u201cBut in elite sports, even perceived benefits can count.\u201d",
      "Three-time major finalist Casper Ruud, who wore the strips in matches earlier this year, knows the evidence is shaky. But he still liked using them \u2014 both on the court and while sleeping. Like Alcaraz, Ruud did not wear one in Paris before his second-round exit.",
      "But he has been testing a prototype of a different version.",
      "\u201cI tried out a device that\u2019s very early in development. It will be a bit more comfortable to wear, because it\u2019s inside the nose and it looks like I have this bullring under,\u201d said Ruud, who was the runner-up at Roland-Garros to Rafael Nadal in 2022 and Novak Djokovic in 2023. \u201cIt will return, don\u2019t worry.\u201d",
      "For other players, like Nicol\u00e1s Jarry, the strips are more than a trend \u2014 they\u2019re a necessity. After nasal surgery in 2020, the Chilean still needed help to draw air into his nose, so he puts them on for every practice and every match he plays.",
      "\u201cWithout it, I cannot breathe. My nostrils shut when I try,\u201d he said, inhaling to demonstrate for a reporter. \u201cOthers don\u2019t have that issue and still use them.\u201d",
      "Jarry definitely has noticed a recent spike in interest among players. He said that even though he's worn the strips for years, including at this French Open, other competitors on tour never asked about them \u2014 until Alcaraz started wearing one last year, sometimes in black, sometimes in pink.",
      "\u201cOthers have asked me, and many are trying it,\" said Jarry, who sported a beige-colored strip in Paris. \"But before him? Nothing.\u201d",
      "There are those, like 2024 US Open runner-up Jessica Pegula, who are tempted to try.",
      "\u201cI have a horrible deviated septum. I can\u2019t really breathe out of one side of my nose,\" said Pegula, who will play 2023 Wimbledon champion Marketa Vondrousova in the third round Saturday. \u201cMaybe I should start wearing one.\u201d",
      "She admits, though, that the aesthetic aspect might be a deal-breaker.",
      "\u201cI don\u2019t know,\" Pegula said with a smile, \u201cif I have the confidence to rock one.\u201d",

      "BUDAPEST, Hungary -- The advocate general for the European Union\u2019s highest court on Thursday urged the court to rule that Hungary violated the bloc\u2019s laws and fundamental values when it passed legislation barring the availability of LGBTQ+ content to minors under 18.",
      "The non-binding opinion from the European Court of Justice\u2019s Advocate General, Tamara Capeta, states that the legislative changes adopted by Hungary's right-wing populist government violate several rights protected by the EU, \u201cnamely the prohibition of discrimination on grounds of sex and sexual orientation, the respect for private and family life, the freedom of expression and information, as well as the right to human dignity.\u201d",
      "Hungary's law, adopted in 2021 by Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n's ruling Fidesz party, prohibited the display of content to minors that depicts homosexuality or gender change, while also providing harsher penalties for crimes of pedophilia.",
      "The government has argued its policies, including a more recent law and constitutional amendment that effectively ban the popular Budapest Pride event, seek to protect children from what it calls \u201csexual propaganda.\u201d",
      "But critics of the legislation have compared it to Russia\u2019s gay propaganda law of 2013, and say it conflates homosexuality with pedophilia as part of a campaign ploy to mobilize Fidesz's conservative voter base.",
      "In her opinion, Capeta rejected Hungary's justification that the measures are aimed at protecting children, since the legislation \u201cprohibits portrayal of ordinary lives of LGBTI people, and is not limited to shielding minors from pornographic content, which was prohibited by the law in Hungary already.\u201d",
      "She also wrote that Hungary has not offered any proof that content which portrays the ordinary lives of LGBTQ+ people has a negative effect on the healthy development of minors.",
      "\u201cConsequently, those amendments are based on a value judgment that homosexual and non-cisgender life is not of equal value or status\u201d to heterosexual life, Capeta wrote.",
      "She urged the EU court to rule in favor of the bloc's executive commission \u2014 which launched an infringement procedure against Hungary over the law shortly after it was passed \u2014 on all counts.",
      "Opinions by advocates general are often but not always followed by the European Court of Justice, which will make a final ruling on the case at a later date.",

      "Panic and a chaotic run toward the stadium gates turned into a deadly crowd crush in India\u2019s southern Bengaluru city Wednesday, leaving at least 11 people dead and more than 30 others injured. Most of the victims, including young students, were trampled upon or suffocated after getting caught in crowds that swelled beyond control.",
      "The stampede was yet another incident of a crowd crush in a country where poor crowd management often leads to accidents. It also underscored that passion for cricket stars in India \u2014 where fans of the game closely follow the players\u2019 every move \u2014 can easily turn deadly if crowds are not managed properly.",
      "The incident took place when crowds outside the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium began swarming into the premises, where state authorities were celebrating the Royal Challengers Bengaluru cricket team. The team had on Tuesday finally won the final of the Indian Premier League \u2014 the world\u2019s most popular T20 cricket tournament \u2014 after 18 years. Joyful crowds had poured into the city streets all night.",
      "By late afternoon on Wednesday, tens of thousands began moving toward the stadium. City police later said around 50,000 people had gathered within the stadium\u2019s 1-kilometre radius, and more crowds were continuing to stream in.",
      "Some fans scaled over stadium gates and outer walls. Others tried to break the metal gates. Soon, people began falling on each other.",
      "B.V. Shivkumar\u2019s 14-year old daughter, Divyanshi Shivakumar, was with her mother and aunt. The three women approached the gate, but fans jostling to enter the stadium caused them to collide with each other, Shivkumar said. Then a crush followed.",
      "Divyanshi suffered head injuries. Her mother and aunt rushed her to the hospital, where she later died.",
      "\u201cMy wife begged the police and everyone there, but nobody helped,\u201d Shivkumar, who uses only one name, said at his Bengaluru home, surrounded by relatives who were there to offer condolences.",
      "Shivkumar said he was particularly incensed by the fact that while people were getting caught in a crush outside, the ceremony inside the stadium continued.",
      "\u201cWho cares about the people\u2019s loss?\u201d he asked.",
      "Cricket is followed by hundreds of millions of people in India, where it draws record television and digital viewership. For decades, it has also been a crucial part of India\u2019s global brand. For many fans, catching a glimpse of their favorite cricketer is no less than a dream come true, even if it means risking their lives.",
      "Karnataka state\u2019s Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, who only uses one name, said at least 200,000 cricket fans were out on the city streets on Wednesday, at least four times more than what authorities had expected. His deputy, D.K. Shivakumar, said that 5,000 police officers had been deployed to provide security, but the \u201cyoung, vibrant crowd\u201d grew \u201cuncontrollable.\"",
      "\u201cThis tragedy has overshadowed the joy of the victory,\u201d he said on social platform X.",
      "The incident has since turned into a political tug-of-war, with opposition parties raising questions about hasty arrangements. India's cricket management authorities have said they did not know who planned the event and that players inside the stadium were not aware of the crush until they began receiving phone calls.",
      "Meanwhile, India's top cricketers and franchise teams have shared their condolences. The tournament\u2019s biggest star player, Virat Kohli, wrote on Instagram: \u201cAt a loss for words. Absolutely gutted.\u201d",
      "Families of the victims are grappling with a sense of disbelief and anger as to how a scene of celebration spiraled into a tragedy.",
      "Divyanshi's father said authorities should have prepared better so that lives lost could have been saved.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s the parents who will suffer now,\u201d he said.",

      "Separately, prosecutors launched an investigation into the leader of the opposition Republican People\u2019s Party, or CHP, over comments made in a speech Wednesday evening.

      "Europe\u2019s top official monitoring illegal drugs is nearing the end of his decade-long tenure with one clear message: the non-stop rise in cocaine and other stimulants is producing more violence than ever before in the heart of the world\u2019s safest society",
      "Europe\u2019s top official monitoring illegal drugs has a parting message near the end of his tenure: the relentless rise in the trafficking of cocaine and other stimulants is producing more violence than ever before in the heart of the world\u2019s safest societies.",
      "Alexis Goosdeel, the Belgian clinician who has run the European Union Drugs Agency since Jan. 2016, has watched it unfold across the continent and spill into his home country. The bulk of drug seizures shifted from Europe's southern flank to its northern ports and, with Antwerp now a leading entry point for cocaine and crack, spreading gang violence has produced shootouts even near the seat of Europe\u2019s government.",
      "It's emblematic of the risk the continent at large faces, he told The Associated Press via video conference from Lisbon, Portugal, where his agency is based.",
      "\u201cFor people living in Brussels, that\u2019s the first time in the history of the country ... that you have episodes with weapons, with guns, in the center of Brussels,\u201d Goosdeel said. \u201cAnd this happens 2,000 meters (1.2 miles) from the building of the European Parliament, in a city that was felt and perceived by people to be quite safe.\u201d",
      "He noted the globalization of drug gangs \u2014 for example groups from the western Balkans arrested in Andean nations in South America. And he pointed to the new phenomena of gangs using social media to recruit at-risk youths, some of whom are recent arrivals to Europe as undocumented migrants.",
      "\u201cWe don\u2019t understand yet what are the root causes of this change of behavior among young teenagers or adolescents who embarked on ultra-violent behavior without having really a past of delinquency,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd some of them do not hesitate to take pictures or to make a movie of what they are doing and to share it on some social media.\u201d",
      "The European Union Drugs Agency\u2019s annual report released on Thursday found that in 2023 cocaine seizures in Europe hit a record for a seventh straight year, with 419 tonnes (462 tons) of cocaine confiscated by officials. Belgium led the way with 123 tonnes, followed by Spain (118 tonnes) and the Netherlands (59 tonnes), as the three countries with major ports accounted for 72% of the total amount grabbed by agents.",
      "The report, which covers the EU as well as Norway and Turkey, highlighted Spain\u2019s largest-ever seizure, of 13 tonnes of cocaine hidden in bananas from Ecuador, as an example of cartels' use of standard shipping lanes.",
      "Besides warning policymakers across the EU\u2019s 27 capitals to prepare for more violence, Goosdeel sounded the alarm about a looming public health threat. Whereas addiction and overdose from opioids can be treatable, that\u2019s not the case for stimulants.",
      "Their growing use \u201csuggests that in four or five years time we will face most probably an increase in the needs for treatment and we don\u2019t have any pharmacological standard treatment available,\u201d he said. \"You don\u2019t have anything magic in terms of medicine that would help to stabilize them, to cut the craving and to help them really disconnect from this extremely huge addiction. So it\u2019s time to invest.\u201d",
      "Europe remains the leading producer and exporter of ecstasy. The agency\u2019s early warning system to spot new synthetic drugs has identified 1,000 new substances in its 27 years of existence. Goosdeel said he wouldn't be surprised if, of the total, more than half were detected in the past decade. The period has ushered in \u201can entirely different world,\u201d he said.",
      "\u201cDrugs are everywhere, including those we produce in Europe. Everything can be used as a drug,\u201d he said.",
      "Goosdeel insists that, while policymakers should tackle the issue of drug-related violence, they must continue caring for users rather than jailing or shunning them, as some critics say the United States\u2019 \u201cwar on drugs\u201d has done. Europe's approach has formed the basis of a public health response aimed at helping users overcome their addictions.",
      "\u201cWe have learned in Europe, and from what happens outside Europe, that to declare war on the people who are using drugs is not the solution,\u201d he said.",

      "SEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea\u2019s liberal-led legislature overwhelmingly passed bills Thursday to launch special investigations into former President Yoon Suk Yeol\u2019s short-lived imposition of martial law in December and criminal allegations against his wife, targeting the ousted conservative a day after his liberal successor took office.",
      "The National Assembly also passed a bill to initiate an independent investigation into the 2023 drowning death of a marine during a search-and-rescue operation for flood victims, an incident the Democratic Party, which holds majority, accuses Yoon\u2019s government of covering up.",

      "Yet Lee has vowed a full investigation into Yoon\u2019s martial law imposition and the allegations surrounding his wife, moves that could overshadow the new government and inflame tensions as Yoon faces a high-stakes rebellion trial carrying a possible death sentence.",

      "Liberals have insisted independent investigations into Yoon are essential, saying probes by prosecutors, police and an anti-corruption agency were inadequate and hampered by Yoon\u2019s refusal to cooperate. If Lee approves the independent investigations, special prosecutors could request the transfer of relevant cases to expand those investigations or direct public or military prosecutors to continue handling them under their supervision.",
      "The bills calling for independent investigations into Yoon\u2019s martial law decree and criminal allegations involving his wife both passed by a vote of 194 to 3.",
      "Dozens of retired marines, dressed in red shirts, saluted and cheered from an observation box after lawmakers passed the bill for a special prosecutor investigation into the marine\u2019s death, which also passed 194 to 3.",
      "Martial law lasted only a few hours after a quorum of lawmakers pushed past a blockade of hundreds of heavily armed soldiers and voted to revoke the measure. Yoon defended the move as a necessary act of governance, accusing the Democrats, whom he labeled \u201canti-state forces,\u201d of abusing their majority to obstruct his agenda and paralyze state affairs.",

She also is suspected of interfering with PPP\u2019s candidate nominations ahead of legislative elections in April last year.",

      "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- New Zealand legislators voted Thursday to enact record suspensions from Parliament for three lawmakers who performed a M\u0101ori haka to protest a proposed law.",
      "Hana-R\u0101whiti Maipi-Clarke received a seven-day ban and the leaders of her political party, Debbie Ngarewa-Packer and Rawiri Waititi, were barred for 21 days. Three days had been the longest ban for a lawmaker from New Zealand\u2019s Parliament before.",
      "The lawmakers from Te P\u0101ti M\u0101ori, the M\u0101ori Party, performed the haka, a chanting dance of challenge, in November to oppose a widely unpopular bill, now defeated, that they said would reverse Indigenous rights.",
      "The protest drew global headlines and provoked months of fraught debate among lawmakers about what the consequences for the lawmakers' actions should be and the place of M\u0101ori culture in Parliament.",
      "A committee of the lawmakers\u2019 peers in April recommended the lengthy bans. It said the lawmakers were not being punished for the haka, but for striding across the floor of the debating chamber toward their opponents while doing it.",
      "Judith Collins, the committee chair, said the lawmakers' behavior was egregious, disruptive and potentially intimidating.",
      "Maipi-Clarke, 22, rejected that description Thursday, citing other instances when legislators have left their seats and approached opponents without sanction. The suspended legislators said they are being treated more harshly than others because they are M\u0101ori.",
      "\u201cI came into this house to give a voice to the voiceless. Is that the real issue here?\u201d Maipi-Clarke asked Parliament. \u201cIs that the real intimidation here? Are our voices too loud for this house?\u201d",
      "Inside and outside Parliament, the haka has increasingly been welcomed as an important part of New Zealand life. The sacred chant can be a challenge to the viewer but is not violent.",
      "As M\u0101ori language and culture have become part of mainstream New Zealand in recent years, haka appear in a range of cultural, somber and celebratory settings. They also have rung out in Parliament to welcome the passage of high-profile laws.",
      "Some who decried the protest haka in Parliament cited its timing, with Maipi-Clarke beginning the chant as votes were being tallied and causing a brief suspension of proceedings. She has privately apologized for the disruption to Parliament's Speaker, she said Thursday.",
      "A few lawmakers urged their peers to consider rewriting rules about what lawmakers could do in Parliament to recognize M\u0101ori cultural protocols as accepted forms of protest. One cited changes to allow breastfeeding in the debating chamber as evidence the institution had amended rules before.",
      "Normally the parliamentary committee that decides on punishments for errant lawmakers is in agreement on what should happen to them. But panel members were sharply divided over the haka protest and the lengthy punishments were advanced only because the government has more legislators in Parliament than the opposition.",
      "One party in the government bloc wanted even longer suspensions and had asked the committee if the M\u0101ori party lawmakers could be jailed. Most in opposition rejected any punishment beyond the one-day ban Maipi-Clarke already served.",
      "Speaker Gerry Brownlee urged lawmakers last month to negotiate a consensus and ordered a free-ranging debate that would continue until all agreed to put the sanctions to a vote. But no such accord was reached after hours of occasionally emotional speeches in which opposition lawmakers accused the government of undermining democracy by passing such a severe punishment on its opponents.",
      "While the bans were certain to pass, even as the debate began Thursday it remained unclear whether opposition lawmakers would filibuster to prevent the suspensions from reaching a vote. By evening, with no one's mind changed, all lawmakers agreed the debate should end.",
      "Every government lawmaker voted for the punishments, while all opposition members voted against them.",
      "Thursday's debate capped a fraught episode for race relations in New Zealand, beginning with the controversial bill that the M\u0101ori Party lawmakers opposed.",
      "The measures would have rewritten principles in the country's founding document, a treaty between M\u0101ori tribal leaders and representatives of the British Crown signed at the time New Zealand was colonized.",
      "The bill's authors were chagrined by moves from Parliament and the courts in recent decades to enshrine the Treaty of Waitangi's promises. Opponents warned of constitutional crisis if the law was passed and tens of thousands of people marched to Parliament last November to oppose it.",
      "Despite growing recognition for the treaty, M\u0101ori remain disadvantaged on most social and economic metrics compared to non-M\u0101ori New Zealanders.",

      "Ukrainian officials say at least five people, including a 1-year-old child, his mother and grandmother, were killed in a Russian drone strike on a northern Ukrainian overnight",
      "PRYLUKY, Ukraine -- At least five people, including a 1-year-old child, his mother and grandmother, were killed Thursday in a nighttime Russian drone attack on the northern Ukrainian city of Pryluky, officials said.",
      "Six drones hit a residential area in the city shortly before dawn, injuring nine others, according to authorities. The child killed was the grandson of the local fire chief, Ukraine\u2019s Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko said.",
      "The fire chief, identified by local officials as 50-year-old Oleksandr Lebid, \"arrived to respond to the aftermath right at his own home,\u201d Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a post on Telegram. \u201cIt turned out that a Shahed drone hit his house.\u201d",
      "The attack came just hours after U.S. President Donald Trump spoke by phone with Russian President Vladimir Putin. According to Trump, Putin said \u201cvery strongly\u201d that Russia will retaliate for Ukraine\u2019s stunning drone attacks on Russian military airfields on Sunday.",
      "U.S.-led diplomatic efforts to stop the more than 3-year-long war have delivered no significant progress, and the grinding war of attrition has continued unabated.",
      "The mother of the 1-year-old killed in Pryluky was a police officer called Daryna Shyhyda, Ukraine\u2019s National Police said.",
      "\u201cToday our hearts are scorched by pain,\u201d the police force wrote on Telegram. \u201cThis is not just a loss \u2014 it is three generations of life uprooted.\u201d",
      "Liudmyla Horbunova, 55, who lives across the street from where the Shahed drone hit, said Shyhyda had moved with her son last weekend to her parents\u2019 house from her home in Kyiv because she was scared of potential Russian attacks on the capital.",
      "\u201cShe ran away from Shaheds in Kyiv, but they found her here, in Pryluky,\u201d Horbunova told The Associated Press.",
      "Firefighters worked through charred debris and extinguished the remains of a fire that engulfed the home of Shyhyda's parents, leaving only a brick carcass and scattered toys, clothes and a family photo book.",
      "Pryluky, which had a prewar population of around 50,000 people, lies about 100 kilometers (60 miles) east of Kyiv, the capital. The city is far from the front line and does not contain any known military assets.",
      "The last time Pryluky was struck was in November last year, when a Russian missile hit an administrative building and injured one person.",
      "Zelenskyy said a total of 103 drones and one ballistic missile targeted multiple Ukrainian regions overnight, including Donetsk, Kharkiv, Odesa, Sumy, Chernihiv, Dnipro and Kherson.",
      "\u201cThis is another massive strike,\u201d Zelenskyy said. \u201cIt is yet another reason to impose the strongest possible sanctions and apply pressure collectively.\u201d",
      "Zelenskyy, who has accepted a U.S. ceasefire proposal and offered to meet with Putin in an attempt to break the stalemate in negotiations, wants more international sanctions on Russia to force it to accept a settlement. Putin has shown no willingness to meet with Zelenskyy, however, and has indicated no readiness to compromise.",
      "Germany\u2019s new leader Friedrich Merz was due to meet with President Donald Trump in Washington on Thursday as he works to keep the U.S. on board with Western diplomatic and military support for Ukraine.",
      "Ukraine\u2019s top presidential aide, Andriy Yermak, met with senior American officials in Washington on Wednesday and called for greater U.S. pressure on Russia, accusing the Kremlin of deliberately stalling ceasefire talks and blocking progress toward peace, according to a statement on the presidential website.",
      "Yermak, who traveled to the U.S. as part of a Ukrainian delegation, met with senior American officials to bolster support for Ukraine\u2019s defense and humanitarian priorities. He said Ukraine urgently needs stronger air defense capabilities.",
      "Hours later, 19 people were injured in a Russian drone strike on the eastern Ukrainian city of Kharkiv. Those hurt included children, a pregnant woman, and a 93-year-old woman, regional Gov. Oleh Syniehubov wrote on Telegram.",
      "At around 1:05 a.m., Shahed-type drones struck two apartment buildings in the city\u2019s Slobidskyi district, causing fires and destroying several private vehicles.",
      "\u201cBy launching attacks while people sleep in their homes, the enemy once again confirms its tactic of insidious terror,\u201d Syniehubov wrote on Telegram.",

      "OMAHA BEACH, France -- The D-Day generation, smaller in number than ever, is back on the beaches of France where so much blood was spilled 81 years ago. World War II veterans, now mostly centenarians, have returned with the same message they fought for then: Freedom is worth defending.",
      "In what they acknowledge may be one of their last hurrahs, a group of nearly two dozen veterans who served in Europe and the Pacific is commemorating the fallen and getting rock-star treatment this week in Normandy \u2014 the first patch of mainland France that Allied forces liberated with the June 6, 1944, invasion and the greatest assembly of ships and planes the world had known.",
      "On what became known as \u201c Bloody Omaha \u201d and other gun-swept beaches where soldiers waded ashore and were cut down, their sacrifices forged bonds among Europe, the United States and Canada that endure, outlasting geopolitical shifts and the rise and fall of political leaders who blow hot and cold about the ties between nations.",
      "In Normandy, families hand down D-Day stories like heirlooms from one generation to the next. They clamor for handshakes, selfies, kisses and autographs from WWII veterans, and reward them with cries of \u201cMerci!\u201d \u2014 thank you.",
      "Both the young and the very old thrive off the interactions. French schoolchildren oohed and aahed when 101-year-old Arlester Brown told them his age. The U.S. military was still segregated by race when the 18-year-old was drafted in 1942. Like most Black soldiers, Brown wasn't assigned a combat role and served in a laundry unit that accompanied the Allied advances through France and the Low Countries and into Nazi Germany.",
      "Jack Stowe, who lied about being 15 to join the Navy after Japan attacked Pearl Harbor in 1941, said he gets \u201cthe sweetest letters\u201d from kids he met on previous trips.",
      "\u201cThe French people here, they\u2019re so good to us,\u201d the 98-year-old said, on a walk to the water's edge on Omaha. \u201cThey want to talk to us, they want to sit down and they want their kids around us.\u201d",
      "\u201cPeople are not going to let it be forgotten, you know, Omaha, these beaches,\u201d he said. \u201cThese stories will go on and on and on.\u201d",
      "At the Normandy American Cemetery that overlooks Omaha, the resting place for nearly 9,400 American war dead, workers and visitors rub sand from the beach onto the white gravestones so the engraved names stand out.",
      "Wally King, a sprightly 101-year-old, wiped off excess sand with a weathered hand, resting the other atop the white cross, before saying a few words at the grave of Henry Shurlds Jr. Shurlds flew P-47 Thunderbolt fighters like King and was shot down and killed on Aug. 19, 1944. In the woods where they found his body, the townspeople of Verneuil-sur-Seine, northwest of Paris, erected a stele of Mississippi tulip tree wood in his memory.",
      "Although Shurlds flew in the same 513th Fighter Squadron, King said he never met him. King himself was shot down over Germany and badly burned on his 75th and last mission in mid-April 1945, weeks before the Nazi surrender. He said pilots tended not to become fast friends, to avoid the pain of loss when they were killed, which was often.",
      "When \u201cmost veterans from World War II came home, they didn\u2019t want to talk about the war. So they didn\u2019t pass those experiences on to their children and grandchildren,\u201d King said.",
      "\u201cIn a way, that\u2019s good because there\u2019s enough unpleasantness, bloodshed, agony in war, and perhaps we don\u2019t need to emphasize it,\" he added. \"But the sacrifice needs to be emphasized and celebrated.\u201d",
      "With the march of time, the veterans' groups are only getting smaller.",
      "The Best Defense Foundation, a non-profit that has been running veteran trips to Normandy since 2004, last year brought 50 people for the 80th anniversary of D-Day. This year, the number is 23.",
      "Betty Huffman-Rosevear, who served as an army nurse, is the only woman. She turned 104 this week. The group also includes a renowned romantic: 101-year-old Harold Terens and his sweetheart, Jeanne Swerlin, were feted by France's president after they tied the knot in a symbolic wedding inland of the D-Day beaches last year.",
      "D-Day veteran Jake Larson, now 102, has made multiple return trips and has become a star as \"Papa Jake\" on TikTok, with 1.2 million followers. He survived machine-gun fire when he landed on Omaha, making it unhurt to the bluffs that overlook the beach and which in 1944 were studded with German gun emplacements that mowed down American soldiers.",
      "\u201cWe are the lucky ones,\u201d Larson said amid the cemetery's immaculate rows of graves. \u201cThey had no family. We are their family. We have the responsibility to honor these guys who gave us a chance to be alive.\"",
      "As WWII's survivors disappear, the responsibility is falling on the next generations that owe them the debt of freedom.",
      "\u201cThis will probably be the last Normandy return, when you see the condition of some of us old guys,\u201d King said. \u201cI hope I'm wrong.\u201d",

      "There\u2019s a lot of walking at the Hajj, even when pilgrims are not performing rituals. Too much traffic, or not enough transport, means people end up walking up to 25 kilometers (15 miles) every day. All the rituals are on foot.",
      "High temperatures, adrenaline, and physical exertion will elevate the heart rate.",

    "story": [
      "Hugo Aguilar campaigned for Mexico\u2019s Supreme Court with the simple message that he would finally give Indigenous Mexicans a voice at one of the highest levels of government",
      "MEXICO CITY -- In his campaign for Mexico's Supreme Court, Hugo Aguilar sent a simple message: He would be the one to finally give Indigenous Mexicans a voice at one of the highest levels of government.",
      "\u201cIt's our turn as Indigenous people ... to make decisions in this country,\u201d he said in the lead up to Sunday's first judicial elections in Mexican history.",
      "Now, the 52-year-old Aguilar, a lawyer from the Mixtec people in Mexico\u2019s southern Oaxaca state, will be the first Indigenous Supreme Court justice in nearly 170 years in the Latin American nation, according to Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum. He could lead the high court. The last Indigenous justice to do so was Mexican hero and former President Benito Ju\u00e1rez, who ran the court from 1857 to 1858.",
      "For some, Aguilar has become a symbol of hope for 23 million Indigenous people long on the forgotten fringes of Mexican society. But others fiercely criticize his past, and worry that instead of representing them, he will instead stand with the ruling party, Morena, that ushered him onto the court.",
      "Supporters cite Aguilar's long history of working on Indigenous rights, while critics say that more recently he's helped push the governing party's agenda, including former President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s massive infrastructure projects, at the expense of Indigenous communities. Aguilar's team said he would not comment until after official results were confirmed.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s not an Indigenous candidate,\u201d said Francisco L\u00f3pez B\u00e1rcenas, a distinguished Mixtec lawyer from the same region as Aguilar who once worked with him decades ago. He applauded the election of an Indigenous justice, but said \u201cHe\u2019s an Indigenous man who became a candidate.\u201d",
      "Aguilar was elected in Mexico's first judicial election, a process that's been criticized as weakening Mexico's system of checks and balances.",
      "L\u00f3pez Obrador and his party overhauled the judicial system the populist leader was long at odds with. Instead of appointing judges through experience, voters elected judges to 2,600 federal, state and local positions. But the vote was marked by a very low voter turnout, about 13%.",
      "L\u00f3pez Obrador and his successor and protege President Claudia Sheinbaum claimed the election would cut corruption in the courts. Judges, watchdogs and political opposition called it a blatant attempt to use the party's political popularity to stack courts in their favor, and gain control of all three branches of Mexico's government.",
      "While votes are still being counted in many races, the tally of results for nine Supreme Court justices came in first. The vast majority of the justices hold strong ties to the ruling party, handing Morena potential control over the high court. Aguilar's name was among those that appeared on pamphlets suggesting which candidates to vote for, which electoral authorities are investigating.",
      "Aguilar scooped up more than 6 million votes, more than any other candidate, including three who currently serve on the Supreme Court. The victory opened the possibility of Aguilar not just serving on the court, but leading it.",
      "Critics attributed his win to Mexico's highly popular president repeatedly saying she wanted an Indigenous judge on the Supreme Court in the lead up to the election. On Wednesday she said she was thrilled he was on the court.",
      "\u201cHe is a very good lawyer,\u201d she said. \u201cI have the privilege of knowing his work not just on Indigenous issues, but in general. He has wide knowledge and is a modest and simple man.\u201d",
      "The Supreme Court has handed down decisions that, for example, establish the right of Indigenous people to be assisted by interpreters who speak their native language and defense attorneys in any legal process. But there remain significant outstanding issues like territorial disputes in cases of mega-projects.",

      "Sof\u00eda Robles, a member of the organization remembers young Aguilar being passionate, choosing to be a lawyer to advocate for Indigenous communities often living in poverty and out of reach of the law.",

      "Despite coming from a humble working-class family, he would work for the organization for free after his law classes. He later worked there as a lawyer on agrarian issues for 13 years. After the Zapatista uprising in 1994, a guerrilla movement fighting for Indigenous rights in southern Mexico, Aguilar worked to carry out constitutional reforms recognizing the basic rights of Mexico's Indigenous people.",
      "Robles said she believes he will bring that fight she saw in him to the Supreme Court.",
      "\u201cHe gives us hope,\u201d she said. \u201cAguilar is going to be an example for future generations.\u201d",
      "But others like Romel Gonz\u00e1lez D\u00edaz, a member of the Xpujil Indigenous Council in a Mayan community in southern Mexico, cast doubt on if Aguilar would truly act as a voice for their community.",
      "Aguilar's work came under fire when he joined the government's National Institute of Indigenous Peoples at the beginning of L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s administration in 2018. It was then that he began to work on a mega-project known as the Maya Train fiercely criticized by environmentalists, Indigenous communities and even the United Nations.",
      "The train, which runs in a rough loop around the Yucatan peninsula, has deforested large swathes of jungle and irreversibly damaged an ancient cave system sacred to Indigenous populations there. Aguilar was tasked with investigating the potential impacts of the train, hearing the concerns of local Indigenous communities and informing them of the consequences.",
      "That was when Gonz\u00e1lez D\u00edaz met Aguilar, who arrived with a handful of government officials, who sat down for just a few hours with his small community in Xpujil, and provided sparse details about the negative parts of the project.",
      "Gonz\u00e1lez D\u00edaz\u2019s organization was among many to take legal action against the government in an attempt to block train construction for not properly studying the project's impacts.",
      "The environmental destruction left in the project's wake is something that continues to fuel his distrust for Aguilar.",
      "\u201cThe concern with Hugo is: Who is he going to represent?\u201d Gonz\u00e1lez D\u00edaz said. \u201cIs he going to represent the (Morena) party or is he going to represent the Indigenous people?\u201d",

      "Guidon first documented the red ocher cave paintings in the semi-arid state of Piaui in the 1970s. These ancient artworks, made with natural pigments such as iron oxides and charcoal, depict deer and capybaras, but also scenes of everyday life including hunting, childbirth, dancing and kissing.",
      "Guidon fought for the preservation of the area, leading to the establishment of the Serra da Capivara National Park in 1979. In 1991, UNESCO recognized the nearly 130,000-hectare park, with its sprawling valleys, mountains, and plains, as a world cultural heritage site.",

      "The Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation and the National Institute of Historical and Artistic Heritage commended Guidon\u2019s contributions in a joint statement Wednesday.",
      "\u201cIf Serra da Capivara is today recognized as one of the most important concentrations of archaeological sites in the world, with a profound impact on the debate and understanding of the history of human occupation of the Americas, it is above all thanks to Ni\u00e8de Guidon\u2019s vision and tireless defense of science and culture,\u201d they said.",

      "Guidon was born in the interior of Sao Paulo state in 1933. She graduated in Natural History from the University of Sao Paulo in 1959, before moving to France to pursue her studies. She completed her doctorate at Paris\u2019 Sorbonne University in 1975, after presenting a thesis on the cave paintings in Piaui state.",
      "Guidon went on to found the Foundation Museum of the American Man, a non-profit dedicated to the cultural and natural heritage of Serra da Capivara National Park, which she led between 1986 and 2019.",
      "\u201cFor decades, she and her team fought to secure funding and infrastructure for the park, firmly standing against government neglect,\u201d the nonprofit said on Wednesday, adding that her work was marked by \u201cpassion, persistence, and a generous vision of science as a tool for social transformation.\u201d",

      "\u201cThe type of things I learn from him \u2014 on and off the court. He's just a beautiful guy,\" Iverson said about O'Neal. \"He stands up to his faults. The things that he felt he did wrong in life. The way he treats his mom. All that resembles who I am. That makes this special.\u201d",
      "Reebok, founded in 1895, became a household name in the early 1990s, thanks to Boston Celtics guard Dee Brown and his iconic Pump sneakers. The brand took off from there inking major deals with O\u2019Neal and Iverson, partnering with the NFL, NBA, NHL and MLB, and even stepping into hip-hop with signature lines for Jay-Z and 50 Cent\u2019s G-Unit.",
      "But Reebok\u2019s cultural momentum began to fade after Nike doubled down on star power with Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant and LeBron James. Adidas bought the company for $3.8 billion in 2006, aiming to better compete with Nike on a global scale.",
      "Instead, Reebok struggled to find its footing, gradually losing its identity in both sports and style.",
      "\u201cNow it's time for us to get Reebok back to prominence,\" said O'Neal, who played a key role in Reebok's acquisition in 2021 by Authentic Brands Group, where he is a shareholder. \u201cThere's all these competitive brands, which is fine. It makes the job harder. But for me, it's all about motivation and trying to build.\"",
      "\u201cPower Moves\u201d dives into Reebok\u2019s strategy for staying relevant, including signing rising stars like WNBA phenom Angel Reese to the brand\u2019s first name, image and likeness (NIL) deal. The series also shows how O\u2019Neal leans on a surprising source for insight into today\u2019s athletes through his son, Shareef.",
      "Shaq was initially set on creating high-top sneakers, until a visit to a massive Amateur Athletic Union tournament \u2014 with nearly 70 courts \u2014 sparked a shift. Shareef pulled his dad aside and explained that low tops are the go-to for this generation. It was a lightbulb moment that helped Shaq better understand and connect with modern players.",
      "\u201cI had to realize that my way is not always the right way,\u201d Shaq said. \u201cSometimes, the best way to be an effective leader is listening to the ones who are really in the trenches.\u201d",
      "Iverson believes he and Shaq can help Reebok bounce back by paying forward the same support and opportunity the brand once gave them.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to show our love to the brand that showed us love,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re putting our efforts into what they did in my life. Reebok took care of my family, my friends, me. It was a power move. We\u2019re here to bring it back.\u201d",

      "WASHINGTON -- Filings for U.S. unemployment benefits rose to their highest level in eight months last week but remain historically low despite growing uncertainty about how tariffs could impact the broader economy.",
      "New applications for jobless benefits rose by 8,000 to 247,000 for the week ending May 31, the Labor Department said Thursday. That\u2019s the most since early October. Analysts had forecast 237,000 new applications.",
      "Weekly applications for jobless benefits are considered representative of U.S. layoffs and have mostly bounced around a historically healthy range between 200,000 and 250,000 since COVID-19 throttled the economy five years ago, wiping out millions of jobs.",
      "In reporting their latest earnings, many companies have either lowered their sales and profit expectations for 2025 or not issued guidance at all, often citing President Donald Trump\u2019s dizzying rollout of tariff announcements.",
      "Though Trump has paused or dialed down many of his tariff threats, concerns remain that a tariff-induced global economic slowdown could upend what\u2019s been a robust U.S. labor market.",
      "In early May, the Federal Reserve held its benchmark lending rate at 4.3% for the third straight meeting after cutting it three times at the end of last year.",
      "Fed chair Jerome Powell said the potential for both higher unemployment and inflation are elevated, an unusual combination that complicates the central bank\u2019s dual mandate of controlling prices and keeping unemployment low. Powell said that tariffs have dampened consumer and business sentiment.",
      "Earlier this week, the government reported that U.S. job openings rose unexpectedly in April, but other data suggested that Americans are less optimistic about the labor market.",
      "Tuesday\u2019s report showed that the number of Americans quitting their jobs \u2014 a sign of confidence in their prospects \u2014 fell, while layoffs ticked higher. And in another sign the job market has cooled from the hiring boom of 2021-2023, the Labor Department reported one job every unemployed person. As recently as December 2022, there were two vacancies for every jobless American.",
      "The Labor Department\u2019s more comprehensive monthly employment report comes out Friday, with analysts expecting that U.S. employers added a slim 130,000 jobs in May, down from 177,000 in April.",
      "The government has estimated that the U.S. economy shrank at a 0.2% annual pace in the first quarter of 2025, a slight upgrade from its first estimate. Growth was slowed by a surge in imports as companies in the U.S. tried to bring in foreign goods before Trump\u2019s massive tariffs went into effect.",
      "Trump is attempting to reshape the global economy by dramatically increasing import taxes to rejuvenate the U.S. manufacturing sector. The president has also tried to drastically downsize the federal government workforce, but many of those cuts are being challenged in the courts and Congress.",
      "In a regulatory filing early Thursday, the packaged consumer goods company Procter & Gamble said it expected to cut 7,000 jobs \u2014 about 15% of its nonmanufacturing workforce \u2014 as part of a two-year restructuring plan.",

      "FRANKFURT, Germany -- Lower inflation and concern that U.S. President Donald Trump's trade war will slow already modest growth have cleared the way for the European Central Bank to cut interest rates at Thursday's policy meeting, a step that would lower borrowing costs for consumers and businesses and promote economic activity.",
      "With a cut widely expected by market analysts, a key question is how low the bank will go, given uncertainty about the impact of U.S. trade policy on Europe\u2019s export-dependent economy. Bank President Christine Lagarde will face questions about the bank\u2019s outlook for coming meetings at her post-decision news conference.",
      "A cut of a quarter percentage point would be the eighth rate cut since June 2024 and would take the bank's benchmark rate to 2%.",
      "Trump on April 2 announced a 20% tariff, or import tax, on goods from the European Union. He later threatened to raise the tariff to 50% after expressing dissatisfaction with the progress of trade talks with the EU. Trump and the EU's executive commission have agreed to suspend implementation and any retaliation by the EU until July 14 as negotiators seek to reach agreement.",
      "Trump added more disruption this week by suddenly increasing a 25% tariff on steel imports to 50% for all countries except for the U.K.",
      "The threat of even higher tariffs has raised fears that growth will underperform already modest forecasts. The EU's executive commission lowered its growth forecast for this year to 0.9% from 1.3% on the optimistic assumption that the 20% tariff rate can be negotiated down to no more than 10%.",
      "Low inflation has bolstered the ECB's ability to cut rates. Annual inflation for the 20 countries that use the euro fell to 1.9% in May from 2.2% in April as energy prices eased.",
      "The ECB raised rates to a record high of 4% to suppress a 2021-2023 inflation outbreak that reached double digits. But with inflation now below its 2% target, the bank has more freedom to cut. Lower rates make it cheaper to borrow and buy things, supporting demand for goods and in theory increasing spending and investment.",

      "NEW YORK -- Six weeks before UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson was gunned down outside a Manhattan hotel in December, suspect Luigi Mangione mused about rebelling against \u201cthe deadly, greed fueled health insurance cartel\u201d and said killing the executive \u201cconveys a greedy bastard that had it coming,\u201d prosecutors revealed Wednesday.",
      "The Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office quoted extensively from Mangione\u2019s handwritten diary \u2014 highlighting his desire to kill an insurance honcho and praise for Ted Kaczynski, the Unabomber \u2014 as they fight to uphold his state murder charges. They also cited a confession they say he penned \u201cTo the feds,\u201d in which he wrote that \u201cit had to be done.\u201d",

      "His lawyers say that has created a \u201clegal quagmire\u201d that makes it \u201clegally and logistically impossible to defend against them simultaneously.\u201d",
      "The state charges, which carry a maximum of life in prison, allege that Mangione wanted to \u201cintimidate or coerce a civilian population,\u201d that is, insurance employees and investors. The federal charges allege that Mangione stalked an individual, Thompson, and do not involve terror allegations.",
      "Mangione, 27, has pleaded not guilty in both cases. No trial dates have been set.",
      "Mangione\u2019s \u201cintentions were obvious from his acts, but his writings serve to make those intentions explicit,\u201d prosecutors said in Wednesday\u2019s filing. The writings, which they sometimes described as a manifesto, \u201cconvey one clear message: that the murder of Brian Thompson was intended to bring about revolutionary change to the healthcare industry.\u201d",
      "They quoted excerpts in which Mangione discussed options for the attack, such as bombing UnitedHealthcare\u2019s headquarters, before deciding to target the company's investor conference in Manhattan. He wrote about plans to \u201cwack the CEO at the annual parasitic bean-counter convention\u201d because it was \u201ctargeted, precise and doesn\u2019t risk innocents.\u201d",

      "Mangione is due back in state court June 26, when Judge Gregory Carro is expected to rule on his request for dismissal.",
      "His lawyers asked Tuesday for his handcuffs and bulletproof vest to be removed during the hearing. They called him a \u201ca model prisoner, a model defendant\u201d and said the security measures would suggest to potential jurors that he is dangerous. Carro has not ruled on that.",
      "Mangione\u2019s next federal court date is Dec. 5, a day after the one-year anniversary of Thompson\u2019s death.",
      "Surveillance video showed a masked gunman shooting Thompson from behind as he arrived for the conference Dec. 4 at the New York Hilton Midtown. Police say \u201cdelay,\u201d \u201cdeny\u201d and \u201cdepose\u201d were scrawled on the ammunition, mimicking a phrase commonly used to describe how insurers avoid paying claims.",

      "Another U.S. company, Intuitive Machines, arrived at the moon a few days after Firefly. But the tall, spindly lander face-planted in a crater near the moon\u2019s south pole and was declared dead within hours.",
      "Resilience is targeting the top of the moon, a less forbidding place than the shadowy bottom. The ispace team chose a flat area with few boulders in Mare Frigoris or Sea of Cold, a long and narrow region full of craters and ancient lava flows that stretches across the near side\u2019s northern tier.",

That would be followed a year or more later by the first lunar landing by a crew in more than a half-century, with SpaceX's Starship providing the lift from lunar orbit all the way down to the surface.

    "story": [
      "Students from around the world say being an international student in American today comes with feelings of fear, anxiety and insecurity that have made them more cautious in their daily lives",
      "To attract the brightest minds to America, President Donald Trump proposed a novel idea while campaigning: If elected, he would grant green cards to all foreign students who graduate from U.S. colleges.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s so sad when we lose people from Harvard, MIT, from the greatest schools,\u201d Trump said during a podcast interview last June. \u201cThat is going to end on Day One.\u201d",
      "That promise never came to pass. Trump\u2019s stance on welcoming foreign students has shifted dramatically. International students have found themselves at the center of an escalating campaign to kick them out or keep them from coming as his administration merges a crackdown on immigration with an effort to reshape higher education.",
      "An avalanche of policies from the Trump administration \u2014 such as terminating students\u2019 ability to study in the U.S., halting all new student visa interviews and moving to block foreign enrollment at Harvard \u2014 have triggered lawsuits, countersuits and confusion. Foreign students say they feel targeted on multiple fronts. Late Wednesday, Trump himself took the latest action against international students, signing an executive order barring nearly all foreigners from entering the country to attend Harvard.",
      "In interviews, students from around the world described how it feels to be an international student today in America. Their accounts highlight pervasive feelings of fear, anxiety and insecurity that have made them more cautious in their daily lives, distracted them from schoolwork and prompted many to cancel trips home because they fear not being allowed to return.",
      "For many, the last few months have forced them to rethink their dreams of building a life in America.",
      "Markuss Saule, a freshman at Brigham Young University-Idaho, took a recent trip home to Latvia and spent the entire flight back to the U.S. in a state of panic.",
      "For hours, he scrubbed his phone, uninstalling all social media, deleting anything that touched on politics or could be construed as anti-Trump.",
      "\u201cThat whole 10-hour flight, where I was debating, \u2018Will they let me in?\u2019 \u2014 it definitely killed me a little bit,\u201d said Saule, a business analytics major. \u201cIt was terrifying.\u201d",
      "Saule is the type of international student the U.S. has coveted. As a high schooler in Latvia, he qualified for a competitive, merit-based exchange program funded by the U.S. State Department. He spent a year of high school in Minnesota, falling in love with America and a classmate who is now his fiancee. He just ended his freshman year in college with a 4.0 GPA.",
      "But the alarm he felt on that flight crushed what was left of his American dream.",
      "\u201cIf you had asked me at the end of 2024 what my plans were, it was to get married, find a great job here in the U.S. and start a family,\u201d said Saule, who hopes to work as a business data analyst. \u201cThose plans are not applicable anymore. Ask me now, and the plan to leave this place as soon as possible.\u201d",
      "Saule and his fiancee plan to marry this summer, graduate a year early and move to Europe.",
      "This spring the Trump administration abruptly revoked permission to study in the U.S. for thousands of international students before reversing itself. A federal judge has blocked further status terminations, but for many, the damage is done. Saule has a constant fear he could be next.",
      "As a student in Minnesota just three years ago, he felt like a proud ambassador for his country.",
      "\u201cNow I feel a sense of inferiority. I feel that I am expendable, that I am purely an appendage that is maybe getting cut off soon,\u201d he said. Trump\u2019s policies carry a clear subtext. \u201cThe policies, what they tell me is simple. It is one word: Leave.\u201d",
      "A concern for attracting the world\u2019s top students was raised in the interview Trump gave last June on the podcast \u201cAll-In.\u201d Can you promise, Trump was asked, to give companies more ability \u201cto import the best and brightest\" students?",
      "\u201cI do promise,\u201d Trump answered. Green cards, he said, would be handed out with diplomas to any foreign student who gets a college or graduate degree.",
      "Trump said he knew stories of \u201cbrilliant\u201d graduates who wanted to stay in the U.S. to work but couldn\u2019t. \u201cThey go back to India, they go back to China\u201d and become multi-billionaires, employing thousands of people. \u201cThat is going to end on Day One.\u201d",
      "Had Trump followed through with that pledge, a 24-year-old Indian physics major named Avi would not be afraid of losing everything he has worked toward.",
      "After six years in Arizona, where Avi attended college and is now working as an engineer, the U.S. feels like a second home. He dreams of working at NASA or in a national lab and staying in America where he has several relatives.",
      "But now he is too afraid to fly to Chicago to see them, rattled by news of foreigners being harassed at immigration centers and airports.",
      "\u201cDo I risk seeing my family or risk deportation?\u201d said Avi, who asked to be identified by his first name, fearing retribution.",
      "Avi is one of about 240,000 people on student visas in the U.S. on Optional Practical Training \u2014 a postgraduation period where students are authorized to work in fields related to their degrees for up to three years. A key Trump nominee has said he would like to see an end to postgraduate work authorization for international students.",
      "Avi\u2019s visa is valid until next year but he feels \u201ca massive amount of uncertainty.\u201d",
      "He wonders if he can sign a lease on a new apartment. Even his daily commute feels different.",
      "\u201cI drive to work every morning, 10 miles an hour under speed limit to avoid getting pulled over,\u201d said Avi, who hopes to stay in the U.S. but is casting a wider net. \u201cI spend a lot of time doomscrolling job listings in India and other places.\u201d",
      "Vladyslav Plyaka came to the U.S. from Ukraine as an exchange student in high school. As war broke out at home, he stayed to attend the University of Wisconsin.",
      "He was planning to visit Poland to see his mother but if he leaves the U.S., he would need to reapply for a visa. He doesn\u2019t know when that will be possible now that visa appointments are suspended, and he doesn\u2019t feel safe leaving the country anyway.",
      "He feels grateful for the education, but without renewing his visa, he\u2019ll be stuck in the U.S. at least two more years while he finishes his degree. He sometimes wonders if he would be willing to risk leaving his education in the United States \u2014 something he worked for years to achieve \u2014 if something happened to his family.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s hard because every day I have to think about my family, if everything is going to be all right,\u201d he said.",
      "It took him three tries to win a scholarship to study in the U.S. Having that cut short because of visa problems would undermine the sacrifice he made to be here. He sometimes feels guilty that he isn\u2019t at home fighting for his country, but he knows there\u2019s value in gaining an education in America.",
      "\u201cI decided to stay here just because of how good the college education is,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it was not good, I probably would be on the front lines.\u201d",

      "Bulgaria has the green light to join the euro next year and become the 21st member of the European Union's currency union",
      "FRANKFURT, Germany -- European Union officials gave the green light Wednesday for Bulgaria to become the 21st member of the euro currency union,, a key EU project aimed at deepening the ties between member countries.",
      "The Balkan country of 6.4 million people is to make the switch from its national currency, the lev, to the euro on Jan. 1.",
      "Here are basic facts about the currency union, also called the eurozone, and how countries join it.",
      "The euro is a shared currency and monetary system launched in 1999 when 11 EU member countries irrevocably fixed their currencies to the euro as an accounting currency, then swapped out the national notes and coins in 2002.",
      "The EU established the European Central Bank to handle monetary policy and set interest rate benchmarks for member countries, similar to the role of the U.S. Federal Reserve in the U.S.",
      "Countries must meet four criteria: low inflation, keeping deficits and debt under control, low long-term interest rates and a stable exchange rate between their currency and the euro. Countries must go through a two-year \u201cwaiting room\u201d in which their currency does not fluctuate excessively against the euro. The process is meant to demonstrate that their economies are sustainably converging with that of the eurozone.",
      "Once the European Commission determines that requirements have been met, the member governments of the EU decide by what's called a qualified majority vote. Approval needs a minimum of 55% of member states representing at least 65% of the EU population.",
      "After joining, countries face rules limiting debt and deficits. Those rules are intended to keep countries from running large deficits that could undermine the euro.",
      "The European Commission ruled Wednesday that Bulgaria has met the requirements, seconded by an opinion from the ECB. The matter now goes to a vote at a meeting of EU finance ministers slated for July 8. EU officials say the vote is a done deal.",
      "Bulgaria is unusual in that it pegged its currency, the lev, to the euro right from the beginning of monetary union in 1999, even before it joined the European Union in 2007. Bulgaria also has very low levels of debt, only 24.1% of annual economic output. That is well below the 60% level set in the economic criteria for eurozone membership. The last step was getting inflation below the benchmark of 2.8%, or no more than 1.5% higher than the average of the three lowest eurozone members.",
      "There were concerns about the level of corruption and money laundering in the EU's poorest country. The commission and the ECB found however that Bulgaria has made progress in those areas.",
      "The most recent Eurobarometer poll carried out by the EU showed that 50% of Bulgarians were opposed and 43% in favor. Reasons include fears of inflation, distrust of official institutions in a country that has had seven governments in four years, and widespread misinformation on social media.",
      "The issue has been taken up by pro-Russian nationalist politicians who argue for keeping the national currency. President Rumen Radev stoked anti-euro forces with a proposal for a referendum, which was rejected by parliament. Misinformation included false claims that the euro would allow EU officials to confiscate dormant bank accounts or use a digital euro to control people.",
      "On Jan.1, only euros will be dispensed from cash machines, though both currencies will circulate in cash for a month. After that, lev notes can be exchanged at banks for 12 months and for an unlimited time at the Bulgarian national bank.",
      "In theory, the euro brings means lower interest rates for business and consumers and eases cross-border trade within the eurozone. Companies no longer have to engage in currency exchange transactions or worry that exchange rate shifts will erode their profits or holdings. Travelers no longer have to pay commissions at an exchange booth or on their credit card bill when vacationing or on a business trip to another EU country.",
      "Member countries get a seat on the ECB\u2019s rate-setting council and so have a voice in eurozone-wide monetary policy.",
      "Countries that join lose some authority over their own economy. They give up their ability set their own interest rates, and face restrictions on government spending and deficits, though those rules have proved flexible in practice. And they can no longer gain competitiveness relative to other countries by allowing their currency's exchange rate to devalue.",
      "Bitter memories remain of the debt and economic crisis that shook the eurozone in 2010-2015. After Greece admitted its deficit and debts were much larger than previously reported, it wound up defaulting on its debts and market turmoil spread to other eurozone countries.",
      "Greece, Portugal, Ireland, Spain, and Cyprus were bailed out with loans by the other eurozone governments, in return for strict austerity measures that impacted many ordinary people including government workers and retirees.",
      "ECB President Mario Draghi is credited with defusing the eurozone crisis in 2012 by saying that the central bank would do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to save the euro. The ECB then said it could intervene in bond markets to support countries hit by turmoil, a safeguard that calmed markets even though it was never used.",
      "Later other backstops were added, including a eurozone bailout fund and moving banking oversight from sometimes-lax national supervisors to the ECB.",
      "Countries agree to join the euro as part of joining the EU, but not all have made the effort to meet the economic requirements. There is no time window to join.",
      "Denmark was granted an opt out, while Sweden rejected the euro in a 2003 referendum despite not having an opt out and has no target date to join. Other non-members are Czechia, Hungary, Poland and Romania.",
      "Officials in Poland, the biggest non-member, have shown little interest in joining despite acknowledging the obligation to join someday. The winner of Sunday's presidential election, Karol Nawrocki, campaigned on keeping the zloty currency.",
      "The country's economy has grown strongly without euro membership, doubling in size over the past two decades as its standard of living has almost caught up with Western Europe since emerging from communist rule in 1989.",

      "Labubu, the plush toy from China\u2019s Pop Mart is a social media darling, but the toothy little monsters are not an overnight success",
      "Labubu, the plush toy from China's Pop Mart is a social media darling, but the toothy little monsters are far from an overnight success. Having appeared a decade ago, Labubus may have finally cemented their place in the collectible toy market for years to come.",
      "The Labubu, by artist and illustrator Kasing Lung, first appeared with pointed ears and pointy teeth, in three picture books inspired by Nordic mythology in 2015.",
      "In 2019 Lung struck a deal with Pop Mart, a company that caters to toy connoisseurs and influencers, to sell Labubu figurines. But it wasn't until Pop Mart started selling Labubu plush toys on key rings in 2023 that the toothy monsters suddenly seemed to be everywhere, including in the hands of Rihanna, Kim Kardashian and NBA star Dillon Brooks. K-pop singer Lisa of Blackpink began posting images of hers for her more than 100 million followers on Instagram and on TikTok, where Labubu pandemonium has broken out.",
      "There are 1.4 million #Labubu TikTok posts and counting, videos of fans unboxing them, showing styles inspired by them, and of course, Labubu cosplay.",
      "Fans have latched on to Labubu\u2019s mashup of play and fashion, making them accessories on handbags, backpacks and belts, or hanging them from car mirrors.",
      "\u201cThe character has evolved into a collectible and style symbol, resonating with fans who connect with its quirky aesthetic and unique backstory,\u201d Emily Brough, Popmart\u2019s head of IP licensing in the Americas, said.",
      "Labubu has been a bonanza for Pop Mart. Its revenue more than doubled in 2024 to 13.04 billion yuan ($1.81 billion), thanks in part to its elvish monster. Revenue from Pop Mart's plush toys soared more than 1,200% in 2024, nearly 22% of its overall revenue, according to the company's annual report.",
      "Aside from their ability to pique the interest of toy aficionados and fashionistas, Labubu latched on to the blind box phenomenon, where the purchaser doesn't know exactly which version of the plush toy they'll get.",
      "And Pop Mart made sure there is a Labubu for everyone, regardless of income. Most are priced in a wide rage between $20 and $300, with certain collaborations or limited editions priced higher, according to Brough.",
      "Unlike many toys, Labubu devotees include a large number of adults. Buyers ages 18 and over drove a year-over-year increase of more than $800 million in the U.S. toy market in 2024, according to market research firm Circana. Adult shoppers, mostly female, bought the toys for themselves. In 2025's first quarter, toy sales for those ages 18 and over rose 12% from the prior-year period. At $1.8 billion, adults also accounted for the highest spending among all age groups in the quarter.",
      "Like many retailers, Pop Mart is actively monitoring negotiations between the U.S. and just about every one of its trading partners as prices may be impacted. The situation with China is at the forefront, with President Donald Trump saying on Friday that the country \u201cviolated\u201d an agreement with the United States on trade talks.",
      "Right now Pop Mart, whose products are manufactured across Asia, says that it is continuously scaling production and expanding distribution across its online shop, retail stores and blind box vending machines to meet increasing demand.",
      "Short supply has led to long lines at stores and at least one physical fight at a shopping center in the United Kingdom. Pop Mart said in an Instagram post late last month that it was temporarily suspending all in-store and blind box machine sales in the U.K. Peter Shipman, head of Europe, said in a Facebook post that the company is currently working on a new method to distribute toys to stores.",
      "Resellers have become problematic and many Labubu fans are still willing to pay exorbitant price markups.",
      "Kena Flynn was at The Grove shopping center in Los Angeles recently when she stumbled upon some Labubus being sold at a kiosk. Flynn said in a TikTok on Sunday that the prices were \u201creally bad,\u201d but her boyfriend bought two anyway.",
      "\u201cAt a certain point, you can\u2019t buy them,\u201d Flynn said in her video. \u201cI just want a Labubu and I cannot buy one from Pop Mart, so here we are.\u201d",
      "Looking to keep up with the overwhelming demand, Pop Mart says it's on track for 50 more retail locations in the U.S. by the end of the year. That'll give shoppers more chances to hunt for Labubus, as Pop Mart says it's planning multiple new Labubu releases tied to seasonal moments and holidays throughout the rest of the year.",

      "Chancellor Friedrich Merz's Cabinet approved the so-called growth booster program, which must still be passed by lawmakers.

      "PARIS -- Europe and the United States are meeting in Paris to negotiate a settlement of a tense tariff spat with global economic ramifications between two global economic powerhouses.",
      "The European Union\u2019s top trade negotiator, Maro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d, met Wednesday with his American counterpart, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, on the sidelines of a meeting of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re advancing in the right direction at pace,\u201d \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d said at a news conference. He said ongoing technical meetings between EU and U.S. negotiators in Washington would be soon followed by a video conference between himself and Greer to then \"assess the progress and charter the way forward.\u201d",
      "Brussels and Washington are unlikely to reach a substantive trade agreement in Paris. The issues dividing them are too difficult to resolve quickly.",
      "President Donald Trump regularly fumes about America\u2019s persistent trade deficit with the European Union, which was a record $161 billion last year, according to the U.S. Commerce Department.",
      "Trump blames the gap between what the U.S. sells and what it buys from Europe on unfair trade practices and often singles out for criticism the EU\u2019s 10% tax on imported cars. America\u2019s was 2.5% until Trump raised it to 25% in April. The EU has argued its purchases of U.S. services, especially in the technology sector, all but overcome the deficit.",
      "After the Trump administration\u2019s surprise tariffs last week on steel rattled global markets and complicated the ongoing, wider tariff negotiations between Brussels and Washington, the EU on Monday said it is preparing \u201ccountermeasures\u201d against the U.S.",
      "The EU has offered the U.S. a \u201czero for zero\u201d deal in which both sides end tariffs on industrial goods, including autos. Trump has rejected that idea, but EU officials say it\u2019s still on the table.",
      "The EU could buy more liquefied natural gas and defense items from the U.S., and lower duties on cars, but it isn\u2019t likely to budge on calls to scrap the value added tax, which is akin to a sales tax, or open up the EU to American beef.",
      "\u201cWe still have a few weeks to have this discussion and negotiation,\" French Trade Minister Laurent Saint-Martin said in Paris on Wednesday ahead of the OECD meeting. \u201cIf the discussion and negotiation do not succeed, Europe is capable of having countermeasures on American products and services as well.\"",
      "Greta Peisch, who was general counsel for the U.S. trade representative in the Biden administration, said the zero-for-zero proposal could provide a way to make progress if the Trump administration \u201cis looking for a reason not to impose tariffs on the EU.\u2019\u2019",
      "But Peisch, now a partner at the Wiley Rein law firm, wondered: \u201cHow motivated is the U.S. to come to a deal with the EU?\u2019\u2019 Trump, after all, has longstanding grievances and complaints about EU trade practices.",
      "One target of his ire is the value-added tax, similar to U.S. state sales taxes.",
      "Trump and his advisers consider VATs unfair protectionism because they are levied on U.S. products. But VATs are set at a national level, not by the EU, and apply to domestic and imported products alike, so they have not traditionally been considered a trade barrier. There is little chance governments will overhaul their tax systems to appease Trump.",
      "Likewise, the Europeans are likely to balk at U.S. demands to scrap food and safety regulations that Washington views as trade barriers. These include bans on hormone-raised beef, chlorinated chicken and genetically modified foods.",
      "\u201cWhen you start talking about chickens or GMOs or automobile safety standards, you\u2019re talking about the ways countries choose to regulate their economies,\u201d Peisch said. \u201cWe think that\u2019s protectionist. They think it\u2019s keeping their citizens healthy ... It\u2019s been a sore point for 60 years.\u2019\u2019",

      "ANCHORAGE, Alaska -- Top Trump administration officials \u2014 fresh off touring one of the country's largest oil fields in the Alaska Arctic \u2014 headlined an energy conference led by the state's Republican governor on Tuesday that environmentalists criticized as promoting new oil and gas drilling and turning away from the climate crisis.",
      "Several dozen protesters were outside Gov. Mike Dunleavy's annual Alaska Sustainable Energy Conference in Anchorage, where U.S. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin were featured speakers. The federal officials were continuing a multiday trip aimed at highlighting President Donald Trump's push to expand oil and gas drilling, mining and logging in the state.",
      "The trip has included meetings with pro-drilling groups and officials, including some Alaska Native leaders on the petroleum-rich North Slope, and a visit to the Prudhoe Bay oil field near the Arctic Ocean that featured selfies near the 800-mile (1,287-kilometer) trans-Alaska oil pipeline.",
      "Calls for additional oil and gas drilling \u2014 including Trump\u2019s renewed focus on getting a massive liquefied natural gas project built \u2014 are \u201cfalse solutions\u201d to energy needs and climate concerns, protester Sarah Furman said outside the Anchorage convention hall, as people carried signs with slogans such as \u201cAlaska is Not for Sale\u201d and \u201cProtect our Public Lands.\u201d",
      "\"We find it really disingenuous that they\u2019re hosting this conference and not talking about real solutions,\u201d she said.",
      "Topics at the conference, which runs through Thursday, also include mining, carbon management, nuclear energy, renewables and hydrogen. Oil has been Alaska\u2019s economic lifeblood for decades, and Dunleavy has continued to embrace fossil fuels even as he has touted other energy opportunities in the state.",
      "Another protester, Rochelle Adams, who is Gwich\u2019in, raised concerns about the ongoing push to allow oil and gas drilling on the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Gwich\u2019in leaders have said they consider the coastal plain sacred, as caribou they rely on calve there. Leaders of the I\u00f1upiaq community of Kaktovik, which is within the refuge, support drilling as economically vital and have joined Alaska political leaders in welcoming Trump's interest in reviving a leasing program there.",
      "\u201cWhen these people come from outside to take and take and take, we are going to be left with the aftereffects,\u201d Adams said, adding later: \u201cIt's our health that will be impacted. It\u2019s our wellness, our ways of life.\u201d",
      "Zeldin, during a friendly question-and-answer period led by Dunleavy, said wildlife he saw while on the North Slope didn't appear \u201cto be victims of their surroundings\u201d and seemed \u201chappy.\u201d",
      "Burgum, addressing a move toward additional drilling in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska, said wildlife and development can coexist.

      "The White House has officially asked Congress to claw back $9.4 billion in already approved spending",
      "WASHINGTON -- The White House on Tuesday officially asked Congress to claw back $9.4 billion in already approved spending, taking funding away from programs targeted by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency.",
      "It's a process known as \u201crescission,\u201d which requires President Donald Trump to get approval from Congress to return money that had previously been appropriated. Trump's aides say the funding cuts target programs that promote liberal ideologies.",
      "The request, if it passes the House and Senate, would formally enshrine many of the spending cuts and freezes sought by DOGE. It comes at a time when Musk is extremely unhappy with the tax cut and spending plan making its way through Congress, calling it on Tuesday a \u201cdisgusting abomination\u201d for increasing the federal deficit.",
      "White House budget director Russ Vought said more rescission packages and other efforts to cut spending could follow if the current effort succeeds.",
      "\u201cWe are certainly willing and able to send up additional packages if the congressional will is there,\u201d Vought told reporters.",
      "Here's what to know about the rescissions request:",
      "The request to Congress is unlikely to meaningfully change the troublesome increase in the U.S. national debt. Tax revenues have been insufficient to cover the growing costs of Social Security, Medicare and other programs. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the government is on track to spend roughly $7 trillion this year, with the rescission request equaling just 0.1% of that total.",
      "White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters at Tuesday's briefing that Vought \u2014 a \u201cwell-respected fiscal hawk,\u201d she called him \u2014 would continue to cut spending, hinting that there could be additional efforts to return funds.",
      "\u201cHe has tools at his disposal to produce even more savings,\u201d Leavitt said.",
      "Vought said he can send up additional rescissions at the end of the fiscal year in September \u201cand if Congress does not act on it, that funding expires.\u201d",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s one of the reasons why we are not putting all of our expectations in a typical rescissions process,\u201d he added.",
      "A spokesperson for the White House Office of Management and Budget, speaking on condition of anonymity to preview some of the items that would lose funding, said that $8.3 billion was being cut from the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development. NPR and PBS would also lose federal funding, as would the U.S. President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, also known as PEPFAR.",
      "The spokesperson listed specific programs that the Trump administration considered wasteful, including $750,000 to reduce xenophobia in Venezuela, $67,000 for feeding insect powder to children in Madagascar and $3 million for circumcision, vasectomies and condoms in Zambia.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., complimented the planned cuts and pledged to pass them.",
      "\u201cThis rescissions package reflects many of DOGE\u2019s findings and is one of the many legislative tools Republicans are using to restore fiscal sanity,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cCongress will continue working closely with the White House to codify these recommendations, and the House will bring the package to the floor as quickly as possible.\u201d",
      "Members of the House Freedom Caucus, among the chamber\u2019s most conservative lawmakers, said they would like to see additional rescission packages from the administration.",
      "\u201cWe will support as many more rescissions packages the White House can send us in the coming weeks and months,\u201d the group said in a press release. \u201cPassing this rescissions package will be an important demonstration of Congress\u2019s willingness to deliver on DOGE and the Trump agenda.\u201d",
      "Sen. Susan Collins, chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, gave the package a less optimistic greeting.",
      "\u201cDespite this fast track, the Senate Appropriations Committee will carefully review the rescissions package and examine the potential consequences of these rescissions on global health, national security, emergency communications in rural communities, and public radio and television stations,\u201d the Maine lawmaker said in a statement.",
      "The White House's request to return appropriated funds is meant to comply with the 1974 Impoundment Control Act. That law created the process by which the president can formally disclose to Congress the appropriated money it intends to not spend. Congress generally has 45 days to review and approve the request, but Vought is arguing that the end of the fiscal year would enable the administration to bypass a vote.",
      "The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a fiscal watchdog group, said in a 2018 backgrounder that the Senate can pass rescission packages with a simple majority, instead of the 60 votes needed to overcome a possible filibuster. Between 1974 and 2000, presidents requested $76 billion worth of rescissions and Congress approved $25 billion.",
      "Bobby Kogan, senior director of federal budget policy at the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank, said in an emailed statement that the Trump administration was already \u201cillegally impounding additional funds,\u201d as withholding money has \u201calways been illegal without explicit Congressional approval.\u201d",
      "On CNN on Sunday, Vought insisted that the Trump administration was complying with the law, but it simply had a different view of the law relative to some Democrats.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not breaking the law,\u201d Vought said. \u201cEvery part of the federal government, each branch, has to look at the Constitution themselves and uphold it, and there\u2019s tension between the branches.\u201d",

      "The Federal Reserve said Tuesday that Wells Fargo is no longer subject to the restraints the Fed placed on the bank in 2018 for having a toxic sales and banking culture",
      "NEW YORK -- The Federal Reserve said Tuesday that Wells Fargo is no longer subject to harsh restraints the Fed placed on the bank in 2018 for having a toxic sales and banking culture.",
      "It's a win for Wells Fargo, which has spent nearly a decade trying to convince the public and policymakers that it had changed its ways.",
      "\"We are a different and far stronger company today because of the work we\u2019ve done,\u201d said Wells Fargo CEO Charlie Scharf in a statement. Scharf also announced that each of the 215,000 employees at Wells Fargo would receive a $2,000 award for turning the bank around.",
      "Wells Fargo used to have a corporate culture where it placed unreasonable sales goals on its branch employees, which resulted in employees opening up millions of fake accounts in order to meet those goals. Wells' top executives called its branches \u201cstores\u201d and employees were expected to cross-sell customers into as many banking products as possible, even if the customer did not want or need them.",
      "After an investigation by The Los Angeles Times in 2016, Wells Fargo shut down its sales culture and fired much of its leadership and board of directors. The fake accounts scandal cost Wells Fargo billions of dollars in fines and lost business, and permanently tarnished its reputation, particularly because the scandal broke only a few years after the Great Recession and financial crisis. It was later revealed that Wells Fargo opened up roughly 3.5 million accounts that were not wanted or needed by customers.",
      "Wells Fargo, once thought to be the best run bank in the country, was now the poster child of the worst practices of banking in decades.",
      "In order to push Wells to fix itself, the Federal Reserve took the unusual step of placing Wells Fargo in a program where the bank could grow no larger than it was in 2018. No bank had previously been placed into such a program, known as an asset cap. The Fed required Wells to fix it culture and redo its entire risk and compliance departments in order to address its problems.",
      "Since taking over in 2019, Scharf's goal has been to convince the Federal Reserve that Wells Fargo had fixed its toxic banking practices. With the asset cap removed, the bank can now pursue more deposits, new accounts and take on additional investment banking businesses by holding additional securities on its balance shet.",

      "The life of South Korea's new President Lee Jae-myung is full of ups and downs",
      "SEOUL, South Korea -- SEOUL, South Korea (AP) \u2014 Lee Jae-myung was a child laborer with an arm deformity. He attempted suicide. He later made his way through university and became a highly divisive politician who survived a stabbing attack and struggles with numerous criminal charges.",
      "His turbulent life climaxed, as Lee, 60, the candidate of the main liberal Democratic Party, was elected as South Korea's new president to succeed his conservative archrival Yoon Suk Yeol, who was ousted over his stunning imposition of martial law.",
      "There are both hopes and fears about Lee's win. Supporters think he's an able leader who can get things done and fix the country's deep-rooted economic inequality and corruption. But critics say Lee will likely oppress political opponents and intensify a domestic division.",
      "Here's a look at Lee, whose single, five-year presidency begins on Wednesday:",
      "After graduating from an elementary school, Lee had to work at various factories in Seongnam, a city near Seoul, because his family couldn\u2019t afford his secondary education.",
      "At a factory manufacturing baseball gloves, he had his left forearm crushed by a press machine, getting a permanent arm disability. Lee said he suffered beating at his factories and hated encountering a girl who was a neighbor when he helped his garbage collector father's work at a traditional market.",
      "Despaired, Lee tried to kill himself twice, both unsuccessfully. He later got back on his feet and entered Seoul's Chung-Ang University with a full scholarship, before he became a human rights lawyer.",
      "\u201cHopes and ordeals always come together. The roles of ordeals are not getting people to surrender, but testing how serious and desperate their hopes are,\u201d Lee said in a memoir published in 2017.",
      "Lee later entered politics and became Seongnam mayor and governor of Gyeonggi province. Once a political outsider, Lee rose to prominence in 2016 after he made a series of fiery street speeches criticizing then conservative President Park Geun-hye, who was later removed from office over a corruption scandal.",
      "\u201cLet\u2019s seize her with our hands and consign her to history,\" Lee said during one rally in December 2016.",
      "Many of his comments have since sharply polarized South Koreans.",
      "Lee vilified South Korea's conservative establishment as greedy \u201cfake conservatives.\" He slammed a U.S. missile defense system in South Korea as a source of tensions and likened strengthening U.S.-Japan ties to a 1905 Washington-Tokyo agreement that he said helped Japan colonize the Korean Peninsula later.",
      "Lee's proposal of giving a universal basic income to all citizens have invited accusations that he's a populist.",
      "In 2022, he lost the hotly contested presidential election to Yoon. In 2024, Lee was attacked by a man who told investigators that he wanted to kill Lee to prevent him from becoming president.",
      "Recently, Lee has made few contentious or radical comments on foreign policy and security issues, and rather has promised to pursue pragmatic diplomacy.",
      "He's repeatedly described South Korea's alliance with the U.S. as the foundation of the country's foreign policy and stressed the need to maintain a trilateral Seoul-Washington-Tokyo security partnership.",
      "\u201cWhen it comes to what Lee said in the past, we don't know whether he made such comments only to appeal to his supporters or whether they showed his true nature,\u201d said Shin Yul, a politics professor at Seoul\u2019s Myonggi University.",
      "The major issues that Lee will immediately face is U.S. President Donald Trump's trade war and other \u201cAmerica First\u201d policies, and North Korea's advancing nuclear program. They are both vital issues for South Korea, but many experts say there isn't much diplomatic room for South Korea to maneuver in to produce major changes in its favor in both matters.",
      "Paik Wooyeal, a professor at Seoul\u2019s Yonsei University, said that Trump is \u201ctoo overwhelming and dominant,\u201d so that whoever is in South Korean leadership, the country's dealings with the U.S. won't be much different. He said that foreign policy advisers for Lee would also know that North Korea won't voluntarily give up its nuclear weapons.",
      "Lee comes to office under the shadow of his own legal troubles.",
      "He stands accused in five trials over corruption and other charges, and at one point, some of his legal battles threatened his bid for presidency.",
      "Lee celebrated in March when the Seoul High Court overturned a suspended prison sentence against him for violating the election law during the 2022 race. But he fumed in May when the Supreme Court quashed that ruling and sent the case back to the high court, citing a strong likelihood of his guilt. Hearings at the high court were eventually postponed until after the election.",
      "Had his conviction been finalized, Lee would have been barred from running for president.",
      "Other trials center around his roles in dubious development projects and illegal money transfers to North Korea, and his alleged misuse of official funds and persuading of a witness to commit perjury.",
      "Lee's five trials will likely stop as South Korea\u2019s constitution prevents a sitting president from being charged with most crimes. But his rivals will take issue with it, because the constitution doesn't clearly state whether a president can be convicted for crimes in which indictments came before taking up office.",
      "Lee\u2019s Democratic Party, which holds a majority in the National Assembly, has been pushing to revise the criminal procedure law to suspend ongoing criminal trials involving a sitting president until the end of their term. Conservatives have harshly lambasted the move.",
      "During the presidential campaign, Lee vowed not to pursue a vendetta against conservatives. However, he has also called for a thorough investigation into Yoon and his inner circle over rebellion allegations.",
      "Lee's opponents worry he could use those investigations to clamp down on Yoon associates and prosecutors who he thinks orchestrated inquiries involving his criminal charges.",
      "Yoon's martial law stunt intensified a domestic divide.",
      "Declaring martial law, Yoon portrayed Lee's party as \u201canti-state\u201d forces influenced by North Korea and China. He has also endorsed baseless election fraud theories to discredit the liberals\u2019 legislative majority, prompting his angry supporters to pour onto the streets with \u201cStop the Steal\u201d signs. Anti-Yoon activists and citizens, for their part, also rallied for weeks to demand his immediate dismissal.",
      "With liberals remaining in control of the legislature, Lee faces a far more favorable environment to advance his policies. Conservatives have voiced concern that Lee and the Democratic Party will wield virtually unchecked power to pass legislation previously blocked by Yoon\u2019s administration, including bills aimed at strengthening protections for labor unionists against corporate lawsuits and shielding farmers from volatile rice prices.",

      "Colombia\u2019s wind energy plans in La Guajira are faltering as major companies exit and projects remain stalled",
      "BOGOTA, Colombia -- Colombia\u2019s ambitious plans for wind energy development, especially in the resource-rich La Guajira region, are facing serious setbacks as major companies pull out and projects stall, industry experts say.",
      "Margarita Nieves, director of the Colombian Offshore Wind Research Network, told The Associated Press that despite large targets \u2014 including 1.1 gigawatts awarded in a 2019 auction \u2014 only two wind farms are partially operating today, with a combined capacity of less than 32 megawatts.",
      "Colombia\u2019s Mining and Energy Planning Unit estimates the country could generate up to 18 gigawatts of wind energy \u2014 nearly double the nation\u2019s current installed electricity capacity of 20 gigawatts.",
      "Several companies brought equipment and infrastructure to Colombia around 2021 before securing permits, but parks remain unbuilt. Key obstacles include limited grid connection infrastructure in La Guajira, recent regulatory changes that reduce financial returns and complex social and leadership challenges.",
      "Colombia, Latin America\u2019s third-most populous country, has pledged to reach net-zero emissions by 2050. President Gustavo Petro, the country\u2019s first leftist leader, presents himself as an environmentalist and advocate of a just energy transition. Yet Colombia remains deeply reliant on fossil fuels \u2014 oil is its top export and a major source of government revenue.",
      "In 2023, Italian multinational Enel withdrew from the Windpeshi onshore wind energy project in La Guajira. By late 2024, EDP Renewables canceled two major projects, Alpha and Beta, two large-scale onshore wind farms in the same region. In May, Colombian state-owned oil company Ecopetrol acquired nine solar and wind energy projects from Norway\u2019s Statkraft, marking the European firm\u2019s exit from the country. The portfolio spans La Guajira, Sucre, Cordoba, Caldas, and Magdalena, with a combined potential capacity of 1.3 gigawatts. Only one project is currently operational, with others expected to come online between 2026 and 2027.",
      "The move is part of Ecopetrol\u2019s broader energy transition strategy to reduce reliance on oil and gas and meet net-zero goals by 2050. However, challenges like regulatory delays, governance concerns, and potential impacts on Colombia\u2019s fiscal stability raise questions about the transition\u2019s pace and economic effects.",
      "Nieves warned that the situation is \u201cvery concerning,\u201d with only two of over 20 planned projects advancing. She stressed the need to speed up regulatory processes, improve consultations with Indigenous communities \u2014 notably the Wayuu in La Guajira \u2014 and ensure sufficient electrical infrastructure.",
      "\u201cColombia has more than 20 years of delay in wind energy,\u201d Nieves said. \u201cBrazil, in contrast, has built over 1,300 onshore wind farms in the last two decades and is a top global turbine producer.\"",
      "The wind energy projects were part of Colombia\u2019s just energy transition, aiming to replace fossil fuels with renewables while supporting vulnerable groups like Indigenous peoples. The region is home to Cerrejon, one of the largest open-pit coal mines in the world and a major player in Latin America\u2019s mining sector, which has been in operation since 1985. The mine has just nine years left in its life span, and its closure, without alternative plans in place, will deal a significant blow to the region\u2019s economy.",
      "For Samuel Lanao, head of La Guajira\u2019s environmental authority, the main reason several licensed renewable energy projects are being sold off is because companies struggle with deep-rooted social tensions, particularly during the prior consultation process with local Indigenous communities. Lanao said confrontations have emerged between firms and residents, derailing expectations of development.",
      "\u201cThis has been a major blow to La Guajira,\u201d he said, \u201cas there were high hopes for economic and social progress through these projects.\u201d",
      "The Wayuu people, a seminomadic Indigenous group in the arid La Guajira region of northern Colombia and Venezuela, remain divided over wind energy development. While some have welcomed the economic support offered by companies building turbines on their ancestral lands, many others have raised concerns over environmental and cultural impacts, and a lack of meaningful prior consultation, in what is one of Colombia\u2019s poorest regions.",
      "Diego Patron, manager of the Jemeiwaa Ka\u2019I wind project, a large-scale wind farm cluster in La Guajira, acknowledged the pioneering nature of Colombia\u2019s early wind efforts, which began in a regulatory vacuum without clear institutional frameworks.",
      "\u201cThese foundational projects faced a steep institutional and territorial learning curve, resulting in the loss of key strategic projects,\u201d Patron said. \u201cHowever, their legacy now forms the cornerstone for new initiatives.\"",
      "Patron believes that barriers around legitimate Wayuu community representation, environmental permitting, and contract resolutions have been overcome, creating more stable conditions.\u201d",
      "Patron said misinformation deepened tensions and unfairly damaged firms like EDP that, he says, aimed to support communities.",

      "Trump met with Senate Majority Leader John Thune at the White House early this week and has been dialing senators for one-on-one chats, using both the carrot and stick to nudge, badger and encourage them to act. But it's still a long road ahead for the 1,000-page-plus package.",
      "\u201cHis question to me was, How do you think the bill's going to go in the Senate?\u201d Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., said about his call with Trump. \u201cDo you think there's going to be problems?\u201d",
      "It's a potentially tumultuous three-week sprint for senators preparing to put their own imprint on the massive Republican package that cleared the House late last month by a single vote. The senators have been meeting for weeks behind closed doors, including as they returned to Washington late Monday, to revise the package ahead of what is expected to be a similarly narrow vote in the Senate.",

      "But Trump's high-octane ally, billionaire Elon Musk, lambasted the package \u2014 and those voting for it.",
      "\u201cThis massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination,\u201d Musk posted on his site X, as some lawmakers have expressed reservations about the details. \u201cShame on those who voted for it: you know you did wrong. You know it.\u201d",
      "Thune, like House Speaker Mike Johnson, has few votes to spare from the Senate's slim, 53-seat GOP majority. Democrats are waging an all-out political assault on GOP proposals to cut Medicaid, food stamps and green energy investments to help pay for more than $4.5 trillion in tax cuts \u2014 with many lawmakers being hammered at boisterous town halls back home.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019d be nice if we could have everybody on board to do it, but, you know, individual members are going to stake out their positions,\u201d Thune said Tuesday.",
      "\u201cBut in the end, we have to succeed. Failure\u2019s not an option.\u201d",
      "At its core, the package seeks to extend the tax cuts approved in 2017, during Trump's first term at the White House, and add new ones the presidents campaigned on, including no taxes on tips and others. It also includes a massive build-up of $350 billion for border security, deportations and national security.",
      "To defray the lost tax revenue to the government and avoid piling onto the nation's $36 trillion debt load, Republicans want reduce federal spending by imposing work requirements for some Americans who rely on government safety net services. Estimates are 8.6 million people would no longer have health care and nearly 4 million would lose Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program benefits, known as SNAP.",
      "The package also would raise the nation's debt limit by $4 trillion to allow more borrowing to pay the bills.",
      "Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said Trump's bill \"is ugly to its very core.\u201d",
      "Schumer said Tuesday it's a \u201clie\u201d that the cuts won't hurt Americans. \u201cBehind the smoke and mirrors lies a cruel and draconian truth: tax breaks for the ultra-wealthy paid for by gutting health care for millions of Americans,\" said the New York senator.",
      "The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office is expected to soon provide an overall analysis of the package's impacts on the government balance sheets, particular rising annual deficits. But Republicans are ready to blast those findings from the congressional scorekeeper as flawed.",
      "Trump Tuesday switched to tougher tactics, deriding the holdout Republican senators to get on board.",
      "The president laid into Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, the libertarian-leaning deficit hawk who has made a career of arguing against government spending. Paul wants the package's $4 trillion increase to the debt ceiling out of the bill.",

      "The July 4th deadline is not only aspirational for the president, it's all but mandatory for his Treasury Department. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has warned Congress that the nation will run out of money to pay its bills if the debt ceiling, now at $36 trillion, is not lifted by mid-July or early August to allow more borrowing. Bessent has also been meeting behind closed doors with senators and GOP leadership.",

      "USA Gymnastics president and CEO Li Li Leung is stepping down at the end of the year",
      "Li Li Leung, who deftly guided USA Gymnastics back from the brink of collapse in the wake of the Larry Nassar sexual abuse scandal, is stepping down at the end of the year.",
      "The decision, which USA Gymnastics announced Thursday, comes with the organization in a far different place than it was when Leung took over in the spring of 2019.",
      "Back then, it was fighting battles on multiple fronts, and the long-term survival of one of the U.S. Olympic movement's marquee programs was hardly assured.",
      "USA Gymnastics had filed for bankruptcy just months before Leung's arrival in the hopes of reaching settlements in the dozens of lawsuits it faced from women who blamed it for failing to supervise Nassar, a former national team doctor who sexually abused them under the guise of medical treatment.",
      "The U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee was in the process of stripping USA Gymnastics of its status as the national governing body for the sport. Sponsors fled.",
      "Most importantly to Leung, a former college gymnast, the trust between the organization and its stakeholders \u2014 from athletes to parents to coaches \u2014 appeared irrevocably broken.",
      "Through a mixture of empathy, savvy and commitment, it's not that way anymore. The lawsuit was settled in late 2021. The USOPC eventually halted the decertification process. High-profile corporate partners reengaged and, in some instances, even expanded their relationship.",
      "More vitally, the daunting culture shift USA Gymnastics faced as it tried to remake itself more athlete-focused has found firm footing.",
      "Throw in a dazzling performance at the Paris Games last summer by the women's Olympic program and a resurgent one by the men, and Leung knew it was time to make a choice she called \u201cdifficult\u201d and \u201cbittersweet\u201d but also necessary.",
      "\u201cThe organization is in a great place right now,\u201d Leung told The Associated Press. \"I feel comfortable about being able to hand it over in this situation, in this position, to my successor who can then build on all the achievements we\u2019ve had so far.\u201d",
      "While Leung stressed she isn't burned out, she added she'd \u201clike a little bit of a rest.\" She also wants to ensure whoever follows her will have plenty of runway ahead of the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics.",
      "\u201cFrom a timing perspective, it would be completely unfair of me to say to the (USA Gymnastics board of directors) in 2027: \u2018Hey I\u2019m out. Now you have to figure out how to get us to LA,\" she said.",
      "The search for her replacement will begin immediately. Leung, who said she is firmly committed to finishing out the year, will be part of the hiring process for a job that looks far more desirable now than it did six years ago.",
      "\u201cLi Li leaves USA Gymnastics in a significantly stronger position than when she joined, with a promising trajectory towards LA 28,\u201d USOPC CEO Sarah Hirshland told the AP. \u201cHer leadership faced numerous challenges, yet she demonstrated remarkable resilience and strength, along with unwavering support for the athletes.\u201d",
      "When Leung was hired, she was the fourth person to hold the titles of CEO and president in two years. She never put a timeline on how long she might stay, though she believes her departure showcases just how stable things have become.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a sign of good organizational evolution to have new leadership come into place and have new perspectives and innovative thinking,\u201d she said.",
      "Leung leaned heavily into both when she ran into what was essentially a burning building. During her first week on the job alone, a tractor-trailer carrying equipment to a national training camp flipped over and she was told there was only about six weeks\u2019 worth of cash flow in the bank.",
      "It was daunting to be sure, but Leung said she had \u201czero buyer's remorse.\"",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s been difficult at times, but there has never been a day that I thought \u2018We can\u2019t do this,'\u201d she added.",
      "Leung might have been one of the few. Yet her experience as a gymnast gave her a perspective that those who preceded her did not. Where others had been almost standoffish with sexual abuse survivors out of fear of legal retribution, Leung led with empathy that wasn't merely performative.",
      "The organization established an Athletes Bill of Rights in 2020. It later expanded mental health care services for both athletes and their coaches and created a new funding structure designed to give national team members more equity.",
      "Even some of USA Gymnastics\u2019 most visible critics took notice.",
      "Two-time Olympic champion Simone Biles, who publicly identified herself as a Nassar victim in 2018 and frequently called out the organization's leadership for a series of missteps, told the AP in 2024 that she had noticed a positive shift inside USA Gymnastics because those in power had \u201cstepped up to the role\u201d and \u201cput in the work.\u201d",
      "It's that shift that Leung is most proud of as she eyes a break. She had no idea how long she would stay when she came on board. Given the organization\u2019s tenuous position at the time, she didn't have the luxury.",
      "\u201cFor me, it was about putting the big building blocks in place (and) accomplishing the things that were mission critical,\" she said. \"Cultural change is the most difficult type of change to implement, because you have no idea how long it takes.\u201d",
      "Leung understands that kind of change has no finish line. Yet when she walks out of her office in Indianapolis for the last time later this year, it will be far closer than when she walked into it.",
      "\u201cA lot of people said it was total career suicide (when I came on),\u201d Leung said. \"I thought the exact opposite of that. I think, obviously a lot of people thought it was an impossibility, (but) we\u2019ve been able to accomplish what people thought was impossible.\u201d",

      "And the winner of Game 1 will obviously leave the floor feeling good about themselves. But in the past 78 years, only 55 Game 1 winners have gone on to eventually win the title \u2014 or just about 71%.",
      "If the winner is the Thunder, it's a really good sign. Teams that win Game 1 at home have ultimately prevailed 78% of the time (47 out of 60). If the Pacers win, their odds of winning the title improve dramatically but they probably still wouldn't be called favorites. Teams that win Game 1 on the road only end up winning the series 44% of the time (8 out of 18).",
      "But it should be noted as well that the last time the Thunder were in the NBA Finals, they had the home-court advantage over the Miami Heat. Oklahoma City won Game 1 of that series at home \u2014 then lost the next four games, and LeBron James won the first of four NBA championships for the league's all-time scoring king.",

      "The two best teams in the NHL over the past couple of years traded hits, goals and saves through an instant-classic Game 1 that ended with Leon Draisaitl scoring 19-plus minutes into overtime.",
      "It was at the same time tight-checking and also wildly entertaining. Even Panthers coach Paul Maurice on the losing end could appreciate the value of must-see hockey.",
      "\u201cIts potential (is) just a spectacular seven-gamer,\u201d Maurice said \u201cUp and down the ice, it\u2019s still fast. There isn\u2019t any casualness. ... It was honest, it was hard, it was fast and it was tight. It was an overtime game.\u201d",
      "It had a little bit of everything, from Draisaitl scoring 66 seconds in to Oilers coach Kris Knoblauch unsuccessfully challenging Florida's tying goal by Sam Bennett only to watch Brad Marchand get a power-play goal less than two minutes later.",
      "Edmonton rallied from a two-goal deficit to tie it. And Sergei Bobrovsky and Stuart Skinner each made some stops on high-danger scoring chances along the way.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s my job to give us a chance to win,\u201d Skinner said. \u201cI think you\u2019ve got to give a lot of props to Bob over there, too. He made some fantastic saves, especially in overtime.\u201d",
      "There were times the play bogged down, particularly late in regulation and in sudden death OT when two powerhouse teams minimized the risks they were taking. Even for long stretches when the Panthers had the lead, there was not much ice for the Oilers to get through \u2014 and they expect more of that moving forward.",
      "\u201cTight checking,\" said Mattias Ekholm, who scored Edmonton's tying goal in the third period. \u201cI think that there\u2019s two very experienced lineups with a lot of playoff experience and have been in these situations. Everybody\u2019s pretty confident and comfortable in these. I think it\u2019s going to be a lot of the same.\u201d",
      "Part of what made it masterpiece hockey was how good the Panthers and Oilers are when the pressure is on. Sure, mistakes were made that led to goals, including the puck over the glass penalty in OT, but much of the game was textbook fundamentals.",
      "\u201cThe pucks go deep that are supposed to go deep,\u201d Maurice said. \u201cI think we had one all night we didn\u2019t like, maybe two all night that we didn\u2019t like our decision of the line. They didn\u2019t fool around with it, either.\u201d",
      "A year after the Panthers went up 3-0 in the series only to lose three in a row and then defeat the Oilers in a tight Game 7, it's clear these opponents are again evenly matched. That is a recipe for some fun times ahead, with Game 2 Friday night in Edmonton the next chapter of a growing rivalry.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s two great teams,\u201d Ekholm said. \u201cThe thing now, too, is we know exactly how they play, they know exactly how we play. It\u2019s those little, little details that are going to matter so much in the end. It\u2019s one lost coverage for a second here or there, or a penalty like you saw tonight, or whatever it is. It\u2019s teams that are also very comfortable in these moments and in these high stake games.\u201d",

      "Tom Thibodeau\u2019s firing brought back some of the confusion and chaos the New York Knicks had seemingly left behind",
      "NEW YORK -- Tom Thibodeau's firing brought back some of the confusion and chaos the New York Knicks had seemingly left behind.",
      "After an era of stability and more success than they had enjoyed in a quarter of a century, the Knicks opened a coaching search few could have predicted when they fired Thibodeau on Tuesday.",
      "\u201cWhen I first saw it, I thought it was one of those fake AI things. No way. There\u2019s no way possible,\u201d Indiana Pacers coach Rick Carlisle said.",
      "Coaching searches weren't unusual in New York for much of the 2000s, but the Knicks weren't winning then. This time, they had just reached the Eastern Conference finals for the first time in 25 years before losing to Carlisle's team, and were an early favorite to do it again next year. So changing course brought swift and strong reaction from a fan base that seemed satisfied.",
      "Who decided Thibodeau had to go? And why?",
      "\u201cThat seemed like an unfortunate call that the boss made, certainly for him,\u201d tennis Hall of Famer John McEnroe, a Knicks fan, said while calling the French Open quarterfinals for TNT.",
      "But which boss?",
      "Direct answers may not come. Knicks leadership, from owner James Dolan to team president Leon Rose, doesn't do interviews with the reporters who cover the team. So the only hint may have come in the team's statement announcing the firing, in which Rose said the organization was \u201csingularly focused on winning a championship for our fans.\u201d",
      "That means the view was that Thibodeau was good enough to get the Knicks close but not all the way.",
      "Rose was friends with Thibodeau long before hiring him in 2020 and giving him a three-year contract extension last summer. So immediate speculation was that Dolan, who at times has been viewed as meddlesome and unpopular with his team's fans, must have ordered the ouster. But a person with knowledge of the decision, speaking to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because details were to remain private, said Rose made the call with Dolan's approval.",
      "Rose conducted a thorough search five years ago, even though Thibodeau had been viewed as a favorite because of his relationship both to Rose and the organization as an assistant to Jeff Van Gundy in the late 1990s and early 2000s.",
      "Van Gundy has returned to coaching as an assistant with the Clippers, if the Knicks wanted to gauge interest in a reunion. Michael Malone, who led Denver to the 2023 NBA title, is another former Knicks assistant who is available, as is Johnnie Bryant, who was beaten out Wednesday by Jordan Ott for Phoenix's head coaching position.",
      "Rick Pitino, Dan Hurley and John Calipari are all big names with ties to the New York area if Rose wanted to go the college route, and the retired Jay Wright coached current Knicks players Jalen Brunson, Josh Hart and Mikal Bridges on national championship teams at Villanova. Brunson's father, Rick, was an assistant on Thibodeau's staff, if Rose wanted to promote the team captain's father.",
      "The Knicks had 12 different coaches between the time Van Gundy resigned early in the 2001-02 season and Thibodeau's hiring, and they won just one playoff series. Thibodeau won four in the last three seasons.",
      "McEnroe thought that earned Thibodeau another year, a common reaction to his firing. The Knicks decided otherwise, sending Rose into a search with much higher consequences than last time.",
      "Back then, on the heels of seven straight losing seasons, he just needed a coach who could win some games. Now he needs one who can deliver a championship.",
      "\u201cI mean, I\u2019m not really in that situation, but the thing I can say is Thibs did a lot for New York,\" said Thunder center Isaiah Hartenstein, who played in New York last season. \u201cHe did a lot just building that culture over there. So I think I have a lot of respect for him.\u201d",

      "The NBA is working on a plan to turn next season\u2019s All-Star Game into a U.S.-vs",
      "OKLAHOMA CITY -- The NBA is working on a plan to turn next season's All-Star Game into a U.S.-vs.-world competition, a person with knowledge of the situation said Wednesday.",
      "It remains unclear how the format will work, said the person, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the league has not made any final determinations. Speaking to Fox Sports 1 earlier Wednesday, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver \u2014 who has talked about such a game on multiple occasions \u2014 was asked if U.S. vs. the world is possible.",
      "\u201cYes,\u201d Silver said.",
      "Silver addressed the idea on March 27 as well at the league's most recent board of governors meeting, when he revealed that the NBA was scrapping the All-Star mini-tournament format that was used this season.",
      "At that time, the AP reported that the 2026 game \u2014 to be played Feb. 15 in Inglewood, California, just past the midpoint of the Milan-Cortina Winter Olympics \u2014 will be moved from its traditional prime-time Sunday night slot to one that starts on Sunday afternoon. That's happening because the game will be aired on NBC under the terms of the new 11-year media rights deals that kick in next season. NBC is also the Olympic broadcaster in the U.S.",
      "So, NBC could show Olympic events in the morning and early afternoon, then the All-Star Game, then have prime-time Olympic programming.",
      "The move comes on the heels of a popular tournament, the 4 Nations Face-off, that essentially took the place of the NHL All-Star Game this year, as well as strong competition at the Paris Olympics, where the Americans won a fifth consecutive gold medal by rallying past Nikola Jokic and Serbia in the semifinals, then topping host France and Victor Wembanyama in the title game \u2014 behind a barrage of late 3-pointers from Stephen Curry.",
      "\u201cWhat better time to feature some form of USA against the world?\u201d Silver said on FS1. \u201cI\u2019m not exactly sure what the format will be yet. I obviously paid a lot of attention to what the NHL did, which was a huge success. ... But also, going back, last summer, our Olympic competition was a huge success.\u201d",
      "There is one big challenge regarding any U.S.-vs.-world format. About 70% of NBA players are American, while 30% are international, so it would in theory be easier for an international player to make the All-Star team \u2014 if the rosters are the same size.",
      "International players, when asked at this year's All-Star Game if they would want a U.S.-vs.-world matchup, sounded enthusiastic.",
      "\u201cI would love to. My opinion is that it\u2019s more purposeful,\u201d Wembanyama said back in February. \u201cThere\u2019s more pride in it. More stakes.\u201d",
      "Added Milwaukee's Giannis Antetokounmpo, who's from Greece: \u201cI would love that. Oh, I would love that. I think that would be the most interesting and most exciting format. I would love that. For sure, I\u2019d take pride in that. I always compete, but I think that will give me a little bit more extra juice to compete.\u201d",
      "The latest format for the All-Star Game \u2014 a four-team, three-game mini-tournament in San Francisco with the first team to 40 points winning each \u2014 was a miss. It came after years of the league asking players for a more competitive game.",
      "The 211-186 final score at Indianapolis in 2024 was the last straw, and the league \u2014 for one year, anyway \u2014 thought the tournament was the answer.",

      "David Hamilton\u2019s two-run double with one out gave Boston a 5-4 lead.",
      "Combined, the starting pitchers, allowed 14 runs in 5 1/3 innings.",
      "The Angels are off Thursday, with RHP Kyle Hendricks (2-6, 5.34 ERA) slated to start the opener of a three-game series against Seattle on Friday night. The Red Sox are off Thursday before starting a three-game series in New York against the Yankees.",

      "In these NBA Finals, a team is four wins away from getting the last laugh",
      "OKLAHOMA CITY -- In these NBA Finals, a team is four wins away from getting the last laugh.",
      "Ask anyone on the Oklahoma City Thunder and Indiana Pacers if they're still fueled by doubters, and the answer is probably going to be an immediate \u201cyes.\u201d Thunder star and NBA MVP Shai Gilgeous-Alexander went 11th in his draft. Pacers star Tyrese Haliburton went 12th in his. Both sides have undrafted players in their rotation.",
      "Here they are: The NBA Finals, which start Thursday night in Oklahoma City. The Thunder have, by far, the NBA's best record this season. The Pacers have the league's second-best record since Jan. 1, including playoffs. And both teams have rolled through the postseason, going 12-4 in the first three rounds.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ll continue to tell you guys in certain moments that it doesn\u2019t matter what people say, but it matters \u2014 and I enjoy it,\" Haliburton said. \"I think the greats try to find external motivation as much as they can and that\u2019s something that\u2019s always worked for me.\u201d",
      "It's not like more motivation is needed. Not for the next couple of weeks, anyway. Indiana is chasing its first NBA title. Oklahoma City \u2014 technically \u2014 is also seeking its first; the franchise won a championship when it played in Seattle in 1979. These are teams that combined to win 49 games just three seasons ago, and now they're the last two standing.",
      "\u201cStaying true to who we are is the reason why we\u2019re here,\" Gilgeous-Alexander said. \u201cWe\u2019d be doing ourselves a disservice if we changed or tried to be something we're not once we got here. We\u2019ve had success doing so. If we want to keep having success, we have to be who we are. It\u2019s organic. It\u2019s nothing we have to think about or force. It\u2019s just who we are, no matter the moment.\u201d",
      "The Thunder are enormous favorites in the series, according to BetMGM Sportsbook, and understandably so. They're 80-18 including the regular season and postseason, plus went 29-1 in the regular season against the Eastern Conference and have more double-digit wins \u2014 61 and counting \u2014 than any team in any season in NBA history.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of work cut out for us,\u201d Pacers coach Rick Carlisle said. \u201cA lot of our guys have been through a lot of situations where they\u2019ve been underdogs in the past. It\u2019s simply going to come down to us being able to play our game at the best possible level. We\u2019re going to need to take care of the ball because these guys turn people over at an historic rate, and we\u2019re going to have to make some shots.\u201d",
      "The Thunder want no part of hearing this series will be easy. The way Indiana \u2014 a No. 4 seed in the East \u2014 got through Giannis Antetokounmpo and Milwaukee in Round 1, a top-seeded Cleveland team in Round 2 and New York in Round 3 and never faced an elimination game has captured Oklahoma City's full attention.",
      "\u201cTheir attack is very simple. The theoretical way to stop it is simple,\u201d Thunder coach Mark Daigneault said. \u201cIn reality it\u2019s very difficult to do, as you can see from the way that they\u2019ve really had their way with everybody. ... They pump a 99 mph fastball at you. You can prepare all you want for that. When you\u2019re in the batter\u2019s box, it\u2019s different when it\u2019s time to hit it.\u201d",
      "The Thunder are the youngest team to make the NBA Finals in 48 years, according to data provided by the league. With an average age of about 25 years and seven months, they're the youngest finalist since Portland in 1977.",
      "That said, hearing about it is getting, well, old.",
      "\u201cYoung or not, when you can learn from whatever situation you\u2019re thrown in, that makes you better,\u201d Thunder guard Jalen Williams said. \u201cI think that\u2019s why we\u2019re here in this moment.\u201d",
      "There will be a Game 1 in Oklahoma City on Thursday night \u2014 and a Game 2 on Thursday night as well.",
      "At Paycom Center, there's Game 1 of the NBA Finals. And Devon Park, about a 15-minute drive away from the Thunder home floor, will play host to Game 2 of the Women's College World Series between Texas and Texas Tech that same night.",
      "If the softball facility \u2014 which will be the site of games at the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics \u2014 is filled, that means about 32,000 people will be watching championship games in Oklahoma City on Thursday.",
      "There are four players on these teams with previous NBA Finals experience.",
      "Indiana\u2019s Pascal Siakam averaged 19.8 points in six games with Toronto, helping the Raptors win the title in 2019. Oklahoma City\u2019s Alex Caruso averaged 6.3 points in six games with the Los Angeles Lakers, helping them past Miami in the bubble finals of 2020.",
      "Indiana\u2019s Thomas Bryant got in one game of Denver\u2019s 2023 finals win over Miami, and the Pacers\u2019 Aaron Nesmith played for Boston in the Celtics\u2019 loss to Golden State in the 2022 finals.",

      "BEREA, Ohio -- The dichotomy that is Shedeur Sanders' development as a rookie quarterback and the heightened expectations for him with the Cleveland Browns were again on full display Wednesday.",
      "Sanders had the best throw of the day during organized team activities when he zipped a pinpoint pass to tight end Caden Davis in the back of the end zone during a 7-on-7 red zone drill. Whether or not Davis got both feet in before going out of bounds was up for debate on social media.",
      "However, Sanders was the only one of Cleveland's four quarterbacks not to take a snap with the first-team offense during 11-on-11 drills. He did take second-team snaps, but slipped and fell on the first play.",
      "Offensive coordinator Tommy Rees lauded Sanders for his work ethic on what some still see as a steep learning curve for the fifth-round pick.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s really put in a lot of work as all those guys are, but you could tell on the mental side of the game and learning the system and calling it and having that rhythm to it, he\u2019s put a lot of work and time and effort into that. And then when you do that, the game starts to slow down and you can focus on finding completions. And he\u2019s done a nice job of that as camp\u2019s progressed,\u201d Rees said.",
      "With three young quarterbacks in camp \u2014 third-round pick Dillon Gabriel, Sanders and fourth-year pro Kenny Pickett \u2014 Rees said a large amount of the offense has been installed while keeping a close eye on the growth and progression of all three.",
      "\u201cDefinitely pushing them and pushing where we want them to go, but also being cognizant of, hey, we want them to go out there with confidence and making sure that it\u2019s beneficial to how they\u2019re learning and the way they\u2019re going,\u201d Rees said.",
      "Joe Flacco and Pickett remain the front-runners to be under center on Sept. 7 when the Browns open against the Cincinnati Bengals. The amount of snaps all four will get during the first two weeks of training camp remain fluid.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re going to find ways to be creative and make sure they all have opportunities to develop and put their best foot forward. And when the time comes, we will continue to push guys forward as they earn it,\u201d Rees said.",
      "The amount of snaps all four will receive during the three days of next week's mandatory minicamp also have to be determined.",
      "When it comes to who may win the starting job, Rees can see valid arguments for any of the four at this stage of the competition.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re so early in the process and in evaluating it. I think we have a good group of guys that will continue to push one another and by the time September rolls around, we\u2019ll be ready to go,\u201d he said.",

      "Edmonton Oilers forward Zach Hyman says his right wrist got dislocated late in the Western Conference final when he was hit by Dallas' Mason Marchment",
      "EDMONTON, Alberta -- Zach Hyman said Wednesday his right wrist got dislocated late last round, an injury that is sidelining one of the Edmonton Oilers' most valuable forwards for the Stanley Cup Final against the Florida Panthers.",
      "Hyman sported a brace on his right arm after undergoing surgery last week to repair the damage caused by a hit from Dallas' Mason Marchment in Game 4 of the Western Conference final.",
      "\u201cI knew it wasn\u2019t good when I got hit,\u201d Hyman said. \u201cRight away, I just felt my wrist kind of go on me. ... Quickly realized when I saw the doctors it\u2019s something that needed surgery and something that I wasn\u2019t going to be able to play through.\u201d",
      "Hyman memorably said after the Oilers' Game 7 loss to Florida last year that he believed they would be back in the final. In a cruel twist of fate, his teammates are, but the 33-year-old winger is not able to play in the series.",
      "Win it for Hyman has quickly becoming a rallying cry for Edmonton.",
      "\u201cMissing him is big; he\u2019s a huge piece of this team,\u201d veteran Adam Henrique said.\" His physicality, net-front presence, in the locker room \u2014 all those sorts of things. Just a great person, so we\u2019re certainly going to miss him on the ice but he\u2019ll be there and we\u2019ll certainly fight for him.\"",
      "Oilers players video-called Hyman after beating the Stars without him in Game 5 of the West final to move on to compete for the Stanley Cup again. He said that meant the world to him.",
      "\u201cIt caught me off guard,\u201d Hyman said. \u201cI was crying. It was really emotional. You just feel so much a part of the team and for them to do that in that moment meant a lot.\u201d",
      "Hyman is expected to be around the team throughout the final, flying to Florida and providing whatever insight and moral support he can without lacing up his skates. He called it \u201cacting like I\u2019m playing but obviously not.\u201d",
      "\u201cSome things in life you can\u2019t control,\u201d Hyman said, \u201cand this is one of them.\u201d",
      "The Panthers are mostly healthy, but they ruled out A.J. Greer for Game 1 of the Cup final with an undisclosed injury. Jesper Boqvist takes his place in the lineup.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s important that, fortunately for us, it\u2019s not his first time in the playoffs, so he hasn\u2019t been sitting for a long time and he\u2019s had some pretty good success when he\u2019s come in,\u201d coach Paul Maurice said of Greer. \u201cAnd he fits. He\u2019s spent time with all of those players. There\u2019s nothing new for him, so he can come in and just play.\u201d",
      "Edmonton is getting a key player back with Connor Brown expected to be back after missing two games because of injury. Coach Kris Knoblauch called the strong two-way winger a game-time decision, while Brown declared himself good to go and all signs pointed to nothing standing in the way of a return.",
      "\u201cHe\u2019s been playing great all playoffs,\u201d linemate Trent Frederic said. \u201cHe brings a lot of energy, brings a lot of swagger, a lot of jam, so we\u2019re excited to get him back.\u201d",
      "Jeff Skinner, who played more than 1,000 regular-season NHL games in his career before making his Stanley Cup Playoff debut in the series opener in the first round and then got scratched until replacing Hyman against Dallas, appears to be out to make room for Brown.",

      "Dan Muse is the new head coach of the Pittsburgh Penguins",
      "PITTSBURGH -- The Pittsburgh Penguins are trying to navigate their way through the twilight of the Sidney Crosby era to the dawn of whatever comes next.",
      "It's a transition general manager Kyle Dubas has repeatedly said will not be easy, or particularly quick, and would require a coach who can connect with veterans while simultaneously developing young talent.",
      "Enter Dan Muse, who has spent the last two decades dabbling in the former and excelling in the latter.",
      "Dubas hired the 42-year-old Muse as Pittsburgh's coach on Wednesday, tasking the former New York Rangers assistant with helping the Penguins find their way back to relevance after three straight springs spent with their noses pressed to the glass while the Stanley Cup playoffs went on with them.",
      "Muse replaces Mike Sullivan, who split with Pittsburgh in April after a nearly decade-long tenure that included back-to-back Stanley Cups in 2016 and 2017. The Rangers scooped up Sullivan in early May.",
      "Sullivan's departure was amicable. He even took out a billboard in Pittsburgh last week thanking the city. In New York, Sullivan will find a more experienced roster ready to win now.",
      "That won't be the case for Muse in Pittsburgh. The seventh of the eight coaching vacancies filled this offseason \u2014 Muse's hiring leaves the Boston Bruins as the only club still searching \u2014 is walking into a job that will require patience, prodding and maybe a bit of politicking to thrive.",
      "Dubas said the team met with \u201cmany candidates\u201d before deciding on Muse, who has spent the last half-decade as an assistant at the NHL level. Muse also has a track record as a cultivator of talent and served as the head coach of USA Hockey\u2019s National Team Development Program from 2020-23.",
      "\u201cWhat separated Dan was his ability to develop players, win at all levels where he has been a head coach and his consistent success coaching special teams in the NHL,\u201d Dubas said. \u201cFrom his success in developing college and junior players, to his impactful work with veteran players during his time in the NHL, Dan has shown a proven ability to connect with players at all stages of their careers and help them to reach their potential.\u201d",
      "Muse has been part of coaching staffs that have won titles at multiple levels. He was an assistant at Yale when the Bulldogs claimed the NCAA championship in 2013. He served as the head coach for the Chicago Steel of the United States Hockey League \u2014 the top junior league in the U.S. \u2014 when the Steel captured the Clark Cup in 2017 and helped the U.S. under-18 and under-20 teams win world titles.",
      "When Muse reached the NHL in 2017 with Nashville, he oversaw a penalty-kill unit that was among the league\u2019s best. He produced similar results when he took over a similar role with the Rangers in 2023.",
      "\u201cHis overall body of work, attention to detail and vision for our group showed us that he is the best coach to take our team forward,\u201d Dubas said.",
      "The list of players Muse has worked with during his time at USA Hockey includes forward Rutger McGroarty, a 21-year-old now considered the top prospect in the Penguins' system.",
      "Muse's job will be to find a way to mesh McGroarty and the rest of what likely will be a substantial youth movement with a team that for now remains defined by franchise icons Crosby, Evgeni Malkin and Kris Letang.",
      "Crosby signed an extension last fall that could keep him in Pittsburgh for two more seasons. Letang is signed through 2028. Malkin, who turns 39 in August, is about to enter the final season of his contract, with retirement perhaps not far behind.",
      "Dubas has long known this day was coming and has spent a significant chunk of the last 16 months stockpiling draft picks. The Penguins have 30 selections over the next three drafts, including 18 over the first three rounds, though Dubas is likely to turn some of those selections into packages designed to acquire NHL-ready players.",
      "While Pittsburgh should have a little more room under the salary cap to fill out the roster, Dubas is focused on trying to build something sustainable for the long haul rather than a quick fix.",
      "Muse will inherit a team that has serious questions in net, where Tristan Jarry and Alex Nedeljkovic struggled last season, and is in urgent need of depth scoring to complement Crosby and linemates Bryan Rust and Rickard Rakell.",
      "The last time the Penguins hired a coach without NHL head coaching experience, Mike Johnston was fired just over two months into his second season. He was replaced by Sullivan, whose fiery persona \u2014 along with significant help from heady moves made by then-general manager Jim Rutherford \u2014 made Pittsburgh the first team in nearly 20 years to win consecutive Cups.",
      "Sullivan's mandate was clear: Wake the Penguins up. Muse's is, too: Help the franchise successfully navigate the bridge from one generation to the next.",

      "As much as Bryson DeChambeau loves to practice and compete, the U.S. Open champion also appreciates the limited LIV Golf schedule that gives him time to pursue other interests",
      "GAINESVILLE, Va. -- As much as Bryson DeChambeau loves to practice and compete, the U.S. Open champion also appreciates the limited LIV Golf schedule that gives him time to pursue other interests.",
      "DeChambeau arrived at Robert Trent Jones Golf Club for LIV Golf Virginia after a characteristically busy few days that included a round of golf with President Donald Trump and some short-game practice on the South Lawn of the White House.",
      "Now the big-hitting YouTube star turns his attention to the 54-hole LIV event that starts Friday at Robert Trent Jones Golf Club. He said the thick rough and fast greens at RTJ would help prepare him for Oakmont, where he will try next week to win his third U.S. Open after triumphs last year at Pinehurst No. 2 and in 2020 at Winged Foot.",
      "\u201cI think LIV afforded me the opportunity to spend more time thinking, strategizing, getting my body healthy, ready for majors in a pretty unique way,\u201d DeChambeau said Wednesday. \u201cFor me, it was a great thing. I thought there was an opportunity to do other things in life, and look, do I want to win every single tournament I show up to? 100%.\u201d",
      "The RTJ event is the eighth of 14 tournaments this year for the globetrotting, Saudi-funded LIV Golf League. Although PGA Tour players have more freedom to set their own schedules, they typically play more often. For top-ranked Scottie Scheffler, the U.S. Open will be the fourth of five events in a seven-week stretch.",
      "DeChambeau hasn't competed since last month's PGA Championship, won by Scheffler. While DeChambeau was enjoying a friendly round with Trump and posting a YouTube short in which he hit golf balls from the top of a mountain and the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah, Scheffler was finishing off his third win of the past month at the Memorial.",
      "\u201cI\u2019ve been doing some fun side quests, yes, there\u2019s no doubt,\u201d DeChambeau said.",
      "When he does compete, nobody practices harder than DeChambeau. He hit 1,029 range balls \u2014 more than anyone else in the field \u2014 at the Masters, where he finished in a tie for fifth.",
      "The 31-year-old DeChambeau said he developed his practice habits as a teenager, when other junior golfers in California were beating him even though they didn't appear to try as hard.",
      "\u201cIt stemmed from me not being as good as others and then realizing I can only be as good as how hard I work,\u201d DeChambeau said. \u201cSo I just became obsessed with hitting crazy amounts of golf balls.\u201d",
      "Known for trying to optimize his swing and his equipment to produce a consistent ball flight \u2014 a long, high draw \u2014 DeChambeau also spends time practicing the unusual shots he needs to finish off tournaments.",
      "\u201cAs much as I am a robot, and try to swing it as straight as possible and just stable as possible, I still do have to hit cuts and draws and hit weird shots every once in a while,\u201d he said. \u201cGiving myself those opportunities in the bunker, in the bush, whatever, has only aided in my golf career.\u201d",
      "After he shocked the golf world four years ago by winning the PGA Championship at age 50, Phil Mickelson had a moment of honest self-assessment.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s very possible that this is the last tournament I ever win. Like if I\u2019m being realistic,\u201d Mickelson said on that triumphant Sunday at Kiawah Island.",
      "Mickelson hasn't won since, and while he wasn't eager to reflect Wednesday on a career that includes six major titles and just as many famous near-misses, he indicated his competitive future is limited.",
      "He said he wants to help his teammates on LIV's HyFlyers squad and would step away if he's no longer doing that.",
      "\u201cI\u2019m also going to be 55 in a couple weeks, so I want to be realistic there, too. I want this team to succeed. I don\u2019t want to hold it back,\u201d Mickelson said. \u201cIf I\u2019m holding it back, then it\u2019s time for me to move on and get somebody else in here.\u201d",
      "Mickelson also acknowledged the possibility that Oakmont will be his last U.S. Open. He has a record six runner-up finishes at the national championship, the only major he hasn't won.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a high likelihood that it will be,\u201d Mickelson said, \u201cbut I haven\u2019t really thought about it too much.\u201d",
      "The USGA gave Mickelson a special exemption to the 2021 U.S. Open at Torrey Pines, which he ultimately didn't need because he won at Kiawah a month earlier. Nonetheless, the U.S. Open historically does not grant more than one special exemption to any player, and Mickelson has missed the past three U.S. Open cuts. He remains exempt for the other three majors as a past champion.",

      "TOKYO -- Eager customers lined up outside electronics stores in Tokyo hours in advance to collect their pre-ordered Nintendo Switch 2 video game consoles.",
      "The much anticipated Switch 2, being released around the world Thursday, is an upgrade to its eight-year-old predecessor with new social features meant to draw players into online gaming. Nintendo is counting on the Switch 2 to boost sagging sales.",
      "In the U.S., a chaotic pre-order process in April left some fans frustrated after the consoles quickly sold out. Still, some eager fans lined up early Thursday at retailers such as Target in hopes of purchasing a unit.",
      "\u201cI'm just rolling the dice here,\u201d said Edgar Huo, who was in a line of about 25 outside of a Target in the Tribeca neighborhood of Manhattan, New York. Many of those waiting for the store to open had ordered online, but a few like Huo hoped for a chance at purchasing any extra inventory the store had.",
      "In Japan, the new consoles were sold through a competitive lottery system that Nintendo said got about 2.2 million applications.",
      "Outside the official draw, some retailers offered their own lotteries to pre-order the devices.",
      "Koji Takahashi was among those who missed out on the official draw but he was selected in the second round of a lottery held by a major electronics retailer in Japan.",
      "He was first in line waiting outside the store, arriving four hours ahead of its opening. He hoped to secure a limited supply of Nintendo accessories to buy along with his pre-ordered Switch 2.",
      "\u201cI feel very sorry for those who weren\u2019t successful in the lottery. But I also had tough time getting this far, so I hope they forgive me!\u201d Takahashi said.",
      "The new console comes with a larger and higher resolution screen than its predecessor, with improved processing power, offering smoother and more vivid graphics. Central to its updated system is a new \u201cC\u201d button on its controller, which will launch a \u201cGameChat\u201d feature that requires a subscription to Nintendo\u2019s Switch online service. It allows players to \u201ccommunicate with friends and family while playing a game,\u201d and lets them share their game screen with others. A built-in microphone will also allow chatting with other gamers.",
      "Nintendo has said it expects to sell 15 million Switch 2 consoles for the fiscal year through March 2026.",
      "The company has promised to roll out attractive software for the Switch 2 later this year, including \u201cThe Legend of Zelda\u201d games, a Pokemon title and a Kirby game, as well as offerings from outside software companies.",
      "Nintendo is capitalizing on the launch with the opening of a store in San Francisco and the Super Nintendo World amusement facility in Orlando, Florida, both set for this month.",
      "The Switch 2\u2019s rollout arrives at an uncertain time for much of the gaming industry due to new tariffs implemented by U.S. President Donald Trump.",
      "In the U.S., the Switch 2\u2019s baseline launch price is $449.99 \u2014 significantly higher than the original Switch\u2019s $299 price tag.",
      "U.S. preorders for the Switch 2 were delayed for several weeks so the company could assess the potential impact of tariffs.",

      "The Humboldt Cable, envisioned for deployment in 2027, is a 14,800-kilometer (9,200-mile) submarine data cable that will connect Chile\u2019s coastal city of Valpara\u00edso with Sydney, Australia through French Polynesia.",
      "The initiative is being launched almost a decade after it was first proposed in 2016, and six years after the initial studies to determine its feasibility.",
      "\u201cThis is the first submarine cable in the South Pacific, so it's an important commitment\", Chilean Transport Minister Juan Carlos Mu\u00f1oz told journalists.",
      "Chile, home to one of Google's largest data centers in Latin America, is currently connected to the United States and the rest of the region via an undersea cable. This cable also provides Chile with a longer route to other continents.",
      "Officials from both Google and the Chilean government hailed the project as critical infrastructure with potential to attract millions of dollars in investment from major tech companies, mining and banking firms in Chile and Australia.",
      "\u201cThe idea of \u200b\u200bbuilding this cable is that it can also be used not only by Google but also by other users, such as technology companies operating in Chile,\u201d said Cristian Ramos, director of telecommunications infrastructure for Latin America at Alphabet, Google\u2019s parent company.",
      "Although Google did not disclose its total investment, Patricio Rey, general manager of local partner Desarrollo Pa\u00eds, a state-owned infrastructure company, estimated the cable project\u2019s value at $300 million to $550 million, with Chile contributing $25 million.",
      "The Humboldt Cable will establish Chile as a data gateway for the Asia-Pacific, while strengthening its relations with Asian nations, especially China, its largest trading partner. It also comes as demand for undersea cables surges due to increased reliance on cloud computing services.",
      "The next stages involve installing the submarine cable, selecting and contracting a telecommunications operator, and constructing landing stations in Chile.",
      "The initiative could heighten tensions as Chile finds itself caught in the middle of an intensifying rivalry between China and the Trump administration. Undersea cables have long been flash points in geopolitical disputes.",

      "The moon landing attempt by Tokyo-based company ispace on Friday Japan time is the latest entry in the rapidly expanding commercial lunar rush.",
      "The encore comes two years after the company\u2019s first moonshot ended in a crash landing, giving rise to the name Resilience for its successor lander. Resilience holds a rover with a shovel to gather lunar dirt as well as a Swedish artist\u2019s toy-size red house that will be lowered onto the moon\u2019s dusty surface.",
      "Long the province of governments, the moon became a target of private outfits in 2019, with more flops than wins along the way.",
      "Launched in January from Florida on a long, roundabout journey, Resilience entered lunar orbit last month. It shared a SpaceX ride with Firefly Aerospace\u2019s Blue Ghost, which reached the moon faster and became the first private entity to successfully land there in March.",
      "Another U.S. company, Intuitive Machines, arrived at the moon a few days after Firefly. But the tall, spindly lander face-planted in a crater near the moon\u2019s south pole and was declared dead within hours.",
      "Resilience is targeting the top of the moon, a less forbidding place than the shadowy bottom. The ispace team chose a flat area with few boulders in Mare Frigoris or Sea of Cold, a long and narrow region full of craters and ancient lava flows that stretches across the near side\u2019s northern tier.",
      "Once settled with power and communication flowing, the 7.5-foot (2.3-meter) Resilience will lower the piggybacking rover onto the lunar surface.",
      "Made of carbon fiber-reinforced plastic with four wheels, ispace\u2019s European-built rover \u2014 named Tenacious \u2014 sports a high-definition camera to scout out the area and a shovel to scoop up some lunar dirt for NASA.",
      "The rover, weighing just 11 pounds (5 kilograms), will stick close to the lander, going in circles at a speed of less than one inch (a couple centimeters) per second.",
      "Besides science and tech experiments, there\u2019s an artistic touch.",
      "The rover holds a tiny, Swedish-style red cottage with white trim and a green door, dubbed the Moonhouse by creator Mikael Genberg, for placement on the lunar surface.",
      "Takeshi Hakamada, CEO and founder of ispace, considers the latest moonshot \u201cmerely a steppingstone,\u201d with its next, much bigger lander launching by 2027 with NASA involvement, and even more to follow.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019re not trying to corner the market. We\u2019re trying to build the market,\u201d Jeremy Fix, chief engineer for ispace's U.S. subsidiary, said at a conference last month. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge market, a huge potential.\"",
      "Fix noted that ispace, like other businesses, does not have \u201cinfinite funds\u201d and cannot afford repeated failures. While not divulging the cost of the current mission, company officials said it\u2019s less than the first one which exceeded $100 million.",
      "Two other U.S. companies are aiming for moon landings by year\u2019s end: Jeff Bezos\u2019 Blue Origin and Astrobotic Technology. Astrobotic\u2019s first lunar lander missed the moon altogether in 2024 and came crashing back through Earth\u2019s atmosphere.",
      "For decades, governments competed to get to the moon. Only five countries have pulled off successful robotic lunar landings: Russia, the U.S., China, India and Japan. Of those, only the U.S. has landed people on the moon: 12 NASA astronauts from 1969 through 1972.",
      "NASA expects to send four astronauts around the moon next year. That would be followed a year or more later by the first lunar landing by a crew in more than a half-century, with SpaceX's Starship providing the lift from lunar orbit all the way down to the surface. China also has moon landing plans for its own astronauts by 2030.",

      "Social media platform Reddit has sued the artificial intelligence company Anthropic, alleging that it is illegally \"scraping\" the comments of Reddit users to train its chatbot Claude.",
      "Reddit claims that Anthropic has used automated bots to access Reddit's content despite being asked not to do so, and \u201cintentionally trained on the personal data of Reddit users without ever requesting their consent.\u201d",
      "Anthropic didn\u2019t immediately return a request for comment Wednesday. Reddit filed the lawsuit Wednesday in California Superior Court in San Francisco, where both companies are based.",
      "\u201cAI companies should not be allowed to scrape information and content from people without clear limitations on how they can use that data,\u201d said Ben Lee, Reddit's chief legal officer, in a statement Wednesday.",
      "Reddit has previously entered licensing agreements with Google, OpenAI and other companies to enable them to train their AI systems on Reddit commentary.",
      "Those agreements \u201cenable us to enforce meaningful protections for our users, including the right to delete your content, user privacy protections, and preventing users from being spammed using this content,\u201d Lee said.",
      "Anthropic was formed by former OpenAI executives in 2021 and its flagship Claude chatbot remains a key competitor to OpenAI's ChatGPT. Much like other AI companies, it's relied heavily on websites such as Wikipedia and Reddit that are full of rich sources of written materials to teach an AI assistant the patterns of human language",
      "In a 2021 paper co-authored by Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei \u2014 cited in the lawsuit \u2014 researchers at the company identified the subreddits, or subject-matter forums, that contained the highest quality data, such as those focused on gardening, history or thoughts people have in the shower.",
      "Anthropic in 2023 argued in a letter to the U.S. Copyright Office that the \"way Claude was trained qualifies as a quintessentially lawful use of materials,\u201d by making copies of information to perform a statistical analysis of a large body of data.",
      "But Reddit's lawsuit is different from others brought against AI companies because it doesn\u2019t allege copyright infringement. Instead, it focuses on the alleged breach of Reddit's terms of use, and the unfair competition, it says, was created.",

      "Federal prosecutors have charged two Chinese researchers with smuggling a crop-killing fungus into the U.S. last summer",
      "NEW YORK -- Federal prosecutors charged two Chinese researchers on Tuesday with smuggling a crop-killing fungus into the U.S. last summer \u2014 charges that come amid heightened political tensions between the two countries and as the Trump administration moves to revoke visas from visiting Chinese students.",
      "Yunqing Jian and Zunyong Liu are charged with conspiracy, smuggling, making false statements and visa fraud for allegedly bringing the fungus Fusarium graminearum into the U.S. Jian, 33, was booked in a Detroit federal court. Liu, 34, is thought to be in China.",
      "According to the FBI, Liu had small baggies of the fungus stashed in his backpack when he flew to the U.S. last year and, after claiming ignorance about the plant material inside them, said he was planning to use it for research at a University of Michigan lab where Jian worked and where Liu previously worked.",
      "Fusarium graminearum causes a disease called Fusarium head blight that can wipe out cereal crops such as wheat, barley and maize and rice \u2014 it inflicts $1 billion in losses annually on U.S. wheat and barley crops, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.",
      "It isn\u2019t the only fungus to cause Fusarium head blight, but it\u2019s the most common culprit in the U.S. The fungus infects plants early in the growing season, shriveling wheat grains and blanching crop heads a whitish-tan color. It also causes a toxin to accumulate in wheat kernels that can make them unsafe for people and livestock to eat.",
      "Nicknamed \u201cvomitoxin\u201d because it\u2019s most known for causing livestock to throw up, it can also cause diarrhea, abdominal pain, headache and fever in animals and people.",
      "Wheat and other grain crops are screened for various toxins, including Fusarium graminearum, before they can be used to feed animals and humans. Farmers have to throw out any infected grains, which can cause devastating losses.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s one of the many problems that farmers have to deal with that risks their livelihood,\u201d said David Geiser, a Fusarium expert at Penn State.",
      "Although Jian and Liu are accused of smuggling Fusarium graminearum into the country, the fungus is already prevalent in the U.S. \u2014 particularly in the east and Upper Midwest \u2014 and scientists have been studying it for decades.",
      "Researchers often bring foreign plants, animals and even strains of fungi to the U.S. to study them, but they must file certain permits before moving anything across state or national borders. Studying the genes of a foreign fungus strain, for example, can help scientists learn how it tolerates heat, resists pesticides or mutates.",
      "\u201cWe look at variations among individuals just like we do humans,\u201d said Nicole Gauthier, a plant pathologist at the University of Kentucky who studies Fusarium.",
      "That said, it\u2019s unclear why the Chinese researchers might have wanted to bring that strain of Fusarium graminearum into the U.S. and why they didn\u2019t fill out the proper paperwork to do so.",

      "When the threat of wildfires has forced power to be cut in the tourist town of Calistoga, California, on the edge of Napa Valley, it\u2019s meant firing up a bank of noisy, polluting diesel generators",
      "CALISTOGA, Calif. -- For residents of this quaint tourist town on the northern edge of Napa Valley, the threat of wildfire is seldom out of mind. The hillside bears burn scars from a 2020 fire that forced all of Calistoga to evacuate, and the 2017 Tubbs fire that killed 22 people in wine country started just a few miles from downtown.",
      "When fire danger required shutting off transmission lines that might spark a blaze, the town relied on a bank of generators in a popular recreation area that belched choking diesel exhaust and rumbled so loudly it drove people away.",
      "But now Calistoga is shifting to a first-of-its-kind system that combines two clean-energy technologies \u2014 hydrogen fuel cells and batteries \u2014 for enough juice to power the city for about two days. Experts say the technology has potential beyond simply delivering clean backup power in emergencies; they say it's a steppingstone to supporting the electric grid any day of the year.",
      "As the system was undergoing its final tests in late May in an area that includes a dog park, ball fields, community garden and bike trail, residents said they were grateful to be guaranteed clean energy year-round. Lisa Gift, a resident who also serves on the city council, noted Calistoga is already grappling with climate change that is fueling more intense and frequent wildfires.",
      "\u201cContinuing to depend on fossil fuels was simply not sustainable,\u201d Gift said. \"That's what excited me about this. It\u2019s a clean and reliable energy solution that ensures the safety and resilience of our community.\u201d",
      "Energy Vault, an energy storage company based in California, built the new facility that was to come online in early June. Next year, it could be exporting power to the electric grid whenever needed once its application to fully connect is approved.",
      "The installation sits next to where Pacific Gas & Electric used to set up nine mobile generators every year from late spring through fall. Behind a chain-link fence stand six hydrogen fuel cells standing two stories tall made by Plug Power in New York. Water vapor wafted from one of the fuel cells being tested as The Associated Press got an exclusive tour of the site as it was in final testing.",
      "Shipping containers hold two pairs of Energy Vault's lithium-ion batteries. Nearby, a cinder block wall surrounds a massive, double-walled steel tank that holds 80,000 gallons (302,833 liters) of extremely cold liquid hydrogen that gets converted to gas to run the fuel cells.",
      "California utilities, especially PG&E, have had to pay large settlements over igniting wildfires. PG&E began cutting power at times to reduce fire risk in 2018, one of California's deadliest and most destructive wildfire years. It ships diesel generators to about a dozen towns to provide backup power during those periods.",
      "Calistoga, the largest with about 5,000 people, has had its power shut off 10 times. When generators ran, they spewed exhaust with harmful nitrogen oxides, carbon dioxide and soot. PG&E considered replacing Calistoga's diesel generators with a natural gas version that would pollute less, but opted instead for Energy Vault's fully clean solution, said Dave Canny, the utility\u2019s vice president for the North Coast Region.",
      "Energy Vault CEO Robert Piconi said other communities, military bases and data centers could all use something similar, but potential customers wanted to see it function first.",
      "\u201cThere\u2019s a massive proof point with this project,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019ll have a lot of implications for how people think about alternative, sustainable solutions.\"",
      "The fuel cell maker, Plug Power, is planning for these types of products to be its main business in a decade. Energy Vault said it\u2019s buying clean hydrogen, produced with low or no greenhouse gas emissions, to run the fuel cells in Calistoga.",
      "\u201cThis solution is just beautiful,\" said Janice Lin, founder and president of the Green Hydrogen Coalition, a nonprofit that advocates for green hydrogen projects to combat climate change. \"No noise, no emissions. And it\u2019s renewable. It\u2019s dumping diesel.\u201d",
      "Calistoga caters to tourists with a main thoroughfare that emphasizes local shops, restaurants, tasting rooms and art galleries over franchise stories. Residents pride themselves on a smalltown vibe, and say Calistoga isn't posh like much of the rest of Napa Valley.",
      "Some of those residents were concerned at first about the hydrogen, which is flammable and can be explosive. Fire Chief Jed Matcham said the \u201cvery, very large tank\u201d got his attention, too.",
      "He collaborated with Energy Vault on emergency planning and training, and said he's comfortable with the safety measures in place. Energy Vault's batteries also come with alarms, detectors and piping to extinguish a fire.",
      "The next time PG&E turns off the power to the area to prevent wildfires, it will tell Energy Vault when it\u2019s safe to electrify Calistoga. The batteries will get things back up and running, discharging the energy stored inside them to the local microgrid.",
      "Then the hydrogen fuel cells will take over to generate a steady level of power for a longer period. By working in tandem \u2014 the company likened it to the way a hybrid vehicle works \u2014 the batteries and fuel cells are expected to keep the lights on for about 48 hours or longer.",
      "Clive Richardson, who owns downtown's Calistoga Roastery and can typically be found behind the counter, drinking coffee and chatting with customers, said people in Calistoga get on edge when the winds kick up. And he knows what it's like to have to empty out his store when power goes out \u2014 a big hit for a small-business owner.",
      "A year-round clean solution for emergency power gives him a measure of comfort.",
      "\u201cThis will give us far more security than we had before,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s fantastic that it\u2019s come. Here we are, little ol\u2019 Calistoga, and we\u2019ve got the first-of-a-kind system that hopefully will be endorsed and go all over the world.\u201d",

      "A federal judge has barred state officials from enforcing a Florida law that would ban social media accounts for young children, while a legal challenge against the law plays out",
      "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- A federal judge has barred state officials from enforcing a Florida law that would ban social media accounts for young children, while a legal challenge against the law plays out. U.S. District Judge Mark Walker issued the order Tuesday, blocking portions of the law from taking effect.",
      "The measure was one of the most restrictive bans in the U.S. on social media use by children when Gov. Ron DeSantis signed it into law in 2024. The law would ban social media accounts for children under 14 and require parental permission for their use by 14- and 15-year-olds.",
      "In his order granting the preliminary injunction sought by the groups Computer & Communications Industry Association and NetChoice, Walker wrote that the law is \u201clikely unconstitutional,\u201d but acknowledged that parents and lawmakers have \u201csincere concerns\u201d about social media's effects on kids.",
      "Walker wrote that the prohibition on social media platforms from allowing certain age groups to have accounts \u201cdirectly burdens those youths\u2019 rights to engage in and access speech.\u201d",
      "Also Tuesday, a federal judge in Atlanta heard arguments from NetChoice seeking to block a 2024 Georgia law scheduled to take effect July 1 that would require age verification for social media accounts and require children younger than 16 to get parental permission for accounts. Like in Florida and other states where laws have been blocked, the internet trade group NetChoice argues that the Georgia law infringes on free speech rights, is vague, and overly burdensome.",
      "While siding with the industry groups' claims that the law limits free speech, Walker allowed a provision of the Florida law to go into effect requiring platforms to shut down accounts for children under 16, if their parent or guardian requests it.",
      "Parents \u2014 and even some teens themselves \u2014 are growing increasingly concerned about the effects of social media use on young people. Supporters of the laws have said they are needed to help curb the explosive use of social media among young people, and what researchers say is an associated increase in depression and anxiety.",
      "Matt Schruers, the president and CEO of the industry association CCIA, praised the judge's order blocking the Florida law.",
      "\u201cThis ruling vindicates our argument that Florida\u2019s statute violates the First Amendment by blocking and restricting minors \u2014 and likely adults as well \u2014 from using certain websites to view lawful content,\" he said in a statement. \"We look forward to seeing this statute permanently blocked as a violation of Floridians\u2019 constitutional right to engage in lawful speech online.\"",
      "A spokesperson for Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier defended the law and the state's efforts to insulate kids from social media at a time when platforms like TikTok, Instagram and Snapchat seem almost impossible to escape.",
      "\u201cFlorida parents voted through their elected representatives for a law protecting kids from the harmful and sometimes lifelong tragic impacts of social media. These platforms do not have a constitutional right to addict kids to their products,\u201d Uthmeier's press secretary Jae Williams said in a statement. \u201cWe disagree with the court\u2019s order and will immediately seek relief in the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals.\u201d",
      "In Atlanta, NetChoice attorney Jeremy Maltz told U.S. District Judge Amy Totenberg that Georgia's law would impermissibly restrict speech by minors, saying that \u201cbefore you share your art, before you share your political information, you need to produce your papers, please.\u201d",
      "Totenberg did not rule Tuesday. But citing rulings against similar laws in other states, she expressed skepticism about Georgia's case, asking Deputy Attorney General Logan Winkles: \u201cWhat makes today different from all other days?\"",
      "Winkles argued the law's requirement of \u201ccommercially reasonable\u201d attempts to verify age could be quite cheap and likened it to banning minors from bars serving alcohol, not restricting their speech.",
      "\u201cThere are things about social media that make it dangerous,\u201d Winkles said. \u201cIt's a place where children are being restricted. It's not about speech.\u201d",

      "Constellation, the owner of the shuttered Three Mile Island nuclear power plant, said in September that it planned to restart the reactor so tech giant Microsoft could secure power to supply its data centers.

      "NEW YORK -- Scientists have unlocked one of the solar system's many secrets from an unexpected source: a planetarium show opening to the public on Monday.",
      "At the American Museum of Natural History last fall, experts were hard at work preparing \u201cEncounters in the Milky Way,\" a deep dive into our home galaxy shaped by the movements of stars and other celestial objects.",
      "They were fine-tuning a scene featuring what's known as the Oort Cloud, a region far beyond Pluto filled with icy relics from the solar system's formation. Comets can hurtle toward Earth from the cloud, but scientists have never glimpsed its true shape.",
      "One evening while watching the Oort Cloud scene, scientists noticed something strange projected onto the planetarium's dome.",
      "\u201cWhy is there a spiral there?\u201d said the museum's Jackie Faherty.",
      "The inner section of the Oort Cloud, made of billions of comets, resembled a bar with two waving arms, similar to the shape of our Milky Way galaxy.",
      "Scientists had long thought the Oort Cloud was shaped like a sphere or flattened shell, warped by the push and pull of other planets and the Milky Way itself. The planetarium show hinted that a more complex shape could lie inside.",
      "The museum contacted the researcher who provided the Oort Cloud data for the show, who was also surprised to see the spiral.",
      "\u201cIt's kind of a freak accident that it actually happened,\u201d said David Nesvorny with the Southwest Research Institute.",
      "Realizing they'd stumbled on something new, the researchers published their findings earlier this year in The Astrophysical Journal.",
      "The spiral is \"a striking shift in our understanding of the outer solar system,\u201d planetary scientist Andre Izidoro with Rice University, who was not involved with the study, said in an email.",
      "The discovery, relying on data on how celestial objects move and using simulations, will be difficult to confirm with observations. But knowing more about the orbits of distant comets could give scientists some clues, Izidoro said.",
      "While putting together the planetarium show, the museum's experts weren't expecting a window into the universe's inner workings.

      "Space weather forecasters say northern lights may be visible in parts of the northern United States following weekend solar storms",
      "NEW YORK -- NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Northern lights may be visible in parts of the U.S. Monday night following weekend solar storms.",
      "The sun burped out a huge burst of energy called a coronal mass ejection last week, prompting space weather forecasters to issue a rare, severe solar storm alert on Sunday, though it wasn't as strong as last year's record. Another one headed toward Earth on Monday could produce more aurora sightings.",
      "Authorities are monitoring for possible disruptions, though the worst is already over. The weekend\u2019s storms may have caused brief disruptions to high-frequency radio, said Erica Grow Cei, a spokesperson with National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.",
      "Auroras could be visible \u2014 especially in darker, rural areas \u2014 in Alaska, Washington, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Michigan, Wisconsin, Maine and northern parts of Idaho, Wyoming, Iowa, New York, Vermont and New Hampshire.",
      "Here\u2019s what to know about auroras and how to spot them.",
      "The sun is at the maximum phase of its 11-year activity cycle, making the light displays more common and widespread. Colorful northern lights have decorated night skies in unexpected places and space weather experts say there are more auroras still to come.",
      "Last spring, the strongest geomagnetic storm in two decades slammed Earth, producing light displays across the Northern Hemisphere. And last fall, a powerful solar storm dazzled skygazers far from the Arctic Circle when dancing lights appeared in unexpected places including Germany, the United Kingdom, New England and New York City.",
      "Aurora displays known as the northern and southern lights are commonly visible near the poles, where charged particles from the sun interact with Earth's atmosphere.",
      "Skygazers are spotting the lights deeper into the United States and Europe because the sun is going through a major facelift. Every 11 years, its poles swap places, causing magnetic twists and tangles along the way.",
      "Severe storms are capable of scrambling radio and GPS communications.",
      "The sun\u2019s active spurt is expected to last at least through the end of this year, though when solar activity will peak won\u2019t be known until months after the fact, according to NASA and NOAA.",
      "Solar storms can bring more than colorful lights to Earth.",
      "When fast-moving particles and plasma slam into Earth\u2019s magnetic field, they can temporarily disrupt the power grid. Space weather can also interfere with air traffic control radio and satellites in orbit.",
      "In 1859, a severe solar storm triggered auroras as far south as Hawaii and caught telegraph lines on fire in a rare event. And a 1972 solar storm may have detonated magnetic U.S. sea mines off the coast of Vietnam.",
      "Space weather experts aren\u2019t able to predict a solar storm months in advance. Instead, they alert relevant parties to prepare in the days before a solar outburst hits Earth.",
      "Northern lights forecasts can be found on NOAA\u2019s Space Weather Prediction Center website or an aurora forecasting app.",
      "Consider aurora-watching in a quiet, dark area away from city lights. Experts recommend skygazing from a local or national park. And check the weather forecast because clouds can cover up the spectacle entirely.",
      "Taking a picture with a smartphone camera may also reveal hints of the aurora that aren\u2019t visible to the naked eye.",

      "It turns out that looming collision between our Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies might not happen after all",
      "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. -- It turns out that looming collision between our Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies might not happen after all.",
      "Astronomers reported Monday that the probability of the two spiral galaxies colliding is less than previously thought, with a 50-50 chance within the next 10 billion years. That\u2019s essentially a coin flip, but still better odds than previous estimates and farther out in time.",
      "\u201cAs it stands, proclamations of the impending demise of our galaxy seem greatly exaggerated,\u201d the Finnish-led team wrote in a study appearing in Nature Astronomy.",
      "While good news for the Milky Way galaxy, the latest forecast may be moot for humanity.",
      "\u201cWe likely won\u2019t live to see the benefit,\" lead author Till Sawala of the University of Helsinki said in an email.",
      "Already more than 4.5 billion years old, the sun is on course to run out of energy and die in another 5 billion years or so, but not before becoming so big it will engulf Mercury, Venus and possibly Earth. Even if it doesn\u2019t swallow Earth, the home planet will be left a burnt ball, its oceans long since boiled away.",
      "Sawala\u2019s international team relied on the latest observations by NASA\u2019s Hubble Space Telescope and the European Space Agency\u2019s Gaia star-surveying spacecraft to simulate the possible scenarios facing the Milky Way and next-door neighbor Andromeda. Both already collided with other galaxies in their ancient past and, according to many, seemed destined for a head-on crash.",
      "Past theories put a collision between the two \u2014 resulting in a new elliptical galaxy dubbed Milkomeda \u2014 as probable if not inevitable. Some predictions had that happening within 5 billion years, if not sooner.",
      "For this new study, the scientists relied on updated galaxy measurements to factor in the gravitational pull on the Milky Way's movement through the universe. They found that the effects of the neighboring Triangulum galaxy increased the likelihood of a merger between the Milky Way and Andromeda, while the Large Magellanic Cloud decreased those chances.",
      "Despite lingering uncertainty over the position, motion and mass of all these galaxies, the scientists ended up with 50-50 odds of a collision within the next 10 billion years.",
      "\u201cThe fate of our Milky Way galaxy is a subject of broad interest \u2014 not just to astronomers,\u201d said Raja GuhaThakurta of the University of California, Santa Cruz, who was not involved in the study,",
      "A full-on collision, he noted, would transform our home galaxy from a disk of stars seen as a milky band of diffuse light across the sky into a milky blob. A harmless flyby of the two galaxies could leave this stellar disk largely undisturbed, thus preserving our galaxy's name.",
      "More work is needed before the Milky Way\u2019s fate can be predicted with accuracy, according to the researchers. Further insight should help scientists better understand what's happening among galaxies even deeper in the cosmos.",
      "While our galaxy\u2019s fate remains highly uncertain, the sun\u2019s future is \u201cpretty much sealed,\" according to Sawala. \u201cOf course, there is also a very significant chance that humanity will bring an end to itself still much before that, without any need for astrophysical help.\"",

      "\u201cWe ironically know these 19 because of the horrific thing that happened to them after their death, the desecration of their bodies,\u201d said Monique Guillory, president of Dillard University, a historically Black private liberal arts college, which spearheaded the receipt of the remains on behalf of the city. \u201cThis is actually an opportunity for us to recognize and commemorate the humanity of all of these individuals who would have been denied, you know, such a respectful send-off and final burial.\u201d",
      "The 19 people are all believed to have passed away from natural causes between 1871 and 1872 at Charity Hospital, which served people of all races and classes in New Orleans during the height of white supremacist oppression in the 1800s. The hospital shuttered following Hurricane Katrina in 2005.",

      "Scientists say 4 billion people, about half the world\u2019s population, experienced at least one extra month of extreme heat because of human-caused climate change from May 2024 to May 2025.",
      "The extreme heat caused illness, death, crop losses, and strained energy and health care systems, according to the analysis from World Weather Attribution, Climate Central and the Red Cross.",
      "\u201cAlthough floods and cyclones often dominate headlines, heat is arguably the deadliest extreme event,\u201d the report said. Many heat-related deaths are unreported or are mislabeled by other conditions like heart disease or kidney failure.",
      "The scientists used peer-reviewed methods to study how much climate change boosted temperatures in an extreme heat event and calculated how much more likely its occurrence was because of climate change. In almost all countries in the world, the number of extreme heat days has at least doubled compared with a world without climate change.",
      "Caribbean islands were among the hardest hit by additional extreme heat days. Puerto Rico, a territory of the United States, endured 161 days of extreme heat. Without climate change, only 48 would have occurred.",
      "\u201cIt makes it feel impossible to be outside,\u201d said Charlotte Gossett Navarro, chief director for Puerto Rico at Hispanic Federation, a nonprofit focused on social and environmental issues in Latino communities, who lives in the San Juan area and was not involved in the report.",
      "\u201cEven something as simple as trying to have a day outdoors with family, we weren\u2019t able to do it because the heat was too high,\" she said, reporting feeling dizzy and sick last summer.",
      "When the power goes out, which happens frequently in Puerto Rico in part because of decades of neglected grid maintenance and damage from Hurricane Maria in 2017, Navarro said it is difficult to sleep. \u201cIf you are someone relatively healthy, that is uncomfortable, it\u2019s hard to sleep ... but if you are someone who has a health condition, now your life is at risk,\u201d Gossett Navarro said.",
      "Heat waves are silent killers, said Friederike Otto, associate professor of climate science at Imperial College London, one of the report\u2019s authors. \u201cPeople don\u2019t fall dead on the street in a heat wave ... people either die in hospitals or in poorly insulated homes and therefore are just not seen,\u201d he said.",
      "Low-income communities and vulnerable populations, such as older adults and people with medical conditions, suffer the most from extreme heat.",
      "The high temperatures recorded in the extreme heat events that occurred in Central Asia in March, South Sudan in February and in the Mediterranean last July would have not been possible without climate change, according to the report. At least 21 people died in Morocco after temperatures hit 118 degrees Fahrenheit (48 degrees Celsius) last July. People are noticing temperatures are getting hotter but don't always know it is being driven by climate change, said Roop Singh, head of urban and attribution at the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Centre, in a World Weather Attribution statement.",
      "\u201cWe need to quickly scale our responses to heat through better early warning systems, heat action plans, and long-term planning for heat in urban areas to meet the rising challenge,\u201d Singh said.",
      "City-led initiatives to tackle extreme heat are becoming popular in parts of South Asia, North America, Europe and Australia to coordinate resources across governments and other agencies. One example is a tree-planting initiative launched in Marseille, France, to create more shaded areas.",
      "The report says strategies to prepare for heat waves include monitoring and reporting systems for extreme temperatures, providing emergency health services, cooling shelters, updated building codes, enforcing heat safety rules at work, and designing cities to be more heat-resilient.",
      "But without phasing out fossil fuels, heat waves will continue becoming more severe and frequent and protective measures against the heat will lose their effectiveness, the scientists said.",

      "The legal and technological threats facing Google are among the key issues that will be dissected during the closing arguments of a legal proceeding that will determine the changes imposed upon the company in the wake of its dominant search engine being declared as an illegal monopoly by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta last year.",
      "Brandishing evidence presented during a recent three-week stretch of hearings, Justice Department lawyers will attempt to persuade Mehta to order a radical shake-up that includes a ban on Google paying to lock its search engine in as the default on smart devices and an order requiring the company to sell its Chrome browser.",
      "Google lawyers are expected to assert only minor concessions are needed, especially as the upheaval triggered by advances in artificial intelligence already are reshaping the search landscape, as alternative, conversational search options are rolling out from AI startups that are hoping to use the Department of Justice's four-and-half-year-old case to gain the upper hand in the next technological frontier.",
      "\u201cOver weeks of testimony, we heard from a series of well-funded companies eager to gain access to Google\u2019s technology so they don\u2019t have to innovate themselves,\u201d Lee-Anne Mulholland, Google's vice president of regulatory affairs, wrote in a blog post earlier this month. \u201cWhat we didn\u2019t hear was how DOJ\u2019s extreme proposals would benefit consumers.\u201d",
      "After the day-long closing arguments, Mehta will spend much of the summer mulling a decision that he plans to issue before Labor Day. Google has already vowed to appeal the ruling that branded its search engine as a monopoly, a step it can't take until the judge orders a remedy.",
      "While both sides of this showdown agree that AI is an inflection point for the industry's future, they have disparate views on how the shift will affect Google.",
      "The Justice Department contends that AI technology by itself won't rein in Google's power, arguing additional legal restraints must be slapped on a search engine that's the main reason its parent company, Alphabet Inc., is valued at $2 trillion.",
      "Google has already been deploying AI to transform its search engine i nto an answer engine, an effort that has so far helped maintain its perch as the internet's main gateway despite inroads being made by alternatives from the likes of OpenAI and Perplexity.",
      "The Justice Department contends a divestiture of the Chrome browser that Google CEO Sundar Pichai helped build nearly 20 years ago would be among the most effective countermeasures against Google continuing to amass massive volumes of browser traffic and personal data that could be leveraged to retain its dominance in the AI era. Executives from both OpenAi and Perplexity testified last month that they would be eager bidders for the Chrome browser if Mehta orders its sale.",
      "The debate over Google's fate also has pulled in opinions from Apple, mobile app developers, legal scholars and startups.",
      "Apple, which collects more than $20 billion annually to make Google the default search engine on the iPhone and its other devices, filed briefs arguing against the Justice Department's proposed 10-year ban on such lucrative lock-in agreements. Apple told the judge that prohibiting the contracts would deprive the company of money that it funnels into its own research, and that the ban might even make Google even more powerful because the company would be able to hold onto its money while consumers would end up choosing its search engine anyway. The Cupertino, California, company also told the judge a ban wouldn't compel it to build its own search engine to compete against Google.",
      "In other filings, a group of legal scholars said the Justice Department's proposed divestiture of Chrome would be an improper penalty that would inject unwarranted government interference in a company's business. Meanwhile, former Federal Trade Commission officials James Cooper and Andrew Stivers warned that another proposal that would require Google to share its data with rival search engines \u201cdoes not account for the expectations users have developed over time regarding the privacy, security, and stewardship\u201d of their personal information.",
      "The App Association, a group that represents mostly small software developers, also advised Mehta not to adopt the Justice Department's proposed changes because of the ripple effects they would have across the tech industry.",
      "Hobbling Google in the way the Justice Department envisions would make it more difficult for startups to realize their goal of being acquired, the App Association wrote. \u201cDevelopers will be overcome by uncertainty\u201d if Google is torn apart, the group argues.",
      "Buy Y Combinator, an incubator that has helped create hundreds of startups collectively worth about $800 billion filed documents pushing for the dramatic overhaul of Google, whose immense power has discouraged venture capitalists from investing in areas that are considered to be part of the company's \u201ckill zone.\u201d",
      "Startups \u201calso need to be able to get their products into the hands of users, free from restrictive dealing and self-preferencing that locks up important distribution channels. As things stand, Google has locked up the most critical distribution channels, freezing the general search and search text advertising markets into static competition for more than a decade,\u201d Y Combinator told Mehta.",

      "President Donald Trump spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping on the phone Thursday amid a trade war between the two countries -- and during the call, Trump said Xi invited him to visit China.",
      "In a social media post, Trump said the leaders discussed \"some of the intricacies of our recently made, and agreed to, Trade Deal.\" Trump said the call lasted about one and a half hours, and the leaders exclusively talked trade.",
      "Trump added that it \"resulted in a very positive conclusion for both Countries.\" He said that U.S. and Chinese negotiating teams \"will be meeting shortly at a location to be determined.\"",
      "The president said that Xi invited him to visit China and Trump extended an invitation for Xi to visit the U.S.",
      "The call happened at Trump's request, Chinese State News Agency Xinhua had reported.",
      "Their conversation is a significant development amid a tense tariff standoff between the U.S. and China, the world's two largest economies.",
      "On Wednesday, Trump wrote on his conservative social media platform: \"I like President XI of China, always have, and always will, but he is VERY TOUGH, AND EXTREMELY HARD TO MAKE A DEAL WITH!!!\"",
      "This is the first confirmed time the leaders have spoken since Trump returned to the White House in January. Trump has alluded to a previous call with Xi, but he nor the White House have ever confirmed if that took place since he took office in January.",
      "Their conversation comes after Trump accused China of violating a deal negotiated by top officials in Geneva last month to roll back high tariff rates for 90 days. The agreement saw the U.S. drop the rate on Chinese goods coming to the U.S. from over 145% to 30%. China lowered its levy on U.S. goods from 125% to 10%.",
      "Trump, last Friday, said China had breached the temporary truce though didn't provide details.",
      "\"So much for being Mr. NICE GUY!\" he wrote on his conservative social media platform.",
      "Beijing pushed back on Monday, saying it \"firmly rejects unreasonable accusations\" and that it was the U.S. that \"unilaterally provoked new economic and trade frictions.\"",
      "White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett, during an appearance on ABC's \"This Week\" on Sunday, had said the expectation was for Trump and China's Xi to talk this week.",
      "Hassett said \"the two of them will talk about the Geneva agreement, which we're all very favorably inclined towards, thinking this is a huge step forward. But then what happened is that people had to -- in China -- had to give us licenses for things, and the licenses, we believe, have been slow rolled is something that the presidents want to talk about this week.\"",
      "Hassett also said that U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer's team and their counterparts in China are \"talking every day trying to move the ball forward on this matter.\"",
      "Greer said on CNBC last week that China was slow-walking approval of export licenses for rare earth materials, which was also a part of the Geneva agreement.",
      "Meanwhile, Chinese leaders said recently that they have their own concerns about U.S. restrictions on tech exports and the Trump administration's attempt to revoke Chinese student visas.",

      "The highly anticipated trial of hip-hop mogul Sean \"Diddy\" Combs is underway. Combs has been accused of sex trafficking by force, transportation to engage in prostitution, and racketeering conspiracy as part of a blockbuster federal indictment originally filed in September 2024. He later faced two additional superseding indictments. Combs has pleaded not guilty to all of the charges.",
      "Combs is accused of being the ringleader of an alleged enterprise that \"abused, threatened and coerced women\" into prolonged, drug-fueled sexual orgies with male prostitutes, which he called \"freak offs,\" and then threatened them into silence. Combs has said that all of the sex was consensual and that while his relationships sometimes involved domestic violence, he wasn't engaged in trafficking.",

      "According to prosecutors, \u201cJane\u201d initially agreed to one \"freak-off,\" thinking it would make Combs happy and help turn what began as a secret relationship with him into something more meaningful. Instead, she \u201cspent years in hotel rooms for forced sex,\u201d according to prosecutor Emily Johnson.",
      "\u201c'Jane' will tell you about those nights in detail, how she wanted the escorts to wear condoms but many times the defendant did not let them. And Jane will tell you how he had her take drugs to stay awake and aroused for days,\u201d Johnson previously told the court.",

      "Biden responded to Trump's memo to Bondi and the Department of Justice, calling an investigation \"nothing more than a mere distraction\" and defending his decision-making ability. In a statement he says any suggestion he was not in control is \"ridiculous and false.\"",
      "\"This is nothing more than a distraction by Donald Trump and Congressional Republicans who are working to push disastrous legislation that would cut essential programs like Medicaid and raise costs on American families, all to pay for tax breaks for the ultra-wealthy and big corporations,\" Biden said in a statement sent to ABC News.",
      "The president directed the U.S.'s top law enforcement official, in coordination with his White House counsel, to investigate \"the circumstances surrounding Biden's supposed execution of numerous executive actions during his final years in office,\" according to a statement  from the White House.",

      "The fresh data arrives days after a major swath of tariffs entered legal limbo.",
      "The U.S. trade deficit narrowed significantly in April as President Donald Trump sharply escalated tariffs before pausing a large swath of the levies, U.S. Commerce Department data on Thursday showed.",
      "Trump touted the tariffs as an effort to slash the nation's trade deficit, which the president has said he considers a threat to the nation's economic prosperity. Many economists disagree, however, saying the trade deficit reflects the consumer-driven engine of the U.S. economy.",
      "The trade gap fell by more than half in April as imports plunged, the data showed. The U.S. registered a trade deficit of about $61 billion in April, marking a sharp decline from a $140 billion trade gap a month earlier.",
      "Imports dropped by 16% in April as some trade barriers took effect, the data showed. Imports had ticked upward a month earlier as some firms rushed to stockpile supply before the levies saddled them with additional costs.",
      "The nation's trade gap stands well below the $131 billion deficit recorded in January, the month Trump took office.",
      "The outlook is murky for the Trump's tariff policy and the wider economy.",
      "Trump's on-again, off-again approach to tariffs leaves in doubt their ultimate level. A pair of court rulings last week thrust Trump's steepest tariffs into limbo, adding another layer of uncertainty as federal appeals court judges determine whether a significant number of the policies pass legal muster.",
      "The uncertain policy environment facing businesses has coincided with an anxious moment for consumers. Consumer attitudes have soured for four consecutive months as tariffs have taken hold, according to a survey conducted by the University of Michigan.",
      "Consumer spending, which accounts for about two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, could weaken if shopper appetites diminish and import prices rise.",
      "So far, key measures of the economy have largely defied fears of a downturn. The unemployment rate stands at a historically low level and job growth remains robust, though it has slowed from previous highs. In recent months, inflation has cooled, reaching its lowest level since 2021.",
      "The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, or OECD, forecast on Tuesday continued growth for the U.S. economy in 2025 and 2026, albeit at a slower pace than last year. Additionally, recession forecasts on Wall Street faded in recent weeks after Trump rolled back some tariffs.",

      "A former Republican congressman and vocal critic of Donald Trump says he wants to become governor in the president\u2019s adopted home state of Florida, and he\u2019s running as a Democrat",
      "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- A former Republican congressman and vocal critic of Donald Trump says he wants to become governor in the president\u2019s adopted home state of Florida, and that he\u2019s running as a Democrat.",
      "David Jolly formally announced his bid Thursday, becoming the latest party convert hoping to wrest back control of what had been the country\u2019s premier swing state that in recent years has made a hard shift to the right. Under state law, term-limited Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis can\u2019t run for reelection in 2026.",
      "Even as Florida serves as a place for the Trump administration to poach staff and test policies, Jolly says he\u2019s confident that issues such as affordability, funding public schools, and strengthening campaign finance and ethics laws will resonate with all voters in 2026. He predicts elections next year will herald nationwide change.",
      "\u201cI actually think Republicans in Tallahassee have gone too far in dividing us. I think we should get politicians out of the classrooms, out of the doctor\u2019s offices,\u201d Jolly said.",
      "\u201cI think enough people in Florida, even some Republicans, now understand that. That the culture wars have gone too far,\u201d he said.",
      "Jolly was first elected to his Tampa Bay-area congressional seat during a 2014 special election, and was reelected for one full term. The attorney and former lobbyist underwent a political evolution that spurred him to leave the Republican Party in 2018 to become an independent and then a registered Democrat. And he has built a national profile for himself as an anti-Trump political commentator on MSNBC.",
      "Jolly said he has considered himself \u201cpart of the Democratic coalition\u201d for five or so years, and believes in what he sees as the party\u2019s \u201cfundamental values\u201d \u2014 that government can help people, that the economy should be \u201cfair\u201d to all, and that immigrants should be celebrated.",
      "\u201cI struggled to exercise those values in the Republican Party,\u201d Jolly said, continuing: \u201cThe actual registration as a Democrat wasn\u2019t a pivot. It was a kind of a formality.\u201d",
      "Jolly has broken from his old party on immigration, as Florida lawmakers race to help Trump fulfill his promise of mass deportations. Jolly skewered Republicans who he said have \u201dconflated immigration and crime,\u201d which he described as wrong and immoral.",
      "\u201cIf you were born here or if you immigrated here, or if you\u2019re a Tallahassee politician who steals Medicaid money, we\u2019re going to be tough on crime,\u201d Jolly added, referring to a probe into the use of Medicaid settlement funds by a charity associated with first lady Casey DeSantis.",
      "Jolly\u2019s gubernatorial run as a Democrat draws comparisons to the failed bid of former Republican congressman-turned-independent-turned-Democrat Charlie Crist, who lost to DeSantis in 2022 by 19 points. It was Crist, running as a Democrat, who ousted Jolly from his congressional seat in 2016.",
      "Jolly joined the Florida Democratic Party at what is arguably one of its most vulnerable points in years. Florida currently has no Democrats elected to statewide office, and there are now 1.2 million more registered Republicans than Democrats, according to the state\u2019s active voter rolls. The GOP has made significant inroads in formerly Democratic strongholds in the state, such as Miami-Dade County.",
      "The day that Jolly announced his new affiliation, the-then top Democrat in the Florida Senate, Jason Pizzo, revealed he was leaving the party, declaring that \u201cthe Democratic Party in Florida is dead.\u201d Pizzo, a former prosecutor, has said he\u2019ll launch his own run for governor as a candidate with no party affiliation.",
      "On the Republican side, Jolly will face Trump-backed Rep. Byron Donalds, who is also a frequent presence on cable news as a surrogate for the president. Among the other names floated as potential GOP candidates are former Rep. Matt Gaetz and Casey DeSantis.",

      "Trump's post appeared to contradict the position staked out by his negotiators, and although Iran has not yet formally responded to the interim proposal, it remained unclear on Wednesday whether the U.S. would stand by all the terms in its initial offer.",

      "\"Inside, you\u2019ll find some of the outfits that have meant the most to me, but more importantly, the moments that I lived through in them -- big and small, personal and political, historic and ordinary -- that were as memorable as the clothes themselves,\" she wrote of the book, adding that readers will also get a look at the team behind her most famous looks, including her stylist Meredith Koop, her makeup artist Carl Ray and her hairstylists Njeri Radway and Yene Damtew.",

      "The mom of two daughters says in \"The Look,\" she hopes to \"reclaim\" the storylines around her fashion choices.",
      "\"During our family\u2019s time in the White House, the way I looked was constantly being dissected -- what I wore, how my hair was styled. For a while now, I\u2019ve been wanting to reclaim more of that story, to share it in my own way,\" Obama wrote on Instagram. \"I\u2019m thankful to be at a stage in life where I feel comfortable expressing myself freely -- wearing what I love and doing what feels true to me. And I\u2019m excited to share some of what I\u2019ve learned along the way.\"",
      "\"The Look\" will be released on Nov. 4, in hardcover and ebook formats. An audiobook edition, read by Michelle Obama, will also be available, according to the publisher.",

      "A Massachusetts high school student arrested on his way to volleyball practice is scheduled to appear before an immigration judge",
      "CHELMSFORD, Mass. -- A Massachusetts high school student arrested on his way to volleyball practice last weekend was scheduled to appear before an immigration judge Thursday.",
      "Marcelo Gomes da Silva, 18, who came to the U.S. from Brazil at age 7, was detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents Saturday. Authorities have said the agents were looking for the Milford High School teenager\u2019s father, who owns the car Gomes da Silva was driving at the time and had parked in a friend\u2019s driveway.",
      "The teen faced a hearing in immigration court in Chelmsford.",
      "U.S. Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said earlier this week that ICE officers were targeting a \u201cknown public safety threat\u201d and that Gomes da Silva\u2019s father \u201chas a habit of reckless driving at speeds in excess of 100 miles per hour through residential areas.\u201d",
      "\u201cWhile ICE officers never intended to apprehend Gomes da Silva, he was found to be in the United States illegally and subject to removal proceedings, so officers made the arrest,\u201d she said in a statement.",
      "Gomes da Silva initially entered the country on a visitor visa and was later issued a student visa that has since lapsed, said his attorney, Robin Nice. She described him as deeply rooted in his community and a dedicated member of both the school marching band and a band at his church.",
      "A federal judge considering Gomes da Silva\u2019s request to be released while his immigration case proceeds has given the government until June 16 to respond and has ordered that Gomes da Silva not be moved out of Massachusetts without 48 hours\u2019 notice given to the court. The government sought permission Wednesday to move Gomes da Silva to a detention facility in a different New England state, Nice said, a move his lawyers opposed because they feared it would delay the immigration hearing. A judge quickly denied the request.",
      "\u201cI love my son. We need Marcelo back home. It\u2019s no family without him,\u201d Jo\u00e3o Paulo Gomes Pereira said in a video released Wednesday by his son\u2019s attorney. \u201cWe love America. Please, bring my son back.\u201d",
      "Students at Milford High staged a walkout Monday to protest his detainment. Other supporters wore white and packed the stands of the high school gymnasium Tuesday night, when the volleyball team dedicated a match to their missing teammate.",

    "story": [
      "Elon Musk is leaving the Department of Government Efficiency behind, but its playbook has impacted dozens of agencies, departments and organizations and left thousands of federal workers unemployed or in limbo",
      "WASHINGTON -- The staff was already jittery.",
      "The raiders from Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency had disposed of the U.S. Institute of Peace board, its acting president and its longtime outside counsel. But until 9:30 p.m. on Friday, March 28, there was hope the damage might somehow be limited.",
      "Then termination notices started popping up in personal emails. That was only the start.",
      "After ending his sojourn in Washington, Musk left behind a wounded federal government. DOGE's playbook was consistent: Show up physically, take over the facility and information technology systems, fire the leadership and replace it with DOGE associates. Dismiss the staff. Move so quickly that the targets and the courts have little time to react, let alone reverse whatever damage has already occurred.",
      "Thousands of workers across the federal government saw the playbook in action over the last four months. But the Institute of Peace, a small, 300-employee organization, is unique: The blitz during its takeover has been, for the moment, reversed in court. The headquarters taken away in a weekend of lightning moves is back in the hands of its original board and acting president.",
      "The question they must answer now is a point that U.S. District Judge Beryl A. Howell made during one hearing: Even a win \u201cmakes no promises\u201d about how difficult or possible it will be to put the Institute of Peace back together. \u201cA bull in a China shop breaks a lot of things,\u201d the judge said.",
      "Nearly three weeks since the judge delivered a win, the institute is slowly trying to reboot. But there are barriers, and winning might not mean full restoration. For other agencies and departments fighting their own DOGE battles, it is a cautionary tale.",
      "The Institute of Peace was created by Congress in the 1980s. President Ronald Reagan signed the bill into law in 1985. Described as an independent, nonprofit think tank funded by Congress, its mission has been to work to promote peace and prevent and end conflicts while working outside normal channels such as the State Department. When DOGE came knocking, it was operating in 26 conflict zones, including Pakistan, Afghanistan, Mali and Burkina Faso.",
      "The institute was one of four organizations targeted by President Donald Trump\u2019s Feb. 19 Executive Order 14217. The order said it was being enacted to \u201cdramatically reduce the size of the federal government.\u201d",
      "The institute\u2019s acting president, career diplomat and former Ambassador George Moose, and longtime outside counsel George Foote tried to explain to DOGE representatives that the institute was an independent nonprofit outside the executive branch.",
      "That attempt was for naught. At 4 p.m. on March 14, most of the institute\u2019s board was fired by email. The lone holdovers were ex officio \u2014 Cabinet members Pete Hegseth and Marco Rubio and the National Defense University's president, Vice Adm. Peter Garvin. Within minutes of the emails, DOGE staff showed up and tried to get into the building but failed over the next several hours during a standoff.",
      "That, according to court documents, kicked off a weekend of pressure by the FBI on institute security personnel. DOGE returned the following Monday and got into the headquarters with help from the FBI and Washington police officers.",
      "Foote thought the local officers were there to expel the DOGE contingent but learned quickly they were not. He, security chief Colin O\u2019Brien and others were escorted out by local authorities. \u201cThey have sidearms and tasers and are saying you can't go anywhere but out that door,\u201d Foote said. \u201cI had no choice. 'You guys have the guns, and I don't.'\u201d",
      "The board filed a lawsuit the following day and asked for a temporary restraining order. Howell expressed dissatisfaction with DOGE's tactics but declined to restore the fired board members or bar DOGE staff from the headquarters.",
      "By then a DOGE associate, Kenneth Jackson, had been named as acting president of the organization by the ex officio board members. Employees held out hope that the organization would not be disassembled because Jackson was asking questions as if he might do an assessment of the organization's work, said Scott Worden, director of the Afghanistan and Central Asia programs.",
      "The staff knew what he'd done as the head of the U.S. Agency for International Development. Now Jackson was at the Institute of Peace, but they were hopeful \"we would have a process of explanation or review of our work,\u201d Worden said.",
      "Then came March 28. The notices came alphabetically. By the time it was finished, shortly before midnight, almost all the institute's 300 employees had been let go.",
      "The impact was \u201cprofound and devastating on a few levels,\u201d Worden said. First, employees at the institute are not government employees so they got no government benefits or civil service protections. Insurance also was gone \u2014 critical for employees fighting health problems. Partners abroad also suddenly lost their support and contacts. It left \u201cthousands of partners in a lurch,\u201d he said.",
      "The lawyers representing board members in their lawsuit asked for a court hearing as soon as possible to head off rumors of more mayhem to come. But when they walked into courtroom 26A of the E. Barrett Prettyman Courthouse at 10 a.m. on April 1, the headquarters and other assets were gone, too. It was, Howell said at the hearing, \u201ca done deal.\u201d",
      "Over the weekend, as workers reeled, DOGE was making personnel changes of its own. Jackson had given way to DOGE representative Nick Cavanaugh, whose name was on the documents that allowed DOGE to take control of Institute of Peace assets and transfer the headquarters \u2014 built in part with private donations \u2014 to the General Services Administration.",
      "Howell was incredulous that it had been accomplished in two days. In court, the Trump administration\u2019s attorney, Brian Hudak, laid out the timeline, making clear that the newly named president of the institute had not only been authorized to transfer the property but also the request had gone through proper channels. For the second time, Howell refused to stop the actions.",
      "Throughout hearings, Howell struggled with how to describe the institute \u2014 whether it was part of the executive branch and under the Republican president's authority. That was central to the case. The government argued that it had to fall under one of the three branches of government and it clearly wasn't legislative or judicial. Lawyers defending the government also said that because presidents appointed the board, presidents also had the authority to fire them.",
      "The White House also maintained that despite decades of operation and an annual budget of around $50 million, the institute had failed to bring peace and was rightfully targeted.",
      "Howell's May 19 opinion concluded that the institute \u201cultimately exercises no Executive branch power under the Constitution but operates, through research, educational teaching, and scholarship, in the sensitive area of global peace.\"",
      "\u201cIn creating this organization,\u201d the judge said, \"Congress struck a careful balance between political accountability, on the one hand, and partisan independence and stability, on the other.\u201d",
      "She added that even if the organization was part of the executive branch, the law that created it set specific steps for firing the board members and none of those had been followed. Because the board was fired illegally, all subsequent actions \u2014 including replacing Moose, firing the staff and transferring the headquarters \u2014 were \u201cnull and void,\u201d she said in her ruling.",
      "The government filed a notice of appeal and asked Howell to stay her order. She said no. The government has requested a stay with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.",
      "Two weeks later, about 10% of the people who would normally be inside the headquarters, about 25 people, are there, doing maintenance, getting systems running and trying to get to the institute\u2019s funding.",
      "Any physical damage comes more from inattentiveness than malice \u2014 food that spoiled, leaks that went unfixed, popup security barriers needing maintenance. Desks are empty but with paperwork and files strewn across them, left by the speed of the takeover.",
      "O\u2019Brien, the security officer, praised the General Services Administration and security managers who tried to keep the building going. But getting systems fully functioning will entail lots of work. \u201cWe\u2019re the first ones to get behind the looking glass,\u201d O\u2019Brien said.",
      "Foote said those returning continue to try to locate and access the institute's funding. That includes funds appropriated for this fiscal year by Congress and the part of the endowment moved during the takeover. He said transferring funds within the federal government is \u201ccomplicated.\u201d The result: Workers are furloughed, and overseas offices will remain closed.",
      "Nicoletta Barbera, acting director for the U.S. Institute of Peace's West Africa and Central Africa programs, is one of the furloughed workers.",
      "\u201cWe had USIP representatives based in Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger that, overnight, were left with no support system from anyone here in HQ,\u201d she said. The programs were focused on preventing terrorism by supporting women and young people, to \u201cidentify signs of radicalization.\u201d",
      "Barbera said a recent attack in Burkina Faso ended with \u201chundreds of atrocities and deaths.\u201d",
      "\"And I couldn\u2019t just stop but think, what if I could have continued our work there during this time?\u201d she said.",
      "Moose has said the speed at which the organization gets back to work depends on numerous factors, including the appeals process. But, he said, there will likely be lasting damage \u2014 \u201cthe traumatic effects this has had on the people who have been impacted by it.\u201d",
      "\u201cAnd, obviously, that includes our own ... staff members,\u201d Moose said, \"but it also extends to the people with whom we collaborate and work all around the world. That\u2019s going to be hard to repair.\u201d",

      "Governments of 12 countries whose citizens will be banned from visiting the United States starting next week are scrambling to understand President Donald Trump\u2019s latest move to resurrect a hallmark policy of his first term",
      "WASHINGTON -- Governments of 12 countries whose citizens will be banned from visiting the United States beginning next week scrambled on Thursday to understand President Donald Trump\u2019s latest move to resurrect a hallmark policy of his first term.",
      "The ban takes effect Monday at 12:01 a.m., a cushion that may avoid the chaos that unfolded at airports nationwide when a similar measure took effect with virtually no notice in 2017. Trump, who signaled plans for a new ban upon taking office again in January, appears to be on firmer ground this time after the Supreme Court sided with him.",
      "Some of the 12 countries also appeared on the list of banned countries in the Republican president\u2019s first term. The new ban targets Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, the Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen.",
      "There will also be heightened restrictions on visitors from seven other countries: Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela. But North Korea and Syria, which were on the banned list in the first Trump administration, were spared this time.",
      "Trump tied the new ban to Sunday\u2019s terror attack in Boulder, Colorado, saying it underscored the dangers posed by some visitors who overstay visas. The suspect in the attack is from Egypt, which is not on Trump\u2019s restricted list. The Department of Homeland Security says he overstayed a tourist visa.",
      "The travel ban results from a Jan. 20 executive order Trump issued requiring the departments of State and Homeland Security and the director of national intelligence to compile a report on \u201chostile attitudes\u201d toward the U.S. and whether entry from certain countries represented a national security risk.",
      "Trump said some countries had \u201cdeficient\u201d screening and vetting or have historically refused to take back their own citizens. His findings rely extensively on an annual Homeland Security report of visa overstays of tourists, business visitors and students who arrive by air and sea, singling out countries with high percentages of those remaining after their visas expired.",
      "Capturing overstay rates has riddled experts for decades, but the government has made a limited attempt every year since 2016. Trump\u2019s proclamation cites overstay rates for eight of the 12 banned countries and all seven restricted ones.",
      "While Trump\u2019s list captures many of the most egregious offenders, it omits others. Djibouti, for example, had a 23..9% overstay rate among business visitors and tourists in the 12-month period through September 2023, higher than seven countries on the banned list and six countries on the restricted list.",
      "The findings are \u201cbased on sketchy data and a misguided concept of collective punishment,\u201d said Doug Rand, a former Biden administration official at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.",
      "Venezuela\u2019s interior minister, Diosdado Cabello, said being in the United States is a \u201cgreat risk\u201d and called anyone who travels to the U.S. \u201ca fool.\u201d The decision is a significant blow to Venezuelans who were already limited in their U.S. travel plans since both governments broke diplomatic relations in 2019.",
      "\u201cIf you are a fool, then go to the United States,\u201d Cabello said.",
      "The African Union Commission, meanwhile, asked the Trump administration to reconsider, saying it was appealing to the United States to exercise its sovereign right to protect its borders and ensure the security of its citizens \u201cin a manner that is balanced, evidence-based, and reflective of the long-standing partnership between the United States and Africa.\u201d",
      "International aid groups and refugee resettlement organizations took a harsher tone: \u201cThis policy is not about national security \u2014 it is about sowing division and vilifying communities that are seeking safety and opportunity in the United States,\u201d said Abby Maxman, president of Oxfam America.",
      "A travel agent in the Somali capital, Mogadishu, said the policy threatens the travel and service industry.",
      "'The United States is home to the largest Somali diaspora in the world, and for years it has been one of our most active and reliable destinations,\" said Bashir Farah Ali, manager of Kofi Express Travel Services. \u201cEvery month I facilitated travel for at least 10 clients, mostly government officials attending conferences, diplomatic meetings, or U.N. events, as well as ordinary citizens traveling to reunite with their families after years of separation.\"",
      "News of the new Trump travel ban came as a shock to many in Iran despite the decades of enmity between the two countries. Reports suggest thousands of university students each year travel to America to study, and others have extended families living in America, some of whom fled after the initial 1979 Islamic Revolution that overthrew the shah.",
      "\u201cMy elder daughter got a bachelor\u2019s degree from a top Iranian university and planned to continue in the U.S., but now she is badly distressed,\u201d said Nasrin Lajvardi, a 56-year-old mother of two.",
      "While tensions also remain high as negotiations over Iran\u2019s nuclear program have yet to reach any agreement, Tehran resident Mehri Soltani offered rare support for Trump\u2019s decision.",
      "\u201cThose who have family members in the U.S, it\u2019s their right to go, but a bunch of bad people and terrorists and murderers want to go there as well,\u201d he said.",
      "Outside the former U.S. Embassy in Kabul, Afghanistan, a Taliban guard expressed his disappointment in Trump\u2019s decision.",
      "\u201cAmerica has no right to do this and implement this ban,\u201d Ilias Kakal said. \u201cAmerica has to cancel it.\u201d",

      "Since the Taliban took over the country in 2021, only Afghans with foreign passports or green cards were able to travel to the United States with any ease, they said, while even those applying for special visas due to their work with U.S. forces in Afghanistan in previous years were facing problems.",

      "Trump and others have defended the initial ban on national security grounds, arguing it was aimed at protecting the country and not founded on anti-Muslim bias. However, the president had called for an explicit ban on Muslims during his first campaign for the White House.",

      "Roughly 73 square miles of ancestral homelands once belonging to California\u2019s Yurok Tribe have been returned to them",
      "ON THE KLAMATH RIVER, Calif. -- As a youngster, Barry McCovey Jr. would sneak through metal gates and hide from security guards just to catch a steelhead trout in Blue Creek amid northwestern California redwoods.",
      "Since time immemorial, his ancestors from the Yurok Tribe had fished, hunted and gathered in this watershed flanked by coastal forests. But for more than 100 years, these lands were owned and managed by timber companies, severing the tribe's access to its homelands.",
      "When McCovey started working as a fisheries technician, the company would let him go there to do his job.",
      "\u201cSnorkeling Blue Creek ... I felt the significance of that place to myself and to our people, and I knew then that we had to do whatever we could to try and get that back,\u201d McCovey said.",
      "After a 23-year effort and $56 million, that became reality.",
      "Roughly 73 square miles (189 square kilometers) of homelands have been returned to the Yurok, more than doubling the tribe's land holdings, according to a deal announced Thursday. Completion of the land-back conservation deal along the lower Klamath River \u2014 a partnership with Western Rivers Conservancy and other environmental groups \u2014 is being called the largest in California history.",
      "The Yurok Tribe had 90% of its territory taken during the California Gold Rush in the mid-1800s, suffering massacres and disease from settlers.",
      "\u201cTo go from when I was a kid and 20 years ago even, from being afraid to go out there to having it be back in tribal hands \u2026 is incredible,\u201d said McCovey, director of the Yurok Tribal Fisheries Department.",
      "___",
      "EDITOR\u2019S NOTE: This is part of a series of on how tribes and Indigenous communities are coping with and combating climate change.",
      "___",
      "Land Back is a global movement seeking the return of homelands to Indigenous people through ownership or co-stewardship.",
      "In the last decade, nearly 4,700 square miles (12,173 square kilometers) were returned to tribes in 15 states through a federal program. Organizations are aiding similar efforts.",
      "There's mounting recognition that Indigenous people\u2019s traditional knowledge is critical to addressing climate change. Studies found the healthiest, most biodiverse and resilient forests are on protected native lands where Indigenous people remained stewards.",
      "Beth Rose Middleton Manning, a University of California, Davis professor of Native American Studies, said Indigenous people\u2019s perspective \u2014 living in relation with the lands, waterways and wildlife \u2014 is becoming widely recognized, and is a stark contrast to Western views.",
      "\u201cManagement of a forest to grow conifers for sale is very different from thinking about the ecosystem and the different plants and animals and people as part of it and how we all play a role,\" she said.",
      "The Yurok people will now manage these lands and waterways. The tribe's plans include reintroducing fire as a forest management tool, clearing lands for prairie restoration, removing invasive species and planting trees while providing work for some of the tribe's more than 5,000 members and helping restore salmon and wildlife.",
      "One fall morning in heavy fog, a motorboat roared down the turbid Klamath toward Blue Creek \u2014 the crown jewel of these lands \u2014 past towering redwoods, and cottonwoods, willows, alders. Suddenly, gray gave way to blue sky, where an osprey and bald eagle soared. Along a bank, a black bear scrambled over rocks.",
      "The place is home to imperiled marbled murrelets, northern spotted owls and Humboldt martens, as well as elk, deer and mountain lions.",
      "The Klamath River basin supports fish \u2014 steelhead, coho and Chinook salmon \u2014 that live in both fresh and saltwater. The Klamath was once the West Coast's third largest salmon-producing river and the life force of Indigenous people. But the state\u2019s salmon stock has plummeted so dramatically \u2014 in part from dams and diversions \u2014 that fishing was banned for the third consecutive year.",
      "\u201cWe can\u2019t have commercial fishing because populations are so low,\u201d said Tiana Williams-Claussen, director of the Yurok Tribe Wildlife Department. \u201cOur people would use the revenue to feed their families; now there\u2019s less than one salmon per Yurok Tribe member.\"",
      "Experts say restoring Blue Creek complements the successful, decades-long fight by tribes to remove the Klamath dams \u2014 the largest dam removal in U.S. history.",
      "This watershed is a cold-water lifeline in the lower Klamath for spawning salmon and steelhead that stop to cool down before swimming upstream. That's key amid climate-infused droughts and warming waters.",
      "\u201cFor the major river to have its most critical and cold-water tributary \u2026 just doing its job is critical to the entire ecosystem,\u201d said Sue Doroff, co-founder and former president of Western Rivers Conservancy.",
      "For more than 100 years, these lands were owned and managed for industrial timber.",
      "Patchworks of 15 to 20 acres (6 to 8 hectares) at a time of redwoods and Douglas firs have been clear cut to produce and sell logs domestically, according to Galen Schuler, a vice president at Green Diamond Resource Company, the previous landowner.",
      "Schuler said the forests have been sustainably managed, with no more than 2% cut annually, and that old growth is spared. He said they are \u201cmaybe on the third round\u201d of clear cutting since the 1850s.",
      "But clear cutting creates sediment that winds up in streams, making them shallower, more prone to warming and worsening water quality, according to Josh Kling, conservation director for the conservancy. Sediment, including from roads, can also smother salmon eggs and kill small fish.",
      "Culverts, common on Western logging roads, have also been an issue here. Most \"were undersized relative to what a fish needs for passage,\u201d Kling said.",
      "Land management decisions for commercial timber have also created some dense forests of small trees, making them wildfire prone and water thirsty, according to Williams-Claussen.",
      "\u201cI know a lot of people would look at the forested hillsides around here and be like, \u2018It\u2019s beautiful, it\u2019s forested.\u2019 But see that old growth on the hill, like way up there?\u201d asked Sarah Beesley, fisheries biologist for the Yurok Tribe, sitting on a rock in Blue Creek. \u201cThere\u2019s like one or two of those.\"",
      "Fire bans, invasive plants and encroachment of unmanaged native species have contributed to loss of prairies, historically home to abundant elk and deer herds and where the Yurok gathered plants for cultural and medicinal uses.",
      "Western Rivers Conservancy bought and conveyed land to the tribe in phases. The $56 million for the conservation deal came from private capital, low interest loans, tax credits, public grants and carbon credit sales that will continue to support restoration.",
      "The tribe aims to restore historic prairies by removing invasive species and encroaching native vegetation. The prairies are important food sources for elk and the mardon skipper butterfly, said Kling from the conservancy.",
      "Trees removed from prairies will be used as logjams for creeks to create habitat for frogs, fish and turtles.",
      "The tribe will reintroduce fire to aid in prairie restoration and reestablish forest diversity and mature forests to help imperiled species bounce back.",
      "Members know its going to take decades of work for these lands and waterways to heal.",
      "\u201cAnd maybe all that\u2019s not going to be done in my lifetime,\u201d said McCovey, the fisheries director. \u201cBut that\u2019s fine, because I\u2019m not doing doing this for myself.\u201d",

      "Hundreds of people have gathered at the local Jewish Community Center for a vigil to support the victims of the firebombing attack in Boulder",
      "BOULDER, Colo. -- Hundreds of people squeezed into the Jewish Community Center in Boulder, Colorado, for a vigil that featured prayer, singing and emotional testimony from a victim and witnesses of the firebombing attack in the city's downtown, while a federal judge has blocked the deportation of the suspect's family.",
      "Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, has been charged with a federal hate crime and state counts of attempted murder in Sunday\u2019s attack on a group demonstrating for the release of Israeli hostages in Gaza. He is being held in a county jail on a $10 million cash bond and is scheduled to make an appearance in state court on Thursday.",
      "Witnesses say Soliman threw two Molotov cocktails at the group and authorities say he confessed to the attack that injured 15 people.",
      "Rachelle Halpern, who has been walking with the group since 2023, said during Wednesday evening's vigil that she remembers thinking it was strange to see a man with a canister looking like he was going to spray pesticide on the grass. Then she heard a crash and screams and saw flames around her feet.",
      "\u201cA woman stood one foot behind me, engulfed in flames from head to toe, lying on the ground with her husband,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople immediately, three or four men immediately rushed to her to smother the flames.\u201d",
      "Her description prompted murmurs from the audience members. One woman\u2019s head dropped into her hands.",
      "\u201cI heard a loud noise, and the back of my legs burning, and don\u2019t remember those next few moments,\u201d said a victim, who didn\u2019t want to be identified and spoke off camera, over the event\u2019s speakers. \u201cEven as I was watching it unfold before my eyes, even then, it didn\u2019t seem real.\u201d",
      "U.S. District Judge Gordon P. Gallagher on Wednesday granted a request from his wife and five children, who like Soliman are Egyptian, to block their deportation after U.S. immigration officials took them into custody. They have not been charged.",
      "Federal authorities have said Soliman has been living in the U.S. illegally, and U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem said Wednesday that the family was being processed for removal. It\u2019s rare that a criminal suspect\u2019s family members are detained and threatened with deportation.",
      "\u201cIt is patently unlawful to punish individuals for the crimes of their relatives,\" attorneys for the family wrote in the lawsuit.",
      "Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin described the plaintiff\u2019s claims as \u201cabsurd\u201d and \u201can attempt to delay justice.\u201d She said the entire family was in the country illegally.",
      "Soliman\u2019s wife, Hayam El Gamal, a 17-year-old daughter, two minor sons and two minor daughters were being held at an immigration detention center in Texas, said Eric Lee, one of the attorney\u2019s representing the family.",
      "Soliman told authorities that no one, including his family, knew about his planned attack, according to court documents. El Gamal said she was \u201cshocked\u201d to learn her husband had been arrested in the attack, according to her lawsuit.",
      "On Wednesday, authorities raised the number of people injured in the attack to 15 from 12, plus a dog.",
      "Boulder County officials said in a news release that the victims include eight women and seven men ranging in age from 25 to 88. Details about how the victims were impacted would be explained in criminal charges set to be filed Thursday, according to Boulder County District Attorney's office spokesperson Shannon Carbone.",
      "Soliman had planned to kill all of the roughly 20 participants in Sunday\u2019s demonstration at the popular Pearl Street pedestrian mall, but he threw just two of his 18 Molotov cocktails while yelling \u201cFree Palestine,\u201d police said.",
      "According to an FBI affidavit, Soliman told police he was driven by a desire \u201cto kill all Zionist people\u201d \u2014 a reference to the movement to establish and protect a Jewish state in Israel. Authorities said he expressed no remorse about the attack.",
      "Before moving to Colorado Springs three years ago, Soliman spent 17 years in Kuwait, according to court documents.",
      "Soliman arrived in the U.S. in August 2022 on a tourist visa that expired in February 2023, McLaughlin said in a post on X. She said Soliman filed for asylum in September 2022 and was granted a work authorization in March 2023, but that has also expired.",
      "Hundreds of thousands of people overstay their visas each year in the United States, according to Department of Homeland Security reports.",
      "Soliman's wife is an Egyptian national, according to her lawsuit. She is a network engineer and has a pending EB-2 visa, which is available to professionals with advanced degrees, the suit said. She and her children all are listed as dependents on Soliman's asylum application.",
      "Soliman told authorities that he had been planning the attack for a year, the affidavit said.",
      "Soliman's attorney, Kathryn Herold, declined to comment after a state court hearing Monday. Public defenders\u2019 policy prohibits speaking to the media.",
      "The attack unfolded against the backdrop of the Israel-Hamas war, which has contributed to a spike in antisemitic violence in the United States. It happened at the beginning of the Jewish holiday of Shavuot and barely a week after a man who also yelled \u201cFree Palestine\u201d was charged with fatally shooting two Israeli Embassy staffers outside a Jewish museum in Washington.",

      "That\u2019s particularly true with the gradual change we have seen in how women dress, whether in ancient corridors of Tehran\u2019s Grand Bazaar or in the tony streets of northern Tehran. Women are forgoing the mandatory hijab, or headscarf, even as hard-liners try to pressure a renewed enforcement of the law against what they call the \"Western Cultural Invasion.\u201d",
      "The government of reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian has meanwhile been urging restraint by police and others over the hijab. There are enough problems right now in Iran is their thought, particularly as Iran\u2019s economy remains in dire straits.",
      "U.S. sanctions have decimated it. Iran\u2019s rial currency has plummeted in recent years. That economic hardship has made people more distrustful of the country\u2019s theocracy.",
      "And so people continue their daily lives in Tehran as they wait for any news after five rounds of talks so far between Iran and the U.S. You can see it in my photos. A carpet-seller waits to sell his wares in a darkened bazaar corner. Women without hijabs smoke shisha, or water-pipe tobacco. Another woman, wearing an all-black, all-encompassing chador, prays in a mosque\u2019s courtyard.",
      "It can all appear contradictory, but that\u2019s life here. Tehran, home to some 10 million people, is the ever-growing beating heart of Iran. And as it awaits the results of the negotiations, it can feel like it is skipping beats in anticipation.",

      "WASHINGTON -- Germany's new leader is meeting President Donald Trump in Washington on Thursday as he works to keep the U.S. on board with Western support for Ukraine, help defuse trade tensions that pose a risk to Europe's biggest economy and further bolster his country's long-criticized military spending.",
      "Trump and Chancellor Friedrich Merz have spoken several times by phone, either bilaterally or with other European leaders, since Merz took office on May 6. German officials say the two leaders have started to build a \u201cdecent\u201d relationship, with Merz wanting to avoid the antagonism that defined Trump's relationship with one of his predecessors, Angela Merkel, in Trump's first term.",
      "The 69-year-old Merz is a conservative former rival of Merkel's who took over her party after she retired from politics. Merz also comes to office with an extensive business background \u2014 something that could align him with Trump.",
      "A White House official said topics that Trump is likely to raise with Merz include Germany\u2019s defense spending, trade, Ukraine and what the official called \u201cdemocratic backsliding,\" saying the administration's view is that shared values such as freedom of speech have deteriorated in Germany and the country should reverse course. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to preview the discussions.",
      "Merz will want to avoid an Oval Office showdown of the kind that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa experienced in recent months. Asked about the risk of a White House blow-up, Merz spokesperson Stefan Kornelius said on Monday that the chancellor is \u201cwell-prepared\u201d for the meeting and that he and Trump have \u201cbuilt up a decent relationship, at least by phone\" and via text messaging.",
      "Merz has thrown himself into diplomacy on Ukraine, traveling to Kyiv with fellow European leaders days after taking office and receiving Zelenskyy in Berlin last week. He has thanked Trump for his support for an unconditional ceasefire while rejecting the idea of \u201cdictated peace\u201d or the \u201csubjugation\u201d of Ukraine and advocating for more sanctions against Russia.",
      "The White House official said Trump on Thursday will stress that direct peace talks must continue.",
      "In their first phone call since Merz became chancellor, Trump said he would support the efforts of Germany and other European countries to achieve peace, according to a readout from the German government. Merz also said last month that \u201cit is of paramount importance that the political West not let itself be divided, so I will continue to make every effort to produce the greatest possible unity between the European and American partners.\u201d",
      "Under Merz's immediate predecessor, Olaf Scholz, Germany became the second-biggest supplier of military aid to Ukraine after the United States. Merz has vowed to keep up the support and last week pledged to help Ukraine develop its own long-range missile systems that would be free of any range limits.",
      "At home, Merz's government is intensifying a drive that Scholz started to bolster the German military after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. In Trump's first term, Berlin was a target of his ire for failing to meet the current NATO target of spending 2% of gross domestic product on defense, and Trump is now demanding at least 5% from allies.",
      "The White House official said the upcoming NATO summit in the Netherlands later this month is a \u201cgood opportunity\u201d for Germany to commit to meeting that 5% mark.",
      "Scholz set up a 100 billion euro ($115 billion) special fund to modernize Germany's armed forces \u2014 called the Bundeswehr \u2014 which had suffered from years of neglect. Germany has met the 2% target thanks to the fund, but it will be used up in 2027.",
      "Merz has said that \u201cthe government will in the future provide all the financing the Bundeswehr needs to become the strongest conventional army in Europe.\u201d He has endorsed a plan for all allies to aim to spend 3.5% of GDP on their defense budgets by 2032, plus an extra 1.5% on potentially defense-related things like infrastructure.",
      "Another top priority for Merz is to get Germany's economy, Europe's biggest, moving again after it shrank the past two years. He wants to make it a \u201clocomotive of growth,\u201d but Trump's tariff threats are a potential obstacle for a country whose exports have been a key strength. At present, the economy is forecast to stagnate in 2025.",
      "Germany exported $160 billion worth of goods to the U.S. last year, according to the Census Bureau. That was about $85 billion more than what the U.S. sent to Germany, a trade deficit that Trump wants to erase.",
      "The U.S. president has specifically gone after the German auto sector, which includes major brands such as Audi, BMW, Mercedes Benz, Porsche and Volkswagen. Americans bought $36 billion worth of cars, trucks and auto parts from Germany last year, while the Germans purchased $10.2 billion worth of vehicles and parts from the U.S.",
      "Trump\u2019s 25% tariff on autos and parts is specifically designed to increase the cost of German-made automobiles in hopes of causing them to move their factories to the U.S., even though many of the companies already have plants in the U.S. with Volkswagen in Tennessee, BMW in South Carolina and Mercedes-Benz in Alabama and South Carolina.",

Trump recently delayed a planned 50% tariff on goods coming from the European Union, which would have otherwise gone into effect this month.",

      "The Washington Department of Natural Resources has been using one of its firefighting helicopters to haul abandoned boats off an uninhabited island in the southernmost reaches of Puget Sound this week",
      "OLYMPIA, Wash. -- As the owner of a marina, Kate Gervais is used to seeing boats in the water. But for the last couple of days, she's been seeing them in the air.",
      "The Washington Department of Natural Resources this week used one of its firefighting helicopters to haul abandoned boats off an uninhabited island in the southernmost reaches of Puget Sound, where the vessels had come to rest after drifting with the currents, and fly them to the mainland to be deconstructed later.",
      "With 14 vessels removed, it was the agency's largest operation of its kind, officials said.",
      "\u201cIt was a very, very weird sight,\u201d said Gervais, who owns Boston Harbor Marina, just north of Olympia. \u201cThe sail boat with the mast was the weirdest one to see.\u201d",
      "A boat removal by helicopter is typically done by a private pilot, but for this operation, which was funded by a federal grant, the DNR opted to use one of its firefighting helicopters. It was cheaper and helped stretch the $1 million NOAA grant, said Commissioner of Public Lands Dave Upthegrove.",
      "The state agency opts to airlift boats when towing them would disrupt the marine bed or surrounding environment too much. The aquatic lands where the boats land often include kelp beds, which are critical for supporting the forage fish that salmon rely on.",
      "Vessels for this operation where found in hard-to-reach coves, at the tree line or in mud that rendered an airlift a better option, agency staff said.",
      "Since the boat removal program began in 2002, the department has hauled out more than 1,200 derelict vessels. There are at least 300 more out there, with more found all the time, Upthegrove said.",
      "\u201cIt\u2019s a real challenge impacting the Puget Sound when people essentially dump their old boats into the water because they don\u2019t want to deal with disposing of them,\" he said. \"That burden then falls on all of us.\u201d",
      "The federal grant allowed the state to clean up boats on Squaxin Island, an uninhabited island that is of particular cultural importance to the Squaxin Island Tribe. The tribe's people once shared vast lands in western Washington state, but following the 1854 Treaty of Medicine Creek, the island \u2014 4.5 miles (7.2 kilometers) long and half a mile (800 meters) wide \u2014 was the main area reserved for them, according to the tribe's website.",
      "Eventually, the tribe's members moved off the island, but they continue to use it for fishing, hunting, shellfish gathering and camping.",
      "\u201cThe Squaxin Island Tribe is very enthusiastic about this opportunity to work with DNR to clean-up derelict vessels on tribal lands,\u201d said Daniel Kuntz, the tribe's policy and program manager. \u201cMaintaining clean beaches and water are essential to the Squaxin Island culture to ensure gathering access for future generations.\u201d",

      "A Guatemalan man deported to Mexico, whom President Donald Trump's administration was working to bring back after a court order, landed in the United States on Wednesday, his attorneys confirmed.",
      "The man, identified in court documents by initials O.C.G., landed in California via a commercial flight and made contact with his legal team while waiting in line to go through U.S. Customs and Border Protection, said Trina Realmuto of the National Immigration Litigation Alliance.",
      "He was later taken into custody by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and was being transported to a detention facility in Arizona, she said in an email to The Associated Press.",
      "The Trump administration said in court filings last month that it was working to bring him back after he was deported to Mexico, despite his fears of being harmed there, days after a federal judge ordered the administration to facilitate his return.",
      "The U.S. Department of Justice didn't immediately respond to a request for comments and details from the AP.",
      "The man, who is gay, was protected from being returned to his home country under a U.S. immigration judge\u2019s order at the time. But the U.S. put him on a bus and sent him to Mexico instead, a removal that U.S. District Judge Brian Murphy found likely \u201clacked any semblance of due process.\u201d",

The designation allows people who aren\u2019t eligible to enter the U.S. to do so temporarily, often for reasons related to law enforcement or legal proceedings.",
      "An earlier court proceeding had determined that the man risked persecution or torture if returned to Guatemala. But he also feared returning to Mexico, where he says he was raped and extorted while seeking asylum in the U.S., according to court documents.",
      "\u201cAs far as we know, it is the first time since January 20 that (Department of Homeland Security) has facilitated return following a district court order,\u201d Realmuto said.",
      "The case is among a string of findings by federal courts against recent Trump administration deportations. Those have included other deportations to third countries and the erroneous deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, an El Salvadoran man who had lived in Maryland for roughly 14 years.",
      "The U.S. Supreme Court ordered the Trump administration to facilitate Abrego Garcia\u2019s return to the U.S. from a notorious Salvadoran prison, rejecting the White House\u2019s claim that it couldn\u2019t retrieve him after mistakenly deporting him. Both the White House and the El Salvadoran president have said they are powerless to return him.",

      "Army leaders are defending spending as much as $45 million to add a parade to the service\u2019s 250th birthday celebration on June 14, saying it will help boost recruitment",
      "WASHINGTON -- Army leaders on Wednesday defended spending as much as $45 million to add a parade to the service's 250th birthday celebration on June 14 in Washington, saying it will help boost recruitment, as Congress members argued that the money could be better spent on troops' barracks or other priorities.",
      "Members of the House Armed Services Committee also said they are concerned that the Defense Department is shifting about $1 billion from a variety of accounts \u2014 including base housing \u2014 to cover the costs of shoring up the defense of the southern border.",
      "Spending for the parade has become a flashpoint since it comes at a time when the Trump administration is slashing funding for personnel and programs across the federal government, including the Defense Department.",
      "While the Army has long planned for a festival on the National Mall to celebrate its 250th birthday, the parade was just recently added. President Donald Trump has long wanted a military parade in the city, after seeing an elaborate one in France on Bastille Day during his first presidential term, and June 14 is also his birthday.",
      "U.S. Rep. Salud Carbajal, D-Calif., questioned whether the additional cost of the parade was appropriate since all the military services are facing 8% budget cuts, and said perhaps it could be used to improve troops\u2019 quality of life or warfighting capabilities. He prodded Army Secretary Daniel Driscoll on what he would prioritize if Congress wrote him a blank check for $45 million.",
      "Driscoll replied that he thinks the parade offers a chance to tell the public about the Army. \u201cI believe very specifically that telling that story will directly lead to a recruiting boom and will fill up our pipeline for the coming years,\" he said.",
      "At the same time, he and Gen. Randy George, chief of staff of the Army, told lawmakers that the service has now met its recruiting goal for the year \u2014 with 61,000 recruits. Army officials have predicted for months that they would hit the target early after making a series of changes to recruiting programs, recruiters and policies over the past several years.",
      "That prompted Rep. Wesley Bell, D-Mo., to ask why the parade was needed for recruiting if it's already surging.",
      "Driscoll said the Army believes the parade \u201cwill empower an entire new generation of America\u2019s youth to catch the spirit to serve their nation.\u201d",
      "Rep. Derrick Van Orden, R-Wisc., defended the parade spending, saying \u201cyou cannot put a price tag on patriotism.\u201d",
      "House members on both sides of the aisle pressed the Army about a recent request to shift money from across the budget to support the southern border. The biggest concern, they said, is that it takes money away from base housing, which has been plagued with persistent problems, including mold, rodents and raw sewage in barracks.",
      "Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., agreed the nation needs a strong border, but said lawmakers worked for the past year on a broad effort to address the housing problems. \u201cI feel like a decision was made that undermined this whole effort that we spent the last year doing.,\" he said.",
      "Pressed on the issue by Carbajal, George acknowledged that redirecting the money has an impact on the barracks.",
      "\u201cIf we took $1 billion out of barracks, we would be able to fix less barracks,\" he agreed, but also said, \u201d\u201cYou have to make choices, congressman.\"",

      "Organizers of separate campaigns to expand Medicaid and legalize recreational marijuana had urged U.S. District Mark Walker to block implementation of parts of the law, arguing that the new requirements violate their First Amendment rights. But in an order issued Wednesday, Walker granted a narrow injunction, barring state officials from enforcing one section of the law criminalizing ballot petition fraud against one campaign staffer.",

The law signed last month by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis also gives campaigns just 10 days instead of the previous 30 to return signed petition forms to local elections officials. Petitioners could also face stiff fines if they don\u2019t return the petitions on time, or send them to the wrong county.",
      "Lawmakers argue that the new restrictions are needed to reform a process they claim has been tainted by fraud. The Republican-controlled Legislature pushed the changes months after a majority of Florida voters supported ballot initiatives to protect abortion rights and legalize recreational marijuana, though the measures fell short of the 60% needed to pass.",
      "Attorneys for the campaigns Florida Decides Healthcare and Smart & Safe Florida have argued the new law makes gathering enough petitions from voters prohibitively expensive and effectively impossible.",
      "In his order, Walker wrote that the new provisions have caused \u201can immediate reduction in protected speech\u201d by constraining the campaigns' ability to collect petitions \u2014 and volunteers' willingness to help. But Walker said the campaigners didn't prove that their free speech rights had been \u201cseverely burdened.\"",
      "\u201cInstead, the record shows that these provisions simply make the process of getting their proposed initiatives on the ballot more expensive and less efficient for Plaintiffs,\u201d Walker wrote.",

      "The Republican inquiry so far has focused on the final executive actions of Biden's administration, which included the issuing of new federal rules and presidential pardons that they claim may be invalid.",
      "Comer cited the book \u201cOriginal Sin\u201d by CNN's Jake Tapper and Axios' Alex Thompson, which details concerns and debates inside the White House and Democratic Party over Biden's mental state and age.",

      "Justice Department attorneys have asked Leon to end a sealing order for the records nearly two years ahead of its expiration date. A department attorney said the administration is only interested in releasing files related to King's assassination.",
      "The Southern Christian Leadership Conference, which King led, is opposed to unsealing any of the records for privacy reasons. The organization\u2019s lawyers said King\u2019s relatives also want to keep the files under seal.",
      "In 1977, a court order directed the FBI to collect records about its surveillance and monitoring of King and turn them over to the National Archives and Records Administration. The order required the records to remain under seal for 50 years \u2014 until Jan. 31, 2027.",
      "In January, President Donald Trump ordered Attorney General Pam Bondi to review and publicly release documents about King\u2019s assassination \u201cbecause the American people have an interest in full transparency about this key historic event,\u201d government lawyers wrote.",
      "\u201cTo maximize this transparency objective, the records sealed in this case should be part of the Attorney General\u2019s review,\u201d they added.",
      "SCLC attorneys said the FBI tried to discredit King and their organization by illegally wiretapping King\u2019s home, SCLC offices and hotel rooms where King met with other SCLC officials. Unsealing records of those recordings is contrary to the interests of SCLC, the King family and the public, the lawyers argued.",
      "\u201cSince its inception, this case has been about government overreach,\u201d said SCLC attorney Sumayya Saleh.",
      "Justice Department attorney Johnny Walker said the administration has no intention of releasing any personal communications or privileged records contained in the files.",
      "\u201cThankfully, I am not here to defend the allegations in the underlying complaint,\u201d Walker told the judge.",
      "Nobody involved in the litigation knows what's in the archives and whether any of it relates to King's assassination.",
      "\u201cIt could be easy. There could be nothing, and then we just all go away,\u201d Walker said.",
      "\u201cIt's not going to happen overnight,\u201d the judge said. \u201cThe court is going to move very carefully.\u201d",
      "King was shot and killed on April 4, 1968, while standing on the balcony of a motel in Memphis, Tennessee.",
      "In 1976, the SCLC and Bernard Lee, who was King\u2019s executive assistant at the organization, filed a lawsuit to challenge the legality of the FBI\u2019s surveillance. The 1977 court order required the FBI to compile records of its telephone wiretapping operations, between 1963 and 1968, at King\u2019s home and at the SCLC offices in Atlanta and New York.",
      "Bernice King, the civil rights leader\u2019s youngest daughter, said in a court filing that she hopes the files are permanently sealed or destroyed.",
      "\u201cIt is unquestionable that my father was a private citizen, not an elected official, who enjoyed the right to privacy that should be afforded to all private citizens of this country,\u201d she said. \u201cTo not only be unjustifiably surveilled, but to have the purported surveillance files made public would be a travesty of justice.\u201d",
      "Trump\u2019s Jan. 23 executive order also called for declassifying records about the assassinations of President John F. Kennedy and Sen. Robert F. Kennedy.",

      "Garon Nathaniel Killian, 20, of Lenoir, was arrested Tuesday and accused of one count of attempted first-degree murder related to the shooting in a residential neighborhood about 7 miles (11 kilometers) south of Hickory. Killian remained in the Catawba County jail after a hearing Wednesday before a district court judge who said he could be released awaiting trial if a $200,000 bond was posted. Prosecutors had requested that no bond be allowed, media outlets reported.",
      "Authorities announced at a media briefing later Wednesday that they were seeking to apprehend three additional suspects \u2014 one facing a charge of attempted first-degree murder and two facing a charge of helping someone under age 21 possess alcoholic beverages. Killian also is expected to face additional charges, sheriff\u2019s Maj. Aaron Turk said.",

No one was injured.",
      "The Charlotte Observer, citing court records, said that Killian had been free on a $100,000 bond. Killian's attorney now and for the April case didn't respond to phone and email messages Wednesday.",

      "At least 80 shots were fired beginning early Sunday shortly after midnight in a crime scene that spanned several properties along a neighborhood road, authorities said. People reported running, ducking for cover and scrambling to their cars for safety. FBI agents were still at the scene Wednesday working to determine the trajectories of the bullets that were fired.",
      "Shawn Patrick Hood, 58, of Lenoir, was killed in the gunfire. He was the oldest of the victims, who ranged in age from as young as 16, the sheriff\u2019s office said. Turk said that most of those injured were shot, but he didn't immediately have information Wednesday on whether any of the injured were still in the hospital.",
      "Turk said the investigation has determined that the shooting began from an elevated area in a yard neighboring the house where the party was happening. Other gunfire then erupted around the home, the home's front yard and by the road.",

      "A judge has blocked a private prison operator from housing immigrants facing possible deportation in a shuttered Kansas City area detention center unless it can get a permit from frustrated city officials",
      "LEAVENWORTH, Kan. -- A judge on Wednesday barred a major U.S. private prison operator from housing immigrants facing possible deportation in a shuttered Kansas City area detention center unless it can get a permit from frustrated city officials.",
      "Leavenworth County Judge John Bryant agreed after a packed hearing to grant the city of Leavenworth's request for a temporary restraining order against CoreCivic, one of the nation's largest private prison operators.",
      "CoreCivic had claimed in legal filings that halting the opening of the 1,033-bed facility on the northwest outskirts of the Kansas City area would cost it $4.2 million in revenue each month. City officials said they anticipated the arrival of detainees apprehended by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement was imminent under a Trump administration crackdown on illegal immigration.",
      "Leavenworth isn\u2019t the first city where controversy has surrounded the reopening of a private prison as an ICE detention facility. In Newark, New Jersey, Mayor Ras Baraka sued the state\u2019s top federal prosecutor on Tuesday over his recent arrest on a trespassing charge at a federal immigration detention facility in that state, saying the Trump-appointed attorney had pursued the case out of political spite.",
      "Scott Peterson, the city manager for Leavenworth, said he didn\u2019t know if the case in Kansas marked the first time a municipality had prevailed in court.",
      "\u201cI would point out that maybe the reason we have seen some success here today is this is not about immigration,\u201d Peterson said. \u201cThis is not about private prisons. This is about land use.\u201d",
      "In late 2021, CoreCivic stopped housing pretrial detainees for the U.S. Marshals Service in the Leavenworth facility after then-President Joe Biden called on the Justice Department to curb the use of private prisons. In the months leading up to the closure, the American Civil Liberties Union and federal public defenders urged the White House to speed up the closure, citing inmate rights violations there along with stabbings, suicides and even one homicide.",
      "But with President Donald Trump pushing for mass deportations under a wide-ranging crackdown on illegal immigration, the facility that CoreCivic now calls the Midwest Regional Reception Center is in demand again. It is located just 10 miles (16 kilometers) west of the Kansas City International Airport. As part of his crackdown, Trump has vowed to sharply increase detention beds nationwide from the budgeted 41,000 beds this year.",
      "Tennessee-based CoreCivic initially applied for a special use permit from the city in February but then withdrew that application the next month, arguing in court filings that it didn\u2019t need the permit and that the process would take too long.",
      "\u201cIt became clear to CoreCivic that there was not a cooperative relationship,\u201d said Taylor Concannon Hausmann, an attorney for the private prison operator, speaking in court.",
      "The city sued CoreCivic, the lawsuit claiming that CoreCivic impeded the city police force\u2019s ability to investigate sexual assaults and other violent crimes. The lawsuit contended that the permitting process was needed to safeguard itself from future problems.",
      "\u201cJust follow our rules,\" an attorney for the city, Joe Hatley, said in court. \u201cGo get a permit.\u201d",
      "The first version of the lawsuit, filed in March in federal court, was tossed out in May on technical grounds. But Bryant sided with Hatley in the case refiled the same month in state court, finding that the proper procedures weren't followed.",
      "Concannon Hausmann, CoreCivic's attorney, declined to comment as the crowd filtered out of the courtroom Wednesday. Norman Mallicoat held a sign reading, \u201cCoreCivic Doesn\u2019t Run Leavenworth\u201d as he left.",
      "\u201cI see this as basically a large company trying to bully a small city into getting what it wants and not having to follow the rules and ordinances of the city,\u201d Mallicoat said.",

      "A federal judge says the Trump administration must give migrants sent to an El Salvador prison a chance to challenge their removals",
      "WASHINGTON -- A federal judge ruled on Wednesday that the Trump administration must give more than 100 migrants sent to a notorious prison in El Salvador prison a chance to challenge their deportations.",
      "U.S. District Court Chief Judge James Boasberg said that people who were sent to the prison in March under an 18th-century wartime law haven\u2019t been able to formally contest the removals or allegations that they are members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. He ordered the administration to work toward giving them a way to file those challenges.",
      "The judge wrote that \u201csignificant evidence\u201d has surfaced indicating that many of the migrants imprisoned in El Salvador are not connected to the gang \u201cand thus languish in a foreign prison on flimsy, even frivolous, accusations.\u201d",
      "Boasberg gave the administration one week to come up with a manner in which the \"at least 137\" people can make those claims, even while they're formally in the custody of El Salvador. It's the latest milestone in the monthslong legal saga over the fate of deportees imprisoned at El Salvador\u2019s notorious Terrorism Confinement Center.",
      "After Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 in March and prepared to fly planeloads of accused gang members to El Salvador and out of the jurisdiction of U.S. courts, Boasberg ordered them to turn the planes around. This demand was ignored. Boasberg has found probably cause that the administration committed contempt of court after the flight landed. El Salvador President Nayib Bukele posted a taunting message on social media \u2014 reposted by some of Trump's top aides \u2014 that read \u201cOopsie, too late.\u201d",
      "The U.S. Supreme Court later ruled that anyone targeted under the AEA has the right to appeal to a judge to contest their designation as an enemy of the state. Boasberg, in his latest, ruling wrote that he was simply applying that principle to those who'd been removed.",
      "Boasberg said the administration \u201cplainly deprived\u201d the immigrants of a chance to challenge their removals before they were put on flights. Therefore, he says the government must handle the migrants cases now as if they \u201cwould have been if the Government had not provided constitutionally inadequate process.\u201d",
      "The Department of Justice did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "The administration and its supporters have targeted Boasberg for his initial order halting deportations and his contempt inquiry, part of their growing battle with the judiciary as it puts the brakes on Trump's efforts to unilaterally remake government. The fight has been particularly harsh in the realm of immigration, where Trump has repeatedly said it'd be impossible to protect the country from dangerous immigrants if each one has his or her day in court.",
      "\u201cWe cannot give everyone a trial!\u201d the president posted on his social media site, Truth Social, after the Supreme Court intervened a second time in the AEA saga, halting a possible effort to evade its initial ruling by temporarily freezing deportations from northern Texas.",
      "Boasberg wrote that he accepted the administration's declaration, filed under seal, providing details of the government's deal with El Salvador to house deportees and how that means the Venezuelans are technically under the legal control of El Salvador and not the United States. He added, while noting there is a criminal penalty for providing false testimony, that believing those representations was \u201crendered more difficult given the Government\u2019s troubling conduct throughout this case.\u201d",
      "He also noted parallels with another case where the Trump administration admitted it mistakenly deported a Maryland man to El Salvador and has been ordered by a judge, appellate judges and the U.S. Supreme Court to \u201cfacilitate\u201d his return.",
      "That man, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, remains in El Salvador more than two months later.",
      "ACLU attorney Lee Gelernt welcomed Boasberg\u2019s ruling.",
      "\u201cThis is a significant step forward to getting these men the chance to show that they should not ever have been removed under a wartime authority,\u201d Gelernt told reporters in San Diego after a hearing in an unrelated case.",
      "Boasberg's order is only the latest of a blizzard of legal rulings in the sprawling AEA case.",
      "Several judges have temporarily halted deportations under the act in parts of Texas, New York, California, Pennsylvania and elsewhere, finding the administration's 24 hour window that it gave detainees to challenge their designation under the act did not meet the Supreme Court's requirement of providing a \u201creasonable\u201d chance to seek relief. Deportations of people in the country illegally can continue in those areas under laws other than the AEA,",
      "Some of the judges in those cases have also found that Trump cannot use the act to target a criminal gang rather than a state, noting that the act has only been invoked three prior times in history \u2014 during the War of 1812 and during World Wars I and II.",
      "The Supreme Court will likely eventually decide those issues. The Trump administration contends that the gang is acting as a shadow arm of Venezuela's government.",

      "But one thing he doesn't seem to love, considering he's lived his life in the public eye, is a certain kind of attention. He says sometimes getting in front of a crowd (or even our \"Sunday Morning\" cameras) doesn't quite come naturally.",
      "He is, he admits, an introvert. \"Oh, hell yeah. Yeah. I don't even wanna be here!\" he said.",
      "In fact, he says he sometimes has to resort to liquid courage. \"I think I had like four scotches before I walked out on stage at the Oscars,\" he said, referring to his hosting gig in 2013. \"I do get, yeah, I definitely get nervous.\"",
      "You might know MacFarlane as the voice of Peter, Brian Griffin and Stewie on the show \"Family Guy\" that he created more than two decades ago. In 1999, MacFarlane became the youngest showrunner in Hollywood history. And less than a decade later, with three network shows on the air, he became Hollywood's highest-paid writer-producer.",
      "But back in college, MacFarlane's first love was singing. \"My sister, at the time, was going to the Boston Conservatory of Music for musical theater,\" he said. \"She has a beautiful singing voice. And I had got it into my head that I was going to maybe go to grad school for musical theater as well. So, I applied and got in. And I was all set to go to their grad program. And I got this offer from Hanna-Barbera to come do an animated short for a series that they were developing. And so, I just had to take it, moved out to California. But there was an instant there where I could have kind of diverged into a completely different career and never, you know, never even thought about something called 'Family Guy.'\"",
      "MacFarlane loved film scores as a college student and to this day he uses a live orchestra to score his TV shows.\u00a0 \"It's the one part that I don't really understand, even to this day,\" he said. \"There's still something mysterious about how a composer sits down to write, and then a couple weeks later walks in front of an orchestra, plops down these charts, and they all play it. And you hear this insane, magical sound. That still eludes me.\"",
      "Frank Sinatra Jr, and Stewie and Brian (Seth MacFarlane), perform \"At Frank Sinatra's Restaurant (Jr.)\" from \"Family Guy\":",
      "For his latest album, \"Lush Life: The Lost Sinatra Arrangements\" (out this week), MacFarlane and Joel McNeely (his composer for \"American Dad!\" and \"The Orville\") combed through the Sinatra Family archives for songs that had been arranged for Sinatra but never fully recorded. For McNeely, the process was almost like speaking to the ghosts of the greatest arrangers in popular music, the men who helped make Sinatra's voice shine.",
      "McNeely showed an arrangement by Nelson Riddle: \"This was the first one we read when we had a sight-reading session at Fox. We got an orchestra together just to see what was there, you know, because there was nothing to reference. But all this time later, these little black pencil dots on paper, there's his voice brought back to life. I mean, it was chilling.\"",
      "So, what exactly does an arranger do? \"Frank Sinatra, there's a recording of him saying that the arrangers could be in a sense a recording secretary, taking the vision of the artist and interpreting it into this,\" McNeely said.",
      "MacFarlane said, \"You take a song like 'Fly Me to the Moon,' for example, which I think was originally a ballad. [Here], it's the same song, but it's a completely different animal.\"",
      "McNeely says MacFarlane is preserving the essential legacy of the American Songbook through his recordings and the music of the TV show \"Family Guy.\" But what about the legacy of \"Family Guy\"? MacFarlane has some thoughts: \"When I started the show \u2013 this is the conversation that, like, tortures me at night! \u2013 when I started the show, my attitude was, it doesn't matter, none of it matters. It's like, It's funny? Let's do it.",
      "\"And the older I've gotten, I look back at shows that we've done, and I'm like, Gosh, I guess it's a little more complicated than that, isn't it? Comedy and jokes do have an impact. I have to figure out a way to maintain what the show is, and maintain the thing that people love. But at the same time, recognize that, like, all right, I am analyzing it now in a different way than I did when I was younger.\"",
      "If it's true that you're nobody 'till somebody loves you, then thanks to \"Family Guy\"'s legion of fans, Seth MacFarlane, it turns out, is a very big somebody indeed.",
      "Seth MacFarlane performs \"Give Me the Simple Life,\" from his album \"Lush Life: The Lost Sinatra Arrangements\":",
      "CORRECTION: A previous version of this story stated that Joel McNeely was the composer and arranger for \"Family Guy.\" He was in fact the composer for two other Seth MacFarlane series, \"American Dad!\" and \"The Orville.\"",

    "summary": "Audra McDonald role in \"Gypsy\" marks a new milestone in a record-setting career that continues to redefine what's possible.",
    "story": [
      "When Audra McDonald won her first Tony Award at 23, it was just the beginning of a record-breaking Broadway career. Earlier this month, she received her 11th Tony nomination, making her the most Tony-nominated actor of all time.",
      "McDonald received the nomination for her portrayal of Mama Rose in the latest Broadway revival of \"Gypsy.\" If she wins this Sunday, she'll make history as the performer with the most Tonys ever.",
      "Before she discovered the stage, McDonald described herself as a hyperactive kid who would express her emotions frequently.",
      "\"I had big feelings. I had music in my heart. And so once I found theater, it was like I have a place to put my big feelings now,\" she said.",
      "Those emotions are on full display as Mama Rose, a character based on the real-life mother of famed burlesque entertainer Gypsy Rose Lee. It is currently being shown at the Majestic Theatre. In the musical, Mama Rose is an intense stage mom.",
      "McDonald first stepped into the role during a concert at Carnegie Hall in 2022, performing the musical's emotional climax \"Rose's Turn.\"",
      "\"It was the same time of year that I was getting ready to send my daughter off to college. And I was dealing with all this rage I was having at my sweet, wonderful daughter,\" McDonald said. \"And I burst into tears and I realized it's because my baby's leaving and I'm sad. So then that was my first sort, like, emotional dive into Rose.\"",
      "McDonald is the first Black woman to portray Mama Rose on Broadway. Director George C. Wolfe guided her interpretation of what Rose would be experiencing in the 1920s and 30s, with not one word of the original script changed.",
      "\"George talks a lot about Rose's obsession with the kids becoming stars is because being a star protects you in some way. You got star money, you could eat. You got star money, maybe you won't be lynched,\" McDonald explained. \"And so she as a single woman at this time, abandoned three times by her husbands, abandoned by her mother, not really treated all that well by her father, she's tryin' to protect these babies.\"",
      "Behind the Curtain",
      "The \"CBS Mornings\" interview went backstage to find out what happens when the curtain closes. McDonald and her co-star Danny Burstein are \"of a certain age,\" she laughed, noting they don't run up the stairs after performances.",
      "McDonald showed how she warms up to take on the demanding role.",
      "\"One thing that a lotta singers do is humming. Just like (humming), you're doing things like that just to sort of and people do that, whether you're singing or not. It's good just to sort of make sure that everything's sort of moving and healthy. And you know, to do it eight times a week,\" she said.",
      "Inspiring the next generation",
      "Despite her countless accolades, McDonald still struggles with being called a legend.",
      "\"If it can mean something to some little Black girl somewhere who says 'She did it and she looks like me so I can do it,' great,\" she said. \"But I can't really comprehend what that means to me about me. You know what I mean? 'Cause I can't, you know, as I see how dirty my closet is, and the fact that I have not done laundry in four weeks.\"",
      "When asked about her own legends, McDonald became emotional while naming the likes of Diahann Carroll, Ruby Dee and Lena Horne.",
      "\"They're not here. And they meant a lot to me. I could see them. They were doing it. They looked like me,\" she said.",

      "And sometimes, their made-up White House looks almost like real life. In the book, the president keeps working through an agonizing personal crisis. During his 1999 impeachment proceedings, President Clinton kept working, too, with some of the very people who were trying to kick him out of the White House. \"And they were amazed by it,\" he said. \"They'd come and do business with me, [and] as far as they knew, I couldn't remember what was going on. And we would try to hammer out deals.\" In the midst of impeachment? \"Because that's what I got hired to do,\" Clinton said. \"The American people don't pay you to have personal feelings. They pay you to deliver for them.\"",
      "Clinton and Patterson have been delivering since 2018, with their first book about a president gone missing, and in 2021 their second about the president's daughter getting kidnapped. Both were bestsellers. But for them, it's really not all about work.",
      "Asked how their relationship has evolved over their three books together, Clinton replied, \"We've played a lot more golf.\"",
      "Patterson said, \"He's been president more times, but I have more holes-in-one.\"",
      "\"Oh God. Well, I have one; he has nine,\" said Clinton. \"How many Americans have nine holes-in-one?\"",
      "\"I know. That's sick,\" Patterson said. \"Remember I'm a fiction writer.\"",
      "\"Makes the craziness stop for a little while\"",
      "I asked, \"There's so much political drama in the world today, real-life political drama. Do you think that there's an appetite for political thrillers, for fictional political thrillers?\"",
      "Patterson said, \"I think so, 100%. I mean, one of the nice things here is you escape, but you don't totally escape reality. It's like, 'Yeah, I love this. I can't put it down.' Or 'I keep reading,' or in some cases to me what's even better, which is you don't want it to end.",
      "\"I think it's useful, and 'cause so many people are wandering around, they go, 'Oh my God, oh my God, please make it stop'? This makes it stop for a little while, makes the craziness stop for a little while for people.\"",
      "Clinton said, \"One reason I hope there's an appetite is\u2026 I hope that people will still believe in our democratic system enough to stick with it and keep pushing to make it work.\"",
      "During the summer, Patterson lives at his home on the Hudson River; the president is about five miles away.",
      "Asked what they may have learned about each other during the writing process, Patterson offered, \"the notion \u2026 of not worrying about stuff that we can't do anything about. And if we can do something about it, try to do it.\"",
      "Their new book comes out tomorrow and they hope it's another bestseller. But if you spend any time at all with Patterson and Clinton, you get the sense that their partnership is about something money can't buy.",
      "I asked, \"Back when you wrote your first book together, The New York Times said that the two of you 'complete each other in the Jerry Maguire sense.'\"",
      "\"Well, we kinda do,\" Patterson said. \"This has been driving me for months now, which is: my time here is short. What can I do most beautifully? And in this case, doing another book with my friend is a beautiful thing to do.\"",

      "Prologue",
      "President Wright AdministrationYear Three: September",
      "1Brentwood, New Hampshire",
      "Cole Wright is sitting in the rear seat of a black up-armored Chevy Suburban, one of three in a convoy speeding its way down Route 125 in the Seacoast Region of New Hampshire.",
      "Two dark green state police cruisers, lights flashing, are leading this no-frills motorcade, scaled down for the occasion. The presidential limousine \u2014 the Beast \u2014 is back at the airport, along with the Secret Service counterassault team, support personnel, news media vans, and a fully equipped ambulance.",
      "Three years after the election, Cole still gets pumped from seeing traffic part like magic, even though he's well aware that it's for the convenience and safety of the woman sitting beside him \u2014 his wife, Madeline Parson Wright, the president of the United States.",
      "He's just the First Gentleman.",
      "A light drizzle spatters against the bulletproof windows. The agent accelerates to seventy along the two-lane highway.",
      "\"Two minutes out,\" says Burton Pearce, the president's chief of staff. Pearce perches in a rear-facing jump seat across from the First Couple. He's pale and serious, wearing one of his many identical gray suits. \"The Gray Ghost,\" staffers call him. The president nods without looking up.",
      "Cole glances over to see the CONFIDENTIAL stamps on the pages Maddy is reading as the convoy hums along. He knows those pages represent the biggest political gamble of her administration \u2014 of any administration. She should be in the Oval Office working the phones and twisting arms, but instead she's here with him. A powerful personal show of support.",
      "Maddy puts her briefing packet aside. Cole takes her hand and squeezes it.",
      "She squeezes back. \"Don't worry,\" she says. \"After all we've been through together, we can get through this too.\"",
      "The Suburban slows down to make a hard turn behind the police escort. Now the convoy is moving at just forty miles per hour. On both sides of the route, locals hold up crude hand-painted placards.",
      "WE BELIEVE IN YOU, COLE!",
      "STAY STRONG, COLE!",
      "KEEP MOVING, COLE!",
      "He looks out through the tinted side window. Almost game time. He can feel his muscles twitching, his focus narrowing, just like in his days as a tight end for New England \u2014 before the blown knee forced him out. He remembers how the tension in the Patriots locker room would build and build almost to the breaking point until the team ran out into the light, and when the cheers of the crowd washed over him, he'd think, Yeah, we're okay. We've got this.",
      "But today?",
      "Today he's not so sure.",
      "The redbrick facade of the Rockingham County courthouse comes into view. The road is lined with police barricades holding back hundreds \u2014 maybe thousands \u2014 of onlookers. Up here, some of the signs have a different tone.",
      "SCUM!",
      "MONSTER!",
      "JUSTICE FOR SUZANNE!",
      "\"Don't worry about these people,\" says Maddy. \"They don't know what they're talking about.\"",
      "\"I don't care about the people on the road,\" says Cole. \"I'm worried about the twelve people waiting for me inside.\"",
      "As the Suburban slows to a crawl, two women jump out in front and unspool a long banner.",
      "CONVICT COLE WRIGHT! SEND HIM STRAIGHT TO HELL!",
      "Thanks for the kind wishes, Cole thinks.",
      "2",
      "A thousand demonstrators, media people, and curious locals are crowded into the rain-slick parking lot. The convoy is passing through the tall evergreens flanking the pavement leading up to the courthouse when I realize I left my umbrella in my car. Too late.",
      "Rockingham County has never drawn security like this. Uniforms representing every law enforcement department in New Hampshire \u2014 from local cops to Fish and Game \u2014 are patrolling the courthouse steps. On the roof there's a detail of men and women in tactical gear and black baseball caps carrying sniper rifles. They're not even trying to hide. That's the job of their colleagues, posted in places nobody can see.",
      "I hear someone calling my name: \"Brea Cooke? That you?\"",
      "I look at the crowd. Mostly white. No surprise; the Granite State is around 89 percent Caucasian. It's a situation I got used to as a Black student at Dartmouth, about two hours north. Let's just say it's not unusual for me to stand out around here.",
      "I turn around. \"Ron Reynolds!\"",
      "Ron is a friendly face from the old days when he and my partner, Garrett Wilson, both reported for the Boston Globe. He's wearing his standard outfit \u2014 tan overcoat, khaki pants, and a tweed cap. His big press pass is dangling around his neck.",
      "I give him a quick hug. \"Guess we both forgot our umbrellas.\"",
      "A guy in a thick camo jacket jostles by us and flicks a finger at Ron's press pass. \"Fake news!\" the guy shouts. Ron ignores him.",
      "\"So why are you here?\" I ask. \"You could be in one of those gyms right now, dry and toasty. Probably getting a better view than this.\"",
      "\"I get paid to get wet,\" says Ron. \"Even if nothing happens.\"",
      "But something is happening. I've been waiting for this day a long time. I see flashing lights coming up the drive. Two state police cars and three big black SUVs.",
      "\"It's them!\"",
      "The lights are getting closer. I'm in the middle of the crowd, but suddenly I feel as alone as I've ever felt in my life.",
      "I close my eyes for a second. My mind whispers, Garrett.",
      "I blink hard. Not now! I need to focus. Capture this scene for my book. Our book. The one Garrett and I were working on together. Until he ...",
      "Ron points to the courthouse steps. \"See the podium and the camera stands up there?\"",
      "I nod. \"What about them?\"",
      "\"All for show. No way the Secret Service allows the president and First Gent to go through the front entrance.\"",
      "\"The crowd won't appreciate being tricked like that.\"",
      "\"You're right,\" says Ron. \"They came to witness history.\"",
      "So did I.",
      "The first time in history that a president's spouse is going on trial for murder.",
      "3",
      "The convoy crawls toward the entrance as cops push the crowds back. Inside the six-ton Suburban in the middle, Cole rubs his hands together nervously. Pearce leans forward in his jump seat and says, \"The county sheriffs, state troopers, and Secret Service have carved out a path so we can go around to the rear of the courthouse. By the time the crowd and the press catch on, we'll be inside and out of sight.\"",
      "Hidden away, Cole thinks. \"No,\" he says quietly. \"That's not going to happen.\"",
      "Pearce blinks. \"Excuse me?\"",
      "\"I said no. Going in through the rear of the courthouse signals that I'm guilty, that I have something to hide. Screw that. I'm going to run the ball straight through the line of scrimmage.\"",
      "The Suburban moves toward the driveway turnoff. Pearce is getting testy. \"Cole, plans have been in place for days. Best to arrive via the rear from both a safety and PR viewpoint.\"",
      "But Cole is firm. \"We go through the front door. That's final.\"",
      "He turns to his wife. \"Maddy, will you say a few words on the courthouse steps?\"",
      "It's a big ask. Maddy doesn't need to tell him the source of the tension in her eyes. The conflict between being his loving partner while serving as POTUS, leader of the free world, is etched on her face.",
      "Maddy looks at her chief of staff. \"Cole is right, Burton. We go through the front entrance, heads held high.\"",
      "\"But, ma'am, we're just about there. Arrangements have been made.\"",
      "Cole sees Maddy shift into commander-in-chief mode. Cool. Crisp. Decisive. \"You've got a phone,\" she says. \"Make new arrangements.\"",
      "4",
      "They're getting out!\" Ron grabs my sleeve.",
      "Sure enough, I hear the slamming of heavy car doors and see movement at the front of the courthouse steps. The Secret Service is scrambling to clear a path to the podium.",
      "\"That takes some brass ones!\" Ron calls to me above the rising noise.",
      "A ring of dark suits surrounds President Wright and her broad-shouldered husband.",
      "The president walks up the wide steps and pivots to the podium. The crowd surges forward. Cops push back. Secret Service agents watch the sea of faces. And hands. Especially the hands. Looking for weapons.",
      "President Wright squeezes her husband's arm just before she leans into the microphones. \"Ladies and gentlemen, my dear friends, I will make this short and to the point.\"",
      "I hear her voice echo across the parking lot. She pauses after each phrase to let the words sink in.",
      "\"I have full faith and confidence in my husband's innocence, and I trust that the good citizens of New Hampshire, who have stood by my side over the years, will also support my husband during this time of crisis.\"",
      "The president turns and kisses her husband's cheek, making sure the cameras have a good angle. Then, as if it's an after-thought, she steps up to the mics again and says, \"I believe in our legal system, and I'm confident justice will be done here.\"",
      "She takes her husband's hand. The Secret Service team surrounds them. As a unit, they walk up the steps to the courthouse doors.",
      "\"Quite a performance,\" says Reynolds.",
      "\"It was a performance all right. Pure theater. They're not a couple \u2014 they're a damn criminal enterprise.\"",
      "My outburst must surprise Ron. A second later, he heads off to gather quotes.",
      "Once again, I'm alone. I scan the masses. Almost every man, woman, and child is looking toward the courthouse, trying to get one last glimpse of the First Couple.",
      "On the far side of the parking lot, I spot the lone exceptions: a man and a woman, looking straight at me.",
      "I've seen these two before. My watchers.",
      "Damn. Not again.",
      "The crowd shifts, and they disappear.",
      "All around me, people are chattering and yelling, but their words are a blanket of white noise. Again my mind whispers, Garrett. I hold out my hand, half expecting to see him reaching for me.",
      "I fight back the tears as reality hits home.",
      "The love of my life, Garrett Wilson, is dead. And I believe the man inside that courthouse is responsible for his death.",
      "The First Gentleman.",
      "He might even have pulled the trigger.",

    "published": "Wed, 04 Jun 2025 11:00:43 -0400",
    "summary": "The norovirus strain GII.17 may have disrupted the seasonal pattern of outbreaks.",
    "story": [
      "After years of largely predictable norovirus waves, the emergence of a new strain might have disrupted the seasonal pattern of outbreaks from this notorious stomach bug, suggests a new report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",
      "In previous years, the U.S. usually saw norovirus outbreaks increase around December. That marked the start of the season for the virus. But last year's season started in October, as a new norovirus strain called GII.17 drove a record wave of outbreaks.",
      "\"Continued surveillance is needed to determine if this genotype remains the dominant genotype, as well as whether the norovirus season continues to start earlier than previous years,\" wrote two of the CDC's top norovirus researchers, in an article published this month by the agency's Emerging Infectious Diseases journal.",
      "Outbreaks have since slowed to usual levels. But with GII.17 now identified in more than 3 in 4 outbreaks in the U.S., its displacement of the GII.4 strain that had previously been dominant is raising questions about whether norovirus season could arrive early again.",
      "\"GII.4 viruses are the main driver for norovirus seasonality. With the decrease of GII.4 outbreaks since 2024, whether GII.17 viruses will continue to cause an earlier onset of the norovirus season cannot yet be determined,\" the CDC researchers wrote.",
      "Several other countries also saw unusually large or shifted waves of norovirus this past year, after GII.17 surged to dominance.",
      "In England, norovirus reports reached levels more than double recent seasons. GII.17 was the most frequently reported genotype of norovirus through April, far above GII.4.",
      "In Japan, where GII.17 previously drove a wave of infections a decade ago, local health authorities in Tokyo reported a steep wave of infectious gastroenteritis \u2014 most from norovirus \u2014 that peaked weeks later than previous seasons and remains above recent years.",
      "Miranda de Graaf, a scientist at Erasmus University Medical Center in the Netherlands coordinating the global NoroNet network of norovirus researchers, said the Dutch nation did not see an earlier start to its norovirus season. But the country did see higher numbers of norovirus outbreaks, including a few large outbreaks in between when the usual seasonal surges occurred.",
      "GII.4 was still being detected around the world, meaning it was possible that GII.17's dominance could be short-lived, de Graaf said. Researchers had previously wondered if GII.17 could permanently take over, only to see GII.4 cases continue to remain dominant.",
      "\"GII.17 only replaced GII.4 last year, and there has not been another seasonal peak after that. Therefore it is not clear if these shifts will last, or if GII.17 will be the predominant strain next winter season,\" de Graaf said in an email.",
      "A CDC spokesperson said the agency is monitoring norovirus outbreaks through its CaliciNet laboratory\u00a0database\u00a0and pointed to a surge of GII.17 strains in Asia and Europe in 2014 that was followed by no reports of a change to seasonality.",
      "They also cautioned that there was no clear evidence to prove that GII.17's emergence was the cause of a change to the norovirus season last year.",
      "\"There are currently insufficient historic data to predict whether norovirus GII.17 will remain the dominant genotype and lead to an earlier onset of the norovirus season later this year,\" the spokesperson said in an email.",
      "Benjamin Lopman, an epidemiology professor at Emory University who previously worked for the CDC's viral diseases division, said shifts in norovirus strains happen \"when new variants find ways around the immunity that people have built up\" to previous strains. He said that new strains usually trigger more frequent outbreaks earlier in the season.",
      "\"I expect we'll see outbreak patterns return to more typical levels and seasonal patterns in the coming years, though it's always challenging to predict how these viruses will behave,\" Lopman said in an email.",

      "A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention official said Tuesday she was resigning from her role overseeing updates to the agency's COVID-19 vaccine recommendations, following an order by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to force an update to the agency's guidance.",
      "\"My career in public health and vaccinology started with a deep-seated desire to help the most vulnerable members of our population, and that is not something I am able to continue doing in this role,\" Dr. Lakshmi Panagiotakopoulos wrote in an email to the COVID-19 vaccines work group in the agency's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP).",
      "Panagiotakopoulos had served as one of the leads of this ACIP work group. She sent an email to members of the group early Tuesday morning to say she was resigning, multiple people who received the email confirmed to CBS News.",
      "Reuters first reported news of her resignation. Panagiotakopoulos and a CDC spokesperson did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
      "The process to update the CDC's influential vaccine recommendations is closely watched by experts because they are tied to federal policies and programs, including liability protections, vaccines for uninsured children and requirements for insurance coverage.",
      "The committee had been set to vote on updated recommendations for COVID-19 vaccines at a meeting later this month, before Kennedy usurped the process to impose his own changes to the guidance.",
      "Earlier this year, members of the work group had signaled they were already leaning toward narrowing the guidance to soften the recommendation for children with no underlying conditions to get vaccinated, in line with how Kennedy's order was ultimately implemented.",
      "But Kennedy's directive also broke with the committee by ordering the agency to exclude pregnant women from its COVID-19 vaccine recommendations. Pregnant women had been one of the groups that experts had worried were at higher risk of severe COVID-19 and warranted continued recommendations to get vaccinated.",

      "In life, you never know what cards you'll be dealt. Linde Jacobs lost her mother in 2022, which makes being a mother to two young daughters tough.",
      "She's struggled with how to properly grieve and cope. She's struggling with making sure her daughters see strength and resilience.",
      "There's also the fear. Unlike most people, Jacobs knows what cards are in her own future.",
      "\"I was speechless in that appointment,\" Jacobs recalled. \"I had never been delivered news like that before. It was something so shocking that I really didn't know how to grasp it and internalize it.\"",
      "Aside from years of love, Jacobs' mother had also given her a cruel gene that causes a condition nearly impossible to diagnose.",
      "\"She was boundary-less\"",
      "Alison Lee was a proud mother of three girls, a successful physical therapist and a doting grandmother. But when she turned 50, life turned upside down.",
      "\"Some of her impulses would be to touch people in public, so if she saw someone, she would go pull some guy's pants up because she said, 'I can see your underwear.' She was boundary-less, she didn't realize the social norms we place on what is appropriate,\" Jacobs said.",
      "Jacobs, a nurse herself, pounded doctors for information. She was told it was depression but she knew there was more.",
      "Meanwhile Lee's bizarre behavior continued. She started shoplifting, and after dodging a traffic stop she ended up in jail.",
      "Jacobs' sister received a letter from a fellow inmate saying, \"your mom doesn't belong here, I think she has dementia.\"",
      "\"It was affirmation, first time we had somebody look into this from a third party perspective and say this is dementia,\" Jacobs said.",
      "It was a diagnosis no doctor had given. Lee hadn't lost her memory but she had lost the mind she once had, and something clicked with Jacobs.",
      "Turns out, that inmate known only as \"Angie\" was right. That was 2018, and Jacobs still marvels at the gesture.",
      "\"The incredible kindness of a stranger to know that not only did she recognize this, but she recognized my mom as being vulnerable and then kept her sane,\" Jacobs said.",
      "Jacobs now had a clear path thanks to a to a stranger she'd never be able to thank.",
      "But with the context of dementia, Jacobs was able to figure out a lot. She recalled that her grandmother had similar impulsive behaviors.",
      "It was genetic \u2014 it was the mapT mutation of frontal dementia known as FTD. It's a disease that hits at 50, and instead of losing memories, patients often lose impulse control and self-awareness.",
      "\"Honestly, I had a lot of guilt that I was so intolerant to those symptoms when my mom would display them,\" said Jacobs.",
      "Jacobs watched her mom progress; one day Lee fell and hit her head. Because of the FTD, her brain couldn't take the swelling and she died at 62, leaving devastation and frustration.",
      "\"I had that understanding level while she was alive, this is not her, she is not doing this to me, this is happening because this disease is causing this symptom,\" Jacobs said.",
      "But she says it was hard to separate her mom from those symptoms. Amidst the grief, she learned that she and her two sisters had the gene, too. Jacobs said immediately, her mind went to her little girls.",
      "\"Truly, that I passed it on to my daughters,\" she said.",
      "Jacobs realized that there was very little information about MapT. She could barely Google the condition that she was most certainly going to have.",
      "Then, she and her husband happened to see a documentary on gene editing.",
      "\"And so he just Google searched \"FTD, CRISPR,\" and then we came across a physician that's based out of San Francisco, Dr. Claire Clelland,\" said Jacobs.",
      "\"It's just a matter of time\"",
      "In a busy laboratory on the other side of the country, Clelland received an email.",
      "\"I get contacted from patients, particularly gene carriers from around the world, but I remember just replying that I would try to help in the best way that I could,\" she said.",
      "That was the start of a powerful friendship.",
      "Jacobs set out on an advocacy journey across the nation, speaking to the nation's top neurologists and making them better understand this tricky and brutal disease that effects 40,000 Americans, essentially putting FTD on the map.",
      "Clelland said Jacobs' personal touch has fueled the process.",
      "\"And if you look at new therapies that make it through the pipeline and actually get to patients, often, they have patient supporters and champions that don't give up even when the work gets really hard,\" Clelland said.",
      "And that hard work landed Jacobs on the front page of the New York Times. From her frustration, to her grief, to that inmate's letter, she laid out her story for the world to see, giving her even more opportunity for revelations like the one she had in February inside a University of Minnesota research lab.",
      "It's there she saw a mouse with the frontal temporal dementia mutation she has. That mouse is a symbol of hope. It's part of promising research at the University of Minnesota.",
      "\"Linde sent me an email, she's actually the first FTD patient I've ever met,\" said Dr. Michael Koob, who is leading a team of researchers.",
      "Koob and his students are getting promising results for a treatment for people who know they have the gene.",
      "\"So, so for her, it's just a matter of time. This is going to happen. You know, at this point, I'm fairly confident that there will be an intervention that is going to work,\" said Koob.",
      "From the mice to the microscopes, things are looking up.",
      "WCCO followed Jacobs and her pursuit for two months. During that time, she had another breakthrough. It came at a coffee shop in River Falls, Wisconsin.",
      "A reunion",
      "After years, Jacobs finally found the inmate who had sent her the initial letter about her mom. She messaged her on Facebook, and the two set up a time to meet.",
      "When Jacobs met Angela Olson, the tears welled.",
      "\"I have no idea what the Lord is doing. I think it's amazing that he brought our lives together. I never realized, even writing that letter, what it was doing, right? I just knew that your mom was a really great person and needed help,\" said Olson.",
      "As they marveled at the letter, they marveled at the moment.",
      "\"I think there's so many times in life that, like, people are brought into our lives, right, for a poor purpose, right, and a bigger purpose,\" said Jacobs.",
      "\"Yeah, she's actually the beginning of my journey with sobriety,\" said Olson.",
      "Olson knew the ropes when it came to jail; she was 20 years into her addiction.",
      "\"Never, all these years, my whole life, I never understood how to have, actually, emotions. It's like I was rejected in my life, betrayed by people, but yet understand how to have love or emotion, and just was so suppressed. And so then I ended up coming to Teen Challenge,\" Olson said.",
      "Now she's seven years sober and thriving as a manager at Minnesota Adult and Teen Challenge Recovery program. She spends her days sharing her story.",
      "Olson recalled that Lee \"just kept repeating herself.\" As a nurse herself, she had some experience with dementia.",
      "She marveled at the New York Times article with her letter in it.",
      "\"Just reading how Linde said, you know, she was easily diagnosed by inmates before any doctor diagnosed this condition. And I was just, thank you, Lord,\" Olson said. \"Thank you that something that I did would help this woman.\"",
      "Now, Jacobs has another partner in her fight to honor her mother and protect her daughters. She recently was invited to a gala in New York, with Anna Wintour of Vogue helping to lead fundraising.",

      "The new vaccine, mNexspike, is a step toward next-generation coronavirus vaccines. It's made in a way that allows for a lower dose - a fifth of the dose of its current COVID-19 vaccine, Spikevax - by refining its immune target.",
      "The approval \"adds an important new tool to help protect people at high risk of severe disease from COVID-19,\" Stephane Bancel, Moderna's CEO, said in a statement Saturday.",
      "The Food and Drug Administration approved the new vaccine for use in adults 65 and older and people age 12 to 64 who have at least one health condition that puts them at increased risk from the coronavirus.",

      "Moderna's existing vaccine doesn't face those limits and has long been used for anyone ages 6 months and older. The company said it expected to offer both options this fall.",
      "The FDA's approval was based on a study of 11,400 people age 12 and older that compared the new low-dose vaccine with Moderna's existing vaccine. It found the new vaccine was safe and was at least as effective - and more by some measures - than the original shot, the company said.",

    "summary": "\"This is a setback of probably a decade for HIV vaccine research,\" one scientist said.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration has moved to end funding for a broad swath of HIV vaccine research, saying current approaches are enough to counter the virus, multiple scientists and federal health officials say.",
      "Notifications that the funding would not be extended were relayed Friday to researchers, who were told by National Institutes of Health officials that the Department of Health and Human Services had elected \"to go with currently available approaches to eliminate HIV\" instead.",
      "The cuts will shutter two major HIV vaccine research efforts that were first funded by the NIH in 2012 at the Duke Human Vaccine Institute and the Scripps Research Institute, multiple scientists said. A spokesperson for Moderna said the vaccine manufacturer's clinical trials through the NIH's HIV Vaccine Trials Network have also been put on pause.",
      "One senior NIH official said the HHS had also instructed the agency not to issue any more funding in the next fiscal year for HIV vaccine research, with only a small handful of exceptions.",
      "A budgetary rule change specifically targeted at HIV vaccine research is also expected to lead to another cut to the NIH's awards for studies initiated by scientists, an official said.",
      "The change, to be finalized shortly, inflates the accounting for the upfront cost of studies into HIV vaccines funded by the agency. Instead of the cost of a five-year grant being spread out over five years, the NIH plans to make HIV vaccine dollars from multi-year grants all count toward a single year, the official said, making it harder for them to get funded.",
      "A spokesperson for HHS told CBS News that \"complex and duplicative health programs have resulted in serious duplication of efforts,\" saying that \"27 separate programs that address HIV/AIDS\" had spent $7.5 billion.",
      "\"The Administration believes the United States should have the best medical research in the world. To that end, we are advancing policies to maximize the impact of every federal taxpayer dollar and ensure proper oversight of this funding,\" HHS spokesperson Emily Hilliard said.",
      "Hilliard claimed \"critical HIV/AIDS programs will continue\" under the new agency that Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has proposed creating, dubbed the Administration for a Healthy America.",
      "\"For HIV vaccine design and development, we've begun to see light at the end of the tunnel after many years of research. This is a terrible time to cut it off. We're beginning to get close. We're getting good results out of clinical trials,\" said Dennis Burton, an immunology professor at Scripps Research.",
      "Burton warned that their HIV vaccine research could not simply be turned back on, even if a future administration decided to change course on HIV funding. He said ongoing experiments would be shuttered, and researchers assembled to study the issue would be forced to refocus their careers on other topics.",
      "\"This is a decision with consequences that will linger. This is a setback of probably a decade for HIV vaccine research,\" Burton said.",
      "The cancellation of the funds comes weeks ahead of the Food and Drug Administration's June 19 deadline for deciding on approval of lenacapavir, a twice-yearly injectable drug to prevent HIV.",
      "The drug, which is being brought to the commercial market by drugmaker Gilead Sciences, builds on NIH-backed research into earlier HIV medications. The drug's availability could lead to a significant drop in HIV cases worldwide, since a study found it was 100% effective in preventing transmission.",
      "An NIH official, who was not authorized to speak publicly, rebuked the claim that the effectiveness of current HIV prevention strategies meant a vaccine was no longer needed. \"The only way of ending the HIV epidemic in the U.S. and AIDS pandemic worldwide\" is with a vaccine, they said.",
      "Developing an effective HIV vaccine has been an elusive target for researchers, though scientists have hailed recent breakthroughs in the field.",
      "\"HIV has established roadblocks to us fighting it off, which are unparalleled in vaccinology. We've had to learn what each of the roadblocks are and to devise ways to overcome it. This virus mutates so quickly,\" said Duke professor of medicine Dr. Barton Ford Haynes, who is part of the Duke Human Vaccine Institute.",
      "Haynes said their work was essentially combining multiple different vaccines as part of their approach to designing an effective HIV vaccine.",
      "He praised lenacapavir as a \"wonderful development for the field,\" but said there was still a need for a vaccine. Lenacapavir requires injections every six months to remain effective, a challenging proposition even before steep cuts to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's domestic HIV programs and U.S.-backed HIV/AIDS foreign aid programs.",
      "\"The hope was that adding an HIV vaccine to all the preventive measures that we have would finally allow us to end the pandemic,\" Haynes said.",

      "\"Studies including hundreds of thousands of people around the world show that COVID-19 vaccination before and during pregnancy is safe, effective, and beneficial to both the pregnant woman and the baby.

      "The CDC also deleted a statement previously on the childhood immunization schedule that the guidance had been recommended by the committee, approved by the CDC and backed by a number of outside medical groups.",
      "So far, the CDC's changes echo what the committee had already been considering voting on next month: narrowing COVID-19 vaccine recommendations to only older adults and younger ages with risk factors, but still allowing for permissive coverage of others getting vaccinated.",
      "The CDC has used \"shared clinical decision-making\" guidance in the past to allow for federal requirements guaranteeing insurance coverage and access to some vaccines, while stopping short of full-throated recommendations for everyone eligible to get a shot.",

      "After investigating 50 of those travelers, the CDC was able to determine that measles spread during air travel in at least one of those situations, the spokesperson said. That is usually based on connecting confirmed cases of measles among airline passengers sitting near each other.",
      "There have also been numerous public alerts in recent months about the possible risk of exposure in airports, after travelers were found to be contagious. \"Exposures at the airport itself are more difficult to track, and state, local, and territorial health departments lead these investigations,\" the spokesperson said.",
      "In its Wednesday update, the CDC dropped its list of countries now facing \"high incidence\" of measles. Instead, the agency now warns only that the virus is \"an ongoing risk around the world, and more international travelers are getting infected.\"",
      "In addition to this year's record surge of the virus within the U.S., health authorities in neighboring Mexico and Canada have also reported large outbreaks of measles.",
      "The CDC also replaced a previous recommendation that Americans \"consider making alternative travel plans\" if they could not get vaccinated before departing, and now says travelers should \"consider postponing their trip.\"",
      "All travelers are recommended to be fully vaccinated for measles before going to any international destination. The CDC recently updated its guidance to doctors advising additional measles vaccines\u00a0for some domestic travelers as well.",

    "published": "Fri, 30 May 2025 05:00:00 -0400",
    "summary": "As state officials anticipate Medicaid funding cuts that could strip resources for those with disabilities and chronic health conditions, an army of unpaid caregivers waits in the wings: children.",
    "story": [
      "St. Paul, Minn. \u2014 High school senior Joshua Yang understands sacrifice. When he was midway through 10th grade, his mom survived a terrible car crash. But her body developed tremors, and she lost mobility. After countless appointments, doctors diagnosed her with Parkinson's disease, saying it was likely triggered by brain injuries sustained in the wreck.",
      "At 15, Yang, an aspiring baseball player and member of his school's debate team, took on a new role: his mother's caregiver.",
      "Researchers estimate that Yang, now 18, counted among at least 5.4 million U.S. children who provide care to an adult in their home. As state officials eye federal Medicaid funding cuts that could drastically reduce home care services for those who are disabled or have chronic health conditions, many predict that number will rise.",
      "That's bad news for kids: Studies show that when young people take on care for adults with medical conditions, their health and academic outcomes decline. At the same time, their loved ones receive untrained care.",
      "\"It all fell to me,\" said Yang, whose sisters were 9 and 10 at the time of their mom's accident, and whose stepdad worked nights. His grades fell and he quit after-school activities, he said, unable to spare the time.",
      "Early on, Yang found reprieve from a personal care nurse who gave them supplies, such as adult diapers, and advice on items to purchase, such as a chair for the shower. And for about a year, Yang was able to work for a personal care agency and earn $1,000 a month caring for his mom \u2014 money that went toward her medication and family needs.",
      "But at the beginning of 11th grade, a change to his mom's insurance ended her personal care benefit, sending him into a runaround with his county's Medicaid office in Minnesota. \"For a solid month I was on my phone, on hold, in the back of the class, waiting for the 'hello,'\" he said. \"I'd be in third period, saying, 'Mr. Stepan, can I step out?'\"",
      "A report published in May by the U.S. Government Accountability Office reminded states that National Family Caregiver Support Program grants can be used to assist caregivers under 18. However, the future of those grants remains unclear: They are funded through the Older Americans Act, which is awaiting reauthorization; and the Administration for Community Living, which oversees the grants, was nearly halved in April as part of the reorganization of the Department of Health and Human Services under President Trump.",
      "Additionally, if Congress approves proposed cuts to Medicaid, one of the first casualties likely will be states' home- and community-based service programs that provide critical financial relief to family caregivers, said Andrew Olenski, an economist at Lehigh University specializing in long-term health care.",
      "Such programs, which differ by state but are paid for with federal dollars, are designed to ensure that Medicaid-eligible people in need of long-term care can continue living at home by covering in-home personal and nursing care. In 2021, they served almost 5% of all Medicaid participants, costing about $158 billion.",
      "By law, Medicaid is required to cover necessary long-term care in a nursing home setting but not all home or community care programs. So, if states are forced to make cuts, those programs are vulnerable to being scaled back or eliminated.",
      "If an aide who makes daily home visits, for example, is no longer an option, family caregivers could step in, Olenski said. But he pointed out that not all patients have adult children to care for them, and not all adult children can afford to step away from the workforce. And that could put more pressure on any kids at home.",
      "\"These things tend to roll downhill,\" Olenski said.",
      "Some studies show benefits to young people who step into caregiving roles, such as more self-confidence and improved family relationships. Yang said he feels more on top of things than his peers: \"I have friends worrying about how to land a job interview, while I've already applied to seven or eight other jobs.\"",
      "But for many, the cost is steep. Young caregivers report more depression, anxiety, and stress than their peers. Their physical health tends to be worse, too, related to diet and lack of attention to their own care. And caregiving often becomes a significant drag on their education: A large study found that 15- to 18-year-old caregivers spent, on average, 42 fewer minutes per day on educational activities and 31 fewer minutes in class than their peers.",
      "Schools in several states are taking notice. In Colorado, a statewide survey recently included its first question about caregiving and found that more than 12% of high schoolers provide care for someone in their home who is chronically ill, elderly, or disabled.",
      "Rhode Island's education department now requires every middle and high school to craft a policy to support caregiving students after a study published in 2023 found 29% of middle and high school students report caring for a younger or older family member for part of the day, and 7% said the role takes up most of their day. Rates were higher for Hispanic, Asian, and Black students than their white peers.",
      "The results floored Lindsey Tavares, principal of Apprenticeship Exploration School, a charter high school in Cranston. Just under half her students identified as caregivers, she said. That awareness has changed conversations when students' grades slip or the kids stop showing up on time or at all.",
      "\"We know now that this is a question we should be asking directly,\" she said.",
      "Students have shared stories of staying home to care for an ill sibling when a parent needs to work, missing school to translate doctors' appointments, or working nights to pitch in financially, she said. Tavares and her team see it as their job to find an approach to help students persist. That might look like connecting the student to resources outside the school, offering mental health support, or working with a teacher to keep a student caught up.",
      "\"We can't always solve their problem,\" Tavares said. \"But we can be really realistic about how we can get that student to finish high school.\"",
      "Rhode Island officials believe their state is the first to officially support caregiving students \u2014 work they're doing in partnership with the Florida-based American Association for Caregiving Youth. In 2006, the association formed the Caregiving Youth Project, which works with schools to provide eligible students with peer group support, medical care training, overnight summer camp, and specialists tuned in to each student's specific needs. This school year, more than 700 middle and high school students took part.",
      "\"For kids, it's important for them to know they're not alone,\" said Julia Belkowitz, a pediatrician and an associate professor at the University of Miami who has studied student caregivers. \"And for the rest of us, it's important, as we consider policies, to know who's really doing this work.\"",
      "In St. Paul, Joshua Yang had hoped to study civil engineering at the University of Minnesota, but decided instead to attend community college in the fall, where his schedule will make it simpler to continue living at home and caring for his mom.",
      "But he sees some respite on the horizon as his sisters, now 12 and 13, prepare to take on a greater share of the caregiving. They're \"actual people\" now with personalities and a sense of responsibility, he said with a laugh.",
      "\"It's like, we all know that we're the most meaningful people in our mom's life, so let's all help out,\" he said.",

      "They're all over your social media timeline and dangling from bags on the street, prompting some consumers to stand in long lines outside stores: small plush charms called Labubus that have created a global sensation, with prices skyrocketing to over $1,000 for rare designs on resale sites like StockX amid overwhelming demand.",
      "Labubu, pronounced \"lah-boo-boo,\" first appeared in 2015 and has exploded in popularity recently. The toy creatures can be described as kind of scary looking but also kind of cute.",
      "What is a Labubu?",
      "Artist Kasing Lung from Hong Kong introduced Labubu as literary characters from his book \"The Monsters Trilogy\" before the figure transformed into a worldwide collecting sensation via retailer Pop Mart's randomized packaging strategy.",
      "These toys, featuring sharp-eared designs and mischievous expressions, also now appearing prominently on secondary markets.",
      "The accessories, made by Chinese retailer Pop Mart, have been spotted on celebrities including Rihanna, Blackpink's Lisa and Dua Lipa. Actress Hilary Duff has also been photographed sporting the trendy charms.",
      "The collectibles are sold in mystery boxes and come in hundreds of different varieties, meaning buyers don't know which specific Labubu they'll receive. This element of surprise has contributed to their popularity and collectible value.",
      "The figurines have become highly sought-after merchandise among younger adult consumers. Some rare variants currently sell for more than $1,000 through digital marketplaces. Social media campaigns on TikTok and Instagram, combined with restricted production runs and surprise releases, have driven consumer interest.",
      "Demand has become so intense that TikTok users have reported having their Labubus stolen directly from their bags.",
      "\"Someone stole my Labubu off my purse yesterday, it got literally snatched from my purse, and I didn't even know it,\" one user said in a video. \"She's holding a little knife, like, you know, this pocket knife where you could just slash something off. She was literally holding it, and it was aimed at my Labubu.\"",
      "The theft concerns have prompted warnings among collectors.",
      "The popularity has extended internationally. In Britain, consumers have gone to extreme lengths to obtain the plush dolls, with reports of crowd shoving and fighting in long lines waiting for the collectible. The distributor has since halted in-store sales across the UK, though online purchases remain available.",

      "Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social that he and Xi spoke for 90 minutes and addressed a number of outstanding issues surrounding a temporary truce reached on May 12 that was meant to alleviate the escalating trade war between the two countries. He said the conversation \"was focused almost entirely on TRADE\" and \"resulted in a very positive conclusion for both Countries.\"",
      "Under the\u00a0May 12 deal, the U.S. agreed to reduce tariffs on Chinese goods to around 30% from 145%, while China reduced its levies on American imports to 10%. The 90-day accord was meant to give both sides breathing room to strike a broader agreement, but talks soon stalled.",
      "Last week, Mr. Trump\u00a0accused\u00a0China of violating the May 12 deal. U.S. officials have said China is withholding some products, including rare earth minerals, that it agreed to resume exporting under the agreement. Earlier this week, China\u00a0said\u00a0the U.S. is undermining the deal by imposing new export control guidelines on AI chips and planning to revoke Chinese student visas.",
      "In his post after Thursday's call with Xi, Mr. Trump said there \"should no longer be any questions respecting the complexity of Rare Earth products.\" He said high-level talks between U.S. and Chinese officials would resume \"shortly at a location to be determined,\" and that the U.S. would be represented by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer.",
      "The president echoed his statement in remarks to reporters at the White House later in the day. \"I think we're in very good shape with China and the trade deal. We have a deal with China, as you know, but we were straightening out some of the points, having to do mostly with rare earths, magnets and other things,\" he said.",
      "The U.S. president also said Xi invited him and first lady Melania Trump to China, and Mr. Trump in turn invited Xi to the U.S. \"As Presidents of two Great Nations, this is something that we both look forward to doing,\" Mr. Trump wrote. He clarified later that he intends to take Xi up on his invitation and travel to China.",
      "The Chinese Embassy in Washington said the two leaders spoke at Mr. Trump's request. The Chinese summary of the meeting said, in part: \"Recalibrating the direction of the giant ship of China-U.S. relations requires the two Presidents to take the helm and set the right course. It is particularly important to steer clear of the various disturbances and disruptions. The two countries' lead officials recently held economic and trade talks in Geneva, which marked an important step forward in resolving the relevant issues through dialogue and consultation.\"",
      "On \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday, Bessent said he was expecting the two leaders to resolve their issues when they spoke.",
      "\"I am confident that when President Trump and party Chairman Xi have a call, that this will be ironed out,\" Bessent said, referring to the dispute over rare earth minerals.",

    "story": [
      "Four-and-a-half months after launch atop a Falcon 9 rocket, a privately-built Japanese moon lander is finally in position for a descent to touchdown Thursday. It comes two years after the company's first lander ran out of gas and crashed to the lunar surface.",
      "The Resilience lander, carrying cameras, a few scientific instruments and a tiny rover, was expected to drop out of a 62-mile-high orbit and touch down at 3:17 p.m. EDT near the center of Mare Frigoris \u2014 the Sea of Cold \u2014 in the moon's northern hemisphere at 60 degrees north latitude.",
      "\"For Mission 2, our second attempt at landing on the moon, we will not only land the Resilience lander, but we will also use a mechanism to deploy the Tenacious rover, which we developed in house, to explore the lunar surface,\" Ryo Ujiie, chief technology officer of ispace, the lander's builder, said on the company's web page.",
      "\"Tenacious will explore the lunar surface, deploy a customer payload and collect regolith. Resilience will continue to operate the customer payloads on board and transmit valuable telemetry data to our mission control center.\"",
      "The customer payload is a tiny model of a Swedish house, designed by artist Mikael Genberg. The traditionally styled red-and-white house measures just 4.7 inches long and 4 inches high and weighs just 3.5 ounces.",
      "Asked why he took on the project, which required years of planning, fund-raising and engineering, Genberg said \"we have done as human beings things from time to time that (do not) seemingly have a purpose beyond just being creative.\"",
      "\"The Eiffel Tower, for instance, I mean it's a stupid thing to build,\" he said. \"Today, it has a purpose as maybe the most important thing to make Paris the most visited city in the world.\"",
      "While the \"moonhouse\" will survive for thousands if not millions of years in the airless environment of the moon, its custom paint will fade in the sun's harsh radiation and lunar dust will slowly coat its surface. Genberg joked that he would happily await an invitation to repaint it.",
      "The house will be dropped from the rover a few days after landing, and the team hopes to capture photos with Earth in the background. The cost of the project was not disclosed, but a spokesman said it was similar to what one might pay for a relatively large house on Earth.",
      "ispace is one of a handful of companies attempting to provide non-government transportation services to the moon for a variety of payloads ranging from science instruments to technology demonstrations.",
      "But as it turns out, getting low-cost spacecraft to the moon's surface is extremely difficult.",
      "ispace tried and\u00a0failed in 2023\u00a0when its first lander ran out of propellant nearing the surface, dropping to a \"hard\" crash landing. Pittsburgh-based Astrobotic Technology launched its\u00a0Peregrine lander in January 2024, but the spacecraft suffered a propulsion system leak and never made it to the moon.",
      "Houston-based Intuitive Machines successfully put two landers down on the lunar surface\u00a0in 2024\u00a0and again\u00a0earlier this year, but both spacecraft tipped over on touchdown. While each one survived its landing, neither was able to accomplish all of its pre-flight objectives.",
      "Before Thursday, only one company, Austin-based Firefly Aerospace, had successfully touched down and carried out its mission, landing the\u00a0Blue Ghost spacecraft on March 2, 53 years after the final Apollo mission.",
      "Resilience and Blue Ghost\u00a0were launched atop a single SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket on Jan. 15. The Blue Ghost lander took a direct route to the moon and carried out a successful touchdown, operating for a full two-week lunar \"day.\"",
      "Resilience followed a longer, low-energy trajectory that carried it well past its target, using the moon's gravity to bring it back to an initially elliptical orbit and finally, using its thrusters, to the 100-kilometer (62-mile) circular orbit that set the stage for descent.",

    "published": "Thu, 05 Jun 2025 10:41:52 -0400",
    "summary": "President Trump is putting a political spotlight on autopens, machines that have been used for decades by presidents, writers and more.",
    "story": [
      "The autopen \u2014 a machine first patented centuries ago \u2014 is having a moment in the political spotlight, following\u00a0 allegations made by President Trump that former President Biden used one to sign pardons.",
      "That's prompting questions about what autopens do, how they work and why the device is now stirring up controversy. The devices use pens or other writing instruments to place a person's signature on documents, books or other papers, such as in the case of a college president, for example, who would otherwise be required to sign hundreds or thousands of diplomas for graduating students by hand.",
      "Mr. Trump raised the issue in March when he claimed Mr. Biden's alleged use of an autopen to sign preemptive pardons to members of the House select committee that investigated the Jan. 6, 2021,\u00a0assault on the U.S. Capitol\u00a0rendered them \"void\" and \"vacant.\"",
      "Mr. Trump raised the issue again on Wednesday, when he posted on Truth Social, \"With the exception of the RIGGED PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION OF 2020, THE AUTOPEN IS THE BIGGEST POLITICAL SCANDAL IN AMERICAN HISTORY!!!\"",
      "The autopen has also become a focus of the right-leaning Heritage Foundation's Oversight Project, which claims that Mr. Biden's alleged use of an autopen given his \"clear cognitive decline ... raises additional questions for investigators.\"",
      "Regardless of the allegations, the autopen is hardly a novel device for the political sphere, with the Shapell Manuscript Foundation noting that one of the devices was bought by Thomas Jefferson soon after it was patented in 1803. Throughout U.S. history, presidents have relied on autopens, although the Shapell Manuscript Foundation notes that some commanders-in-chief have been guarded about their use of the machine.",
      "\"Whereas once the official White House position was to deny the existence or usage of the autopen, today its existence is more of an open secret,\" the foundation notes.",
      "A spokesperson for Mr. Biden didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "What is an autopen?",
      "An autopen, also called a robot pen, is a machine that automates a person's signature with a pen or other writing instrument, versus a scanned signature, which is a digital image of a signature.",
      "Unlike people, the machine will never get writer's cramp, and can replicate a person's signature on high volumes of letters, certificates, diplomas and other documents, according to Automated Signature Technology, an autopen manufacturer.",
      "Its Ghostwriter machine uses a smart card or USB flash drive to store signatures and phrases that can be replicated on paper. The company's machines \"write at human speed ... to produce quality handwriting reproductions,\" Automated Signature Technology says.",
      "The Ghostwriter can use any type of writing instrument, from a ballpoint pen to crayons, and can write on a variety of materials with different thicknesses, it added.",
      "Another autopen manufacturer, the Autopen Company, said its machines can be used for \"signing certificates, correspondence, photographs and posters, almost anything up to 1/4 inch thick. Factory modifications can be incorporated for signing books and sports memorabilia.\"",
      "One site that sells autopens says that high-end machines used by governments can cost\u00a0between $5,000 to $20,000 each.",
      "Neither the Autopen Company nor Automated Signature Technology immediately responded to requests for comment from CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Have other presidents used autopens?",
      "Yes. President Johnson even allowed the autopen to be photographed in the White House. The photo appeared in The National Enquirer with a 1968 article titled, \"The Robot That Sits in for the President,\" according to the Shapell Manuscript Foundation.",
      "Other presidents who have relied on autopens include John F. Kennedy and Barack Obama, among others. Presidents have typically used an autopen to sign routine correspondence to constituents, like letters recognizing life milestones, as well as legislation and pardons.",
      "During the Gerald Ford administration, the president and First Lady Betty Ford occasionally signed documents and other correspondence by hand, but White House staff more often used autopen machines to reproduce their signatures on letters and photographs.",
      "Mr. Trump has also used an autopen, telling reporters on Air Force One in March that he'd used the device \"only for very unimportant papers.\"",
      "\"You know, we get thousands and thousands of letters, letters of support for young people, from people that aren't feeling well, etcetera. But to sign pardons and all of the things that he signed with an autopen is disgraceful,\" Mr. Trump said at the time, in reference to his claims former President Biden used the technology to sign pardons.",
      "President George W. Bush asked the Justice Department in 2005 if it was constitutional to use an autopen to sign a bill, with the department concluding that \"the president need not personally perform the physical act of affixing his signature to a bill he approves and decides to sign in order for the bill to become law.",

    "story": [
      "Older Americans are filing for Social Security benefits at a record rate this year, a surge that could reflect growing anxiety about the stability of the retirement system amid cutbacks under the Trump administration, experts say.",
      "The number of people claiming Social Security jumped 17% to 1.8 million this year through May compared with the same period a year ago, according to the most recent data from the Social Security Administration. For the federal fiscal year, new filings are on track to reach 4 million, up 15% from the prior fiscal year, the Urban Institute said in a new analysis of claims data.",
      "The spike in early benefits claims comes as the Trump administration has slashed jobs\u00a0and made other changes at the Social Security Administration, an agency already struggling to provide services to the nearly 70 million retirees, disabled people and survivors of deceased workers who rely on the program.",
      "These developments are likely prompting the surge in new filings, as well as an increase in calls and in-person visits to Social Security offices since January, the Urban Institute said.",
      "Although Mr. Trump has vowed not to touch Social Security, his administration is has cut\u00a0the agency's staffing to 50,000 workers, down from its current level of about 57,000 workers. The agency's workforce has been shrinking for years, with the AARP noting that the Social Security Administration had 63,000 workers in 2015.",
      "Even as its workforce shrinks, the Social Security Administration is serving more people, with the number of beneficiaries rising 19% from about 59 million people in 2015 to about 70 million today, its data shows.",
      "\"I have attended several town halls around the country, and many people have asked if they should claim benefits early given Trump and [Elon] Musk's interference in the system,\" Max Richtman, president of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, an advocacy group for the two retirement programs, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "He added, \"People are scared, and they're not sure what to do.\"",
      "To be sure, Americans have long held concerns about the stability of the Social Security system. Because the agency is paying out more in benefits than it's taking in through payroll taxes due to the nation's aging demographics, the program is currently dipping into its trust fund to pay beneficiaries.",
      "Without changes to the program, the trust fund is slated to be depleted in 2035, which will trigger a benefits cut of about 20%, the agency has forecast.",
      "An aging society",
      "Other factors could be driving the increase in early Social Security filings, the Urban Institute said. For one, the baby boomer generation is hitting \"peak 65\" as a record number of people hit retirement age, although that demographic shift isn't enough to entirely explain this year's surge in claims, the think tank noted.",
      "Another cause could be the Social Security Fairness Act, which provides more retirement benefits to public servants such as teachers, firefighters and police officers, and could encourage more people to file, the Urban analysis said.",
      "The Social Security Administration didn't respond to a request for comment.",
      "Frank Bisignano, the agency's new commissioner, told CBS News last month that the program will be able to provide services to beneficiaries despite the staffing cuts \"through technology and process engineering.\"",
      "He added, \"Everybody is committed to Social Security for the rest of time.\"",
      "The downside to claiming early",
      "The agency is receiving more early claims from higher-income Americans, especially at age 62, which is the earliest age at which a worker can start receiving their monthly Social Security benefits, the Urban Institute said.",
      "But there's a major cost to claiming at 62. While it might seem prudent to claim early if you're worried Social Security won't be around in a few years \u2014 something that experts say is extremely unlikely \u2014 the tradeoff is a permanently lower monthly benefit.",
      "People who claim Social Security benefits at 62 receive about\u00a030% less\u00a0in their monthly checks than if they wait until they turn 67, which is currently the program's full retirement age. Older Americans can collect even greater benefits if they delay filing past their full retirement age, getting an extra 24% boost to their monthly check if they wait until they turn 70.",
      "Because of that math, Richtman said his group recommends holding off on claiming, even though people might be fearful about the program's health.",
      "\"Their concern is understandable. But we advise workers not to claim early out of fear, because filing for Social Security before full retirement age results in a lifetime reduction in benefits,\" he said.",

      "The Seattle, Washington-based airline said it wouldn't immediately accept delivery of two Embraer 175 regional jets in order to avoid incurring the extra tariff-related costs. The aircraft were meant to serve Horizon Air, a regional subsidiary of Alaska Airlines.",
      "President Trump's tariff agenda has upended\u00a0supply chains for a range of businesses, and has forced many companies to raise prices on consumers in order to protect their margins. The aviation industry has also warned that the levies will affect its business.",

    "published": "Thu, 05 Jun 2025 06:51:42 -0400",
    "summary": "The 50% steel and aluminum tariffs could lead to higher prices on everything from cars to home and office supplies.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration on Wednesday officially\u00a0raised tariffs on aluminum and steel to 50%, a move experts say could increase costs on everything from homes and cars to household items and office supplies.",
      "While the U.S. has carved out its own niche in domestic metals manufacturing, it also relies on imports from abroad to fill in the gaps: America imported 26.2 million metric tons of steel and 5.4 million metric tons of aluminum\u00a0from abroad last year, according to the International Trade Administration. Canada serves as the biggest foreign source for both metals.",
      "The White House has been aggressively trying to pare back on America's reliance on foreign nations,\u00a0imposing 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum\u00a0in February, citing\u00a0national security concerns. President Trump, during a visit to a U.S. Steel mill in Pittsburgh on May 30, announced he was\u00a0doubling down on that rate, raising the 25% levies to 50%. The higher tariffs went into effect Wednesday at 12:01 a.m. EST.",
      "While the new tariffs have won over some of the nation's largest steel makers, who saw huge gains in share prices following Mr. Trump's May 30 announcement, experts say the levies will raise cost of manufacturing on a wide range of products, making many items more expensive to buy. That's because businesses typically pass on most or all of tariff-related costs to consumers\u00a0through higher prices, according to economists.",
      "\"That will hurt the people working in those industries and put their jobs under stress,\" said Wayne Winegarden, a senior fellow and director at the Pacific Research Institute, a right-leaning think tank. \"And it also is going to put pressure on consumers, because those prices are going to increase.\"",
      "While some businesses may ultimately choose to absorb some of those increased costs, experts say others are likely to pass some of them along to customers \u2014 as was the case\u00a0in 2018 when tariffs on steel and aluminum tariffs were introduced by the first Trump administration.",
      "Here are some of the consumer categories that could get pricier with the new 50% steel and aluminum tariffs now in effect.",
      "Cars",
      "Automobile manufacturers are likely to feel the burn of higher tariffs, as they rely heavily on steel and aluminum for car production. The materials are found throughout the body and structure of a car, in everything from the car's frame to engine parts to the hub caps, pipes and bumpers. According to Jay Cushing, senior bond analyst with Gimme Credit, steel accounts for 60% of the weight of the average vehicle.",
      "Dean Baker, senior economist at The Center For Economic and Policy Research, told CBS MoneyWatch there is about $800 worth of steel in each vehicle. With that figure in mind, he projected a 50% tariff would drive up the cost of a car by around $400.",
      "Cushing, however, projects an even steeper price hike. \"A doubling of tariffs from 25% to 50% could raise the cost of a car from $1,500 to $3,000 per vehicle,\" he told CBS MoneyWatch in an email.",
      "A 25% tariff on imported cars remains in place, although the Trump administration has\u00a0softened industry tariffs\u00a0to ensure automakers aren't hit twice with the additional import duty on imported steel and aluminum. \"The metal tariffs should apply only once per vehicle,\" Cushing said.",
      "Sports equipment",
      "Athletes may also notice a slight uptick in prices when shopping for new equipment such as baseball bats, tennis rackets and lacrosse sticks which sometimes contain aluminum. Industry experts say they're already seeing price increases on aluminum bats, which are fairly expensive to begin with: upwards of $100 in many cases, with higher-end models running as high as $400.",
      "Those higher price tags could end up creating negative repercussions for sports participation. The Sports & Fitness Industry Association, which tracks industry data, has consistently found that the lowest household income brackets are most negatively impacted in terms of sports participation.",
      "\"If we're going to continue to increase costs on equipment, then those lower income level households are going to continue to be left on the sideline in terms of literally and figuratively,\" said Todd Smith, president and CEO of the Sports & Fitness Industry Association.",
      "Beer and soda cans",
      "Whether it be beer, soda or seltzer, any beverages that come in a can will likely cost Americans more after the steel and aluminum tariffs take effect.",
      "This could lead major name-brand businesses to shift their strategy. Back in February, the CEO of Coca-Cola James Quincey said if aluminum cans become more expensive, the company would put more emphasis on plastic bottles. The soda giant sources aluminum for its cans from Canada, Quincey said on a February company earnings call.",
      "Canned goods and packaged grocery items",
      "Another place where Americans might feel a slight pinch is at the grocery store. Nonperishables that come in aluminum or steel cans \u2014 think beans, chickpeas, and soups \u2014 are typically thought of as a way for shoppers to economize. But the steel and aluminum tariffs could ratchet up the price of canned goods.",
      "Robert Budway, president of the Can Manufacturers Institute,\u00a0told the Associated Press that manufacturers have become increasingly reliant on imported materials in recent years and that it's American families who will most likely bear the increased tariff costs.",
      "Baker, the economist from The Center For Economic and Policy Research, didn't have an exact estimate but said the increase to the cost of canned goods would be fairly low. \"If you get $2 can of soup, maybe it would go up a cent or two,\" he said.",
      "There could be indirect price increases at the grocery store as well. Many packaged goods are made using machines with steel and aluminum machines, Baker said, meaning products like cookies could get more expensive.",
      "Household appliances/supplies",
      "A wide range of appliances from dishwashers and dryers to garbage disposals and air conditioners all stand to become pricier as a result of the Trump administration's 50% steel and aluminum tariffs.",
      "The Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers did not respond to CBS MoneyWatch's request for comment, but has said in the past that they strongly support an \"integrated North American market\" and have\u00a0called for \"common-sense\" trade policies.",
      "\"It can go from the grandiose of a washing machine and a car, to the trivial, like a staple or a paper clip,\" said Winegarden at the Pacific Research Institute.",
      "Lawn mowers could also see price hikes. Baker estimates that a lawn mower that goes for $250mightcost $255 after the tariffs take effect.",
      "\"Will people notice that? Some will, some won't,\" he said. \"But there's no doubt the direction is higher \u2014 the question is how much.\"",
      "Homes",
      "Building materials could also be impacted, which will ultimately translate to higher home prices.",
      "In an April blog post, Realtor.com documented how the price of nails used in homebuilding has already started to increase due to tariffs. A single box of coil roofing nails could go from $65 to $325, the real estate platform predicted at the time.",
      "Other products used in home construction like steel fasteners could also get caught in the crosshairs of the tariffs. This bodes poorly for the housing sector \u2014 which is already facing pressure from high prices, steep mortgage rates and lack of inventory.",
      "\"President Trump's move to double steel and aluminum tariffs will have a negative impact on housing affordability by further disrupting building material supply chains and fueling business uncertainty,\" said Buddy Hughes, chairman of the National Association of Home Builders.",
      "Before the new 50% tariffs were introduced, the trade association estimated that tariff activity would add roughly $10,900 to the average cost of a new home.",

      "Payments are going to public pension holders\u00a0 previously barred from collecting full benefits under the federal retirement program due to two federal policies: the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) and Government Pension Offset (GPO). The Social Security Fairness Act ended these provisions, opening the door for millions to receive retroactive payments dating back to January 2024. December 2023 was the last month the WEP and GPO applied, according to the SSA.",

      "Although such credit arrangements can help consumers afford an item in the short term, some BNPL loans can carry interest changes and fees, potentially leading consumers to rack up debt. According to LendingTree, 41% of customers who have used a BNPL loan say they have made a late payment in the past year, up from 34% the year prior. And while most lenders don't charge interest, they do charge late fees for missed payments, which can add up over time.",
      "Despite such risks, BNPL loans have exploded in popularity, including for modest transactions. For example, Klarna in March partnered with food delivery service DoorDash to offer a BNPL plan that consumers can use to pay for meal and grocery deliveries. DoorDash said it was launching the service to let customers postpone payment to \"a more convenient time, such as a date that aligns with their paycheck.\"",
      "LendingTree chief consumer finance analyst Matt Schulz said BNPL loan providers make it easy for customers to use them for a wide range of purchases. \"They give people more options, which can be good if it's managed well,\" he told CBS News' Kelly O'Grady.",
      "At the same time, the growing number of Americans using the loans to buy food \"clearly shows that there are a lot of people who are struggling with high costs at the grocery store and elsewhere, and who are looking for whatever ways they can find to help them make ends meet a little easier,\" Schulz said.",
      "\"If you make a bunch of purchases with a credit card, you're just making one payment at the end of the month,\" he added. \"But if you get a bunch of different BNPL loans, it can be a challenge to manage them. That's especially true if you're on a tight budget without a lot of wiggle room, and you're inexperienced with managing payments.\"",
      "LendingTree survey data shows that about one in four BNPL users say they've had at least three active BNPL loans at one time.",
      "\"That speaks to how easy these are to get and how easy it is to overspend on them,\" Schulz said.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump's sweeping tariff plan would cut deficits by $2.8 trillion over a 10-year period while shrinking the economy, raising the inflation rate and reducing the purchasing power of households overall, according to an analysis released Wednesday by the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "The numbers were revealed in a letter sent to Democratic congressional leadership outlining how the Trump administration's plan to impose wide-ranging tariffs on countries around the world will affect American households.",
      "Baked into the CBO analysis is a prediction that households would ultimately buy less from the countries hit with added tariffs. The budget office estimates that the tariffs would increase the average annual rate of inflation by 0.4 percentage points in 2025 and 2026.",
      "The budget office's model also assumes that the tariffs, announced through executive action between January and May, will be in place permanently. \"If the Administration makes additional changes to tariffs, the budget baseline will be adjusted to reflect the budgetary implications of those changes as they take effect,\" CBO Director Phillip Swagel wrote.",
      "Since the analysis was conducted, a federal court struck down sweeping tariffs that Mr. Trump invoked under an emergency-powers law. An appeals court allowed the Trump administration to continue collecting the tariffs while the case goes through appeals.",
      "Largely confirming what other economic models have predicted, the CBO's estimations show that the tradeoff for a $2.8 trillion deficit reduction over 10 years would be an overall reduction in household wealth. In addition, the tariffs would shrink the economy, or reduce the rate of the gross domestic product by 0.06 percentage points per year.",
      "The Penn-Wharton Budget Model's April report predicted that the Republican president's tariffs would reduce long-run GDP by about 6% and wages by 5%.",
      "A major caveat of the CBO's estimates is written into the report \u2014 its estimates are \"subject to significant uncertainty, in part because the Administration could change how the tariff policies are administered.\"",
      "The evaluation also does not appear to take into account any impact from Mr. Trump's massive tax and budget bill currently being debated in Congress. The CBO released another estimate earlier Tuesday showing that the legislation would increase deficits by a total of roughly $2.4 trillion over 10 years. White House have argued that any deficit increase caused by the \"one big, beautiful bill\" would be offset by the \"reciprocal\" tariff plans, and touted the CBO's new analysis on Tuesday.",
      "Mr. Trump has often announced changes and pauses to his tariff plans on his social media platform.",
      "In April, he posted that he was backing off his tariffs on most nations for 90 days and jacking up the tax rate on Chinese imports to 125%.",
      "Last week, he announced plans to hike the tariffs on steel and aluminum imports to a punishing 50%, a move that's set to hammer businesses and likely push up prices for consumers even further. The 50% tariffs went into effect Wednesday.",
      "The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development forecast Tuesday that the U.S. economy, the world's largest, will slow growth to just 1.5% in 2026.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 Republicans' sweeping policy bill aimed at advancing President Trump's second-term agenda would increase annual budget deficits by a total of $2.4 trillion over the next decade, according to a new estimate prepared by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.",
      "The CBO also estimates that 10.9 million more people would be without health insurance in 2034 as the result of the House-passed legislation, mostly due to cuts to Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act under the bill.",
      "House Republicans are aiming to cut at least $1.5 trillion in spending to offset trillions in tax cuts, while also raising the debt ceiling by $4 trillion. The CBO projection puts the spending cuts at about $1.2 trillion over the next decade, with the tax cuts totaling just under $3.7 trillion. The national debt currently stands at roughly $36 trillion, according to the Treasury Department.",
      "The package, which Mr. Trump and Republican lawmakers refer to as the \"one big, beautiful bill,\" is now in the hands of the Senate after making it out of the House before Memorial Day. The bill is expected to undergo changes in the Senate before heading back to the lower chamber.",
      "Though Republicans vowed to protect Medicaid benefits and have framed cuts to the program as trimming \"waste, fraud and abuse,\" the analysis found that the portion of the bill dealing with Medicaid would mean 7.8 million fewer people being enrolled in the safety net program. Federal spending on Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act would be reduced by $902 billion over a decade.",
      "Another 1.3 million people would be without insurance due to changes in the Affordable Care Act. The bill would also eliminate state-funded insurance for 1.4 million people \"without verified citizenship, nationality, or satisfactory immigration status,\" the CBO said.",
      "Medicaid, a popular entitlement program, provides government-sponsored health care for more than 70 million low-income adults, children and people with disabilities. The House bill includes new work requirements that would apply to childless Medicaid recipients without disabilities between the ages of 19 and 64, more frequent eligibility checks and changes to how states can finance their share of the costs of the program.",
      "Cuts to federal food assistance programs, which includes Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, would save more than $294 billion over 10 years, according to the analysis. House Republicans plan to achieve the savings by requiring states to cover a share of the costs to provide benefits that help low-income individuals and families pay for groceries and by expanding work requirements.",
      "About 42 million people benefited from SNAP, also known as food stamps, in fiscal year 2023, with recipients receiving an average of $211 each month in benefits, according to the Department of Agriculture.",
      "House Republican leadership dismissed the CBO's findings Wednesday morning, arguing that it ignores economic growth that will stem from their policies.",
      "\"This bill will actually reduce the deficit if you recognize the historical economical growth that has always been there,\" House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, a Louisiana Republican, said Wednesday.",
      "House Speaker Mike Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, also pushed back on the uninsured estimate, telling reporters later Wednesday, \"We're not buying the CBO estimates.\"",
      "\"The primary emphasis is on the work requirements,\" he said. \"That's the largest pool of people that they claim will be affected, and the minimal work requirement is 20 hours a week. Volunteer in your community, get a job or do a job training.\"",

Even at the reduced rate, some businesses say the levies would make importing Chinese-made goods prohibitively expensive.",
      "Dollar Tree CEO Mike Creedon said in an earnings call with Wall Street analysts on Wednesday that he expects the tariffs to hurt the company's earnings in the near-term.",
      "\"We are actively engaged on multiple fronts to mitigate the impact of inflationary cost pressures including tariffs,\" he added, while acknowledging that \"the tariff landscape is highly fluid and changing week to week.\"",

      "Consisting of a white-flour tortilla filled with chicken, shredded lettuce and cheese, the Snack Wrap was introduced nearly two decades ago.

    "story": [
      "A Republican-backed budget package includes a new restriction for the federal Child Tax Credit that could strip the benefit from millions of children who are U.S. citizens or legal residents, according to policy experts.",
      "The proposed tax and spending legislation \u2014 which proponents have dubbed the \"one big, beautiful bill\" \u2014 includes a\u00a0requirement that both a tax filer and the person's spouse have Social Security numbers to claim the Child Tax Credit, or CTC, for their kids. That means children with mixed-status parents, such as one parent who is a U.S. citizen and the second who is not, would no longer qualify for the tax credit, said Carl Davis, the research director of nonpartisan tax research group ITEP.",
      "Children who are born in the U.S., making them American citizens, but whose parents are undocumented would also be barred from the CTC. In some cases, one or both parents of a child who is authorized to be in the U.S. may lack a Social Security numbers. For example, parents who are in the U.S. on non-working visas, such as graduate students on education visas, would be prohibited from receiving the tax credit.",
      "The proposed restriction is part of a push by Republican lawmakers to ensure that tax breaks aren't going to undocumented immigrants. But the new policies would have the secondary effect of denying a tax credit to millions of children in the U.S. who currently qualify for the benefit, policy experts told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "The CTC, which now amounts to $2,000 per eligible child and has been shown to lift children out of poverty, currently requires that each kid has a valid Social Security number, but not their parents.",
      "Republicans say the bill would benefit families by boosting the CTC to $2,500 for three years, and then adjusting the tax credit each year for inflation so its value doesn't erode over time.",
      "A spokesperson for the Republican members of the congressional panel didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "In May, \"Working families, farmers and small businesses win with this bill,\" House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Jason Smith, a Republican from Missouri, said last month from the House floor. \"We expand and make permanent the small business deduction, and increase the Child Tax Credit, the standard deduction and the Death Tax exemption.\"",
      "He added, \"President Trump stopped the flow of illegal immigrants over our borders \u2014 this bill will stop the flow of taxpayer benefits to their pockets.\"",
      "4.5 million kids could be affected",
      "Most undocumented immigrants are already blocked from receiving most federal tax benefits, according to the Brookings Institution. The GOP tax bill could instead eliminate tax breaks for many immigrants who are in the U.S. legally, such as refugees or people on educational visas, the think tank said in a recent report.",
      "The tax bill could undergo more changes as it moves through the legislative process. The Senate is currently working on the measure after it squeaked through the House with a one-vote margin. Some senators have\u00a0voiced opposition, such as Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, who has said the bill will \"explode the debt.\"",
      "Should the CTC restriction be passed into law, however, it would impact roughly 4.5 million children, with the greatest number residing in California, Texas and Florida, according to an April\u00a0estimate from researchers at the Center for Migration Studies, Center on Poverty and Social Policy at Columbia University, ITEP and Boston University.",
      "\"The proposal now is actually to tighten the eligibility rules even more and to say, 'We basically don't care if the child is a citizen or not \u2014 we need every person in the household to be a citizen or otherwise have legal status in order for the credit to be paid out,\" Davis said.",
      "\"Treated differently\"",
      "Under the GOP bill, both spouses in a given household also must have a Social Security number to qualify for a number of other tax breaks, including provisions eliminating taxes on worker tips and overtime pay.",
      "That would create different tax rules for people who are married to spouses without a Social Security number, as well as for immigrants who are undocumented or who possess valid visas that don't allow them to have Social Security numbers, ITEP's Davis said.",
      "\"It seems to say, if your parents don't meet this criteria regarding their immigration status, then you will be treated differently as a child than all other children in the U.S. who were born of two parents that meet the qualifications,\" said Shelby Gonzales, vice president for immigration policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, nonpartisan think tank.",
      "Created in 1997, the Child Tax Credit received a boost in President Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which doubled the credit to $2,000 per eligible child, although that provision is set to expire at the end of 2025, when the credit is set to return to $1,000 per kid.",
      "The Republican tax bill would boost the CTC to $2,500 per child from tax years 2025 through 2028, at which point the credit would return to its $2,000 level. The tax credit would also be adjusted for inflation each year, ensuring that it wouldn't erode in value over time.",
      "Eligible parents can claim the CTC when filing their taxes, which can help families reduce their tax liability or receive a tax refund. During the pandemic, the CTC received a temporary boost that increased the maximum credit per child to $3,600 while paying out half the benefit through monthly payments, helping millions of families afford things like school supplies, clothing and educational programs for their kids.",
      "An effort last year to expand the CTC failed to advance in the Senate\u00a0in the face of widespread Republican opposition.",
      "\"When families have counted on this funding, it means making sure they have the school supplies, they have access to food and groceries,\" Gonzales said. \"That sets them up for a better trajectory in life, and all of that could be lost because they can't access this credit.\"",

    "summary": "Experts share tips on how to reduce your electricity bill.",
    "story": [
      "With weather\u00a0forecasts\u00a0showing above-normal temperatures throughout the country this summer, heat-weary Americans will soon likely be turning up their air conditioners for relief. But that comfort will come at a cost.",
      "Home electricity bills\u00a0are expected to reach their highest average rate in 12 years, at $784 for the summer period, according to a recent analysis from the National Energy Assistance Directors Association (NEADA). The elevated cost comes as a one-two punch for families already financially strapped after this winter season's higher-than-average heating costs.",
      "Those most impacted by higher summer utility bills will be lower-income households, which often lack the resources to cover monthly payments. About one in four households say they can't pay their energy bills, according to the most recent Census Household Pulse Survey.",
      "The stakes for keeping cool are high. \"Heat is the leading weather-related killer in the United States, resulting in hundreds of fatalities each year,\"\u00a0according to the National Weather Service. Higher temperatures can lead to heat stroke and heat exhaustion.",
      "Heat waves are\u00a0already hitting\u00a0parts of the U.S. like\u00a0Texas. As Mayo Clinic points out, unexpected fluctuations in the temperature often catch people off guard.",
      "For those looking for relief from high temperatures and high bills, experts offer helpful suggestions. \"There are simple things to do,\" said Mark Wolfe, executive director of NEADA. \"You can do them now, and they pay off.\"",
      "Here are tips to reduce your energy costs as summer heats up.",
      "Low-hanging fruit",
      "As a starting point, Americans can tackle low-hanging fruit options, like using a fan in place of, or in addition to an AC. Fans use far less electricity than air conditioners and are priced more reasonably, whether you're looking for a box fan, a pedestal fan or another model.",
      "For those with ceiling fans there's a hack for staying extra cool. Experts recommend setting ceiling fans to rotate counterclockwise during summer months, as doing so pushes warm air down and keeps a cool breeze going. In the fall and winter, rotation should be switched back to clockwise so that as warm air rises, it's circulated throughout the room, said Laurie Wheelock, executive director and counsel at New York's Utility Project (PULP).",
      "If you use an AC, make sure to change the air filter regularly. Wolfe recommends replacing AC filters monthly during the summer, to help units run more efficiently. For those who plan to keep their unit running during the day, you can set it to a few degrees higher before you leave your home to conserve energy.",
      "Wolfe advises setting your AC temperature between 70\u00b0F and 78\u00b0F when you are at home, and 78\u00b0F when the house is empty.",
      "Other small adjustments to keep your space cool include using indoor plants to create shade, keeping your curtains closed to block out the sunlight during the day, investing in reflective blinds or UV-reflective film for windows. Also, limit your oven use and make sure to turn it off right after using it, as it can warm up your space significantly, said Wolfe.",
      "For general energy conservation, experts suggest unplugging small appliances or electronics when you're not using them. Wolfe also recommends running your refrigerator and freezer at the regular temperature as directed by the manufacturer.",
      "\"Running them at cooler temperatures might seem like a good idea in the summer, but that can drive up electricity costs and potentially wear out the electrical appliance,\" he said.",
      "Also, make sure nothing is blocking the airflow of your heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system. Plant life or other obstacles in front of vents can make units less efficient, Wolfe noted.",
      "Look to your state or utility company for help",
      "While it may seem counter-intuitive, your utility company may be able to help you bear the cost burden of higher bills.",
      "\"Some utilities run programs to help make your home more energy efficient in the summer,\" said Wolfe. \"They'll offer rebates if you buy more efficient air conditioners, no-cost audits of your home, and they'll subsidize the cost of installing more insulation.\"",
      "In New York, for example, energy giants ConEd and National Grid have monthly discount programs that provide bill credits to low-income households. Wheelock said PULP has seen ConEd customers save $30 to $45 per month on gas an electricity as part of New York's Energy Affordability program, which is administered by the state's major electric and natural gas utilities.",
      "State governments can also be a useful resource. Depending on where you live, your local government may offer free home energy assessments, weatherization assistance or an energy efficiency program designs to help residents lower their electricity bill.",
      "For those struggling to make ends meet, the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), a federally funded initiative with a\u00a0network\u00a0of state-run programs, provides financial assistance to low-income households.",
      "HEAP provides eligible households, including apartments, with air conditioning units or fans, up to a value of $800, according to WE ACT for Environment Justice, a New York-based environmental justice organization.",
      "\"Anyone at risk of service termination who is low-income should contact their local Department of Social Services to discuss financial assistance programs including Emergency Energy Assistance,\" said Wheelock.",
      "Invest in long-term solutions",
      "With hotter temperatures here to stay, Wolfe said it may be worth investing in more permanent measures like improving your home's insulation or updating your ductwork. This will improve ventilation, keep cold air locked in and make your home more energy efficient overall.",
      "Another option is installing a smart thermostat, which allows you to remotely control the temperature of your space. They can also automatically adjust heating and cooling based on when you're home. Models like Ecobee's Smart Thermostat Essential or Google's Nest Smart Learning Thermostat typically run anywhere from $100 to $200.",
      "These investments may cost more upfront but will save you money over time, says Wolfe. \"In making your home more energy efficient, the savings will pay for the improvements,\" he said.",
      "For those ready to make an even bigger leap, installing a heat pump, switching to central air or upgrading your HVAC or AC system to one with a high Energy Star rating\u00a0are other long-term investments.",
      "Something to keep in mind before you make any of these purchases is whether electricity in your state is high enough to warrant the investment.",
      "\"If you're in like the northeast using heating oil, heat pumps make a lot of sense,\" said Wolfe.",
      "Even before you buy a home, it's worth investigating what the energy bills will look like. You can do this by getting an energy audit from a utility company, said Wolfe.",

The Trump administration's policies, which have introduced new import duties on almost every foreign nation, have hiked the effective tariff rate to 15.4% from 2% last year, marking the highest rate since 1938, the group said.",
      "Because tariffs are paid by U.S. importers like Walmart, those costs are largely passed onto consumers in the form of higher costs \u2014 prompting the OECD to forecast that inflation in the U.S. will \"spike in mid-2025\" and reach 3.9% by the end of 2025.",

    "story": [
      "China on Monday said the Trump administration is undermining the temporary\u00a0May 12 trade agreement between the two nations by issuing AI chip export control guidelines, stopping the sale of chip design software to China and by planning to revoke Chinese student visas.",
      "The Trump administration's actions \"seriously undermine the existing consensus reached at the Geneva economic and trade talks, and seriously damage China's legitimate rights and interests,\" China's Commerce Ministry said in the June 2 statement.",
      "China's claims come after President Trump on Friday said that Beijing is violating a trade agreement with the U.S., just weeks after the two countries announced on May 12 a\u00a0temporary but significant easing\u00a0of tariffs imposed on each other's imports earlier in the year. The escalation of rhetoric heightens concerns that the two largest global economies may encounter further stumbling blocks as they pursue trade negotiations, experts say.",
      "\"Fresh hostilities between the U.S. and China show that the many questions left hanging after the Geneva ceasefire in mid-May still have no satisfactory answers,\" Arthur Kroeber, a China analyst at Gavekal Research, said in a report. \"It is not clear whether U.S. trade policy is being run by President Donald Trump, his trade negotiators or his national security team.\"",
      "He added, \"The overall objectives of the trade aggression, other than the display of raw power, are as muddled as ever.\"",
      "Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Sunday said he's \"confident\" a U.S.-China trade dispute \"will be ironed out\" when Mr. Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping have a conversation. \"I believe we'll see something very soon,\"\u00a0Bessent said on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\"",
      "Wall Street was lower on Monday amid renewed concerns of a brewing trade war between the nations. The S&P 500 slipped 10 points, or 0.2%, to 5,901, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.4% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite shed 0.1%.",
      "May 12 tariff pause",
      "The May 12 deal lasts 90 days, creating time for U.S. and Chinese negotiators to reach a more substantive agreement. But the pause still leaves tariffs higher than before Mr. Trump\u00a0started ramping them up\u00a0last month. Businesses and investors must also contend with uncertainty about whether the truce will last.",
      "U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer said the U.S. agreed to drop the 145% tax Mr. Trump had imposed on China to 30%. China agreed to lower its tariff rate on U.S. goods to 10% from 125%.",
      "On Monday, the Commerce Ministry said China held up its end of the deal, canceling or suspending tariffs and nontariff measures taken against the U.S. \"reciprocal tariffs\" following the agreement. But it alleged that the Trump administration has \"unilaterally provoked new economic and trade frictions and exacerbated the uncertainty and instability\" in trade relations between the two nations, citing curbs on exports of AI chips and chip design software to China.",
      "The statement also singled out the Trump administration's threat of stripping visas away from Chinese students studying at U.S. universities as undermining the trade agreement between the nations.",
      "The Trump administration stepped up the clash with China last week, announcing that it would start\u00a0revoking visas for Chinese students\u00a0in the U.S. American campuses host more than 275,000 students from China.",
      "The turmoil between the U.S. and China raises economic risks, given the links between the two nations and their importance in global trade, experts added.",
      "\"If the United States and China were to disengage completely in another blitz of escalating tariffs, it would be a really big deal for the global economy,\" Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics, told investors in a client note. \"Demand for industrial commodities would plummet. Supply chains spanning multiple borders would shut down.\"",

      "Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social that he and Xi spoke for 90 minutes and addressed a number of outstanding issues surrounding a temporary truce reached on May 12 that was meant to alleviate the escalating trade war between the two countries. He said the conversation \"was focused almost entirely on TRADE\" and \"resulted in a very positive conclusion for both Countries.\"",
      "Under the\u00a0May 12 deal, the U.S. agreed to reduce tariffs on Chinese goods to around 30% from 145%, while China reduced its levies on American imports to 10%. The 90-day accord was meant to give both sides breathing room to strike a broader agreement, but talks soon stalled.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Thursday blocked the Mexican government's lawsuit against major U.S. gun manufacturers, delivering a win for the firearms industry in a test of a federal law that shields them from civil suits.",
      "The high court unanimously rejected Mexico's arguments that its effort to hold firearms makers accountable for the violence wreaked by drug cartels armed with their products should proceed because it satisfied an exception to the liability shield provided through the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, or PLCAA.",
      "In the case known as Smith & Wesson Brands, Inc. v. Estados Unidos Mexicanos, Mexico had argued that gun manufacturers are knowingly aiding and abetting the unlawful sale of their firearms to straw purchasers, who are trafficking them across the southern border to give to drug cartels.",
      "But the justices said that because Mexico's complaint does not plausibly allege that the gunmakers criminally aided and abetted retail dealers' unlawful sale of weapons to Mexican traffickers, it is barred by PLCAA. Justice Elena Kagan delivered the opinion for the court, writing that Congress enacted the law to prevent lawsuits like Mexico's.",
      "\"The predicate exception allows for accomplice liability only when a plaintiff makes a plausible allegation that a gun manufacturer 'participate[d] in' a firearms violation 'as in something that [it] wishe[d] to bring about' and sought to make succeed,\" she wrote. \"Because Mexico's complaint fails to do so, the defendant manufacturers retain their PLCAA-granted immunity.\"",
      "David Pucino, legal director and deputy chief counsel at GIFFORDS Law Center, said that while the Supreme Court's decision ends Mexico's lawsuit against gun manufacturers, it doesn't affect the ability of gun violence prevention groups from holding law-breakers accountable.",
      "\"The justices did not give the gun industry the broad immunity it sought. Instead, they reaffirmed that the victims of gun industry misconduct can hold lawbreakers accountable in court,\" he said in a statement. \"All survivors, in the United States, in Mexico, and anywhere else, deserve their day in court, and we will continue to support them in their fight for justice.\"",
      "Between 200,000 to 500,000 American-made firearms are trafficked into Mexico each year, a pipeline that's become known as the \"iron river.\" Nearly half of all guns recovered at Mexican crime scenes are manufactured in the U.S., according to data from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.",
      "As part of its efforts to stem the flow of guns illegally trafficked across the U.S.-Mexico border to arm drug cartels, the Mexican government sued seven of the biggest gunmakers in the U.S. and one wholesaler in 2021. It is seeking $10 billion in damages from the industry, as well as other forms of relief.",
      "Mexico has argued that its suit fell under one of PLCAA's exceptions, known as the predicate exception, because the gun manufacturers allegedly knew they were breaking the law by selling to known straw purchasers, and that violation led directly to Mexico's injuries: the millions of dollars in damage to its military and property caused by cartel violence.",
      "The law was passed with bipartisan support from Congress in 2005 and broadly provides a legal shield for gun companies from civil suits that seek to hold them liable for harms stemming from the criminal misuse of their products by another person.",
      "A federal district court in Massachusetts dismissed Mexico's suit in 2022 after finding that PLCAA \"unequivocally\" bars lawsuits seeking to hold firearms manufacturers liable for the actions of people using their products. The court also ruled that PLCAA's narrow exceptions did not apply to the case.",
      "But in early 2024, a panel of three judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 1st Circuit revived Mexico's lawsuit, concluding it fell under PLCAA's predicate exception. That allows gunmakers to be sued if they knowingly broke the law, and if that legal violation led directly to Mexico's injuries.",
      "The appeals court found that the gun industry was \"aiding and abetting\" the unlawful sale of firearms to traffickers for cartels in Mexico, and that the trafficking of those guns has foreseeably forced the Mexican government to incur significant costs because of cartel violence.",
      "The Supreme Court reversed the 1st Circuit's ruling and found that Mexico's complaint \"stretches the bounds\" of its caselaw.",
      "The suit, Kagan wrote, repeatedly claims that gunmakers \"treat rogue dealers just the same as they do law-abiding ones \u2014 selling to everyone, and on equivalent terms.\" But Mexico, she said, could not plausibly allege that is taking place, in part because the manufacturers sell their products to middlemen distributors.",
      "\"A manufacturer of goods is not an accomplice to every unaffiliated retailer whom it fails to make follow the law,\" Kagan wrote.",
      "In a concurring opinion, Justice Clarence Thomas wrote that courts should in future cases more fully examine what constitutes the violation of state or federal law that would allow a lawsuit to fall under the exception to PLCAA's liability shield. He suggested that the law requires not only a plausible allegation that a gunmaker has broken the law, but also a finding of guilt or liability in an adjudication regarding that violation.",
      "\"Particularly given PLCAA's aim of protecting gun manufacturers from litigation, this issue warrants careful consideration,\" Thomas wrote.",
      "Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson also authored a concurring opinion, in which she wrote that Mexico is merely faulting the gun industry writ large for engaging in practices that legislatures and voters have decided not to prohibit.",
      "The lawsuit, she said, \"seeks to turn the courts into common-law regulators. But Congress passed PLCAA to preserve the primacy of the political branches \u2014 both state and federal \u2014 in deciding which duties to impose on the firearms industry. Construing PLCAA's predicate exception to authorize lawsuits like the one Mexico filed here would distort that basic design.\"",
      "The case arrived at the Supreme Court while it was in its early stages. As the gunmakers' appeal was pending, the district court dismissed six of the eight manufacturers from the case. The remaining companies are Smith & Wesson and Interstate Arms, a wholesaler.",

      "\"Very simply, we cannot have open migration from any country where we cannot safely and reliably vet and screen those who seek to enter the United States,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "The president cited the recent attack in Boulder, where an Egyptian national was charged, as part of the justification for the bans. Egypt is not among the countries on the White House's list. But the proclamation directed officials to assess the \"adequacy\" of Egypt's vetting policies \"in light of recent events.\"",
      "Are there exceptions to the new travel ban?",
      "The president's decree contains certain exemptions, including for U.S. permanent residents and the spouses and children of U.S. citizens who have \"clear and convincing evidence of identity and family relationship.\"",

      "Mr. Trump said the list could be revised if countries make \"material improvements,\" and new countries could be added \"as threats emerge around the world.\"",
      "Did Trump do this before?",
      "The president's actions follow a series of travel bans issued during his first administration that initially targeted predominantly Muslim countries. Like those orders, his latest proclamation could be subject to lawsuits, although the Supreme Court ultimately upheld the revised ban from his first term, which the White House noted in a fact sheet outlining his second-term bans.",
      "The president touted his first-term travel bans in his video statement released Wednesday.",
      "\"In my first term, my powerful travel restrictions were one of our most successful policies, and they were a key part of preventing major foreign terror attacks on American soil,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "In January 2017, Mr. Trump signed a travel ban restricting the entry of most citizens of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. The ban sparked widespread outcry, creating chaos at airports and prompting legal challenges, as opponents argued the ban was discriminatory.",
      "Then in March 2017, Mr. Trump removed Iraq from the list and added Chad, Venezuela and North Korea. The president expanded the ban in 2020, adding immigration restrictions for nationals of Nigeria, Eritrea, Sudan, Tanzania, Myanmar and Kyrgyzstan. Chad was later removed from the list.",
      "The third iteration of the president's first-term ban was upheld by the Supreme Court in the summer of 2018. At the time, conservative justices cited the president's broad authority to restrict the entry of foreigners on national security grounds. When President Joe Biden took office, he scrapped that ban.",

    "summary": "The Supreme Court on Thursday revived a lawsuit from an Ohio woman who\u200b claimed she was the victim of reverse discrimination.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Thursday revived a lawsuit from an\u00a0Ohio woman\u00a0who claimed she was the victim of reverse discrimination because her employer denied her a promotion because she is straight.",
      "In a unanimous decision\u00a0in the case of Ames v. Ohio Department of Youth Services, the high court tossed out a ruling by a federal appeals court that dismissed Marlean Ames' claims because she failed to clear a higher bar applied to members of a majority group in order for her employment discrimination case to proceed. The justices concluded that a \"background circumstances\" requirement cannot be squared with Title VII of the Civil Rights Act and sent Ames' case back to the lower courts for further proceedings.",
      "The background circumstances rule required plaintiffs who are members of a majority group to put forth more evidence showing that their employer is \"unusual\" because it discriminates against the majority. Ames had argued that the requirement unfairly imposed a higher burden on her as a heterosexual woman.",
      "The ruling from the Supreme Court makes it easier to pursue claims of reverse discrimination in 20 states and the District of Columbia that are covered by federal courts of appeals that still applied the standard.",
      "Writing for the court, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson said that the Supreme Court's case law \"makes clear that the standard for proving disparate treatment under Title VII does not vary based on whether or not the plaintiff is a member of a majority group. ... The 'background circumstances' rule flouts that basic principle.\"",
      "Jackson noted that the requirement uniformly subjects all majority-group plaintiffs to \"the same, highly specific evidentiary standard in every case.\"",
      "Ames sued her employer, the Ohio Department of Youth Services, after she said she was turned down for a promotion in favor of a gay woman and then demoted and replaced by a gay man. She alleged violations of Title VII, which prohibits discrimination in the workplace based on race, religion, national origin and sex, which includes sexual orientation. Ames accused the department of discriminating against her on the basis of sexual orientation.",
      "A federal district court ruled for the Ohio Department of Youth Services after finding that it offered \"legitimate, nondiscriminatory business reasons\" for passing Ames over for the promotion. The court concluded that Ames' allegations were insufficient to establish the background circumstances necessary to make an initial case of reverse discrimination.",
      "A plaintiff can clear that bar if they put forward evidence that a member of the relevant minority group made the employment decision at issue, or by presenting statistical evidence demonstrating a pattern of discrimination by the employer against members of a majority group.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit upheld the district court's decision and agreed that Ames failed to satisfy the background circumstances requirement.",
      "Ames appealed to the Supreme Court, which agreed in October to review the 6th Circuit's decision. That appeals court and four others \u2014 the 7th, 8th, 10th and D.C. Circuits \u2014 still applied the background circumstances standard, while seven others do not.",
      "In a concurring opinion, Justice Clarence Thomas, joined by Justice Neil Gorsuch, criticized the background circumstances rule as \"judge-made\" and said it is \"undoubtedly\" contrary to Title VII and likely violates the Constitution.",
      "\"Courts with this rule have enshrined into Title VII's anti-discrimination law an explicitly race-based preference: White plaintiffs must prove the existence of background circumstances, while nonwhite plaintiffs need not do so,\" Thomas wrote.",
      "He said that the Supreme Court's decision \"obviates the need for courts to engage in the 'sordid business'\" of dividing people by race or other protected traits.",
      "The dispute arrived before the high court as President Trump targeted diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, programs and practices throughout the federal government and fired federal employees in DEI roles. Large companies, too, dismantled their DEI policies following the Supreme Court's 2023 decision that ended affirmative action in college admissions.",

    "link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fda-review-mifepristone-abortion-pill-access/",
    "published": "Thu, 05 Jun 2025 10:46:02 -0400",
    "summary": "HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. asked the FDA \"to review the latest data on mifepristone\u200b,\" but experts say concerns about the abortion pill's safety are misguided.",
    "story": [
      "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has asked Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Marty Makary \"to review the latest data on mifepristone,\" raising questions about the drug commonly referred to as the abortion pill.",
      "A spokesperson for the FDA confirmed the plans in a statement to CBS News Tuesday, but did not respond to questions about when the review is scheduled to start and what exactly it will be reviewing about the medication.",
      "According to a letter published on social media Monday by Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, Makary's review aims to closely monitor the drug's safety. But experts say concerns about its safety are misguided, fueled in part by a report from the Ethics and Public Policy Center, an advocacy group that promotes religious traditions and is funded by multiple right-wing organizations.",
      "Mifepristone, which is taken with a second drug, misoprostol, to end an early pregnancy, was first approved by the FDA in 2000 after \"a thorough and comprehensive review\" determined it was safe and effective, the agency says. Periodic reviews since its approval have not found new safety concerns, according to the FDA.",
      "In the Ethics and Public Policy Center report, which was not published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal, the authors, who don't have medical training, claim the pill harms women, causing 1 in 10 patients to experience what they call a \"serious adverse event,\" including hemorrhage, ER visits, ectopic pregnancy and an undefined category of \"abortion-specific complications.\"",
      "Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News, said some of the instances described as \"adverse events\" are questionable.",
      "\"When you have a medication abortion, you bleed. That is normal. That is not an adverse event unless the bleeding is so significant that a woman needs a transfusion,\" she explained. \"It is to be expected that not all medication abortions will successfully eliminate the pregnancy. A surgical abortion after incomplete/failed medication abortion should not be considered an adverse event. ... An ectopic pregnancy is not caused by mifepristone and should not be considered a serious adverse event.\"",
      "Gounder added that the report lacks transparency and doesn't disclose the data source, meaning no one can reproduce and verify the findings, something Kennedy himself said he's a proponent of, noting in his confirmation hearings that he wants to replicate studies.",
      "It also lacks a comparison group, Gounder said, which is important for examining how experiences compare to pregnant women who did not take the drug.",
      "More than 6 million women in the U.S. have used the brand name mifepristone, Mifeprex, since approval in 2000, the drug maker, Danco Laboratories, told CBS News.",
      "\"Danco stands confidently behind the product's established safety and efficacy record,\" a spokesperson said.",
      "While it's unclear whether the latest review of the drug will impact access, Gounder said it could come down to science versus politics.",
      "\"It really depends on if the FDA strictly follows the science and its own extensive safety reviews,\" she said on \"CBS Evening News\" Wednesday.",
      "This isn't the first time the drug has come under fire from abortion opponents and conservatives.",
      "In 2024, the Supreme Court rejected a challenge targeting the availability of the widely used pill, preserving access to the drug in its first major abortion-related ruling since the reversal of Roe v. Wade. If the challengers had prevailed, the ruling would have restricted access to mifepristone nationwide, even in states where abortion is legal.",
      "The justices unanimously ruled that the anti-abortion rights doctors and medical associations who brought the lawsuit against the FDA did not have the legal right to do so. They did not address whether the FDA acted lawfully when it took a series of steps in 2016 and 2021 that relaxed the rules for mifepristone's use.",
      "Makary had previously said that he had \"no plans to take action on mifepristone.\"",
      "Medication abortions made up more than half of all abortions in the United States health care system in 2023, a study from the Guttmacher Institute, an abortion rights research group, found.",
      "In 28 states, there are policies restricting access to mifepristone in some way, according to the Guttmacher Institute, four of which prohibit the mailing of abortion pills to patients.",
      "Melissa  Quinn and \n                                                  \n                                  Alexander  Tin\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "summary": "President Trump signed a proclamation to ban travel from certain countries, citing national security risks. It's set to take effect at 12:01 a.m. Monday.",
    "story": [
      "President Trump on Wednesday signed a proclamation barring travelers and immigrants from a dozen countries and restricting the entry of nationals of another seven nations, citing concerns about national security.",
      "Mr. Trump's proclamation fully bans the entry of foreigners from Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, the Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. With certain exemptions, Mr. Trump's order bans citizens of those countries seeking to come to the U.S. permanently as legal immigrants, as well as temporary visa holders, like tourists.",
      "The president also partially suspended the entry of travelers and immigrants from Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela. That part of his proclamation applies to all prospective immigrants from these countries with visas to settle in the U.S. permanently and certain temporary visa holders.",
      "The ban is set to take effect at 12:01 a.m. on Monday, June 9.",
      "Mr. Trump said the sweeping entry restrictions were necessary to address concerns related to terrorism in the countries listed in the order, inadequate vetting of the affected nationals and the lack of cooperation on deportations among some of the nations.",
      "\"President Trump is fulfilling his promise to protect Americans from dangerous foreign actors that want to come to our country and cause us harm. These commonsense restrictions are country-specific and include places that lack proper vetting, exhibit high visa overstay rates, or fail to share identity and threat information. President Trump will always act in the best of interest of the American people and their safety,\" White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson told CBS News.",
      "Mr. Trump's decree contains certain exemptions, including for U.S. permanent residents, the spouses and children of U.S. citizens who have \"clear and convincing evidence of identity and family relationship,\" Afghans who assisted American forces and have special visas, diplomats, athletes and dual nationals with a passport from a country not listed in his proclamation.",
      "The announcement of the ban follows an attack Sunday in Boulder, Colorado, on marchers raising attention for Israelis taken hostage by Hamas. The suspect was identified by U.S. officials as an Egyptian national who had overstayed his tourist visa.",
      "While Mr. Trump did not place any restrictions on the entry of Egyptian nationals, his proclamation directed officials to assess the \"adequacy\" of Egypt's vetting policies, \"in light of recent events.\"",
      "In a video statement released by the White House Wednesday night, Mr. Trump said the Boulder attack \"underscored the extreme dangers posed to our country by the entry of foreign nationals who are not properly vetted, as well as those who come here as temporary visitors and overstay their visas. We don't want them.\"",
      "He said the list could be revised if countries make material improvements, and new countries could be added as threats emerge.",
      "Mr. Trump's actions echo a series of travel bans issued during his first administration that initially targeted predominantly Muslim countries. Like those orders, his latest proclamation could be subject to lawsuits.",
      "In the first month of his first term, January 2017, Mr. Trump signed a travel ban restricting the entry of most citizens of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. The move triggered widespread outcry, chaos at airports and legal challenges from advocates who argued the ban was discriminatory.",
      "In March 2017, Mr. Trump removed Iraq from the list and added Chad, Venezuela and North Korea. In 2020, he expanded the ban, adding immigration restrictions for nationals of Nigeria, Eritrea, Sudan, Tanzania, Myanmar and Kyrgyzstan. Chad was later removed from the list.",
      "The third version of Mr. Trump's first-term ban was ultimately upheld by the Supreme Court in the summer of 2018, with the conservative justices citing the president's broad authority to restrict the entry of foreigners on national security grounds. The Biden administration scrapped that ban after it took office.",

      "On Thursday, a chilly winter morning in South Africa, CBS News found hopeful travelers in the line worried about what could happen if they do make it to an arrival gate at a U.S. airport, or during their visits.",
      "President Trump's announcement on Wednesday of a looming travel ban on all citizens from 12 nations in Africa and the Middle East didn't even include South Africa, despite the American leader's tetchy relations with the country. But the anxiety caused by the return of blanket travel restrictions \u2014 something Mr. Trump did during his first term, too \u2014 was almost palpable in Johannesburg.",
      "One person in the line said they were planning to travel for a work conference, but they wondered whether it was a good idea.",
      "Another, tentatively planning to travel for non-essential reasons, worried that, with the last name Assad, it might be better to skip the planned trip entirely.",
      "\"Do I run the risk of being rounded up and sent to another country, or even jail?\" they asked. \"The risk is simply too high.\"",
      "No one in the line would give CBS News their full name \u2014 out of fear, most said, of any public comment possibly bringing a denial of their visa request.",
      "What African countries are facing Trump's travel ban, and why?",
      "Nationals of seven African countries are facing a ban on travel to the U.S. from June 9, per Mr. Trump's announcement: Chad, Somalia, Sudan, Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea and Libya.",
      "Three of those countries \u2014 Sudan, Somalia and Libya \u2014 were among the countries put under a travel ban during Mr. Trump's first term in January 2017, though the restrictions on Sudan were later dropped, and those against Somalia and Libya were eased.",
      "Many of the 12 countries on the new list have been wracked by repressive regimes and plagued by conflict.",
      "\"We don't want them,\" President Trump said as he announced the ban on Wednesday, which he said was needed \"to protect Americans from dangerous actors.\"",
      "He cited risks ranging from terrorism to people overstaying their visas, and stressed that the U.S. \"cannot have open migration from any country where we cannot safely and reliably vet and screen those who seek to enter.\"",
      "Somalia was cited by the president as being a \"terrorist safe haven,\" while Libya, he said, had a \"historical terrorist presence.\"",
      "\"The recent terror attack in Boulder, Colorado, has underscored the extreme dangers posed to our country by the entry of foreign nationals who are not properly vetted, as well as those who come here as temporary visitors and overstay their visas,\" Mr. Trump said.",
      "Critics noted that the man charged in that attack, Mohamed Sabry Soliman, is an Egyptian national, and Egypt is not included on the travel ban list announced by Mr. Trump on Wednesday.",
      "Somalia immediately responded to the American leader's proclamation, with the country's Ambassador to the U.S., Dahir Hassan Abdi, saying in a statement that, \"Somalia values its longstanding relationship with the United States and stands ready to engage in dialogue to address the concerns raised.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said in his remarks that \"the United States must be vigilant during the visa-issuance process.\"",
      "The Africa Union issued a statement Thursday asking the U.S. to adopt a more \"consultative approach\" with the countries named by Mr. Trump, adding that it was concerned about the \"potential negative impact on people-to-people ties, educational exchange, commercial engagement, and the broader diplomatic relations that have been carefully nurtured over decades.\"",
      "It has long been difficult and laborious for people from many African nations to get a visa to travel to the U.S.",
      "Mr. Trump's announcement came, however, just days after a second group of South African Afrikaner \"refugees\" left on commercial flights bound for the U.S. under a program announced by the White House in February, which fast-tracks resettlement of the white South Africans even as the administration works to suspend other refugee programs.",
      "President Trump has repeated false claims that a white genocide taking place in South Africa, claiming Afrikaner farmers are the victims of systemic, racially motivated violence.",
      "In January, South Africa adopted a land expropriation bill that allows the state to take ownership of land to address racial disparities in ownership. To date, no land has been expropriated without compensation in South Africa, despite claims by right-wing activists in the country \u2014 and some prominent supporters outside South Africa, including Elon Musk \u2014 to the contrary.",
      "Soon after the bill was passed, in a briefing with journalists, Mr. Trump accused the government of South Africa of \"doing some terrible, horrible things,\" and he said in a social media post that he would be, \"cutting off all future funding to South Africa until a full investigation of this situation has been completed!\"",
      "As relations between the two countries deteriorated, President Cyril Ramaphosa traveled to Washington late last month with a raft of new measures to try to mend ties. But President Trump ambushed him in the Oval Office, with news cameras rolling, with a video he claimed as proof of the so-called white genocide.",
      "The video included clips of controversial South African opposition figure Julius Malema singing a song that became popular during the anti-apartheid struggle, called \"Kill the Boer,\" which means Afrikaner.",
      "Ramaphosa watched the video and then pointed out to Mr. Trump that the views voiced in it were not government policy, before conceding that South Africa undeniably has a violent crime problem \u2014 but that only a small number of white farmers had been targeted.",
      "Ramaphosa's two hour meeting with President Trump was largely seen as productive from the South African point of view. Ramaphosa had hoped to leave the White House with an assurance from Mr. Trump that he would attend the G20 summit in South Africa in November. He didn't get that, but the U.S. leader said he was considering it.",
      "The U.S. Embassy in South Africa later issued a statement updating administration's policy, saying that to qualify for U.S. resettlement, applicants \"must be of Afrikaner ethnicity or a member of a racial minority in South Africa and must be able to articulate a past experience of persecution or fear of persecution.\"",
      "Across Africa, there was already a sense of confusion and sadness over the relentless aid and trade cuts brought by the Trump administration, and the travel bans have only exacerbated that feeling.",

    "summary": "The Trump administration wants to shutter the CDC's National Asthma Control Program, which provides millions in funding to state-administered initiatives aimed at fighting the disease.",
    "story": [
      "Esther Bejarano's son was 11 months old when asthma landed him in the hospital. She didn't know what had triggered his symptoms \u2014 neither she nor her husband had asthma \u2014 but she suspected it was the pesticides sprayed on the agricultural fields near her family's home.",
      "Pesticides are a known contributor to asthma and are commonly used where Bejarano lives in California's Imperial Valley, a landlocked region that straddles two counties on the U.S.-Mexico border and is one of the main producers of the nation's winter crops. It also has some of the worst air pollution in the nation and one of the highest rates of childhood asthma emergency room visits in the state, according to data collected by the California Department of Public Health.",
      "Bejarano has since learned to manage her now-19-year-old son's asthma and works at Comite Civico del Valle, a local rights organization focused on environmental justice in the Imperial Valley. The organization trains health care workers to educate patients on proper asthma management, enabling them to avoid hospitalization and eliminate triggers at home. The course is so popular that there's a waiting list, Bejarano said.",
      "But the group's Asthma Management Academy program and similar initiatives nationwide face extinction with the Trump administration's mass layoffs, grant cancellations, and proposed budget cuts at the Department of Health and Human Services and the Environmental Protection Agency. Asthma experts fear the cumulative impact of the reductions could result in more ER visits and deaths, particularly for children and people in low-income communities \u2014 populations disproportionately vulnerable to the disease.",
      "\"Asthma is a preventive condition,\" Bejarano said. \"No one should die of asthma.\"",
      "Asthma can block airways, making it hard to breathe, and in severe cases can cause death if not treated quickly. Nearly 28 million people in the U.S. have asthma, and about 10 people still die every day from the disease, according to the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America.",
      "In May, the White House released a budget proposal that would permanently shutter\u00a0the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Asthma Control Program, which was already gutted by federal health department layoffs in April. It's unclear whether Congress will approve the closure.",
      "Last year, the program allotted $33.5 million to state-administered initiatives in 27 states, Puerto Rico, and Washington, D.C., to help communities with asthma education. The funding is distributed in four-year grant cycles, during which the programs receive up to $725,000 each annually.",
      "Comite Civico del Valle's academy in Southern California, a clinician workshop in Houston, and asthma medical management training in Allentown, Pennsylvania \u2014 ranked the most challenging U.S. city to live in with asthma \u2014 are among the programs largely surviving on these grants. The first year of the current grant cycle ends Aug. 31, and it's unknown whether funding will continue beyond then.",
      "Data suggests that the CDC's National Asthma Control Program has had a significant impact. The agency's own research has shown that the program saves $71 in health care costs for every $1 invested. And the asthma death rate decreased 44% between the 1999 launch of the program and 2021, according to the American Lung Association.",
      "\"Losing support from the CDC will have devastating impacts on asthma programs in states and communities across the country, programs that we know are improving the lives of millions of people with asthma,\" said Anne Kelsey Lamb, director of the Public Health Institute's Regional Asthma Management and Prevention program. \"And the thing is that we know a lot about what works to help people keep their asthma well controlled, and that's why it's so devastating.\"",
      "The Trump administration cited cost savings and efficiency in its April announcement of the cuts to HHS. Requests for comment from the White House and HHS's CDC about cuts to federal asthma and related programs were not answered.",
      "The information wars",
      "Fresno, in the heart of California's Central Valley, is one of the country's top 20 \"asthma capitals,\" with high rates of asthma and related emergencies and deaths. It's home to programs that receive funding through the National Asthma Control Program. Health care professionals there also rely on another aspect of the program that is under threat if it's shuttered: countrywide data.",
      "The federal asthma program collects information on asthma rates and offers a tool to study prevalence and rates of death from the disease, see what populations are most affected, and assess state and local trends. Asthma educators and health care providers worry that the loss of these numbers could be the biggest impact of the cuts, because it would mean a dearth of information crucial to forming educated recommendations and treatment plans.",
      "\"How do we justify the services we provide if the data isn't there?\" said Graciela Anaya, director of community health at the Central California Asthma Collaborative in Fresno.",
      "Mitchell Grayson, chair of the Asthma and Allergy Foundation's Medical Scientific Council, is similarly concerned.",
      "\"My fear is we're going to live in a world that is frozen in Jan. 19, 2025, as far as data, because that was the last time you know that this information was safely collected,\" he said.",
      "Grayson, an allergist who practices in Columbus, Ohio, said he also worries government websites will delete important recommendations that asthma sufferers avoid heavy air pollution, get annual flu shots, and get COVID-19 vaccines.",
      "Disproportionate risk",
      "Asthma disproportionately affects communities of color because of \"historic structural issues,\" said Lynda Mitchell, CEO of the Asthma and Allergy Network, citing a higher likelihood of living in public housing or near highways and other pollution sources.",
      "She and other experts in the field said cuts to diversity initiatives across federal agencies, combined with the rollback of environmental protections, will have an outsize impact on these at-risk populations.",
      "In December, the Biden administration awarded nearly $1.6 billion through the EPA's Community Change Grants program to help disadvantaged communities address pollution and climate threats. The Trump administration moved to cut this funding in March. The grant freezes, which have been temporarily blocked by the courts, are part of a broader effort by the Trump EPA to eliminate aid to environmental justice programs across the agency.",
      "In 2023 and 2024, the National Institutes of Health's Climate Change and Health Initiative received $40 million for research, including on the link between asthma and climate change. The Trump administration has moved to cut that money. And a March memo essentially halted all NIH grants focused on diversity, equity, and inclusion, or DEI \u2014 funds many of the asthma programs serving low-income communities rely on to operate.",
      "On top of those cuts, environmental advocates like Isabel Gonz\u00e1lez Whitaker of Memphis, Tennessee, worry that the proposed reversals of environmental regulations will further harm the health of communities like hers that are already reeling from the effects of climate change.

      "Both are students who are undergoing training at Job Corps, but whose careers are in limbo as the centers were abruptly shut down last week.",
      "On May 29, the Labor Department announced a \"phased pause\" in operations at 99 contractor-operated Job Corps centers nationwide.",
      "These are federally-funded centers that offer career training, housing and career assistance to more than 25,000 young people ages 16 to 24. The Labor Department program was funded by Congress in 1964 and has generally received bipartisan support.",
      "However, Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer said in a news release that the program was \"no longer achieving the intended outcomes that students deserve\" as evidenced by \"a startling number of serious incident reports and our in-depth fiscal analysis.\"",
      "On Wednesday, U.S District Judge Andrew Carter in Manhattan temporarily blocked the Trump administration from eliminating the Job Corps program while the case plays out.",
      "The temporary restraining order was issued after Job Corps contractors sued the Trump administration Tuesday arguing the Labor Department violated federal law by shutting down the Job Corps centers, arguing the White House does not have the power to dismantle a program established and funded by Congress.",
      "A hearing is set for June 17. CBS News has reached out to the Labor Department and Job Corps for comment on the ruling.",
      "Job Corps officials told CBS News that even before the Labor Department paused operations last week, it had halted their ability to conduct background checks, effectively freezing the enrollment process. Though it was initially communicated as a pause, staff had been given dates for their last date of employment, they said.",
      "Prior to Carter's ruling, a stop in operations at all contractor-operated Job Corps centers was slated to occur by June 30.",
      "A transparency report released in April by the Labor Department found that the average graduation rate for the program was under 40%. The yearly average cost per student was $80,000 and there were over 14,000 serious incident infractions, including inappropriate sexual behavior, sexual assaults and reported drug use.",
      "The decision to pause operations aligned with President Trump's 2026 budget proposal, according to the Labor Department, and the administration's commitment to \"ensure federal workforce investments deliver meaningful results for both students and taxpayers,\" the agency said last week when it announced the pause.",
      "According to Michelle Matthews, who helps lead the L.A. Job Corps centers, the Labor Department's findings were \"unbelievable\" given that students are under strict rules and are drug tested in order to qualify.",
      "\"All of the numbers presented were inflated, deflated lies and their intent was clear from the start,\" said Matthews, adding that news of the centers' closure was communicated to students last Friday.",
      "\"That was a day I will never forget,\" Matthews told CBS News in tears. \"To see what they were going through and to know that the impact was going to be devastating.\"",
      "Students were required to abandon their dorms, but more than 50 students in the L.A. centers had nowhere to go. Matthews says she is part of the staff still working around the clock to find them housing.",
      "It was not immediately clear whether Wednesday's ruling will allow it to immediately reopen to students.",
      "Both Republican and Democratic lawmakers have denounced the Trump administration's move to suspend Job Corps operations, a move they say is illegal.",
      "\"We funded the program through fiscal year 2025 and they are cutting these slots and shutting things down that Congress has already funded,\" said Democratic Rep. Jimmy Gomez of California in a phone interview with CBS News. \"The money is already there, so they should use it to help these kids finish out their degrees and certifications and then we can have a debate on what the future of Job Corps looks like.\"",
      "Gomez added that he has personally witnessed the success of the program as his two siblings are Job Corps graduates.",
      "\"The kids are in the pipeline, don't take this away from them because they don't have many opportunities as it is,\" Gomez said.",
      "In May, Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, sent a letter to Chavez-DeRemer requesting information on Job Corps contracts, background check processing and evaluation plans.",
      "\"I strongly oppose the Department of Labor's directive to pause operations at Job Corps centers in Maine and across the country,\" Collins said in a statement. \"Serving nearly 500 students in Maine, the Loring Job Corps Center and the Penobscot Job Corps Center have become important pillars of support for some of our most disadvantaged young adults.\"",
      "Scott, who has autism, was forced to drop out of college at the age of 19 to care for her disabled mother.",
      "\"I watched my whole life get put on pause and our circumstances never improved,\" Scott said.",
      "The nursing student says she's unable to pay for her training on her own if Job Corps is effectively shut down.",
      "\"My future, I don't see it, I don't see anything being different than how I started,\" Scott said.",
      "For Watts, leaving Job Corps would mean returning to Las Vegas \u2014 where she doesn't have a home \u2014 without achieving her initial hopes of becoming a pharmacy technician.",
      "\"I wanted to set an example for my future self, and I enrolled into Job Corps thinking that I would come out with a career, with my high school diploma,\" Watts said. \"But that was all just taken from me in a short amount of time.\"",

    "story": [
      "President Trump ordered an investigation Wednesday into whether former President Joe Biden's administration used an autopen machine to sign key presidential documents like pardons \u2014 months after Mr. Trump claimed his predecessor's pardons were illegitimate.",
      "In a memo signed Wednesday night, Mr. Trump told Attorney General Pam Bondi and the president's counsel to probe what he claimed was a \"conspiracy\" to \"abuse the power of Presidential signatures through the use of an autopen to conceal Biden's cognitive decline.\"",
      "The order cited a litany of executive actions by Biden \u2014 including pardons and federal judge appointments \u2014 and argued \"there are serious doubts as to the decision making process and even the degree of Biden's awareness of these actions being taken in his name.\"",
      "It then suggested that if Biden's advisers \"secretly used the mechanical signature pen,\" it would \"have implications for the legality and validity of numerous executive actions.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said the investigation should cover whether Biden's aides \"conspired to deceive the public about Biden's mental state and unconstitutionally exercise the authorities and responsibilities of the president.\" It also directed an investigation into which executive actions an autopen was used for, and who directed its use.",
      "In a statement, Biden called the attacks false and \"nothing more than a distraction by Donald Trump and Congressional Republicans.\"",
      "\"Let me be clear: I made the decisions during my presidency. I made the decisions about the pardons, executive orders, legislation, and proclamations. Any suggestion that I didn't is ridiculous and false,\" Biden said.",
      "Presidents have used an autopen \u2014 or a signature-signing machine \u2014 to sign certain documents for decades, and then-President George W. Bush's Justice Department said in 2005 that the president can legally use an autopen to sign bills into law. Mr. Trump said in March he has occasionally used an autopen, but \"only for very unimportant papers.\"",
      "But Mr. Trump and his allies have suggested Biden's alleged use of an autopen could be illegitimate. In March, the president claimed a slate of pardons issued to some Trump foes in the final days of his administration were \"VOID\" and \"VACANT.\"",
      "CBS News legal contributor Jessica Levinson said in March that Mr. Trump cannot revoke his predecessor's pardons, even if an autopen was involved, noting that the president's constitutional power to pardon people is extremely broad. \"This is not a gray area,\" she said on \"CBS Mornings Plus.\"",
      "Early Wednesday, Mr. Trump on Truth Social\u00a0called the alleged autopen use \"THE BIGGEST POLITICAL SCANDAL IN AMERICAN HISTORY,\" aside from the 2020 presidential election, which Mr. Trump has repeatedly claimed \u2014 without evidence \u2014 was rigged.",
      "Scrutiny over Biden's mental acuity while in office has ramped up in recent weeks, amid new reporting about the circumstances of Biden's exit from the 2024 presidential race. Earlier Wednesday, the Republican chair of the House Oversight Committee, Rep. James Comer of Kentucky,\u00a0pushed several members of Biden's inner circle to answer questions about the president's \"mental and physical faculties\" while serving as the chief executive.",

      "The order claimed Harvard \"is no longer a trustworthy steward of international student and exchange visitor programs,\" accusing the school of failing to report students' disciplinary records to the federal government and criticizing it for ties to researchers based in China.",
      "A Harvard spokesperson called the order \"yet another illegal retaliatory step taken by the Administration in violation of Harvard's First Amendment rights.\"",
      "\"Harvard will continue to protect its international students,\" the spokesperson told CBS News.",

      "Last month, the Department of Homeland Security tried to take away Harvard's certification in the federal government's student visa database. A judge halted that policy after Harvard sued, with the school arguing the order was unconstitutional and would have an \"immediate and devastating effect for Harvard and more than 7,000 visa holders.\"",

      "The Trump administration has feuded with Harvard for months, seeking to cut off billions in federal funding.

It halted new student visa interviews last week in preparation for \"expanded social media vetting,\" and the State Department's email directing extra vetting for travelers to Harvard framed the policy as a \"pilot\" for other visa applicants.",
      "Meanwhile, thousands of foreign students who are already present in the U.S. have faced the termination of their student visa status, sometimes after appearing to get on the government's radar due to minor legal issues \u2014 though a judge blocked that policy.",
      "And some international students with links to pro-Palestinian activism have been detained under a rarely used law allowing visas to be revoked if someone's presence in the U.S. poses \"adverse foreign policy consequences.\" Judges ordered the release of two students on bond \u2014 Columbia University's Mohsen Mahdawi and Tufts University's Rumeysa Ozturk \u2014 but another Columbia activist, Mahmoud Khalil, remains detained.",

      "Senate Republicans on the Finance Committee met with the president at the White House on Wednesday evening, in what Thune said was a \"positive discussion on the path forward\" for the bill.",
      "\"I think it was a reminder that we are all in this together, this is a team effort, and everybody is going to be rowing in the same direction to get this across the finish line,\" Thune said. \"Failure is not an option.\"",
      "Sen. Roger Marshall, a Kansas Republican, told reporters after the meeting that Mr. Trump's message at the meeting was to \"pass the damn bill.\"",
      "\"Pass the bill with as minimal changes as you can,\" Marshall said of the president's urging to senators. \"If there's an opportunity to, a few tweaks here and a few tweaks there, then great. But let's get this bill across the finish line.\"",
      "The Kansas Republican said Musk came up at the White House meeting for a \"laughing conversation for 30 seconds\" and that Mr. Trump is \"absolutely not\" concerned about his criticism.",
      "The criticism from Musk comes almost six months after he successfully\u00a0torpedoed a measure to fund the government in December, forcing lawmakers back to the drawing board. But this time around, with Musk having recently departed from his role as a Special Government Employee, the criticism has not had the same effect.",
      "\"He certainly doesn't have the same sway,\" Sen. Kevin Cramer, a North Dakota Republican, told CBS News of Musk.",
      "GOP Sen. Markwayne Mullin, who previously represented Oklahoma in the House and has served as a messenger between the two chambers, told reporters \"I don't know if it affects a lot.\"",
      "\"I have all the respect in the world for Elon, all the respect in the world for him,\" Mullin said. \"I also love my wife, and every now and then my wife and I disagree. And so sometimes people just have disagreements.\"",
      "Senate Republicans were gathered for their conference luncheon on Tuesday when Musk took to X to criticize the bill, prompting a handful of Senate Republicans to quickly voice their agreement, including Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, who had already expressed serious concerns that spending cuts don't go far enough. Other Republicans, like Sen. Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming, voiced understanding for Musk's views on Wednesday. But she cast doubt on whether the criticism would sway her colleagues.",
      "\"I think that those of us who share concerns that there are inadequate reductions in the bill knew that before Elon Musk said that,\" Lummis said. \"Those who disagree with him disagreed before he said that. So I don't think it changed any views in the Republican Party in the Senate.\"",
      "Senate GOP leadership has already been contending with opposition from the fiscal hawks, along with a handful of other senators who oppose Medicaid restrictions, among other things. Key GOP senators have been conducting meetings in recent days to iron out the disagreement, with opposition from just four Senate Republicans enough to tank the bill.",
      "Cristina  Corujo\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

    "summary": "A Guatemalan man was returned to the U.S. on the orders of a federal judge, in the first high-profile case of its kind.",
    "story": [
      "The Trump administration has returned a Guatemalan man to the United States after a judge determined he was wrongly deported without due process, his legal team told CBS News.",
      "The man, who has gone by O.C.G. in court proceedings, landed in the United States today and made contact with lawyers representing him after he landed, said Trina Realmuto, one of his attorneys and the executive director of the National Immigration Litigation Alliance.",
      "Last month, the Trump administration said in court filings it was working to secure a charter flight to return him, after U.S. District Judge Brian Murphy of Boston said he must be returned. This was the first high-profile case in which the Trump administration has brought back someone who was removed from the country after a judge ordered their return.",
      "Realmuto said that she expects the man will be taken into government custody as he seeks protection from persecution via due process proceedings.",
      "She said the man is \"nervous, scared and thankful to be returned to the United States.\"",
      "O.C.G.'s attorneys argued that he has no criminal history and sought asylum in the United States after multiple violent attacks against him in his native country of Guatemala.",
      "In March 2024, O.C.G. entered the United States illegally and was deported, according to court filings. After making it back to the United States again last year, he presented himself to Border Patrol for asylum proceedings. An immigration judge found in February 2025 that O.C.G. would face serious harm if he were sent back to Guatemala and ordered a \"withholding of removal\" that barred deportation back to his home country.",
      "Two days after the immigration judge's February decision, O.C.G. says he was placed on a bus and removed without due process to Mexico, where his attorneys said he was previously held for ransom and raped during his second attempt to get to the United States. He submitted evidence at his immigration hearing of his experiences in Mexico, and as a result the immigration judge said that O.C.G. could not be removed to a country other than Guatemala without additional due process.",
      "After O.C.G. was sent to Mexico by the United States, Mexican authorities removed him to Guatemala, where he had to remain in hiding until his return, according to court documents.",
      "\"[The] immigration judge told O.C.G.\u2014 consistent with this Court's understanding of the law\u2014that he could not be removed to a country other than his native Guatemala, at least not without some additional steps in the process,\" Murphy wrote in an order requiring his return. \"Those necessary steps, and O.C.G.'s pleas for help, were ignored.\"",
      "Murphy had previously ordered additional fact-finding in the case, after the Trump administration submitted a declaration under oath that O.C.G. told government officials that he had no fear of being sent to Mexico. O.C.G had previously submitted a declaration to the court stating that he was told at the last minute before his removal that he was being sent to Mexico, and that he was denied a request to speak to his attorneys beforehand.",
      "The Justice Department admitted to Murphy that there was no witness who could verify the government's account of O.C.G.'s removal under oath and the declaration was made in error.",
      "\"The only evidence before the Court therefore is O.C.G.'s uncontroverted assertion that he was given no notice of his transfer to Mexico and no opportunity to explain why it would be dangerous to send him there,\" Murphy wrote in his order mandating the man's return.",
      "\"Defendants' retraction of their prior sworn statement makes inexorable the already-strong conclusion that O.C.G. is likely to succeed in showing that his removal lacked any semblance of due process,\" the judge added.",
      "Realmuto said that her legal team was still working to get in touch with eight defendants in the same case who were allegedly flown without due process to East Africa, with a final destination of South Sudan. They are still currently being held in Djibouti after Murphy ordered the government to \"maintain custody and control\" of the migrants as they are given \"reasonable fear\" interviews to screen them for concerns about being harmed in a third country.",
      "If they do not satisfy the reasonable fear standard, the government must give them at least 15 days to challenge their removal. Murphy says the men can be held either in the U.S. or abroad, as long as the government maintains custody over them.",

    "published": "Wed, 04 Jun 2025 18:35:03 -0400",
    "summary": "More than 100 Venezuelan men who were sent to a prison in El Salvador must get an opportunity to challenge their detention, Judge TK James Boasberg ruled.",
    "story": [
      "A federal judge in Washington, D.C., ordered the Trump administration to give more than 100 Venezuelan men it sent to a supermax prison in El Salvador earlier this year a chance to contest their deportation, the latest development after months of legal battles over the fate of the deportees.",
      "U.S. District Judge James Boasberg found that the 137 men removed to El Salvador on March 15 under the 1798 Alien Enemies Act had been \"plainly deprived\" of their due process rights. The Trump administration has argued the 18th century wartime law allows the government to summarily deport Venezuelans identified to be gang members, though that argument has been rejected by several federal judges. The deportees are held in El Salvador's Terrorism Confinement Center prison, or CECOT.",
      "Boasberg concluded that the secretive deportations to El Salvador in March had \"improperly withheld\" from the deportees due process rights that he said \"must now be afforded to them.\"",
      "The order by Boasberg gave the Justice Department one week to say how it intends to provide the 137 Venezuelan deportees an opportunity to seek relief under the constitutional principle of habeas corpus, which allows people to challenge their detention.",
      "The Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "\"As is now clear, CECOT Class members were entitled to notice and an opportunity to challenge their removability pursuant to the Proclamation. That process \u2014 which was improperly withheld \u2014 must now be afforded to them. Put differently, Plaintiffs' ability to bring habeas challenges to their removal must be restored,\" Boasberg wrote. The judge added that the men \"must be allowed the practical opportunity to seek habeas relief that they were previously denied,\" and their cases must be handled as if they had never been removed to El Salvador in the first place.",
      "Boasberg ruled that he does not have jurisdiction over Venezuelan men who are subject to the Alien Enemies Act proclamation and are still in state or federal custody. The judge said he cannot grant them relief from his position on the bench in D.C. after the American Civil Liberties Union asked for relief for both groups of men.",
      "The Trump administration has repeatedly said all the Venezuelan men deported to El Salvador are dangerous criminals and members of Tren de Aragua, a prison gang that the president labeled a wartime enemy and terrorist group. But a \"60 Minutes\" and CBS News review of the migrants' cases found that an overwhelming majority of the men have no apparent criminal convictions or charges.",
      "The Venezuelan migrants deported to El Salvador and imprisoned at CECOT include Andry Romero Hernandez, a gay makeup artist whom an independent journalist photographed weeping when he was transferred to the maximum-security facility.",
      "Boasberg also expressed concerns about the government's claims that all the deportees are gangsters, saying, \"significant evidence has come to light indicating that many of those currently entombed in CECOT have no connection to the gang and thus languish in a foreign prison on flimsy, even frivolous, accusations.\"",
      "\"The court correctly held that the government cannot simply wash its hands of all responsibility for these constitutional violations and leave these men to linger in a brutal prison, perhaps for the rest of their lives,\" said Lee Gelernt, the ACLU lawyer leading the legal challenge against the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act.",
      "The March 15 deportation flights at the center of the legal fight overseen by Boasberg sent roughly 240 Venezuelan men to El Salvador, alongside roughly two dozen Salvadorans accused of gang membership. According to government officials, 137 of the Venezuelans were expelled under the Alien Enemies Act, which allows deportations during a foreign invasion, while the rest were deported under regular immigration law.",
      "Earlier this year, Boasberg blocked deportations under the Alien Enemies Act, after a challenge was brought by the ACLU on behalf of a group of Venezuelan migrants who sought to prevent their removal under the more than 200-year-old wartime law.",
      "After an appeal of Boasberg's order by the Trump administration, the Supreme Court in April allowed the Trump administration to restart removals under the Alien Enemies Act, but mandated that those subject to removal are entitled to some level of due process, including a notice before their deportation.",
      "While the April Supreme Court ruling prohibited Boasberg from granting nationwide relief to those currently in state and local detention across the country, the ACLU asked him to consider the case of the men who are already in CECOT given that there are no other legal jurisdictions that apply.",
      "In April, Boasberg found that probable cause exists to find the Trump administration in criminal contempt over what he said was its \"willful disregard\" of his order to turn two planes carrying the men around.",
      "The judge said the Trump administration can remedy the breach of his order before contempt proceedings are initiated by asserting custody over the migrants who were removed in violation of it, so they can assert their right to challenge their removability. That has not happened yet, and the Trump administration has argued in both this case and the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia \u2014 who was deported due to an \"administrative error\" \u2014 that it does not have custody over the men, because they are technically under the control of the Salvadoran government.",
      "President Trump and his allies have repeatedly attacked Boasberg over his handling of the case that arose after the president issued a proclamation in March invoking the Alien Enemies Act.",
      "Jake Rosen is a reporter covering the Department of Justice. He was previously a campaign digital reporter covering President Trump's 2024 campaign and also served as an associate producer for \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan,\" where he worked with Brennan for two years on the broadcast.

      "Thomasz Szabo was an invisible menace, according to federal prosecutors. His alleged targets: They are quite visible.",
      "Szabo, a Romanian national, has pleaded guilty to leading a scheme to target dozens of politicians and social media influencers with a wave of \"swatting\" attacks.",
      "According to court filings, Szabo began building a network of \"swatters\" in 2018 to unleash havoc on public figures in the United States.",
      "In a swatting hoax, a false emergency call is made to police to lure a SWAT team to a target's home.\tThe swatting call often falsely claims a mass shooting or hostage situation is underway, so as to create an exceptionally large police response and raise the risk of a confrontation at the victim's home.",
      "According to the Justice Department, \"Szabo made false reports to U.S. law enforcement including a threat in December 2020 to commit a mass shooting at New York City synagogues, and a threat in January 2021 to detonate explosives at the U.S. Capitol and kill the President-elect\"\u2014likely referring to Joe Biden.",
      "A plea agreement reviewed by CBS News said Szabo's co-conspirators also targeted at least 25 members of Congress or their families, six executive branch officials and Cabinet members, judges, members of the media and at least two dozen former government officials.",
      "He was extradited from Romania late last year and will be sentenced on federal conspiracy and threat charges in October.",
      "According to the court filings, Szabo's conspiracy sought to victimize targets with large audiences and social media followings, amplifying the impact of the attacks. \"The defendant sought to target those who would react publicly to having been swatted.\" His plea agreement said Szabo's conspiracy would target \"streamers\" who were broadcasting or speaking to an audience online during the attacks.",
      "Among those who say they were targeted was a prolific conservative social media figure known as \"Catturd,\" who posted earlier this week to his 3 million X followers, \"This is the guy who swatted me the first three times.\"",
      "Szabo publicized his \"swatting\" activity to his followers and encouraged them to engage in similar behavior, court documents say. Prosecutors said, \"One of (his) subordinates bragged to Szabo:\u00a0 'I did 25+ swattings today,\" and, 'creating massive havoc in [A]merica. $500,000+ in taxpayers wasted in just two days.\"",
      "Szabo sought to find and inspire others to execute swattings, according to the Justice Department.",
      "Former Department of Homeland Security Undersecretary of Intelligence John Cohen told CBS News, \"Increasingly, swatters are doing more than just incentivizing or inspiring attacks.\u00a0 We are seeing the posting of content that is intended to give people detailed instructions on how to carry out the activity.\"",
      "Cohen said the technology and techniques employed by swatters are becoming more sophisticated and potent. \"If a swatting call involves reporting a fictitious active shooter event, they'll use artificial intelligence-generated sound effects depicting the sounds of gunfire. That's meant to give it credibility,\" Cohen said.",
      "In Szabo's case, prosecutors alleged he used an internet-based phone platform to execute some hoaxes, which could mask identifying information about Szabo or his co-conspirators.",
      "Although charging documents do not name which members of Congress were targeted and disrupted by Szabo or his co-conspirators, several lawmakers have publicly acknowledged being victims of recent swatting attacks across the country.",
      "In a 2023 case spotlighted by CBS News, then-Rep. Brandon Williams, a central New York Republican, said the swatting happened on Christmas Day at his home. Williams told CBS News, \"I organized my family in the kitchen and told them to hang out and keep their hands visible,\" to avoid any confusion by officers when police arrived. Williams said the swatting attack put his family in danger. After the police came inside to confirm the call was a hoax, Williams said he began packing the deputies bags with his holiday cookies.",
      "Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Georgia Republican, has publicly posted about a series of recent swatting incidents, including one on Christmas Day 2023, the same day Williams was targeted. Greene wrote on social media at the time, \"I was just swatted. This is like the 8th time. On Christmas with my family here. My local police are the GREATEST and shouldn't have to deal with this.\"",

      "Swatting has vexed law enforcement for years \u2014 wasting police resources and, in at least one 2017 case unrelated to Szabo, ending in a fatal police shooting. Authorities are also contending with a rise in threats against public officials \u2014 from lawmakers to judges and prosecutors \u2014 including an eerie and menacing trend in which judges are sent unsolicited pizza orders, indicating that some unknown person knows their personal address.",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi issued a statement about Szabo's guilty plea in federal court in Washington, D.C.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 President Trump's sweeping tariff plan would cut deficits by $2.8 trillion over a 10-year period while shrinking the economy, raising the inflation rate and reducing the purchasing power of households overall, according to an analysis released Wednesday by the Congressional Budget Office.",
      "The numbers were revealed in a letter sent to Democratic congressional leadership outlining how the Trump administration's plan to impose wide-ranging tariffs on countries around the world will affect American households.",
      "Baked into the CBO analysis is a prediction that households would ultimately buy less from the countries hit with added tariffs. The budget office estimates that the tariffs would increase the average annual rate of inflation by 0.4 percentage points in 2025 and 2026.",
      "The budget office's model also assumes that the tariffs, announced through executive action between January and May, will be in place permanently. \"If the Administration makes additional changes to tariffs, the budget baseline will be adjusted to reflect the budgetary implications of those changes as they take effect,\" CBO Director Phillip Swagel wrote.",
      "Since the analysis was conducted, a federal court struck down sweeping tariffs that Mr. Trump invoked under an emergency-powers law. An appeals court allowed the Trump administration to continue collecting the tariffs while the case goes through appeals.",
      "Largely confirming what other economic models have predicted, the CBO's estimations show that the tradeoff for a $2.8 trillion deficit reduction over 10 years would be an overall reduction in household wealth. In addition, the tariffs would shrink the economy, or reduce the rate of the gross domestic product by 0.06 percentage points per year.",
      "The Penn-Wharton Budget Model's April report predicted that the Republican president's tariffs would reduce long-run GDP by about 6% and wages by 5%.",
      "A major caveat of the CBO's estimates is written into the report \u2014 its estimates are \"subject to significant uncertainty, in part because the Administration could change how the tariff policies are administered.\"",
      "The evaluation also does not appear to take into account any impact from Mr. Trump's massive tax and budget bill currently being debated in Congress. The CBO released another estimate earlier Tuesday showing that the legislation would increase deficits by a total of roughly $2.4 trillion over 10 years. White House have argued that any deficit increase caused by the \"one big, beautiful bill\" would be offset by the \"reciprocal\" tariff plans, and touted the CBO's new analysis on Tuesday.",
      "Mr. Trump has often announced changes and pauses to his tariff plans on his social media platform.",
      "In April, he posted that he was backing off his tariffs on most nations for 90 days and jacking up the tax rate on Chinese imports to 125%.",
      "Last week, he announced plans to hike the tariffs on steel and aluminum imports to a punishing 50%, a move that's set to hammer businesses and likely push up prices for consumers even further. The 50% tariffs went into effect Wednesday.",
      "The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development forecast Tuesday that the U.S. economy, the world's largest, will slow growth to just 1.5% in 2026.",

The CBO projection puts the spending cuts at about $1.2 trillion over the next decade, with the tax cuts totaling just under $3.7 trillion. The national debt currently stands at roughly $36 trillion, according to the Treasury Department.",
      "The package, which Mr. Trump and Republican lawmakers refer to as the \"one big, beautiful bill,\" is now in the hands of the Senate after making it out of the House before Memorial Day. The bill is expected to undergo changes in the Senate before heading back to the lower chamber.",
      "Though Republicans vowed to protect Medicaid benefits and have framed cuts to the program as trimming \"waste, fraud and abuse,\" the analysis found that the portion of the bill dealing with Medicaid would mean 7.8 million fewer people being enrolled in the safety net program. Federal spending on Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act would be reduced by $902 billion over a decade.",
      "Another 1.3 million people would be without insurance due to changes in the Affordable Care Act. The bill would also eliminate state-funded insurance for 1.4 million people \"without verified citizenship, nationality, or satisfactory immigration status,\" the CBO said.",
      "Medicaid, a popular entitlement program, provides government-sponsored health care for more than 70 million low-income adults, children and people with disabilities. The House bill includes new work requirements that would apply to childless Medicaid recipients without disabilities between the ages of 19 and 64, more frequent eligibility checks and changes to how states can finance their share of the costs of the program.",
      "Cuts to federal food assistance programs, which includes Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, would save more than $294 billion over 10 years, according to the analysis. House Republicans plan to achieve the savings by requiring states to cover a share of the costs to provide benefits that help low-income individuals and families pay for groceries and by expanding work requirements.",
      "About 42 million people benefited from SNAP, also known as food stamps, in fiscal year 2023, with recipients receiving an average of $211 each month in benefits, according to the Department of Agriculture.",
      "House Republican leadership dismissed the CBO's findings Wednesday morning, arguing that it ignores economic growth that will stem from their policies.",

    "story": [
      "Four-and-a-half months after launch atop a Falcon 9 rocket, a privately-built Japanese moon lander is finally in position for a descent to touchdown Thursday. It comes two years after the company's first lander ran out of gas and crashed to the lunar surface.",
      "The Resilience lander, carrying cameras, a few scientific instruments and a tiny rover, was expected to drop out of a 62-mile-high orbit and touch down at 3:17 p.m. EDT near the center of Mare Frigoris \u2014 the Sea of Cold \u2014 in the moon's northern hemisphere at 60 degrees north latitude.",
      "\"For Mission 2, our second attempt at landing on the moon, we will not only land the Resilience lander, but we will also use a mechanism to deploy the Tenacious rover, which we developed in house, to explore the lunar surface,\" Ryo Ujiie, chief technology officer of ispace, the lander's builder, said on the company's web page.",
      "\"Tenacious will explore the lunar surface, deploy a customer payload and collect regolith. Resilience will continue to operate the customer payloads on board and transmit valuable telemetry data to our mission control center.\"",
      "The customer payload is a tiny model of a Swedish house, designed by artist Mikael Genberg. The traditionally styled red-and-white house measures just 4.7 inches long and 4 inches high and weighs just 3.5 ounces.",
      "Asked why he took on the project, which required years of planning, fund-raising and engineering, Genberg said \"we have done as human beings things from time to time that (do not) seemingly have a purpose beyond just being creative.\"",
      "\"The Eiffel Tower, for instance, I mean it's a stupid thing to build,\" he said. \"Today, it has a purpose as maybe the most important thing to make Paris the most visited city in the world.\"",
      "While the \"moonhouse\" will survive for thousands if not millions of years in the airless environment of the moon, its custom paint will fade in the sun's harsh radiation and lunar dust will slowly coat its surface. Genberg joked that he would happily await an invitation to repaint it.",
      "The house will be dropped from the rover a few days after landing, and the team hopes to capture photos with Earth in the background. The cost of the project was not disclosed, but a spokesman said it was similar to what one might pay for a relatively large house on Earth.",
      "ispace is one of a handful of companies attempting to provide non-government transportation services to the moon for a variety of payloads ranging from science instruments to technology demonstrations.",
      "But as it turns out, getting low-cost spacecraft to the moon's surface is extremely difficult.",
      "ispace tried and\u00a0failed in 2023\u00a0when its first lander ran out of propellant nearing the surface, dropping to a \"hard\" crash landing. Pittsburgh-based Astrobotic Technology launched its\u00a0Peregrine lander in January 2024, but the spacecraft suffered a propulsion system leak and never made it to the moon.",
      "Houston-based Intuitive Machines successfully put two landers down on the lunar surface\u00a0in 2024\u00a0and again\u00a0earlier this year, but both spacecraft tipped over on touchdown. While each one survived its landing, neither was able to accomplish all of its pre-flight objectives.",
      "Before Thursday, only one company, Austin-based Firefly Aerospace, had successfully touched down and carried out its mission, landing the\u00a0Blue Ghost spacecraft on March 2, 53 years after the final Apollo mission.",
      "Resilience and Blue Ghost\u00a0were launched atop a single SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket on Jan. 15. The Blue Ghost lander took a direct route to the moon and carried out a successful touchdown, operating for a full two-week lunar \"day.\"",
      "Resilience followed a longer, low-energy trajectory that carried it well past its target, using the moon's gravity to bring it back to an initially elliptical orbit and finally, using its thrusters, to the 100-kilometer (62-mile) circular orbit that set the stage for descent.",

    "story": [
      "The fungus labeled a \"potential agroterrorism weapon\" in a recent arrest touted by the Trump administration likely originated in North America and is already widely prevalent around the country, a researcher who studied the fungus for the federal government says.",
      "University of Michigan researcher Yunqing Jian and her boyfriend, Zunyong Liu, were charged with trying to smuggle strains of a fungus called Fusarium graminearum into the United States. Jian worked at the University of Michigan, according to officials, and Liu works at a Chinese university. The two have co-authored research into the fungus.",
      "\"I can confirm that the FBI arrested a Chinese national within the United States who allegedly smuggled a dangerous biological pathogen into the country,\" FBI Director Kash Patel said Tuesday in a post\u00a0on X.",
      "According to charging documents in the case, Liu told customs officers he was trying to continue his research with the strains at the University of Michigan lab that Jian worked in, skirting the rules that require paperwork and safeguards to safely import fungi for studies.",
      "F. graminearum is already widely prevalent across the U.S. in native grasses around the country as well as crops, scientists say. It spreads and thrives usually during wet weather, causing a common crop disease called Fusarium head blight or head scab, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Agricultural Research Service.",
      "\"It's extremely prevalent in North America. It likely arose in North America, so it's not like a foreign agent coming in. And it's already causing a lot of problems in U.S. agriculture,\" Harold Kistler, an adjunct professor at the University of Minnesota, told CBS News.",
      "Kistler said scientists believe F. graminearum likely originated in North America, because all of its closest relatives have been found on the continent.",
      "\"Graminearum itself is distributed worldwide, and likely because of the distribution of grain from North America worldwide,\" he said.",
      "Kistler previously worked as a researcher for the USDA's Agricultural Research Service, studying fungi like F. graminearum and the crop disease it causes. While at the agency, he co-authored research with Liu and Jian uncovering new molecular clues to how the disease might be mitigated.",
      "\"It's a real problem. The problem is because there's no naturally occurring resistance to the disease. And people have been trying for decades to find resistance. It's just a tough nut to crack,\" Kistler said of the head blight caused by F. graminearum.",
      "Farmers in the U.S. rely on a number of methods to mitigate the risk of F. graminearum, including the use of fungicides, though scientists have worried about the possibility of mutations that could make the fungicides less effective.",
      "\"The fungicides are not cheap. So it's extra cost to farmers. But it's worth it because, without it, their crops could be completely lost. Not only due to yield reduction, but because what grain they may have would be contaminated with these toxins,\" Kistler said.",
      "Billions of dollars were lost to epidemics caused by the fungus in the 1990s, researchers and agriculture officials estimate. The Food and Drug Administration monitors for the toxins that are produced by fungi like F. graminearum, including deoxynivalenol, also called vomitoxin or DON, which can cause vomiting and diarrhea in humans who ingest too much of it.",
      "\"It is not possible to completely avoid the presence of DON in wheat. DON is sometimes found in wheat grown under normal weather conditions, however, the fungus thrives in cool, wet conditions,\" the FDA said in a 2010 advisory to states and grain groups.",
      "Kistler said U.S. distributors also test grain for the presence of the toxins to prevent there being too much of it in the food supply.",
      "\"If it's too high, they will reject it. They won't buy it. Or they will reduce the amount that they'll pay for it. If it's just marginal, they can blend it with grain that doesn't have the toxin to get below the limit of what's considered safe,\" he said.",

    "summary": "It had not been thought possible that such tiny, weak stars could provide the conditions needed to form and host huge planets.",
    "story": [
      "Astronomers announced Wednesday they have discovered a massive planet orbiting a tiny star, a bizarre pairing that has stumped scientists.",
      "Most of the stars across the Milky Way are small red dwarfs like TOI-6894, which has only 20% the mass of our sun.",
      "It had not been thought possible that such puny, weak stars could provide the conditions needed to form and host huge planets.",
      "But an international team of astronomers have detected the unmistakable signature of a gas giant planet orbiting the undersized TOI-6894, according to a study in the journal Nature Astronomy. This makes the star the smallest star yet known to host a gas giant.",
      "The planet has a slightly larger radius than Saturn, but only half its mass. It orbits its star in a little over three days.",
      "The astronomers discovered the planet when searching through more than 91,000 low-mass red dwarfs observed by NASA's TESS space telescope. Its existence was then confirmed by ground-based telescopes, including Chile's Very Large Telescope.",
      "\"The fact that this star hosts a giant planet has big implications for the total number of giant planets we estimate exist in our galaxy,\" study co-author Daniel Bayliss of the UK's Warwick University said in a statement.",
      "Another co-author, Vincent Van Eylen, of University College London, said it was an \"intriguing discovery.\"",
      "\"We don't really understand how a star with so little mass can form such a massive planet!\" he said. \"This is one of the goals of the search for more exoplanets. By finding planetary systems different from our solar system, we can test our models and better understand how our own solar system formed.\"",
      "Planet is unusually cold",
      "The most prominent theory for how planets form is called core accretion.",
      "The process begins when a ring of gas and dust \u2014 called a protoplanetary disc \u2014 which surrounds a newly formed star builds up into a planetary core. This core attracts more gas that forms an atmosphere, eventually snowballing into a gas giant.",
      "Under this theory, it is difficult for low-mass stars to host giant planets because there is not enough gas and dust to begin building a core in the first place.",
      "A rival theory proposes that these planets instead form when their protoplanetary disc becomes gravitationally unstable and breaks up, with the collapsing gas and dust forming a planet.",
      "However neither theory seems to explain the existence of the newly discovered planet, TOI-6894b, the researchers said.",
      "The planet also interests scientists because it is strangely cold.",
      "Most of the gas giants discovered outside our solar system so far have been what are known as \"hot Jupiters,\" where temperatures soar well over 1,000 degrees Celsius. But the newly discovered planet appears to be under 150C, the researchers said.",
      "\"Temperatures are low enough that atmospheric observations could even show us ammonia, which would be the first time it is found in an exoplanet atmosphere,\" said study co-author Amaury Triaud of Birmingham University.",
      "The James Webb space telescope is scheduled to turn its powerful gaze toward the planet in the next year, which could help uncover some more mysteries of this strange planet.",
      "Recent cosmic discoveries",
      "The spotting of the giant planet orbiting the undersized star marks the latest in a string of recent celestial discoveries.",
      "Last month, a U.S.-based trio hunting the elusive \"Planet Nine\" said they instead stumbled on what appears to be a new dwarf planet in the solar system's outer reaches. Named 2017 OF201, the new object is roughly 430 miles across, according to a preprint study, making it three times smaller than Pluto.",
      "Also in May, an international team reported that a newly found celestial object \u2014 perhaps a star, pair of stars or something else entirely \u2014 is emitting X-rays around the same time it's shooting out radio waves.",
      "Meanwhile, scientists announced recently that a new planetarium show about the Milky Way helped them unlock one of the solar system's many secrets. Experts at the American Museum of Natural History in New York were fine-tuning a scene about the Oort Cloud that's far beyond Pluto. Scientists have never glimpsed this region, but when museum experts projected their scene onto the planetarium dome, created using simulation data, they saw a spiral shape.",

The show features many vivid scenes that may capture audiences more than the Oort Cloud, said the museum's Jon Parker, including an ongoing merge of the Sagittarius mini galaxy with the Milky Way.",
      "No matter how striking and beautiful the visuals of the show, the museum was committed to making it scientifically accurate. That's what created the perfect conditions to stumble upon something new, said the museum's Carter Emmart.",

    "story": [
      "Smoke from wildfires in Canada has drifted into the U.S., prompting air quality alerts for Americans as it continues to spread.",
      "But when officials and forecasters classify a city's air as \"unhealthy\" or \"hazardous,\" what does that really mean? The classifications are based on a federal measurement system called the Air Quality Index.",
      "What is the Air Quality Index?",
      "The Air Quality Index is used nationwide to measure the severity of air pollution and categorize the health risks that are involved with various levels of pollution. The index uses six color-coded categories: good (green), moderate (yellow), unhealthy for sensitive groups (orange), unhealthy (red), very unhealthy (purple) and hazardous (maroon).",
      "The health impacts included in the index are those that people are likely to experience within \"a few hours or days\" after being exposed to the air, the National Weather Service Says.",
      "How is air quality measured?",
      "The National Weather Service says that the Environmental Protection Agency calculates the Air Quality Index \u2014 a value between 0 and 500 \u2014 based on five \"major pollutants.\"",
      "Those pollutants \u2014 ground-level ozone, particulate matter, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide \u2014 are all regulated by the Clean Air Act. Of those, ground-level ozone and airborne particles are considered \"the greatest threat to human health.\"",
      "What do the numbers mean?",
      "Each Air Quality Index category, also known as the level of concern, is attached to a certain range of values:",
      "Good (green): 0 to 50Moderate (yellow): 51 to 100Unhealthy for sensitive groups (orange): 101 to 150Unhealthy (red): 151 to 200\u00a0Very unhealthy (purple): 201 to 300\u00a0Hazardous (marron): 301 and higher",

      "Very unhealthy (purple): 201 to 300",
      "Hazardous (marron): 301 and higher",
      "Essentially, the lower the number, the cleaner the air. The only category where air quality is considered \"satisfactory\" is the one where the index value is no more than 50, although values between 51 and 100 are still considered \"acceptable.\" After that, the air could pose a risk to at least some people, and that risk only becomes greater as the index value rises.",
      "Once the air is deemed \"very unhealthy,\" the general public is at risk of experiencing health impacts, which range from a headache and fatigue to much more serious issues such as heart attack or stroke. At \"hazardous\" levels, the region is experiencing an air quality emergency. Those with chronic respiratory or cardiovascular conditions are more at risk of developing serious health issues as pollution worsens.",
      "What is the air quality near me?",
      "Air Quality Index values change constantly throughout the day as weather conditions and weather patterns move through the area. The map below automatically updates to show air quality conditions nationwide.",
      "The EPA's\u00a0AirNow.gov site uses the index to provide the latest status for your area. To use the site, enter your ZIP code and a meter will pop up showing you what the value and color category is for your city, as well as the last time that measurement was updated.",
      "It also tells you what pollutant is causing issues, who is most at risk for health complications and what activities may be safe to do.",
      "In Minneapolis, for example, the reading on Tuesday morning, June 3, said the AQI for PM2.5, a kind of particulate matter, is 203, meaning \"very unhealthy,\" and that people who have heart or lung disease, those who are elderly, and children and teens should avoid outdoor physical activity.

      "The Resilience lander, carrying cameras, a few scientific instruments and a tiny rover, was expected to drop out of a 62-mile-high orbit and touch down at 3:17 p.m. EDT near the center of Mare Frigoris \u2014 the Sea of Cold \u2014 in the moon's northern hemisphere at 60 degrees north latitude.",
      "\"For Mission 2, our second attempt at landing on the moon, we will not only land the Resilience lander, but we will also use a mechanism to deploy the Tenacious rover, which we developed in house, to explore the lunar surface,\" Ryo Ujiie, chief technology officer of ispace, the lander's builder, said on the company's web page.",
      "\"Tenacious will explore the lunar surface, deploy a customer payload and collect regolith. Resilience will continue to operate the customer payloads on board and transmit valuable telemetry data to our mission control center.\"",
      "The customer payload is a tiny model of a Swedish house, designed by artist Mikael Genberg. The traditionally styled red-and-white house measures just 4.7 inches long and 4 inches high and weighs just 3.5 ounces.",
      "Asked why he took on the project, which required years of planning, fund-raising and engineering, Genberg said \"we have done as human beings things from time to time that (do not) seemingly have a purpose beyond just being creative.\"",
      "\"The Eiffel Tower, for instance, I mean it's a stupid thing to build,\" he said. \"Today, it has a purpose as maybe the most important thing to make Paris the most visited city in the world.\"",
      "While the \"moonhouse\" will survive for thousands if not millions of years in the airless environment of the moon, its custom paint will fade in the sun's harsh radiation and lunar dust will slowly coat its surface. Genberg joked that he would happily await an invitation to repaint it.",
      "The house will be dropped from the rover a few days after landing, and the team hopes to capture photos with Earth in the background. The cost of the project was not disclosed, but a spokesman said it was similar to what one might pay for a relatively large house on Earth.",
      "ispace is one of a handful of companies attempting to provide non-government transportation services to the moon for a variety of payloads ranging from science instruments to technology demonstrations.",
      "But as it turns out, getting low-cost spacecraft to the moon's surface is extremely difficult.",
      "ispace tried and\u00a0failed in 2023\u00a0when its first lander ran out of propellant nearing the surface, dropping to a \"hard\" crash landing. Pittsburgh-based Astrobotic Technology launched its\u00a0Peregrine lander in January 2024, but the spacecraft suffered a propulsion system leak and never made it to the moon.",
      "Houston-based Intuitive Machines successfully put two landers down on the lunar surface\u00a0in 2024\u00a0and again\u00a0earlier this year, but both spacecraft tipped over on touchdown. While each one survived its landing, neither was able to accomplish all of its pre-flight objectives.",
      "Before Thursday, only one company, Austin-based Firefly Aerospace, had successfully touched down and carried out its mission, landing the\u00a0Blue Ghost spacecraft on March 2, 53 years after the final Apollo mission.",
      "Resilience and Blue Ghost\u00a0were launched atop a single SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket on Jan. 15. The Blue Ghost lander took a direct route to the moon and carried out a successful touchdown, operating for a full two-week lunar \"day.\"",
      "Resilience followed a longer, low-energy trajectory that carried it well past its target, using the moon's gravity to bring it back to an initially elliptical orbit and finally, using its thrusters, to the 100-kilometer (62-mile) circular orbit that set the stage for descent.",

    "summary": "It had not been thought possible that such tiny, weak stars could provide the conditions needed to form and host huge planets.",
    "story": [
      "Astronomers announced Wednesday they have discovered a massive planet orbiting a tiny star, a bizarre pairing that has stumped scientists.",
      "Most of the stars across the Milky Way are small red dwarfs like TOI-6894, which has only 20% the mass of our sun.",
      "It had not been thought possible that such puny, weak stars could provide the conditions needed to form and host huge planets.",
      "But an international team of astronomers have detected the unmistakable signature of a gas giant planet orbiting the undersized TOI-6894, according to a study in the journal Nature Astronomy. This makes the star the smallest star yet known to host a gas giant.",
      "The planet has a slightly larger radius than Saturn, but only half its mass. It orbits its star in a little over three days.",
      "The astronomers discovered the planet when searching through more than 91,000 low-mass red dwarfs observed by NASA's TESS space telescope. Its existence was then confirmed by ground-based telescopes, including Chile's Very Large Telescope.",
      "\"The fact that this star hosts a giant planet has big implications for the total number of giant planets we estimate exist in our galaxy,\" study co-author Daniel Bayliss of the UK's Warwick University said in a statement.",
      "Another co-author, Vincent Van Eylen, of University College London, said it was an \"intriguing discovery.\"",
      "\"We don't really understand how a star with so little mass can form such a massive planet!\" he said. \"This is one of the goals of the search for more exoplanets. By finding planetary systems different from our solar system, we can test our models and better understand how our own solar system formed.\"",
      "Planet is unusually cold",
      "The most prominent theory for how planets form is called core accretion.",
      "The process begins when a ring of gas and dust \u2014 called a protoplanetary disc \u2014 which surrounds a newly formed star builds up into a planetary core. This core attracts more gas that forms an atmosphere, eventually snowballing into a gas giant.",
      "Under this theory, it is difficult for low-mass stars to host giant planets because there is not enough gas and dust to begin building a core in the first place.",
      "A rival theory proposes that these planets instead form when their protoplanetary disc becomes gravitationally unstable and breaks up, with the collapsing gas and dust forming a planet.",
      "However neither theory seems to explain the existence of the newly discovered planet, TOI-6894b, the researchers said.",
      "The planet also interests scientists because it is strangely cold.",
      "Most of the gas giants discovered outside our solar system so far have been what are known as \"hot Jupiters,\" where temperatures soar well over 1,000 degrees Celsius. But the newly discovered planet appears to be under 150C, the researchers said.",
      "\"Temperatures are low enough that atmospheric observations could even show us ammonia, which would be the first time it is found in an exoplanet atmosphere,\" said study co-author Amaury Triaud of Birmingham University.",
      "The James Webb space telescope is scheduled to turn its powerful gaze toward the planet in the next year, which could help uncover some more mysteries of this strange planet.",
      "Recent cosmic discoveries",
      "The spotting of the giant planet orbiting the undersized star marks the latest in a string of recent celestial discoveries.",
      "Last month, a U.S.-based trio hunting the elusive \"Planet Nine\" said they instead stumbled on what appears to be a new dwarf planet in the solar system's outer reaches. Named 2017 OF201, the new object is roughly 430 miles across, according to a preprint study, making it three times smaller than Pluto.",
      "Also in May, an international team reported that a newly found celestial object \u2014 perhaps a star, pair of stars or something else entirely \u2014 is emitting X-rays around the same time it's shooting out radio waves.",
      "Meanwhile, scientists announced recently that a new planetarium show about the Milky Way helped them unlock one of the solar system's many secrets. Experts at the American Museum of Natural History in New York were fine-tuning a scene about the Oort Cloud that's far beyond Pluto. Scientists have never glimpsed this region, but when museum experts projected their scene onto the planetarium dome, created using simulation data, they saw a spiral shape.",
      "Scientists had long thought the Oort Cloud was shaped like a sphere or flattened shell, warped by the push and pull of other planets and the Milky Way itself. The planetarium show hinted that a more complex shape could lie inside.",
      "The Associated  Press\n                  \n        contributed to this report.",

      "At the American Museum of Natural History last fall, experts were hard at work preparing \"Encounters in the Milky Way,\" a deep dive into our home galaxy shaped by the movements of stars and other celestial objects.",
      "They were fine-tuning a scene featuring what's known as the Oort Cloud, a region far beyond Pluto filled with icy relics from the solar system's formation. Comets can hurtle toward Earth from the cloud, but scientists have never glimpsed its true shape.",
      "One evening while watching the Oort Cloud scene, scientists noticed something strange projected onto the planetarium's dome.",
      "\"Why is there a spiral there?\" said Jackie Faherty, an astrophysicist who leads the museum's educational programs and helped put together the planetarium show.",
      "The inner section of the Oort Cloud, made of billions of comets, resembled a bar with two waving arms, similar to the shape of our Milky Way galaxy.",
      "Scientists had long thought the Oort Cloud was shaped like a sphere or flattened shell, warped by the push and pull of other planets and the Milky Way itself. The planetarium show hinted that a more complex shape could lie inside.",
      "The museum contacted the researcher who provided the Oort Cloud data for the show, who was also surprised to see the spiral.",
      "\"It's kind of a freak accident that it actually happened,\" said David Nesvorny with the Southwest Research Institute.",
      "Realizing they'd stumbled on something new, the researchers published their findings earlier this year in The Astrophysical Journal.",
      "The spiral is \"a striking shift in our understanding of the outer solar system,\" planetary scientist Andre Izidoro with Rice University, who was not involved with the study, said in an email.",
      "The discovery, relying on data on how celestial objects move and using simulations, will be difficult to confirm with observations. But knowing more about the orbits of distant comets could give scientists some clues, Izidoro said.",
      "While putting together the planetarium show, the museum's experts weren't expecting a window into the universe's inner workings. The show features many vivid scenes that may capture audiences more than the Oort Cloud, said the museum's Jon Parker, including an ongoing merge of the Sagittarius mini galaxy with the Milky Way.",
      "No matter how striking and beautiful the visuals of the show, the museum was committed to making it scientifically accurate. That's what created the perfect conditions to stumble upon something new, said the museum's Carter Emmart.",
      "\"You just never know what you're going to find,\" Emmart said.",
      "According to the planetarium, \"Encounters in the Milky Way\" \u2014 narrated by actor Pedro Pascal \u2014 is a \"a time-traveling journey about the cosmic movements that shape our galactic neighborhood.\"",
      "The film, a collaboration of astronomers and science visualization experts, pulls from data from the European Space Agency's Gaia mission. The mission is called the \"billion-star survey\" as it aims to map the precise positions and motions of nearly 2 billion stars in our galaxy.",
      "The show opens to the public on Monday.",

      "Washington \u2014 President Trump spoke to Chinese President Xi Jinping on Thursday morning about the ongoing trade dispute between the U.S. and China, with Mr. Trump saying the two leaders agreed to have their teams resume talks \"shortly.\"",
      "Mr. Trump wrote on Truth Social that he and Xi spoke for 90 minutes and addressed a number of outstanding issues surrounding a temporary truce reached on May 12 that was meant to alleviate the escalating trade war between the two countries. He said the conversation \"was focused almost entirely on TRADE\" and \"resulted in a very positive conclusion for both Countries.\"",
      "Under the\u00a0May 12 deal, the U.S. agreed to reduce tariffs on Chinese goods to around 30% from 145%, while China reduced its levies on American imports to 10%. The 90-day accord was meant to give both sides breathing room to strike a broader agreement, but talks soon stalled.",
      "Last week, Mr. Trump\u00a0accused\u00a0China of violating the May 12 deal. U.S. officials have said China is withholding some products, including rare earth minerals, that it agreed to resume exporting under the agreement. Earlier this week, China\u00a0said\u00a0the U.S. is undermining the deal by imposing new export control guidelines on AI chips and planning to revoke Chinese student visas.",
      "In his post after Thursday's call with Xi, Mr. Trump said there \"should no longer be any questions respecting the complexity of Rare Earth products.\" He said high-level talks between U.S. and Chinese officials would resume \"shortly at a location to be determined,\" and that the U.S. would be represented by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer.",
      "The president echoed his statement in remarks to reporters at the White House later in the day. \"I think we're in very good shape with China and the trade deal. We have a deal with China, as you know, but we were straightening out some of the points, having to do mostly with rare earths, magnets and other things,\" he said.",
      "The U.S. president also said Xi invited him and first lady Melania Trump to China, and Mr. Trump in turn invited Xi to the U.S. \"As Presidents of two Great Nations, this is something that we both look forward to doing,\" Mr. Trump wrote. He clarified later that he intends to take Xi up on his invitation and travel to China.",
      "The Chinese Embassy in Washington said the two leaders spoke at Mr. Trump's request. The Chinese summary of the meeting said, in part: \"Recalibrating the direction of the giant ship of China-U.S. relations requires the two Presidents to take the helm and set the right course. It is particularly important to steer clear of the various disturbances and disruptions. The two countries' lead officials recently held economic and trade talks in Geneva, which marked an important step forward in resolving the relevant issues through dialogue and consultation.\"",
      "On \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Sunday, Bessent said he was expecting the two leaders to resolve their issues when they spoke.",
      "\"I am confident that when President Trump and party Chairman Xi have a call, that this will be ironed out,\" Bessent said, referring to the dispute over rare earth minerals.",
      "In an early morning post on Truth Social on Wednesday, the president wrote that \"I like President XI of China, always have, and always will, but he is VERY TOUGH, AND EXTREMELY HARD TO MAKE A DEAL WITH!!!\"",

    "summary": "The Supreme Court on Thursday blocked the Mexican government's lawsuit against major U.S. gun manufacturers, delivering a win for the firearms industry.",
    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Thursday blocked the Mexican government's lawsuit against major U.S. gun manufacturers, delivering a win for the firearms industry in a test of a federal law that shields them from civil suits.",
      "The high court unanimously rejected Mexico's arguments that its effort to hold firearms makers accountable for the violence wreaked by drug cartels armed with their products should proceed because it satisfied an exception to the liability shield provided through the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, or PLCAA.",
      "In the case known as Smith & Wesson Brands, Inc. v. Estados Unidos Mexicanos, Mexico had argued that gun manufacturers are knowingly aiding and abetting the unlawful sale of their firearms to straw purchasers, who are trafficking them across the southern border to give to drug cartels.",
      "But the justices said that because Mexico's complaint does not plausibly allege that the gunmakers criminally aided and abetted retail dealers' unlawful sale of weapons to Mexican traffickers, it is barred by PLCAA. Justice Elena Kagan delivered the opinion for the court, writing that Congress enacted the law to prevent lawsuits like Mexico's.",
      "\"The predicate exception allows for accomplice liability only when a plaintiff makes a plausible allegation that a gun manufacturer 'participate[d] in' a firearms violation 'as in something that [it] wishe[d] to bring about' and sought to make succeed,\" she wrote. \"Because Mexico's complaint fails to do so, the defendant manufacturers retain their PLCAA-granted immunity.\"",
      "David Pucino, legal director and deputy chief counsel at GIFFORDS Law Center, said that while the Supreme Court's decision ends Mexico's lawsuit against gun manufacturers, it doesn't affect the ability of gun violence prevention groups from holding law-breakers accountable.",
      "\"The justices did not give the gun industry the broad immunity it sought. Instead, they reaffirmed that the victims of gun industry misconduct can hold lawbreakers accountable in court,\" he said in a statement. \"All survivors, in the United States, in Mexico, and anywhere else, deserve their day in court, and we will continue to support them in their fight for justice.\"",
      "Between 200,000 to 500,000 American-made firearms are trafficked into Mexico each year, a pipeline that's become known as the \"iron river.\" Nearly half of all guns recovered at Mexican crime scenes are manufactured in the U.S., according to data from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.",
      "As part of its efforts to stem the flow of guns illegally trafficked across the U.S.-Mexico border to arm drug cartels, the Mexican government sued seven of the biggest gunmakers in the U.S. and one wholesaler in 2021. It is seeking $10 billion in damages from the industry, as well as other forms of relief.",
      "Mexico has argued that its suit fell under one of PLCAA's exceptions, known as the predicate exception, because the gun manufacturers allegedly knew they were breaking the law by selling to known straw purchasers, and that violation led directly to Mexico's injuries: the millions of dollars in damage to its military and property caused by cartel violence.",
      "The law was passed with bipartisan support from Congress in 2005 and broadly provides a legal shield for gun companies from civil suits that seek to hold them liable for harms stemming from the criminal misuse of their products by another person.",
      "A federal district court in Massachusetts dismissed Mexico's suit in 2022 after finding that PLCAA \"unequivocally\" bars lawsuits seeking to hold firearms manufacturers liable for the actions of people using their products. The court also ruled that PLCAA's narrow exceptions did not apply to the case.",
      "But in early 2024, a panel of three judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 1st Circuit revived Mexico's lawsuit, concluding it fell under PLCAA's predicate exception. That allows gunmakers to be sued if they knowingly broke the law, and if that legal violation led directly to Mexico's injuries.",
      "The appeals court found that the gun industry was \"aiding and abetting\" the unlawful sale of firearms to traffickers for cartels in Mexico, and that the trafficking of those guns has foreseeably forced the Mexican government to incur significant costs because of cartel violence.",
      "The Supreme Court reversed the 1st Circuit's ruling and found that Mexico's complaint \"stretches the bounds\" of its caselaw.",
      "The suit, Kagan wrote, repeatedly claims that gunmakers \"treat rogue dealers just the same as they do law-abiding ones \u2014 selling to everyone, and on equivalent terms.\" But Mexico, she said, could not plausibly allege that is taking place, in part because the manufacturers sell their products to middlemen distributors.",
      "\"A manufacturer of goods is not an accomplice to every unaffiliated retailer whom it fails to make follow the law,\" Kagan wrote.",
      "In a concurring opinion, Justice Clarence Thomas wrote that courts should in future cases more fully examine what constitutes the violation of state or federal law that would allow a lawsuit to fall under the exception to PLCAA's liability shield. He suggested that the law requires not only a plausible allegation that a gunmaker has broken the law, but also a finding of guilt or liability in an adjudication regarding that violation.",
      "\"Particularly given PLCAA's aim of protecting gun manufacturers from litigation, this issue warrants careful consideration,\" Thomas wrote.",
      "Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson also authored a concurring opinion, in which she wrote that Mexico is merely faulting the gun industry writ large for engaging in practices that legislatures and voters have decided not to prohibit.",
      "The lawsuit, she said, \"seeks to turn the courts into common-law regulators. But Congress passed PLCAA to preserve the primacy of the political branches \u2014 both state and federal \u2014 in deciding which duties to impose on the firearms industry. Construing PLCAA's predicate exception to authorize lawsuits like the one Mexico filed here would distort that basic design.\"",
      "The case arrived at the Supreme Court while it was in its early stages. As the gunmakers' appeal was pending, the district court dismissed six of the eight manufacturers from the case. The remaining companies are Smith & Wesson and Interstate Arms, a wholesaler.",

    "story": [
      "Washington \u2014 The Supreme Court on Thursday revived a lawsuit from an\u00a0Ohio woman\u00a0who claimed she was the victim of reverse discrimination because her employer denied her a promotion because she is straight.",
      "In a unanimous decision\u00a0in the case of Ames v. Ohio Department of Youth Services, the high court tossed out a ruling by a federal appeals court that dismissed Marlean Ames' claims because she failed to clear a higher bar applied to members of a majority group in order for her employment discrimination case to proceed. The justices concluded that a \"background circumstances\" requirement cannot be squared with Title VII of the Civil Rights Act and sent Ames' case back to the lower courts for further proceedings.",
      "The background circumstances rule required plaintiffs who are members of a majority group to put forth more evidence showing that their employer is \"unusual\" because it discriminates against the majority. Ames had argued that the requirement unfairly imposed a higher burden on her as a heterosexual woman.",
      "The ruling from the Supreme Court makes it easier to pursue claims of reverse discrimination in 20 states and the District of Columbia that are covered by federal courts of appeals that still applied the standard.",
      "Writing for the court, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson said that the Supreme Court's case law \"makes clear that the standard for proving disparate treatment under Title VII does not vary based on whether or not the plaintiff is a member of a majority group. ... The 'background circumstances' rule flouts that basic principle.\"",
      "Jackson noted that the requirement uniformly subjects all majority-group plaintiffs to \"the same, highly specific evidentiary standard in every case.\"",
      "Ames sued her employer, the Ohio Department of Youth Services, after she said she was turned down for a promotion in favor of a gay woman and then demoted and replaced by a gay man. She alleged violations of Title VII, which prohibits discrimination in the workplace based on race, religion, national origin and sex, which includes sexual orientation. Ames accused the department of discriminating against her on the basis of sexual orientation.",
      "A federal district court ruled for the Ohio Department of Youth Services after finding that it offered \"legitimate, nondiscriminatory business reasons\" for passing Ames over for the promotion. The court concluded that Ames' allegations were insufficient to establish the background circumstances necessary to make an initial case of reverse discrimination.",
      "A plaintiff can clear that bar if they put forward evidence that a member of the relevant minority group made the employment decision at issue, or by presenting statistical evidence demonstrating a pattern of discrimination by the employer against members of a majority group.",
      "The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit upheld the district court's decision and agreed that Ames failed to satisfy the background circumstances requirement.",
      "Ames appealed to the Supreme Court, which agreed in October to review the 6th Circuit's decision. That appeals court and four others \u2014 the 7th, 8th, 10th and D.C. Circuits \u2014 still applied the background circumstances standard, while seven others do not.",
      "In a concurring opinion, Justice Clarence Thomas, joined by Justice Neil Gorsuch, criticized the background circumstances rule as \"judge-made\" and said it is \"undoubtedly\" contrary to Title VII and likely violates the Constitution.",
      "\"Courts with this rule have enshrined into Title VII's anti-discrimination law an explicitly race-based preference: White plaintiffs must prove the existence of background circumstances, while nonwhite plaintiffs need not do so,\" Thomas wrote.",
      "He said that the Supreme Court's decision \"obviates the need for courts to engage in the 'sordid business'\" of dividing people by race or other protected traits.",
      "The dispute arrived before the high court as President Trump targeted diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, programs and practices throughout the federal government and fired federal employees in DEI roles. Large companies, too, dismantled their DEI policies following the Supreme Court's 2023 decision that ended affirmative action in college admissions.",

    "summary": "HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. asked the FDA \"to review the latest data on mifepristone\u200b,\" but experts say concerns about the abortion pill's safety are misguided.",
    "story": [
      "Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has asked Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Marty Makary \"to review the latest data on mifepristone,\" raising questions about the drug commonly referred to as the abortion pill.",
      "A spokesperson for the FDA confirmed the plans in a statement to CBS News Tuesday, but did not respond to questions about when the review is scheduled to start and what exactly it will be reviewing about the medication.",
      "According to a letter published on social media Monday by Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, Makary's review aims to closely monitor the drug's safety. But experts say concerns about its safety are misguided, fueled in part by a report from the Ethics and Public Policy Center, an advocacy group that promotes religious traditions and is funded by multiple right-wing organizations.",
      "Mifepristone, which is taken with a second drug, misoprostol, to end an early pregnancy, was first approved by the FDA in 2000 after \"a thorough and comprehensive review\" determined it was safe and effective, the agency says. Periodic reviews since its approval have not found new safety concerns, according to the FDA.",
      "In the Ethics and Public Policy Center report, which was not published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal, the authors, who don't have medical training, claim the pill harms women, causing 1 in 10 patients to experience what they call a \"serious adverse event,\" including hemorrhage, ER visits, ectopic pregnancy and an undefined category of \"abortion-specific complications.\"",
      "Dr. C\u00e9line Gounder, CBS News medical contributor and editor-at-large for public health at KFF Health News, said some of the instances described as \"adverse events\" are questionable.",
      "\"When you have a medication abortion, you bleed. That is normal. That is not an adverse event unless the bleeding is so significant that a woman needs a transfusion,\" she explained. \"It is to be expected that not all medication abortions will successfully eliminate the pregnancy. A surgical abortion after incomplete/failed medication abortion should not be considered an adverse event. ... An ectopic pregnancy is not caused by mifepristone and should not be considered a serious adverse event.\"",
      "Gounder added that the report lacks transparency and doesn't disclose the data source, meaning no one can reproduce and verify the findings, something Kennedy himself said he's a proponent of, noting in his confirmation hearings that he wants to replicate studies.",
      "It also lacks a comparison group, Gounder said, which is important for examining how experiences compare to pregnant women who did not take the drug.",
      "More than 6 million women in the U.S. have used the brand name mifepristone, Mifeprex, since approval in 2000, the drug maker, Danco Laboratories, told CBS News.",
      "\"Danco stands confidently behind the product's established safety and efficacy record,\" a spokesperson said.",
      "While it's unclear whether the latest review of the drug will impact access, Gounder said it could come down to science versus politics.",
      "\"It really depends on if the FDA strictly follows the science and its own extensive safety reviews,\" she said on \"CBS Evening News\" Wednesday.",
      "This isn't the first time the drug has come under fire from abortion opponents and conservatives.",
      "In 2024, the Supreme Court rejected a challenge targeting the availability of the widely used pill, preserving access to the drug in its first major abortion-related ruling since the reversal of Roe v. Wade. If the challengers had prevailed, the ruling would have restricted access to mifepristone nationwide, even in states where abortion is legal.",
      "The justices unanimously ruled that the anti-abortion rights doctors and medical associations who brought the lawsuit against the FDA did not have the legal right to do so. They did not address whether the FDA acted lawfully when it took a series of steps in 2016 and 2021 that relaxed the rules for mifepristone's use.",
      "Makary had previously said that he had \"no plans to take action on mifepristone.\"",
      "Medication abortions made up more than half of all abortions in the United States health care system in 2023, a study from the Guttmacher Institute, an abortion rights research group, found.",
      "In 28 states, there are policies restricting access to mifepristone in some way, according to the Guttmacher Institute, four of which prohibit the mailing of abortion pills to patients.",

    "summary": "President Trump is putting a political spotlight on autopens, machines that have been used for decades by presidents, writers and more.",
    "story": [
      "The autopen \u2014 a machine first patented centuries ago \u2014 is having a moment in the political spotlight, following\u00a0 allegations made by President Trump that former President Biden used one to sign pardons.",
      "That's prompting questions about what autopens do, how they work and why the device is now stirring up controversy. The devices use pens or other writing instruments to place a person's signature on documents, books or other papers, such as in the case of a college president, for example, who would otherwise be required to sign hundreds or thousands of diplomas for graduating students by hand.",
      "Mr. Trump raised the issue in March when he claimed Mr. Biden's alleged use of an autopen to sign preemptive pardons to members of the House select committee that investigated the Jan. 6, 2021,\u00a0assault on the U.S. Capitol\u00a0rendered them \"void\" and \"vacant.\"",
      "Mr. Trump raised the issue again on Wednesday, when he posted on Truth Social, \"With the exception of the RIGGED PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION OF 2020, THE AUTOPEN IS THE BIGGEST POLITICAL SCANDAL IN AMERICAN HISTORY!!!\"",
      "The autopen has also become a focus of the right-leaning Heritage Foundation's Oversight Project, which claims that Mr. Biden's alleged use of an autopen given his \"clear cognitive decline ... raises additional questions for investigators.\"",
      "Regardless of the allegations, the autopen is hardly a novel device for the political sphere, with the Shapell Manuscript Foundation noting that one of the devices was bought by Thomas Jefferson soon after it was patented in 1803. Throughout U.S. history, presidents have relied on autopens, although the Shapell Manuscript Foundation notes that some commanders-in-chief have been guarded about their use of the machine.",
      "\"Whereas once the official White House position was to deny the existence or usage of the autopen, today its existence is more of an open secret,\" the foundation notes.",
      "A spokesperson for Mr. Biden didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",
      "What is an autopen?",
      "An autopen, also called a robot pen, is a machine that automates a person's signature with a pen or other writing instrument, versus a scanned signature, which is a digital image of a signature.",
      "Unlike people, the machine will never get writer's cramp, and can replicate a person's signature on high volumes of letters, certificates, diplomas and other documents, according to Automated Signature Technology, an autopen manufacturer.",
      "Its Ghostwriter machine uses a smart card or USB flash drive to store signatures and phrases that can be replicated on paper. The company's machines \"write at human speed ... to produce quality handwriting reproductions,\" Automated Signature Technology says.",
      "The Ghostwriter can use any type of writing instrument, from a ballpoint pen to crayons, and can write on a variety of materials with different thicknesses, it added.",
      "Another autopen manufacturer, the Autopen Company, said its machines can be used for \"signing certificates, correspondence, photographs and posters, almost anything up to 1/4 inch thick. Factory modifications can be incorporated for signing books and sports memorabilia.\"",
      "One site that sells autopens says that high-end machines used by governments can cost\u00a0between $5,000 to $20,000 each.",
      "Neither the Autopen Company nor Automated Signature Technology immediately responded to requests for comment from CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "Have other presidents used autopens?",
      "Yes. President Johnson even allowed the autopen to be photographed in the White House. The photo appeared in The National Enquirer with a 1968 article titled, \"The Robot That Sits in for the President,\" according to the Shapell Manuscript Foundation.",
      "Other presidents who have relied on autopens include John F. Kennedy and Barack Obama, among others. Presidents have typically used an autopen to sign routine correspondence to constituents, like letters recognizing life milestones, as well as legislation and pardons.",
      "During the Gerald Ford administration, the president and First Lady Betty Ford occasionally signed documents and other correspondence by hand, but White House staff more often used autopen machines to reproduce their signatures on letters and photographs.",
      "Mr. Trump has also used an autopen, telling reporters on Air Force One in March that he'd used the device \"only for very unimportant papers.\"",
      "\"You know, we get thousands and thousands of letters, letters of support for young people, from people that aren't feeling well, etcetera.

    "summary": "Spike in early Social Security claims this year points to growing concerns about the health of the Social Security system, experts say.",
    "story": [
      "Older Americans are filing for Social Security benefits at a record rate this year, a surge that could reflect growing anxiety about the stability of the retirement system amid cutbacks under the Trump administration, experts say.",
      "The number of people claiming Social Security jumped 17% to 1.8 million this year through May compared with the same period a year ago, according to the most recent data from the Social Security Administration. For the federal fiscal year, new filings are on track to reach 4 million, up 15% from the prior fiscal year, the Urban Institute said in a new analysis of claims data.",
      "The spike in early benefits claims comes as the Trump administration has slashed jobs\u00a0and made other changes at the Social Security Administration, an agency already struggling to provide services to the nearly 70 million retirees, disabled people and survivors of deceased workers who rely on the program.",
      "These developments are likely prompting the surge in new filings, as well as an increase in calls and in-person visits to Social Security offices since January, the Urban Institute said.",
      "Although Mr. Trump has vowed not to touch Social Security, his administration is has cut\u00a0the agency's staffing to 50,000 workers, down from its current level of about 57,000 workers. The agency's workforce has been shrinking for years, with the AARP noting that the Social Security Administration had 63,000 workers in 2015.",
      "Even as its workforce shrinks, the Social Security Administration is serving more people, with the number of beneficiaries rising 19% from about 59 million people in 2015 to about 70 million today, its data shows.",
      "\"I have attended several town halls around the country, and many people have asked if they should claim benefits early given Trump and [Elon] Musk's interference in the system,\" Max Richtman, president of the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, an advocacy group for the two retirement programs, told CBS MoneyWatch.",
      "He added, \"People are scared, and they're not sure what to do.\"",
      "To be sure, Americans have long held concerns about the stability of the Social Security system. Because the agency is paying out more in benefits than it's taking in through payroll taxes due to the nation's aging demographics, the program is currently dipping into its trust fund to pay beneficiaries.",
      "Without changes to the program, the trust fund is slated to be depleted in 2035, which will trigger a benefits cut of about 20%, the agency has forecast.",
      "An aging society",
      "Other factors could be driving the increase in early Social Security filings, the Urban Institute said. For one, the baby boomer generation is hitting \"peak 65\" as a record number of people hit retirement age, although that demographic shift isn't enough to entirely explain this year's surge in claims, the think tank noted.",
      "Another cause could be the Social Security Fairness Act, which provides more retirement benefits to public servants such as teachers, firefighters and police officers, and could encourage more people to file, the Urban analysis said.",
      "The Social Security Administration didn't respond to a request for comment.",
      "Frank Bisignano, the agency's new commissioner, told CBS News last month that the program will be able to provide services to beneficiaries despite the staffing cuts \"through technology and process engineering.\"",
      "He added, \"Everybody is committed to Social Security for the rest of time.\"",
      "The downside to claiming early",
      "The agency is receiving more early claims from higher-income Americans, especially at age 62, which is the earliest age at which a worker can start receiving their monthly Social Security benefits, the Urban Institute said.",
      "But there's a major cost to claiming at 62. While it might seem prudent to claim early if you're worried Social Security won't be around in a few years \u2014 something that experts say is extremely unlikely \u2014 the tradeoff is a permanently lower monthly benefit.",
      "People who claim Social Security benefits at 62 receive about\u00a030% less\u00a0in their monthly checks than if they wait until they turn 67, which is currently the program's full retirement age. Older Americans can collect even greater benefits if they delay filing past their full retirement age, getting an extra 24% boost to their monthly check if they wait until they turn 70.",
      "Because of that math, Richtman said his group recommends holding off on claiming, even though people might be fearful about the program's health.",
      "\"Their concern is understandable. But we advise workers not to claim early out of fear, because filing for Social Security before full retirement age results in a lifetime reduction in benefits,\" he said.",

      "President Trump ordered an investigation Wednesday into whether former President Joe Biden's administration used an autopen machine to sign key presidential documents like pardons \u2014 months after Mr. Trump claimed his predecessor's pardons were illegitimate.",
      "In a memo signed Wednesday night, Mr. Trump told Attorney General Pam Bondi and the president's counsel to probe what he claimed was a \"conspiracy\" to \"abuse the power of Presidential signatures through the use of an autopen to conceal Biden's cognitive decline.\"",
      "The order cited a litany of executive actions by Biden \u2014 including pardons and federal judge appointments \u2014 and argued \"there are serious doubts as to the decision making process and even the degree of Biden's awareness of these actions being taken in his name.\"",
      "It then suggested that if Biden's advisers \"secretly used the mechanical signature pen,\" it would \"have implications for the legality and validity of numerous executive actions.\"",
      "Mr. Trump said the investigation should cover whether Biden's aides \"conspired to deceive the public about Biden's mental state and unconstitutionally exercise the authorities and responsibilities of the president.\" It also directed an investigation into which executive actions an autopen was used for, and who directed its use.",
      "In a statement, Biden called the attacks false and \"nothing more than a distraction by Donald Trump and Congressional Republicans.\"",
      "\"Let me be clear: I made the decisions during my presidency. I made the decisions about the pardons, executive orders, legislation, and proclamations. Any suggestion that I didn't is ridiculous and false,\" Biden said.",
      "Presidents have used an autopen \u2014 or a signature-signing machine \u2014 to sign certain documents for decades, and then-President George W. Bush's Justice Department said in 2005 that the president can legally use an autopen to sign bills into law. Mr. Trump said in March he has occasionally used an autopen, but \"only for very unimportant papers.\"",
      "But Mr. Trump and his allies have suggested Biden's alleged use of an autopen could be illegitimate. In March, the president claimed a slate of pardons issued to some Trump foes in the final days of his administration were \"VOID\" and \"VACANT.\"",
      "CBS News legal contributor Jessica Levinson said in March that Mr. Trump cannot revoke his predecessor's pardons, even if an autopen was involved, noting that the president's constitutional power to pardon people is extremely broad. \"This is not a gray area,\" she said on \"CBS Mornings Plus.\"",

      "BNPL loans \u2014 which are readily available from financial technology companies such as Affirm, Klarna and PayPal, as well as from household names like Apple \u2014 let shoppers make interest-free purchases while spreading payments over several installments. The most common BNPL loans are \"pay in four\" products, which divide the total cost of a purchase, usually ranging from $50 to $1,000, into four equal payments. Consumers pay the first 25% at the point of sale and the remaining three installments over the next six weeks.",
      "Although such credit arrangements can help consumers afford an item in the short term, some BNPL loans can carry interest changes and fees, potentially leading consumers to rack up debt. According to LendingTree, 41% of customers who have used a BNPL loan say they have made a late payment in the past year, up from 34% the year prior. And while most lenders don't charge interest, they do charge late fees for missed payments, which can add up over time.",
      "Despite such risks, BNPL loans have exploded in popularity, including for modest transactions. For example, Klarna in March partnered with food delivery service DoorDash to offer a BNPL plan that consumers can use to pay for meal and grocery deliveries. DoorDash said it was launching the service to let customers postpone payment to \"a more convenient time, such as a date that aligns with their paycheck.\"",
      "LendingTree chief consumer finance analyst Matt Schulz said BNPL loan providers make it easy for customers to use them for a wide range of purchases. \"They give people more options, which can be good if it's managed well,\" he told CBS News' Kelly O'Grady.",
      "At the same time, the growing number of Americans using the loans to buy food \"clearly shows that there are a lot of people who are struggling with high costs at the grocery store and elsewhere, and who are looking for whatever ways they can find to help them make ends meet a little easier,\" Schulz said.",
      "\"If you make a bunch of purchases with a credit card, you're just making one payment at the end of the month,\" he added. \"But if you get a bunch of different BNPL loans, it can be a challenge to manage them. That's especially true if you're on a tight budget without a lot of wiggle room, and you're inexperienced with managing payments.\"",
      "LendingTree survey data shows that about one in four BNPL users say they've had at least three active BNPL loans at one time.",

      "Washington \u2014 Republicans' sweeping policy bill aimed at advancing President Trump's second-term agenda would increase annual budget deficits by a total of $2.4 trillion over the next decade, according to a new estimate prepared by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.",
      "The CBO also estimates that 10.9 million more people would be without health insurance in 2034 as the result of the House-passed legislation, mostly due to cuts to Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act under the bill.",
      "House Republicans are aiming to cut at least $1.5 trillion in spending to offset trillions in tax cuts, while also raising the debt ceiling by $4 trillion. The CBO projection puts the spending cuts at about $1.2 trillion over the next decade, with the tax cuts totaling just under $3.7 trillion. The national debt currently stands at roughly $36 trillion, according to the Treasury Department.",
      "The package, which Mr. Trump and Republican lawmakers refer to as the \"one big, beautiful bill,\" is now in the hands of the Senate after making it out of the House before Memorial Day. The bill is expected to undergo changes in the Senate before heading back to the lower chamber.",
      "Though Republicans vowed to protect Medicaid benefits and have framed cuts to the program as trimming \"waste, fraud and abuse,\" the analysis found that the portion of the bill dealing with Medicaid would mean 7.8 million fewer people being enrolled in the safety net program. Federal spending on Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act would be reduced by $902 billion over a decade.",
      "Another 1.3 million people would be without insurance due to changes in the Affordable Care Act. The bill would also eliminate state-funded insurance for 1.4 million people \"without verified citizenship, nationality, or satisfactory immigration status,\" the CBO said.",
      "Medicaid, a popular entitlement program, provides government-sponsored health care for more than 70 million low-income adults, children and people with disabilities. The House bill includes new work requirements that would apply to childless Medicaid recipients without disabilities between the ages of 19 and 64, more frequent eligibility checks and changes to how states can finance their share of the costs of the program.",
      "Cuts to federal food assistance programs, which includes Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, would save more than $294 billion over 10 years, according to the analysis. House Republicans plan to achieve the savings by requiring states to cover a share of the costs to provide benefits that help low-income individuals and families pay for groceries and by expanding work requirements.",
      "About 42 million people benefited from SNAP, also known as food stamps, in fiscal year 2023, with recipients receiving an average of $211 each month in benefits, according to the Department of Agriculture.",

      "The popular sandwich will reappear on menus starting July 10, according to an announcement by the company on Tuesday in which Joe Erlinger, president of McDonald's USA,\u00a0stated\u00a0simply, \"It's back.\"",
      "Consisting of a white-flour tortilla filled with chicken, shredded lettuce and cheese, the Snack Wrap was introduced nearly two decades ago. However, the item was removed from McDonald's menus in 2016 because it was too complicated for its kitchens to prepare. Customers have been calling for the Snack Wrap's return ever since.",
      "In announcing the Snack Wrap's return, the company included a link to a webpage called snackwrapfiles.com, which it describes as a \"content hub for the most anticipated menu item of the decade.\" Featuring Snack Wrap wallpaper as its background, the promotional webpage includes various large folders users can click into. A folder entitled \"Fandom,\" for example, houses screenshots of social media posts from Snack Wrap fans expressing their love for the food and asking when it would be returned to McDonald's menus.",

      "\"I've waited years and I'm getting mildly impatient\" wrote another fan called \"loyal snack wrap lover.\"",
      "Another, more proactive display of loyalty included a Change.org petition to bring back the Snack Wrap. The petition garnered nearly 19,000 signatures. Bringing back the wrap was a \"years-long process,\" Erlinger told The Associated Press.",
      "In its revived form, the Snack Wrap will feature fried chicken and come in two flavors: Ranch and Spicy. This is a departure from the original version, which included a choice of grilled or fried chicken and sauce options like honey mustard and sweet chili. The simplified recipe is to ensure faster service, according to the company. The company has not revealed how much the Snack Wrap will cost, only that prices will vary depending on location.",
      "McDonald's also posted on the Snack Wrap's on its X account, thanking ardent fans for resurrecting the long-lost menu item.

With certain exemptions, Mr. Trump's order bans citizens of those countries seeking to come to the U.S. permanently as legal immigrants, as well as temporary visa holders, like tourists.",

That part of his proclamation applies to all prospective immigrants from these countries with visas to settle in the U.S. permanently and certain temporary visa holders.",
      "The ban is set to take effect at 12:01 a.m. on Monday, June 9.",
      "Mr. Trump said the sweeping entry restrictions were necessary to address concerns related to terrorism in the countries listed in the order, inadequate vetting of the affected nationals and the lack of cooperation on deportations among some of the nations.",

These commonsense restrictions are country-specific and include places that lack proper vetting, exhibit high visa overstay rates, or fail to share identity and threat information.

      "He said the list could be revised if countries make material improvements, and new countries could be added as threats emerge.",

      "In the first month of his first term, January 2017, Mr. Trump signed a travel ban restricting the entry of most citizens of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. The move triggered widespread outcry, chaos at airports and legal challenges from advocates who argued the ban was discriminatory.",
      "In March 2017, Mr. Trump removed Iraq from the list and added Chad, Venezuela and North Korea. In 2020, he expanded the ban, adding immigration restrictions for nationals of Nigeria, Eritrea, Sudan, Tanzania, Myanmar and Kyrgyzstan. Chad was later removed from the list.",
      "The third version of Mr. Trump's first-term ban was ultimately upheld by the Supreme Court in the summer of 2018, with the conservative justices citing the president's broad authority to restrict the entry of foreigners on national security grounds.

To date, no land has been expropriated without compensation in South Africa, despite claims by right-wing activists in the country \u2014 and some prominent supporters outside South Africa, including Elon Musk \u2014 to the contrary.",
      "Soon after the bill was passed, in a briefing with journalists, Mr. Trump accused the government of South Africa of \"doing some terrible, horrible things,\" and he said in a social media post that he would be, \"cutting off all future funding to South Africa until a full investigation of this situation has been completed!\"",
      "As relations between the two countries deteriorated, President Cyril Ramaphosa traveled to Washington late last month with a raft of new measures to try to mend ties. But President Trump ambushed him in the Oval Office, with news cameras rolling, with a video he claimed as proof of the so-called white genocide.",
      "The video included clips of controversial South African opposition figure Julius Malema singing a song that became popular during the anti-apartheid struggle, called \"Kill the Boer,\" which means Afrikaner.",

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the remains of Judi Lynn Weinstein and Gad Haggai were recovered and returned to Israel in a special operation by the army and the Shin Bet internal security agency.",
      "\"Together with all the citizens of Israel, my wife and I extend our heartfelt condolences to the dear families. Our hearts ache for the most terrible loss. May their memory be blessed,\" Netanyahu said in a statement.",
      "Kibbutz Nir Oz announced the deaths of Weinstein, 70, and Haggai, 72, both of whom had Israeli and U.S. citizenship, in December 2023.",
      "The military said they were killed in the Oct. 7 terrorist attack and taken into Gaza by the Mujahideen Brigades, the small armed group that it said had also abducted and killed Shiri Bibas and her two small children.",
      "The army said it recovered the remains of Weinstein and Haggai overnight into Thursday from the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis. The Israeli military and Shin Bet said in a joint statement that the recovery was \"made possible as a result of precise intelligence.\" The Israeli Army Radio network reported that the relevant intelligence was gained via the \"interrogations of terrorists who were taken prisoner\" during military operations in Gaza.",

      "Weinstein was born in New York and taught English to children with special needs at Kibbutz Nir Oz, a small community near the Gaza border. The kibbutz said she also taught meditation techniques to children and teenagers who suffered from anxiety as a result of rocket fire from Gaza. Haggai was a retired chef and jazz musician.",
      "\"My beautiful parents have been freed. We have certainty,\" their daughter, Iris Haggai Liniado, wrote in a message posted on social media. She thanked the Israeli military, the FBI and the Israeli and U.S. governments and called for the release of the remaining 56 hostages held in Gaza. Israeli authorities believe about 20 of those captives are still alive.",
      "Two U.S.-Israeli dual nationals, IDF soldiers Itay Chen and Omer Neutra, are among those whose bodies are still believed to be held in Gaza. The IDF has said that both men were murdered by Hamas during the Oct. 7 attack.",
      "The couple were survived by two sons and two daughters and seven grandchildren, the kibbutz said.",
      "Some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, were killed in the Hamas-led Oct. 7 terrorist attack, and a total of 251 others taken hostage, most of whom have been released under temporary ceasefire agreements or other deals. Israeli forces have rescued eight living hostages from Gaza and recovered dozens of bodies.",
      "Israel's military campaign has killed over 54,600 Palestinians, mostly women and children, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health, which does not provide detailed figures on how many of the dead were civilians or combatants. The offensive has destroyed large parts of Gaza and displaced around 90% of its population of roughly 2 million Palestinians, with many people being displaced multiple times.",

      "Hamas says it will only release the remaining hostages in return for more Palestinian prisoners, a lasting ceasefire and an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. It has offered to hand over power to a politically independent Palestinian committee.",
      "Netanyahu has rejected those terms, saying Israel will only agree to temporary ceasefires to facilitate the return of hostages. He has vowed to continue the war until all the hostages are returned and Hamas is defeated or disarmed and sent into exile.",
      "He has said Israel will maintain control over Gaza indefinitely and will facilitate what he refers to as the voluntary emigration of much of its population to other countries.

    "summary": "Erin Patterson spoke Wednesday about the July 2023 lunch and offered her explanations on how she planned the meal that killed three of her four guests who ate it.",
    "story": [
      "An Australian woman accused of serving poisonous death cap mushrooms in a dish that killed three of her four guests who ate it spoke Wednesday about the incident and detailed how she planned the meal.",
      "Prosecutors in the Supreme Court case in the state of Victoria say Erin Patterson, 50, lured her guests to lunch in July 2023 with a lie about having cancer, before deliberately feeding them toxic fungi. But her lawyers say the tainted beef Wellington that Patterson served was a tragic accident caused by a mushroom storage mishap.",
      "Patterson denies murdering her estranged husband's parents, Don and Gail Patterson, and their relative, Heather Wilkinson. The mother of two also denies attempting to murder Heather's husband, Ian Wilkinson, who survived the meal. If convicted, Patterson faces life in prison for murder and 25 years for attempted murder.",
      "In a rare step for a defendant charged with murder, Patterson chose to speak in her own defense at her trial this week.",
      "On Wednesday, she spoke publicly for the first time about the fateful lunch and offered her explanations on how she planned the meal and didn't become sick herself.",
      "Adding more mushrooms to a \"bland\" meal",
      "No one disputes that Patterson served death cap mushrooms to her guests for lunch in the rural town of Leongatha, but she says she did it unknowingly.",
      "Patterson said Wednesday she splurged on expensive ingredients and researched ideas to find \"something special\" to serve. She deviated from her chosen recipe to improve the \"bland\" flavor, she said.",
      "She believed she was adding dried fungi bought from an Asian supermarket from a container in her pantry, she told the court.",
      "\"Now I think that there was a possibility that there were foraged ones in there as well,\" she told her lawyer, Colin Mandy. Patterson had foraged wild mushrooms for years, she told the court Tuesday, and had put some in her pantry weeks before the deaths.",
      "The accused says she 'shouldn't have lied' about cancer",
      "Patterson, who formally separated from her husband Simon Patterson in 2015, said she felt \"hurt\" when Simon told her the night before the lunch that he \"wasn't comfortable\" attending.",
      "She had earlier told his relatives that she'd arranged the meal to discuss her health. Patterson admitted this week that she never had cancer \u2014 but after a health scare, she told her in-laws she did.",
      "In reality, Patterson said she intended to have weight loss surgery. But she was too embarrassed to tell anybody and planned to pretend to her in-laws that she was undergoing cancer treatment instead, she said.",
      "\"I was ashamed of the fact that I didn't have control over my body or what I ate,\" a tearful Patterson said Wednesday. \"I didn't want to tell anybody, but I shouldn't have lied to them.\"",
      "Patterson says she threw up her mushroom meal",
      "The accused said she believes she was spared the worst effects of the poisoned meal because she self-induced vomiting shortly after her lunch guests left. She had binged on most of a cake and then made herself throw up \u2014 a problem she said she had struggled with for decades.",
      "Patterson also said she believes she had eaten enough of the meal to cause her subsequent diarrhea. She then sought hospital treatment but unlike her lunch guests, she quickly recovered.",
      "At the hospital where her guests' health was deteriorating, her estranged husband asked her about the dehydrator she used to dry her foraged mushrooms, she said.",
      "\"Is that how you poisoned my parents?\" she said Simon Patterson asked her.",
      "Growing afraid she would be blamed for the poisoning and that her children would be taken from her, Patterson said she later disposed of her dehydrator. She told investigators she'd never owned one and hadn't foraged for mushrooms before.",
      "While still at the hospital, she insisted she'd bought all the mushrooms at stores, even though she said she knew it was possible that foraged mushrooms had accidentally found their way into the meal.",
      "She was too frightened to tell anyone, Patterson said.",
      "Also later, Patterson said she remotely wiped her cellphone while it sat in an evidence locker to remove pictures of mushrooms she'd foraged.",
      "Prosecutors argued in opening their case in April that she poisoned her husband's family on purpose, although they didn't suggest a motive. She carefully avoided poisoning herself and faked being ill, they said.",
      "The trial continues on Thursday with Patterson's cross-examination by the prosecutors."

    "story": [
      "The Trump administration is planning to move Greenland from the purview of U.S. European Command to U.S. Northern Command, several U.S. officials told CBS News.",
      "Moving Greenland to Northern Command, which is in charge of defending the homeland, is a symbolic statement suggesting a view of Greenland as more a part of the defense of the U.S. than of Europe. In the eyes of the U.S., the move treats Greenland more like Canada and less like a part of the Kingdom of Denmark. Politico first reported the planned move, and CNN first reported the administration was considering the change.",
      "Top Trump officials, including Vice President JD Vance, have pressed Greenland to break from Denmark and come under the security umbrella of the United States, sources said. Vance visited the Pituffik Space Base\u00a0in March and blasted Denmark's management of Greenland, accusing it of underinvesting in Greenland's people and security architecture. The space base is equipped with a warning system to detect incoming missiles, and the Pentagon sees Greenland as critical to national security.",
      "U.S. European Command includes Europe, Russia and Greenland. U.S. Northern Command is responsible for the defense of the continental U.S. and Alaska, in coordination with Canada, Mexico and the Bahamas.",
      "President Trump hasn't given up on the idea of acquiring Greenland, which he and other top officials see as key to U.S. national security. When Vance visited in March, Mr. Trump said, \"We have to have Greenland.\" The president has also expressed an interest in Greenland because of its rare earth minerals, which are needed in electronics like cell phones and electric cars.",
      "\"We will make you rich, and together, we will take Greenland to heights like you have never thought possible before,\" Mr. Trump said in his March address to a joint session of Congress.",
      "But the vast majority of Greenlanders don't want to join the U.S., according to what little polling exists. Its population of about 56,000 is concentrated along the southern coast, and most of the country is covered in ice.",

    "summary": "At 37 she became the world's youngest female head of government. Now a fellow at Harvard University, Jacinda Ardern talks about the importance of exhibiting kindness and empathy in politics.",
    "story": [
      "These days, at her local coffee shop near Boston, Jacinda Ardern can be just another customer. \"I don't put my name on the order; it's too complicated!\" she laughed.",
      "I asked, \"When you order coffee here, do people start talking politics with you?\"",
      "\"No. Not at all,\" Ardern replied. \"In fact, the guy behind the counter said to me, 'Ah, you are really familiar. Oh, I know: Toni Collette!'\"",
      "That's a moment that would never happen in New Zealand, where Ardern became the world's youngest female head of government when she was just 37 years old. Now 44, former Prime Minister Ardern has been living in the U.S. since she left office two years ago. She is serving as a fellow at Harvard University, and has written a new book, \"A Different Kind of Power\" (to be published June 3 by Crown).",
      "Of the title, she says, \"I think, you know, there are different ways to lead. But I hope you also see that some of those character traits that we perhaps bring to it that we might believe to be weaknesses \u2013 imposter syndrome, or even empathy \u2013 actually are incredible strengths.\"",
      "Ardern says her story is about finding her voice in New Zealand, a small nation of about five million people. \"I never, ever saw myself becoming prime minister, ever,\" she said.",
      "In fact, her father told Ardern that she was too \"thin-skinned\" for politics.",
      "Was he right? \"He was absolutely right!\" she laughed. \"But I guess where I corrected him is, your sensitivity is your empathy. And goodness, don't we need a bit more of that?\"",
      "In New Zealand, the answer was yes. Ahead of the 2017 election, Ardern suddenly became the leader of her country's left-leaning Labour Party. Weeks after winning, she made an announcement: she was pregnant. Her journey, alongside her then-partner, now-husband, Clarke, soon won her global attention.",
      "Was she comfortable with the symbolism of her role? Ardern said, \"I realized the importance of it when I first received a letter from someone on their way to work to tell their boss that they were having a baby, and they felt nervous about their boss' view of whether they could do their job When she heard that I was pregnant, and that gave her a level of confidence, you know, I felt like I also needed to show I could do the job and be a mother.\"",
      "But those joyful early days were followed by challenges. In 2019, mass shootings targeting Muslims in Christchurch left more than 50 dead \u2013 a crucible for New Zealand, and a call to action for its leader: a ban on semi-automatic weapons.",
      "I asked, \"Why do you believe you and your colleagues in New Zealand were able to achieve gun control reform in the wake of a horrific mass shooting, but so often here in the United States such legislative changes have been hard to get?\"",
      "\"I can't speak to the U.S. experience,\" Ardern replied, \"but if we really wanted to say, 'We don't ever want this to happen again,' we needed to demonstrate what we were doing to make that a reality.\"",
      "But even after she won another election, things weren't easy. As the pandemic wore on, tensions flared over her government's COVID policies. In 2023, when she stunned many by deciding to resign, she wore her heart on her sleeve, telling Parliament: \"You can be a nerd, a cryer, a hugger, you can be all of these things, and not only can you be here, you can lead, just like me.\"",
      "Though she has left office, she has not stopped keeping a close eye on our turbulent ties. Asked what she makes of President Trump and his decisions on trade and foreign policy, Ardern said, \"You know, we are seeing people experience deep financial insecurity, and that has to be addressed by political leaders. But I continue to hold that ideas of isolation or protectionism or closing ourselves off to remedy the issue actually doesn't remedy it in the long term, and has a long-term negative impact for some of the collective issues we need to address as a global community.\"",
      "For now, Ardern is not angling to jump back into politics, but she is settling into her new normal \u2013 that is, \"Being just a normal family.\"",
      "And when she is asked for advice \u2013 in a Harvard classroom, or from a world leader \u2013 Jacinda Ardern tells them to be kind: \"That principle of kindness, it's something we teach our kids. Why shouldn't we role model that in the way that we conduct ourselves in politics? And secondly, if you're putting people at the center of what you're doing, it's a reminder that, actually, the act of being in politics is an act of public service as well. And I think voters need to see more of that.\"",

As of Wednesday two deaths were blamed on the blazes.",

      "\"We didn't have a very good day yesterday, with the weather the way it was, where the fires are and just how aggressive they are as they bear down on communities,\" Saskatchewan premier Scott Moe said Tuesday, according to The Canadian Press news agency. \"We're probably approaching in the neighborhood of 15,000 people that have been evacuated across the province and being supported in communities throughout Saskatchewan, and more families are leaving their homes as we speak.\"",
      "In Alberta, more than 1,400 people were ordered to evacuate to shelters provided in hotels and other temporary accommodations. The province had 56 active wildfires as of Tuesday, 27 of them deemed out of control.",

      "In Manitoba, there were 27 active fires on Tuesday, nine of them considered out of control, which is above the average for this time of year.",
      "According to the province's fire situation report, most of those fires were caused by human activity. As a precaution, Manitoba parks were advised to prepare for potential evacuations.",
      "Canada's wildfire season typically begins in April and lasts until late September, with most activity occurring in June and July. In recent years, however, it has started as early as February, due to warmer weather and drier conditions.",

      "A World War II pilot who was remembered for helping fellow servicemembers survive the plane crash that killed him has been accounted for, military officials said this week.",
      "Army Air Forces 1st Lt. Charles W. McCook, 23, of Georgetown, Texas, was a member of the 22nd Bombardment Squadron (Medium), 341st Bombardment Group (Medium), 10th Air Force during World War II, the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency said in a news release. Before joining the military, McCook had graduated from Southwestern University and came from a family of pilots, according to local newspaper clippings gathered by the DPAA.",
      "McCook, nicknamed \"Woody,\" served in China and Burma, according to newspaper clippings. He was one of 20 officers and enlisted men credited for a mission that air-dropped supplies to Allied forces battling Japanese troops in northern Burma. During his service, McCook received the Air Medal and the Distinguished Flying Cross, according to newspaper clippings.",
      "On August 3, 1943, McCook was the armor-gunner on the B-25C \"Mitchell,\" conducting a low-altitude bombing raid over Meiktila, Burma, the DPAA said. The raid was meant to target the Meiktila dam and nearby Japanese barracks, according to a newspaper clipping.",
      "The aircraft crashed during the mission. McCook and three others aboard the plane died, but two men survived. One of the survivors, identified in newspaper clippings as Sgt. John Boyd, said the plane had been hit by an explosive gas shell while flying at a low altitude. McCook, who Boyd recalled \"as the best in the business,\" was able to bring the damaged plane up to an altitude that allowed Boyd and the other surviving soldier to parachute from the craft before it crashed.",
      "Boyd said this action allowed him to survive. He and the other soldier were taken captive by Japanese forces, the DPAA said. Boyd spent two years as a prisoner in Rangoon before he was freed, according to newspaper clippings.",
      "McCook's remains were not recovered. He was eventually listed as missing in action. In 1947, after World War II ended, the American Grave Registration Service recovered four sets of remains from a common grave near a village in Burma, the DPAA said.",
      "Locals said the four sets of remains, designated X-282A-D, were from an \"American crash,\" the DPAA said. But the remains were not identified at the time. They were interred as \"Unknowns\" at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific, or the Punchbowl, in Honolulu, Hawaii. McCook's name was listed on the Walls of the Missing at the Manila American Cemetery and Memorial in the Philippines.",
      "In January 2022, the DPAA disinterred all four sets of remains and taken to the agency's laboratory. Dental, anthropological and isotope analyses were conducted. Other military agencies used mitochondrial DNA analysis and genome sequencing data to help identify the remains. The processes allowed the DPAA to identify one of the sets of remains as belonging to McCook.",
      "Now that McCook has been accounted for, a rosette has been placed next to his name on the Walls of the Missing. He will be buried in his hometown in August 2025, the DPAA said.",

The\u00a0Gaza Humanitarian Foundation\u00a0said in a statement posted on social media that the pause was \"for update, organization, and efficiency improvement work,\" but a spokesperson for the group said it was working to address security concerns.",
      "GHF said in its brief statement that operations would resume on Thursday.",
      "The United Nations and other aid agencies have refused to work with the group, calling it a distraction and accusing it of weaponizing access to desperately needed food. More than 50 people have been killed by Israeli forces near the sites, according to Gaza's Hamas-run Ministry of Health, which has called the GHF effort a trap for hungry Palestinians.",
      "The Israeli military has denied the accusations and accused Hamas of shooting at people seeking aid.",
      "The funding, operational details and origins of the GHF have remained murky since its inception, and it has been plagued not only by grave questions about security for civilians accessing its hubs, but by potentially existential issues regarding its internal operations.",
      "The move comes just days after GHF said it would shutter its Switzerland-based office after officials there told CBS News the foundation was violating Swiss rules for non-governmental organizations. It also comes just a day after\u00a0The Washington Post\u00a0reported that U.S.-based consulting firm Boston Global had severed its ties with the group and launched an internal review over its involvement with GHF.",
      "GHF said it began work in Gaza on May 27, but it remains unclear where it is based and who is funding its operations. Its official\u00a0website\u00a0consists only of a homepage bearing its name and the message: \"More information coming soon.\"",
      "A GHF spokesperson told CBS News in a statement sent Wednesday that the group was \"actively engaged in discussions with\" Israel's military aimed at enhancing security \"beyond the immediate perimeter of GHF sites.\"",
      "The organization said it had asked the Israel Defense Forces to \"guide foot traffic in a way that minimizes confusion or escalation risks\" around its ongoing military operations in Gaza, to offer clearer guidance for civilians seeking to reach its distribution hubs, and to \"enhance IDF force training and refine internal IDF procedures to support safety.\"",
      "\"Our top priority remains ensuring the safety and dignity of civilians receiving aid,\" the spokesperson said in the statement, which was also shared with other news outlets.",
      "Health officials in the Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip said 27 Palestinians were killed trying to reach a GHF hub in southern Gaza on Tuesday alone. The Israeli military denied the claim of mass shooting at civilians, saying troops about a third of a mile away from the site had fired at several people who were deemed to present a threat after they strayed beyond the defined boundaries of the access route. The IDF said it was looking into the reports of civilian casualties.",
      "In a\u00a0message posted\u00a0Wednesday on social media in Arabic, IDF spokesperson Lt. Col. Avichay Adraee warned Gazans against using the roads leading to GHF distribution centers, saying they would be considered \"combat zones\" for the day and stressing that access to them was \"prohibited and dangerous.\"",
      "The IDF has repeatedly accused Hamas of sabotaging the GHF effort, accusing it of sending gunmen specifically to shoot at civilians at the aid hubs.",
      "\"We are not preventing Gaza residents from accessing aid distribution sites,\" IDF spokesperson Brig. Gen. Effie Defrin said in a video statement posted online Tuesday, before the one-day pause was reported. \"Food packages are being distributed daily by a U.S.-based civilian company. This initiative is proving effective. Gazan residents are coming to the distribution centers to receive the aid. The civilian population of Gaza understands that Hamas is not taking care of them \u2014 on the contrary, Hamas is actively trying to prevent them from receiving the aid.\"",
      "Defrin said IDF forces \"operate nearby and do whatever is necessary to ensure that the aid does not fall into the hands of Hamas.\"",
      "He also accused the United Nations' aid agencies of failing to collect and distribute more than 450 trucks carrying humanitarian aid that Israel says were allowed into Gaza in recent days but left waiting on the other side of the Kerem Shalom border crossing with Israel. The U.N. has rejected similar previous Israeli claims, noting that Israeli forces maintain control over virtually all of Gaza and that there are huge logistics challenges to operating in a densely populated active warzone.",
      "And the IDF's assault, which Israel has vowed to continue until Hamas is destroyed and the remaining 58 Israeli hostages are brought back home from Gaza, has continued to ramp up despite the U.S.-backed aid effort.",
      "CBS News' team in Gaza was there as Palestinians rushed to rescue survivors of an Israeli strike that destroyed a bank in Gaza City where families had taken shelter. At least seven people were killed and dozens injured, according to first responders who spoke with CBS News at the scene. They were among 97 Palestinians killed over the preceding 24 hours alone, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health, which put the overall death toll from the war at 54,607 as of Wednesday.",

Not only can the signature turn words into laws of the land, but it also appoints individuals to some of the highest positions in government, creates or eliminates national policies and allows prisoners to go free.",
      "\"In recent months, it has become increasingly apparent that former President Biden's aides abused the power of Presidential signatures through the use of an autopen to conceal Biden's cognitive decline and assert Article II authority,\" Trump wrote. \"This conspiracy marks one of the most dangerous and concerning scandals in American history.

      "Specifically, Trump called on the attorney general\u2019s investigation to look at any activity that purposefully shielded the public from information about Biden\u2019s mental and physical health; any agreements between his aides to falsely deem recorded videos of Biden\u2019s cognitive ability as fake; and any agreements between Biden\u2019s aides to require false, public statements that elevated the president\u2019s capabilities.",

      "LexisNexis filed a\u00a0notice with the Maine attorney general revealing that a hacker accessed consumer data through a third-party software development platform. The breach happened on Dec. 25, 2024, but the company only discovered it months later. LexisNexis was alerted on April 1, 2025, by an unnamed individual who claimed to have found sensitive files.

      "LexisNexis isn\u2019t a household name for most people, but it plays a major role in how personal data is harvested and used behind the scenes. The company pulls information from a wide range of sources, compiling detailed profiles that help other businesses assess risk and detect fraud. Its clients include banks, insurance companies and government agencies.",
      "In 2023, the New York Times reported that several car manufacturers had been sharing driving data with LexisNexis without notifying vehicle owners. That information was then sold to insurance companies, which used it to adjust premiums based on individual driving behavior. The story made one thing clear. LexisNexis has access to a staggering amount of personal detail, even from people who have never willingly engaged with the company.",
      "Law enforcement also uses LexisNexis tools to dig up information on suspects. These systems offer access to phone records, home addresses and other historical data. While such tools might assist in investigations, they also highlight a serious issue. When this much sensitive information is concentrated in one place, it becomes a single point of failure.

      "Keeping your personal data safe online can feel overwhelming, but a few practical steps can make a big difference in protecting your privacy and reducing your digital footprint. Here are 7 effective ways to take control of your information and keep it out of the wrong hands:",
      "1. Remove your data from the internet:\u00a0The most effective way to take control of your data and avoid data brokers from selling it is to opt for data removal services. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time. Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Get a\u00a0free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web.",
      "2. Review privacy settings: Take a few minutes to explore the privacy and security settings on the services you use. For example, limit who can see your social media posts, disable unnecessary location-sharing on your phone and consider turning off ad personalization on accounts like Google and Facebook. Most browsers let you block third-party cookies or clear tracking data. The FTC suggests comparing the privacy notices of different sites and apps and choosing ones that let you opt out of sharing when possible.",
      "3. Use privacy-friendly tools: Install browser extensions or plugins that block ads and trackers (such as uBlock Origin or Privacy Badger). You might switch to a more private search engine (like DuckDuckGo or Brave) that doesn\u2019t log your queries. Consider using a browser\u2019s \"incognito\" or private mode when you don\u2019t want your history saved, and regularly clear your cookies and cache. Even small habits, like logging out of accounts when not in use or using a password manager, make you less trackable.",
      "GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE",
      "4. Beware of phishing links and use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Scammers may try to get access to your financial details and other important data using phishing links. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping\u00a0your personal information and digital assets safe.\u00a0Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "5. Be cautious with personal data: Think twice before sharing extra details. Don\u2019t fill out online surveys or quizzes that ask for personal or financial information unless you trust the source. Create separate email addresses for sign-ups (so marketing emails don\u2019t go to your main inbox). Only download apps from official stores and check app permissions.",
      "6. Opt out of data broker lists: Many data brokers offer ways to opt out or delete your information, though it can be a tedious process. For example, there are sites like Privacy Rights Clearinghouse or the Whitepages opt-out page that list popular brokers and their opt-out procedures. The FTC\u2019s consumer guide,\u00a0\"Your Guide to Protecting Your Privacy Online,\" includes tips on opting out of targeted ads and removing yourself from people-search databases. Keep in mind you may have to repeat this every few months.",
      "7. Be wary of mailbox communications:\u00a0Bad actors may also try to scam you through snail mail. The data leak gives them access to your address. They may impersonate people or brands you know and use themes that require urgent attention, such as missed deliveries, account suspensions and security alerts.",
      "HR FIRM CONFIRMS 4M RECORDS EXPOSED IN MAJOR HACK",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "For many, the LexisNexis breach may be the first time they realize just how much of their data is in circulation. Unlike a social media platform or a bank, there is no clear customer relationship with a data broker, and that makes it harder to demand transparency. This incident should prompt serious discussion around what kind of oversight is necessary in industries that operate in the shadows. A more informed public and stronger regulation may be the only things standing between personal data and permanent exposure.",

      "Phantom 3500 (Otto Aviation)",
      "Why is windowless design such a big deal for aircraft?",
      "Most travelers don't realize that windows are structural weak points in an aircraft. They require extra reinforcement, add weight and disrupt the smooth flow of air over the fuselage (the main body of the plane). This increases drag, a resistance force that makes flight less efficient. By removing windows, the Phantom 3500's surface allows air to flow with minimal turbulence, helping the aircraft achieve what Otto Aviation describes as \"full laminar flow characteristics.\"",
      "HYPERSONIC JET PROMISES NYC TO LONDON IN UNDER AN HOUR",
      "This is a major contributor to its impressive aerodynamic performance. The windowless design is not just for aesthetics. Otto Aviation specifically engineered the fuselage to optimize laminar flow, using lightweight materials and smooth surfaces to further reduce drag and fuel consumption.",

These displays stream real-time video from cameras mounted on the aircraft's exterior, offering passengers a panoramic, immersive view of the skies. Otto Aviation refers to this system as Super Natural Vision, a proprietary technology that replaces traditional windows with state-of-the-art digital displays, seamlessly integrating real-time external views for a unique in-flight experience.",
      "The spacious, luminous cabin measures 800 cubic feet with a 6-foot-5-inch ceiling, comfortably accommodating four or more passengers in a luxurious, flexible layout. The cabin can seat up to nine passengers, depending on configuration, and is designed to maximize comfort and functionality.

By sustaining laminar flow, the aircraft aims to improve fuel efficiency by 35%. This allows it to maintain high-speed performance while consuming less fuel, making it one of the most aerodynamically efficient aircraft ever developed. It operates in the transonic range (Mach 0.8\u20131.2), balancing speed and efficiency. It can also reach a cruising altitude of 51,000 feet, significantly higher than most commercial airliners, which typically fly between 30,000 and 40,000 feet.",
      "Thanks to its streamlined fuselage and optimized aerodynamics, the Phantom 3500 burns 50% less fuel than conventional business jets. This reduction in fuel consumption translates to lower operating costs and a significant decrease in carbon emissions. The Phantom 3500\u2019s wings achieve complete laminar flow, allowing for smoother airflow and reduced drag, enabling the aircraft to take off from runways as short as 3,500 feet, nearly doubling the number of accessible airports in the U.S. alone compared to similar-sized jets.",

It underscores the need for companies to go beyond basic compliance and actively evaluate the cybersecurity standards of every partner in their ecosystem.

    "story": [
      "Artificial intelligence and robotics may help with nursing shortage.",
      "The global healthcare system is expected to face a shortage of 4.5 million nurses by 2030, with burnout identified as a leading cause for this deficit. In response, Taiwan's hospitals are taking decisive action by integrating artificial intelligence and robotics to support their staff and maintain high standards of patient care.",

      "Nurabot: The AI nursing robot changing patient care",

      "These include delivering medications, transporting samples, patrolling wards and guiding visitors through hospital corridors. By handling these responsibilities, Nurabot allows nurses to focus on more meaningful aspects of patient care and helps reduce the physical fatigue that often leads to burnout.",

      "IS THIS ROBOT AFTER OUR HOSPITALITY, RETAIL AND HEALTHCARE JOBS?",
      "Using AI to build the hospitals of the future",
      "Foxconn's approach to smart hospitals goes beyond deploying robots. The company has developed a suite of digital tools using Nvidia platforms, including AI models that monitor patient vitals and digital twins that simulate hospital environments for planning and training purposes.",
      "The process starts in the data center, where large AI models are trained on Nvidia supercomputers. Hospitals then use digital twins to test and train robots in virtual settings before deploying them in real-world scenarios, ensuring that these systems are both safe and effective.",

      "Taichung Veterans General Hospital (TCVGH), along with other top hospitals in Taiwan, is at the forefront of this digital transformation. TCVGH has built digital twins of its wards and nursing stations, providing a virtual training ground for Nurabot before it is introduced to real hospital floors. According to Shu-Fang Liu, deputy director of the nursing department at TCVGH, robots like Nurabot are augmenting the capabilities of healthcare staff, enabling them to deliver more focused and meaningful care to patients.",

      "WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?",

      "Nurabot is already making a difference in daily hospital operations. The robot handles medicine deliveries, ward patrols and visitor guidance, which Foxconn estimates can reduce nurse workloads by up to 30%. In one ward, Nurabot delivers wound care kits and educational materials directly to patient bedsides, saving nurses multiple trips to supply rooms and allowing them to dedicate more time to their patients. The robot is also especially helpful during visiting hours and night shifts, when staffing levels are typically lower.",
      "Nurses hope future versions of Nurabot will be able to converse with patients in multiple languages, recognize faces for personalized interactions and even assist with lifting patients when needed. For example, a lung patient who needs two nurses to sit up for breathing exercises might only require one nurse with Nurabot's help, freeing the other to care for other patients.",

      "When it comes to addressing the nursing shortage, Taiwan is demonstrating that AI and robotics can make a significant difference in hospitals. Instead of spending their shifts running errands or handling repetitive tasks, nurses now have robots like Nurabot to lend a hand. This means nurses can focus their energy on what matters most \u2013 caring for patients \u2013 while robots handle tasks such as delivering medication or guiding visitors around the hospital.",

After more than 30 years of development, this flying car is finally about to become a reality for early buyers.",

After years of prototypes and over 500 test flights, the AirCar is finally set for certification later this year.

      "From the road to the sky in minutes",
      "So, how does it work? The AirCar looks like a sleek sports coupe on the road, with four wheels and a design that would fit right in next to a luxury sedan. When you need to fly, you simply drive to a runway, press a button and watch as the wings unfold and the tail extends. The transformation takes about 80 seconds, and there's no manual tinkering required. Once the wings are locked and the tail is in place, you're ready for takeoff. The steering wheel transforms into a flight yoke, and extra pedals appear for rudder control. The controls are designed to be intuitive for pilots, so if you already have a private pilot's license, you won't need to learn anything new.",

The base model puts out 280 horsepower, while the top version offers 340 horsepower with twin turbos. On the road, the AirCar can reach a top speed of about 124 mph, and it handles and feels much like a sports car. In the air, it cruises at 155 mph and can travel up to 620 miles on a single tank of fuel.",

The AirCar runs on regular high-octane gasoline, and you can fill up at most gas stations.

      "To operate the AirCar on the road, you will need a standard driver's license, just like any other car. If you want to take to the skies, you'll also need a private pilot's license. According to Klein Vision, the AirCar is designed so that if you already have a private pilot's license, you won't have to learn anything new to fly it.

    "story": [
      "Tech expert Kurt Knutsson joins \"Fox & Friends\" to warn of new cyberscams and give tips on how to avoid them.",
      "Given the number of phishing scams we have all faced over the past decade, most of us have developed a basic skill to spot and avoid obvious phishing emails or SMS messages. Cybercriminals are aware of this, and they have evolved their tactics by shifting to more complex and convincing schemes designed to bypass skepticism and lure victims.",
      "Their goal remains the same: to trick you into handing over sensitive information, especially credit card data. One of the latest examples is the rise in subscription scam campaigns. Scammers are creating incredibly convincing websites selling everything from shoes and clothes to electronics, tricking people into signing up for monthly subscriptions and willingly providing their credit card information. Facebook is being used as the primary platform to promote these new and sophisticated scams.",
      "Join the FREE \"CyberGuy Report\": Get my expert tech tips, critical security alerts and exclusive deals, plus instant access to my\u00a0free \"Ultimate Scam Survival Guide\" when you sign up!",
      "A woman shopping online (Kurt \"CyberGuy\" Knutsson)",
      "What you need to know",
      "Bitdefender researchers have uncovered a massive and highly coordinated subscription scam campaign involving more than 200 active websites designed to look like real online stores. These sites, often promoted through Facebook ads, sell everything from clothes and electronics to beauty products, but the real goal is to trick users into signing up for recurring payments, often without realizing it.",
      "One of the most common lures is the \"mystery box\" scam, where you are promised a surprise package at a bargain price. These offers are made to look fun and harmless, but behind the scenes you are giving away personal and credit card information while unknowingly agreeing to hidden subscription terms, often written in tiny fine print.",
      "The scam doesn\u2019t stop there. Once you\u2019re convinced and reach the checkout page, scammers often layer in a second scam, like loyalty cards or VIP memberships that further lock you into payments. It\u2019s all designed to confuse you, overwhelm you with supposed perks and make the scam feel like a good deal.",
      "Researchers found that many of these websites share a single Cyprus address, possibly tied to offshore entities linked to the Paradise Papers. Despite being spread across different categories and brand names, the sites often use the same layouts, AI agents and payment structures, all pointing to a centralized fraud network.",
      "Scammers frequently rotate the brands they impersonate and have started moving beyond mystery boxes, now peddling low-quality products, counterfeit goods, fake investment schemes, dubious supplements and more. To avoid automatic detection, they employ several tactics. These include running multiple versions of an ad, with only one of which is actually malicious while the others display harmless product images, uploading ad images from platforms like Google Drive so they can be swapped out later and cropping visuals to alter recognizable patterns.",

      "What started with simple \"mystery box\" scams has grown into a sprawling, coordinated campaign. These scams now feature fake surveys, tiered \"VIP\" memberships and deceptive credit systems that make the purchase process intentionally confusing. Users are promised deep discounts or access to exclusive deals, but in reality they\u2019re just being locked into recurring payments.",
      "Many of the scam websites trace back to the same physical address in Cyprus, pointing to what appears to be a centralized operation. Researchers also found links to entities mentioned in the Paradise Papers, suggesting these fraudsters are hiding behind offshore infrastructure.",
      "And it\u2019s not just mystery boxes anymore. The same scam format is being used to sell low-quality goods, fake supplements and even bogus investment opportunities. With high-quality site design, aggressive advertising and increasingly sophisticated tactics, subscription scams are becoming the new face of online fraud.",

      "Even as scammers become more sophisticated, there are practical steps you can take right now to protect your personal and financial information from subscription fraud and other online threats. Here are ten proactive measures to help keep your data safe:",
      "1) Always read the fine print: One of the simplest yet most effective ways to protect yourself from subscription scams is to slow down and read the fine print, especially on checkout pages. Scammers often hide recurring payment terms in small or lightly colored text that\u2019s easy to miss. What seems like a one-time purchase could actually sign you up for a biweekly or monthly charge. Taking just a moment to scan for hidden terms before hitting \"Pay\" can help you avoid weeks of silent billing.",
      "2) Avoid mystery box or VIP-style deals:\u00a0These offers often prey on curiosity and the promise of surprise or luxury for a low fee. In reality, the \"mystery\" is the trap: you might receive nothing or a low-quality item while being unknowingly enrolled in a recurring subscription. Scammers use the illusion of exclusivity or urgency to pressure quick decisions.",
      "3) Don\u2019t trust ads blindly on social media:\u00a0Facebook, Instagram and other platforms are a hotbed for these scams, with criminals running paid ads that mimic well-known brands or influencers. These ads often link to professional-looking but fake storefronts. If you\u2019re interested in a deal you see online, don\u2019t click through immediately. Instead, look up the brand or offer in a separate tab and check if it exists outside social media.",
      "4) Investigate before you buy:\u00a0Before purchasing from any unfamiliar site, take a few quick steps to verify its legitimacy. Search the brand's name alongside words like \"scam\" or \"reviews\" to see what others have experienced. Look up the company's physical address and check if it actually exists using tools like Google Maps. Make sure the website uses HTTPS, review the site's contact information and cross-check reviews on trusted third-party sites like the Better Business Bureau or Consumer Reports.",
      "5) Use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Adding a strong antivirus program to your devices can provide an extra layer of defense against fraudulent websites and phishing attempts. Strong antivirus software warns you about suspicious links, blocks malicious ads and scans downloads for malware. Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "6) Invest in personal data removal services:\u00a0Scammers often rely on leaked or publicly available personal information to target victims with convincing subscription scams. Investing in a personal data removal service can help minimize your digital footprint by removing your information from data broker databases and reducing the chances of being targeted in future campaigns. Regularly monitoring and cleaning up your online presence makes it harder for fraudsters to exploit your data for financial gain.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Get a\u00a0free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web.",
      "7) Be cautious with payment methods: Use secure payment options like credit cards, which often offer better fraud protection than wire transfers, gift cards or cryptocurrency.",
      "8) Limit personal information shared on social media: Scammers often gather details from public profiles to craft convincing scams. Review your privacy settings and only share necessary information.",
      "9) Use strong, unique passwords and enable multifactor authentication:\u00a0Create strong, unique passwords for each of your online accounts, especially those tied to your finances or shopping. Enable multifactor authentication wherever possible, as this adds an extra layer of security and makes it harder for scammers to access your accounts, even if your password is compromised. Also, consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords.\u00a0Get more details about my best expert-reviewed password managers of 2025 here.",
      "10) Keep your devices and software updated:\u00a0Regularly\u00a0update your operating system, browsers and apps. Security updates often patch vulnerabilities that scammers exploit to gain access to your information or install malicious software.",
      "MALWARE EXPOSES 3.9 BILLION PASSWORDS IN HUGE CYBERSECURITY THREAT",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "While the rise of subscription scams and deceptive ads is concerning, it\u2019s especially troubling that platforms like Facebook continue to allow these fraudulent ads to run unchecked. Facebook has repeatedly failed to adequately vet or prevent these malicious campaigns from reaching vulnerable individuals. The platform\u2019s ad approval system should be more proactive in spotting and blocking ads promoting scams, particularly those that impersonate well-known brands or content creators.",

      "A chilling video circulating on social media has reignited old anxieties about robots turning against their creators. The footage shows a Unitree H1 humanoid robot, a machine about the size of an adult human, suddenly flailing its arms and legs with alarming force during a test, coming dangerously close to two technicians.",

      "What the video shows",
      "In the viral clip first posted on\u00a0Reddit, the\u00a0Unitree H1 is seen suspended from a crane at a Chinese factory, surrounded by two handlers. Without warning, the robot loses control, thrashing its limbs, knocking over equipment and forcing the technicians to scramble out of harm's way. The chaos is palpable, and the images quickly drew comparisons to movies like \"The Terminator\" and \"I, Robot,\" with many viewers wondering if the age of rogue machines had finally arrived.",

Standing 5.9 feet tall and weighing 104 pounds, it's designed to walk, run and even perform dynamic movements like backflips and dancing. Its joints are powerful and capable of generating 365 pound-feet of torque, enough to lift heavy objects or, in the wrong circumstances, cause serious harm.",

      "Despite the frightening visuals, the reality is far less sinister. According to engineers and robotics experts, the root cause of the malfunction was a combination of software and design oversight. During the test, the H1 was tethered by its head for safety, a common practice during public demonstrations. However, this physical restraint was not accounted for in the robot's balance algorithm.",
      "The robot's sensors interpreted the resistance from the tether as if it were constantly falling. In response, the H1's stabilization software tried to correct its position, but the tether prevented normal movement. This created a feedback loop: the robot made increasingly aggressive corrections, resulting in the violent flailing seen in the video. Investigators concluded that this was not a case of emergent AI behavior but rather a known failure mode triggered by an unanticipated physical constraint and software flaw.",

      "1. Be skeptical of CAPTCHA prompts: Legitimate CAPTCHA tests never require you to press Windows + R, copy commands or paste anything into PowerShell. If a website instructs you to do this, it\u2019s likely a scam. Close the page immediately and avoid interacting with it.",
      "2. Don\u2019t click links from unverified emails and use strong antivirus software:\u00a0Many infostealer attacks start with phishing emails that impersonate trusted services. Always verify the sender before clicking on links. If an email seems urgent or unexpected, go directly to the company\u2019s official website instead of clicking any links inside the email.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe. Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "3. Enable two-factor authentication:\u00a0Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) whenever possible. This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification, such as a code sent to your phone, in addition to your password.",
      "4. Keep devices updated: Regularly\u00a0updating your operating system, browser and security software ensures you have the latest patches against known vulnerabilities. Cybercriminals exploit outdated systems, so enabling automatic updates is a simple but effective way to stay protected.",

      "5. Monitor your accounts for suspicious activity and change your passwords:\u00a0If you\u2019ve interacted with a suspicious website, phishing email or fake login page, check your online accounts for any unusual activity. Look for unexpected login attempts, unauthorized password resets or financial transactions that you don\u2019t recognize. If anything seems off, change your passwords immediately and report the activity to the relevant service provider. Also, consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",
      "6. Invest in a personal data removal service: Consider using a service that monitors your personal information and alerts you to potential breaches or unauthorized use of your data. These services can provide early warning signs of identity theft or other malicious activities resulting from infostealer malware or similar attacks. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0\u200bCheck out my top picks for data removal services here.",

He is best known for the\u00a0Jetson One, a quad-rotor electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) drone that can carry a human pilot. Building on the success of that project, Patan has now introduced the Volonaut Airbike, a smaller, more agile flying machine that relies on jet propulsion rather than propellers. His work continues to push the boundaries of what personal flight can achieve.",

      "BEST FATHER\u2019S DAY GIFTS FOR EVERY DAD",
      "What about the cost?",
      "When it comes to price, the Volonaut Airbike is still something of a mystery. Patan has not yet revealed an official cost, but if you look at his previous project, the Jetson One drone, which was priced at around $92,000, you can get a rough idea of where the Airbike might land. Given the advanced materials, jet propulsion and sophisticated flight computer involved, it's safe to assume this won't be a budget-friendly ride.",
      "However, as with most new technologies, prices often come down over time as production scales up and designs are refined. So, while it might start out as a high-end gadget for early adopters and enthusiasts, there's hope that flying bikes like this could become more accessible in the years ahead.",

      "What lies ahead for the Volonaut Airbike?",
      "Although the Volonaut Airbike has already been demonstrated in flight, many details remain undisclosed. Patan has not yet revealed the exact propulsion technology, pricing or release date, but he has expressed optimism the Airbike will be available to the public in the near future. As development continues, this flying motorcycle could soon become a practical option for urban commuters seeking a faster, more flexible way to travel.",

      "Honestly, the Volonaut Airbike feels like something we've all dreamed about but never thought we'd actually see. It's exciting to watch this blend of bold engineering and creative design come to life, making personal flight more real than ever before. Sure, it might be a bit pricey at first, but who knows? Maybe in a few years, zipping through the skies on a flying bike will be just as normal as hopping on a motorcycle today.",

      "How the database was uncovered and what it contained",
      "Cybersecurity researcher Jeremiah Fowler has\u00a0revealed the existence of an open database that contains 184,162,718 million account credentials. These include email addresses, passwords, usernames and URLs for platforms such as Google, Microsoft, Apple, Facebook and Snapchat.",
      "The information also covers banking services, medical platforms and government accounts. Most shockingly, the entire dataset was left completely unsecured. There was no encryption, no authentication required and no form of access control. It was simply a plain text file sitting online for anyone to find.",
      "19 BILLION PASSWORDS HAVE LEAKED ONLINE: HOW TO PROTECT YOURSELF",
      "Fowler located the database during routine scanning of publicly exposed assets. What he found was staggering. The file included hundreds of millions of unique records containing user credentials linked to the world\u2019s largest technology and communication platforms. There were also account details for financial services and official portals used by state institutions.",
      "The file was not protected in any way. Anyone who discovered the link could open it in a browser and instantly view sensitive personal data. No software exploit was needed. No password was asked for. It was as open as a public document.",

      "Where did the data come from",
      "Fowler believes the data was harvested using an infostealer. These lightweight tools are favored by cybercriminals for their ability to silently extract login credentials and other private information from compromised devices. Once stolen, the data is often sold on dark web forums or used in targeted attacks.",
      "After reporting the breach, the hosting provider quickly removed access to the file. However, the owner of the database remains unknown. The provider did not disclose who uploaded it or whether the database was part of a legitimate archive that was accidentally published. Fowler could not determine whether this was the result of negligence or an operation with malicious intent.",
      "To verify the data, Fowler contacted some individuals listed in the records. Several confirmed that the information was accurate.

      "6 ways to protect yourself after a data breach",
      "1. Change your password on every platform: If your login credentials have been exposed, it\u2019s not enough to change the password on just one account. Cybercriminals often try the same combinations across multiple platforms, hoping to gain access through reused credentials. Start by updating your most critical accounts, email, banking, cloud storage and social media, then move on to others. Use a new, unique password for each platform and avoid variations of old passwords, as they can still be predictable. Consider using a\u00a0password manager to generate and store complex passwords.",
      "Our\u00a0top-rated password manager delivers powerful protection to help keep your accounts secure. It features\u00a0real-time data breach monitoring to alert you if your login details have been exposed, plus a built-in\u00a0data breach scanner\u00a0that checks your saved emails, passwords and credit card information against known leak databases. A password health checker also highlights weak, reused or compromised passwords so you can strengthen your online defenses with just a few clicks. Get more details about my\u00a0best expert-reviewed Password Managers of 2025 here.",
      "2. Enable two-factor authentication: Two-factor authentication, or 2FA, is a critical security feature that drastically reduces the risk of unauthorized access. Even if someone has your password, they won\u2019t be able to log in without the second verification step, usually a one-time code sent to your phone or an authenticator app. Enable 2FA on all services that support it, especially your email, financial accounts and any service that stores sensitive personal data.",
      "3. Watch for unusual account activity: After a breach, it\u2019s common for compromised accounts to be used for spam, scams, or identity theft. Pay close attention to signs such as login attempts from unfamiliar locations, password reset requests you didn\u2019t initiate or unexpected messages sent from your accounts. Most platforms allow you to review login history and connected devices. If you see something off, take action immediately by changing your password and revoking suspicious sessions.",
      "4. Invest in personal data removal services:\u00a0You should also consider a data removal service. Given the scale and frequency of breaches like the one described above, relying on personal caution alone is no longer enough. Automated data removal services can provide an essential extra layer of defense by continuously scanning for and helping eliminate your exposed information from data broker sites and other online sources. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.\u00a0Check out my top picks for data removal services here.",
      "Get a\u00a0free scan to find out if your personal information is already out on the web.",
      "5. Avoid clicking on suspicious links and use strong antivirus software: One of the most common post-breach threats is phishing. Cybercriminals often use information from leaked databases to craft convincing emails that urge you to verify your account or reset your password. Never click on links or download attachments from unknown or suspicious sources. Instead, visit websites by typing the URL directly into your browser.",
      "The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links is to have strong antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping\u00a0your personal information and digital assets safe. Get my picks for the best 2025 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.",
      "6. Keep your software and devices up to date: Many cyberattacks exploit known vulnerabilities in outdated software. Operating systems, browsers, antivirus programs and even apps\u00a0need to be updated regularly to patch security flaws. Turn on automatic updates wherever possible so you\u2019re protected as soon as fixes are released. Staying current with your software is one of the easiest and most effective ways to block malware, ransomware and spyware from infiltrating your system.",
      "HACKERS USING MALWARE TO STEAL DATA FROM USB FLASH DRIVES",
      "Kurt\u2019s key takeaway",
      "Security is not only the responsibility of companies and hosting providers. Users need to adopt better practices, including unique passwords, multifactor authentication and regular reviews of their digital footprint. The careless exposure of over 184 million credentials is not just a mistake. It is an example of how fragile our systems remain when even basic protection is absent. In an era where artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and global connectivity are reshaping technology, it is unacceptable that plain text files containing financial and governmental credentials are still left sitting online.",

    "link": "https://www.foxnews.com/tech/ai-prompts-put-serious-money-your-pocket",
    "published": "Fri, 30 May 2025 14:48:58 -0400",
    "summary": "Here are five AI prompts you can use for freelance work, writing product descriptions, creating social media posts and writing emails to negotiate discounts.",
    "story": [
      "A majority of small businesses are using artificial intelligence and finding out it can save time and money.",
      "So, you want to start making money using AI but you\u2019re not trying to build Skynet or learn 15 coding languages first? Good, because neither am I. You don\u2019t need to become the next Sam Altman or have a Ph.D. in machine learning to turn artificial intelligence into real income. What you do need is curiosity, a dash of creativity, and the right prompts.",
      "\ud83d\udcb8 Enter to win $500 for you and $500 for your favorite person or charity in our\u00a0Pay It Forward Sweepstakes. Hurry, ends soon!",
      "I\u2019ve pulled together five powerful, practical prompts you can throw into ChatGPT (or your AI tool of choice) to help you start earning extra cash this week. These aren\u2019t pie-in-the-sky dreams or $10K-a-month YouTube ad schemes. They\u2019re doable, even if your calendar is already packed.",
      "5-MINUTE CLEANUP FOR YOUR PHONE AND COMPUTER",
      "Let\u2019s get to it.",
      "1. Fast-Track Your Freelance Life",
      "Prompt to use:\"Act as a freelance business coach. Suggest 3 services I can offer on Fiverr or Upwork using AI tools like ChatGPT, Midjourney or Canva. I have [insert skill: writing/design/admin/accounting/managerial] experience.\"",
      "Why this works:Freelance work is exploding right now. Platforms like Upwork and Fiverr are filled with small businesses and entrepreneurs who need help\u2014but don\u2019t have the budget to hire full-time staff. If you\u2019ve got any kind of professional background, you can use AI tools to turbocharge your services. Writing blog posts? ChatGPT can give you a draft. Creating logos or social media templates? Midjourney and Canva are your new best friends.",
      "You don\u2019t need a team. You don\u2019t need fancy software. You just need a good prompt and the confidence to say, \"Yes, I can do that.\" AI helps you scale what you already know how to do.",
      "A man is pictured with a smartphone and laptop computer on January 31, 2019.\u00a0 (Neil Godwin/Future via Getty Images)",
      "2. Make Product Descriptions Sexy Again",
      "Prompt to use:\"Rewrite this Etsy or Shopify product description to make it more compelling and SEO-friendly. Target audience: [insert group]. Here\u2019s the original: [paste description].\"",
      "Why this works:Let\u2019s face it\u2014most product descriptions online are a snooze. But good copy sells. Whether you\u2019re running your own shop or helping someone else with theirs, compelling product descriptions convert clicks into customers. Use ChatGPT to punch up the language, fine-tune for SEO, and speak directly to your ideal buyer.",
      "DON\u2019T SCAM YOURSELF WITH THE TRICKS HACKERS DON\u2019T WANT ME TO SHARE",
      "Remember: people don\u2019t just want to buy a weird mug. They want to buy what it says about them. That\u2019s where a smart rewrite can turn browsers into buyers.",
      "3. Social Posts That Sell",
      "Prompt to use:\"Create 5 attention-grabbing Instagram captions to promote this [product/service]. Keep the tone [fun, confident, expert] and include a strong call to action.\"",
      "Why this works:We live in a scroll-happy world. Your social captions need to grab attention in less than three seconds. But not everyone\u2019s a copywriter\u2014and not everyone has time to be. AI can help you crank out engaging content in the tone and style that fits your brand. Add a great photo, post consistently, and you\u2019re suddenly a one-person content agency without the overhead (or endless Zoom meetings).",
      "A photo taken on October 4, 2023 in Manta, near Turin, shows a smartphone and a laptop displaying the logos of the artificial intelligence OpenAI research company and ChatGPT chatbot. (MARCO BERTORELLO/AFP via Getty Images)",
      "If you\u2019re managing social for clients or your own biz, this prompt is gold. Use it to build content calendars, write reels scripts, or even draft ad copy.",
      "4. Polite Emails That Save You Money",
      "Prompt to use:\"Write a short, polite email to ask for a lower rate or discount on [tool/service/platform]. Mention that I\u2019m a loyal customer comparing alternatives.\"",
      "Why this works:Negotiating discounts doesn\u2019t always feel comfortable but it absolutely works. Companies often have unpublished deals, especially for longtime users or small businesses. And customer service reps? They're human beings. A kind, well-written email might be all it takes to get a discount on that software you\u2019re using every month.",
      "20 TECH TRICKS TO MAKE LIFE BETTER, SAFER OR EASIER",
      "I\u2019ve personally saved hundreds of dollars just by sending quick, respectful emails like this. AI can help you strike the perfect tone confident but kind, assertive but not pushy.",
      "5. Your Passive Income Kit",
      "Prompt to use:\"Give me 3 high-demand, low-competition ideas for a short e-book or low-content book I can sell on Amazon. I have experience in [insert topic].\"",
      "Why this works:You have knowledge people want. Package it. Sell it. Repeat. Whether it\u2019s a short guide on starting a backyard garden or a workbook for productivity hacks, e-books and low-content books (like journals or planners) sell surprisingly well. And AI can help you brainstorm ideas, outline chapters, even draft content to polish up.",

      "Upload it to Amazon KDP or Gumroad, and now you\u2019ve got a digital product that can earn money in your sleep. People pay for convenience, and you have life experience worth sharing.",
      "Final Thought",
      "You don\u2019t need to master AI to start earning with it. You just need to start using it. These five prompts are a low-risk, high-potential way to get your feet wet. And if you need a hand turning these sparks into something bigger, I\u2019m here.",
      "I built my multimillion-dollar business with no investors and no debt. I\u2019ve done this without a big team or expensive consultants. And I\u2019d love to help you do the same.",

      "Protesters, federal agents clash in Minneapolis as rumors posted online suggested criminal search warrant was an ICE raid. (Credit: Taylor Dahlin via Storyful)",
      "A chaotic protest in Minneapolis during which federal agents were seen getting physical with demonstrators unfolded as elected officials posted \"highly irresponsible\" information online suggesting a criminal search warrant was an ICE operation, police say.",
      "Tense moments were captured on video Tuesday as federal agents and the public clashed in the streets of the major city, with State Sen. Omar Fateh claiming on Facebook that \"On scene are DHS, ICE, FBI, Sheriffs, and MPD\" in what he described as \"blatant fascism on display.\"",
      "In a follow-up post, Fateh said \"While the Mayor has told us ICE is not welcome in our city, what residents saw was their deployment assisted by his MPD.\"",
      "However, the federal operation focusing on a Mexican restaurant actually \"was related to a criminal search warrant for drugs and money laundering and was not related to immigration enforcement\" and \"No arrests were made,\" according to Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey.",
      "\"The information that came out on social media from elected officials was highly irresponsible,\" Hennepin County Sheriff Dawanna Witt then said Wednesday. \"There were ways for them to have accurate information and instead of getting accurate information, being impulsive and putting out things that could potentially incite riots is senseless.\"",

      "Protesters confront \u00a0federal agents as they conducted a criminal search warrant in Minneapolis, on Tuesday, June 3. (Kerem Y\u00fccel/Minnesota Public Radio via AP)",
      "\"Yesterday's incident was a criminal investigation,\" she added. \"So putting out the rhetoric that that was a raid, it was not a raid. Putting out the rhetoric that it was an immigration enforcement, the Hennepin County Sheriff's Office does not participate in immigration enforcement. Elected officials have a responsibility to the constituents to put out accurate information. They don't have to agree with it, but do not mislead the public, causing more harm to our communities.\"",
      "Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara added that \"Ultimately, you can say what you want and point fingers and blame people for different things, how it happened, whether they should or shouldn\u2019t have or whatever, but the bottom line is if a tragedy happened at Lake and Bloom yesterday, it doesn\u2019t matter who is at fault. The community loses. The feds lose. We all lose, and we are left behind.",
      "\"The feds can leave, we are left behind to deal with the consequences,\" O'Hara continued. \"And what I saw yesterday as they were trying to leave, aside from just the verbal things that were being said, but with things being thrown at them \u2013 in some cases heavily-armed federal agents getting into hand-to-hand situations with people who are protesting \u2013 is not good.\"",

      "Homeland Security did not immediately respond Thursday to a request for comment from Fox News Digital.",

      "\"From drug smuggling to criminal labor trafficking, this operation showcases the breadth of our collective missions and the strength of a united front,\" the statement added, noting that \"This HSI led investigation wouldn\u2019t have been possible without the extraordinary collaboration of our state partners and federal HSTF partners.\"",

      "In a wide-ranging exclusive interview with Fox News Digital, Focus on the Family President Jim Daly responded to the Southern Poverty Law Center\u2019s (SPLC) recent decision to classify his organization as a \"hate group,\" calling the label \"discouraging,\" \"dangerous,\" and a reflection of \"what\u2019s wrong with the culture right now.\"",
      "Focus on the Family, a Colorado-based nonprofit founded in 1977 by Dr. James Dobson, is one of the most visible Christian ministries in the United States, offering counseling, crisis intervention, parenting resources, foster care support, and more.According to Daly, the group reaches six million radio listeners and several million digital viewers, with a mission of \"helping parents to be the best parents they could be, all with the undertone of a Christian understanding.\"",
      "But now, the nonprofit finds itself added to a controversial SPLC list typically associated with white supremacists and violent extremists.GRASSLEY ALLEGES FBI USED BIASED SOURCES IN ANTI-TRADITIONAL CATHOLIC MEMOS UNDER BIDEN ADMINISTRATION",
      "Focus on the Family President Jim Daly defends the organization\u2019s work as loving and faith-driven, responding to its inclusion on the SPLC\u2019s \"hate group\" list. (Courtesy of Focus on the Family)",
      "\"Southern Poverty Law Center made the decision in some kind of criteria that they, and only they know, and that is to put us on the hate list,\" Daly said. \"I think, again, it exemplifies what's wrong with the culture right now\u2014that we can't have differing opinions on things.\"",
      "At the core of the SPLC\u2019s issue is Focus\u2019s belief in traditional marriage. Daly was direct: \"Our Christian tradition is marriage between one man and one woman, and that's what we believe and we believe we can advocate for that.\"",
      "While Daly acknowledged that society is shifting, he said Focus will not abandon its scriptural roots to satisfy cultural trends. \"For us, we can't relent on changing what we believed to be scriptural truth for the current place of where the culture is at.\"",
      "\"For some reason that then deems us as a hate group,\" he said. \"It\u2019s very discouraging really, because I think the SPLC started in a good place\u2026 but they have turned that muscle now on the Christian community.\"CONCERNED PARENTS OF TRANS KIDS COMPARED TO 'HATE GROUPS' BY COLORADO DEM: WOULDN'T 'ASK THE KKK' FOR OPINION",
      "The Focus on the Family headquarters in Colorado Springs, Colorado. The Christian nonprofit, founded in 1977, provides counseling, foster care resources, and pro-family advocacy. (Courtesy of Focus on the Family)",
      "The implications, Daly warned, are not just reputational.",
      "He recalled the 2012 shooting at Family Research Council (FRC), another Christian nonprofit SPLC labeled as hateful. A gunman entered the FRC office with the intent to kill, and was later quoted saying he was inspired by the SPLC\u2019s \"hate map.\"",
      "\"He said\u2026 his motivation was aroused because Family Research Council had been placed on the SPLC hate list,\" Daly said. \"They are dancing on very dangerous territory when they put these labels out.\"",
      "That danger isn\u2019t theoretical. According to Daly, Focus had protestors at its doorstep within 24 hours of the SPLC\u2019s announcement.",
      "\"We had protesters harassing our employees coming into the door here\u2026 so we had to get and pay for extra police presence on our campus,\" Daly said. \"It raises danger for everybody. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s their motivation, but it is a consequence.\"",
      "But even in the face of hostility, Daly says Focus remains committed to \"doing the work that the Lord has called us to do.\" That includes extensive work in foster care and pregnancy resource services.",
      "\"My wife and I both have been foster parents for 15 years,\" he shared. \"We support pregnancy resource centers with ultrasound machines.\"",

(Photo by Andy Cross/The Denver Post via Getty Images) (Andy Cross/The Denver Post via Getty Images)",
      "He also pointed to Focus\u2019s measurable impact. \"Last year we helped 140,000 couples get through a marital crisis, 540,000 couples to strengthen their marriage,\" he said. \"That\u2019s a good thing.\"",
      "And he asked a pointed question to the SPLC directly: \"Why would you go after an organization doing that much good and label us a hate group? It just, it makes no sense.\"",
      "Daly was clear that the mission isn\u2019t about political gain or culture war bravado, but the gospel.",
      "\"This is not hate,\" Daly said. \"This is the love of Christ trying to show people God's design for marriage and parenting and people.\"",
      "That message, however, is increasingly misunderstood in a culture that Daly says punishes theological conviction. He referenced a meeting with the late Pastor Tim Keller and gay rights activists in New York City as a model.",
      "\"Tim Keller said it so well. He said, \u2018New York City works because we don't go out of our way to put our finger in the other group's eye',\" Daly recounted. \"We need to accept where we're at together and then be at the table of pluralism and say, how do we coexist?\"",
      "He continued: \"Creating a hate list because of your views, your theology, your ideology, just isn't helpful.\"",
      "Asked whether Focus planned a legal response, Daly said it\u2019s under serious consideration. \"There has to be a line where an organization that creates a hate list has to be responsible for that,\" he said. \"If we were to go to court, I think they would be hard-pressed to win that defamation lawsuit.\"",
      "Still, Daly struck a hopeful note. He said the biggest response they\u2019ve received wasn\u2019t fear or funding loss, but support.",
      "\"People that do know us, people that have experienced us helping them through a crisis in their marriage or a crisis with their teenager, they know us,\" Daly said. \"This isn\u2019t who you are, and they get it.\"",
      "Above all, Daly urged believers to respond to cultural hostility with character.",
      "\"Romans 2:4 says it\u2019s God\u2019s kindness that leads one to repentance\u2014and I believe in that,\" he said. \"You can have the most crusty person who hates out for a reason you may not even know, and you start to dialog with them\u2026 and then you find a hurt, a pain that occurred in their life.\"",
      "And for churches wondering how to speak into culture without compromising biblical convictions, Daly offered a closing challenge: don\u2019t just preach orthodoxy: live it.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",
      "\"We know truth. We know orthodoxy, the spoken word. We need more orthopraxy, the doing of the word,\" Daly said. \"We could literally wipe out the foster care list if we just got engaged\u2014one family per church.\"",
      "That vision, he said, is what keeps him going. \"Wouldn\u2019t it be nice if Fox News and the New York Times ran a headline that said: \u2018Christian Church wipes out waiting foster care list\u2019? I\u2019m looking forward to that headline. And that\u2019s what I work for every day.\"",

A deadline that would force TikTok\u2019s Chinese parent company ByteDance to sell the popular social media app or face a U.S. ban is set to expire June 19. Trump now faces the prospect of having to extend the deadline for a third time."

      "Countries across the world were in shock Thursday after President Donald Trump announced a travel ban on nationals from a dozen countries and the cancellation of visa programs for seven more. For many, the move seemed like a return to 2017 and one of the most controversial policies of Trump\u2019s first term.",
      "Trump on Wednesday cited national security and terrorism concerns as motivating factors behind the ban on nationals largely from Africa and Asia, triggering reactions from representatives of those countries that ranged from weary diplomacy to downright anger.",
      "\u201cThe truth is being in the United States is a big risk for anybody, not just for Venezuelans,\u201d said Venezuelan Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello during a weekly show on state television.",

      "The new order affects a patchwork of 19 countries \u2014 some of them banned for the first time, for reasons that the administration said include high rates of visa overstays, lack of \"appropriate screening and vetting measures\" and allegedly being sponsors of terrorism."

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump\u2019s sweeping bid to deport foreign students who have condemned the war in Gaza has been brought to a standstill by federal judges who have repeatedly ruled against the administration, according to an NBC News review of recent court filings.",
      "First, Mahmoud Khalil, a former Columbia University graduate student, was arrested and transported hundreds of miles from his home. Then a graduate student at Tufts University in Massachusetts, R\u00fcmeysa \u00d6zt\u00fcrk, was grabbed off the street by masked plainclothes federal agents. A third student, Badar Khan Suri, a Georgetown University postdoctoral scholar and professor, was arrested at his home, while another Columbia student, Mohsen Mahdawi, was detained at his naturalization interview.",
      "Since then, though, federal judges have rejected the administration\u2019s arguments about court jurisdiction and the continued detention of three of the four students. Federal judges freed \u00d6zt\u00fcrk, Mahdawi and Suri. And a ruling on Khalil\u2019s possible release is expected soon.",
      "In separate legal setbacks for the administration, federal appeals courts upheld lower courts\u2019 orders requiring the government to transfer \u00d6zt\u00fcrk to Vermont for a bail hearing and to release Mahdawi. And late last month, a judge issued an injunction blocking the administration from terminating the legal status of international students at universities across the United States.",
      "The judges have been appointed by both Republican and Democratic presidents, including Trump.",
      "\u201cIt has been very heartening to see the courts recognize the legal issues at play here and recognize that what the administration has been doing is unconstitutional,\u201d said Esha Bhandari, deputy director of the American Civil Liberties Union, which represents several of the students. \u201cThis reinforces just how important it is to have an independent judiciary that can protect individual rights and act as a check when the executive branch overreaches.\u201d",
      "Assistant Homeland Security Secretary Tricia McLaughlin predicted in a statement to NBC News that the administration would eventually prevail in court. \u201cThese rulings delay justice and seek to kneecap the President\u2019s constitutionally vested powers,\u201d she said. \"We expect a higher court to vindicate us in this. We have the law, the facts, and common sense on our side.\u201d",
      "The Justice Department did not respond to a request for comment.",
      "Rarely used provision",
      "The Trump administration\u2019s primary legal argument is that foreign students and scholars can be deported under an obscure provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952. The law allows the secretary of state to remove noncitizens whose presence in the country would have \u201cpotentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.\u201d",
      "Trump administration officials have argued that students who engaged in protests in support of Hamas, a foreign terrorist organization, contributed to antisemitism on college campuses.",
      "Khalil and the other students have denied allegations of antisemitism and of providing support to Hamas or any other terrorist organization, and they say they have not participated in protests backing Hamas. None of the four face any publicly known criminal charges.",
      "The government has yet to disclose any evidence linking the students to Hamas or praising the group, which the United States designated a foreign terrorist organization in 1997.",
      "Attorneys representing the students have argued that their clients\u2019 detainment and the efforts to deport them are retaliation for constitutionally protected free speech and advocacy for Palestinian rights.",
      "Khalil, a legal permanent resident, played a key role in the student protests at Columbia University last year by leading negotiations between the protesters and university officials. The other Columbia student, Mahdawi, was a prominent organizer of the pro-Palestinian demonstrations on campus. \u00d6zt\u00fcrk, a graduate student, wrote an op-ed in her student newspaper at Tufts University that was critical of the university\u2019s response to the war in Gaza.",
      "Last week, a federal judge in New Jersey ruled against the administration\u2019s claim that Khalil\u2019s beliefs and speech had adverse consequences for U.S. foreign policy. It was the first time a judge has said the government\u2019s primary justification for deporting Khalil was most likely unconstitutional.",
      "U.S. District Judge Michael Farbiarz said Secretary of State Marco Rubio failed to \u201caffirmatively determine\u201d that Khalil\u2019s alleged conduct has affected U.S. relations with another country, adding that deporting Khalil under the provision would be \u201cunprecedented.\u201d",
      "In response to a request for comment, a State Department spokesperson said, \u201cWe don\u2019t comment on pending litigation.\u201d",
      "Lora Ries, director of the Heritage Foundation\u2019s border security and immigration center, said the judges were unfairly blocking Trump.",
      "\u201cThere have been a lot of activist judges issuing rulings against the Trump administration,\u201d Ries said. \u201cThere is a clear effort, beyond even what we saw in Trump\u2019s first term, to slow down a lot of the efforts to enforce immigration law.\u201d",
      "Daniel Kanstroom, a professor at Boston College Law School, predicted that judges would continue to rule in international students\u2019 favor.",
      "\u201cI think the courts are going to view this period as one in which the judiciary should and needs to exert a little more force and authority than it might do in other circumstances,\u201d Kanstroom said. \u201cJust to bring the tone down a little bit and bring us back to a more normal interaction among the three branches.\u201d",
      "Detention losses",
      "In April, U.S. District Judge Geoffrey Crawford ruled that Mahdawi, 34, a U.S. permanent resident who was born and raised in a refugee camp in the West Bank, should be released from a Vermont immigration detention facility on bail. Crawford said Mahdawi\u2019s continued detention would be likely to have a \u201cchilling effect on protected speech.\u201d",
      "The government opposed freeing Mahdawi, citing law enforcement records that indicated he was \u201cinvolved in and supporting antisemitic acts of violence\u201d and that he had \u201can interest in and facility with firearms for that purpose,\u201d according to court documents filed under seal but reviewed by NBC News.",
      "But in a court order, Crawford said law enforcement had determined that a Vermont gun shop owner\u2019s accusations against Mahdawi were unsubstantiated.",
      "In May, U.S. District Judge William Sessions III freed \u00d6zt\u00fcrk from detention, writing, \u201cThere has been no evidence introduced by the government other than the op-ed,\u201d referring to the student newspaper op-ed in which \u00d6zt\u00fcrk called on Tufts to acknowledge the war in Gaza. \u201cThat literally is the case. There is no evidence here,\u201d Sessions said.",
      "Sessions said \u00d6zt\u00fcrk\u2019s continued detention infringed on her First Amendment and due process rights. He added that it might be justified \u201cif the government had presented a legitimate case for it, but it has not done so.\u201d",
      "Legal struggle ahead",
      "No cases involving the deportation of foreign students for their condemnation of the war in Gaza are before the Supreme Court, but they could be in the future.",
      "Conor Fitzpatrick, a supervising senior attorney at the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, a nonprofit civil liberties group, said the Supreme Court has yet to address the intersection of executive power, immigration law and free speech. Until it does, the fate of foreign students and scholars in the United States remains uncertain.",
      "\u201cThere is a real sense of unease for international students and international faculty about whether they can feel safe voicing their opinions,\u201d Fitzpatrick said. \u201cThey\u2019re worried about risking their immigration status, and that is a harm that is going to take a long time to undo.\u201d",
      "John Yoo, a law professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who served as a senior Justice Department official during the George W. Bush administration, said the cases will create a unique challenge for the Supreme Court.",
      "\u201cThe two things that this court has been very supportive of are coming into collision,\u201d Yoo said. \u201cThe Roberts Court has been very deferential to the executive branch in general. On the other hand, this court has also been extremely protective of freedom of speech.\u201d",
      "He added, \u201cIt\u2019s going to cause a lot of tension at the court.\u201d"

      "Trump frequently uses Biden as a political foil and has sought to undo a number of policies from his predecessor's administration since he returned to office.",
      "The announcement Wednesday directs the White House counsel and Attorney General Pam Bondi to investigate whether anyone \"conspired to deceive the public about Biden's mental state and unconstitutionally exercise the authorities and responsibilities of the President.\" It is an escalation of an issue that Trump and his allies have frequently raised, possibly paving the way for Republicans to argue that many of Biden\u2019s actions as president were invalid.",
      "\"This conspiracy marks one of the most dangerous and concerning scandals in American history,\" Trump wrote in a memo. \"The American public was purposefully shielded from discovering who wielded the executive power, all while Biden\u2019s signature was deployed across thousands of documents to effect radical policy shifts.\"",
      "Trump has acknowledged using the autopen himself in office. In March, he said he turned to it \u201conly for very unimportant papers,\u201d such as responses to letters.",

      "Autopens have long been a mechanical tool to reproduce signatures in the White House, with Barack Obama being the first president to use it to sign legislation, according to The Associated Press.",
      "Previous administrations have pointed to a 2005 Office of Legal Counsel memo stating that the president \u201cneed not personally perform the physical act of affixing his signature to a bill he approves and decides to sign in order for the bill to become law.\u201d",

      "The report was released by the Ethics and Public Policy Center, a conservative think tank that served on the advisory board of Project 2025, a right-wing policy initiative that called for the FDA to walk back its approval of mifepristone.",
      "The attorneys general said Thursday that the FDA should use the safety review as an opportunity to remove barriers to accessing mifepristone nationwide \u2014 or, at minimum, in the four states involved in the petition.",
      "The FDA regulates certain medications with serious safety concerns via a drug safety program called Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (REMS). Mifepristone is currently part of that program, though a wealth of research has shown that less than 0.5% of women who take it have serious adverse reactions. Studies have also demonstrated that prescribing mifepristone through telehealth is as safe and effective as administering it in person.",
      "As part of the REMS program, mifepristone is subject to a few restrictions: People who prescribe the pills must be certified health care providers, and pharmacies must obtain certifications to dispense the medication. Patients who receive mifepristone must also sign a form attesting that they intend to end their pregnancy.",
      "The attorneys general said in their petition that those restrictions are burdensome and unnecessary. They claim that many primary care and family medicine physicians aren\u2019t able or willing to take on the administrative burden of getting certified to prescribe the pills, or are worried about being added to a list of national or local abortion providers.",
      "The FDA has already lifted several restrictions on mifepristone over the last decade. In 2016, it extended the window in which mifepristone could be used to terminate pregnancies from seven weeks\u2019 gestation to 10 weeks. In 2019, it approved a generic form of the medication, which increased supply. And in 2021, it eliminated a requirement to dispense mifepristone in person, allowing the drug to be prescribed via telehealth and sent by mail.",
      "Anti-abortion groups have called on the FDA to reinstate those restrictions, often pointing to misleading studies that suggest the medication has harmful effects. The April report that launched the FDA safety review, for instance, claims to find a 22-times higher rate of serious complications from mifepristone than reported by the agency.",
      "In their petition Thursday, the four attorneys general denounced recent attempts to challenge mifepristone\u2019s safety, which they said rely on methodologically flawed research.",
      "A coalition of anti-abortion groups sued the FDA in 2022 over its approval of mifepristone, citing two studies from the Charlotte Lozier Institute, a group that opposes abortion, that claimed to show severe complications from the drug. The lawsuit was ultimately thrown out by the Supreme Court and the studies were later retracted by a medical publisher.",
      "The Charlotte Lozier Institute released another paper last month claiming that a growing number of emergency room visits after abortions are incorrectly attributed to miscarriages, thereby masking abortion complications.",
      "Rachel Jones, a principal research scientist at the Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that supports abortion access, said the data only captures a small portion of abortions and is skewed in favor of those that are potentially higher risk. Some of the same data was used in the retracted studies, she said.",
      "Jones added that the timing of the new reports from anti-abortion groups is not coincidental.",
      "\u201cThe anti-choice people are really going after medication abortion and doing whatever they can to get the FDA under the Trump administration to revisit the availability of the drug,\u201d she said."

    "story": [
      "President Donald Trump announced Wednesday night that nationals from 12 countries would be banned from entering the United States starting on Monday.",
      "Trump said that the ban, which primarily targets countries in Africa and the Middle East, was necessary to preserve national security and prevent terrorism in the U.S.",
      "\"As President, I must act to protect the national security and national interest of the United States and its people,\" Trump's proclamation reads. \"I remain committed to engaging with those countries willing to cooperate to improve information-sharing and identity-management procedures, and to address both terrorism-related and public-safety risks.\"",
      "Who is banned?",
      "Citizens of the following 12 countries will be blocked from entering the United States: Afghanistan, Chad, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Myanmar, the Republic of Congo, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen.",
      "In addition, nationals of seven other countries will be barred from coming into the U.S. permanently or under several visa programs: Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela.",
      "When does the ban take effect?",
      "The executive goes into effect Monday at 12:01 am ET.",
      "Why now?",
      "Addressing reporters at the White House on Thursday alongside German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Trump said he implemented the new ban now because \"it can\u2019t come soon enough.\"",
      "\"Frankly, we want to keep bad people out of our country,\" Trump said.",
      "A similar policy in Trump's first term, which barred foreigners from six Muslim-majority countries from entering the country, was reversed by then-President Joe Biden.",
      "On the campaign trail, Trump promised he would revive the ban.",
      "In a video posted Wednesday on YouTube, Trump cited the attack Sunday in Boulder as justification for the travel ban renewal.",
      "\"The recent terror attack in Boulder, Colorado, has underscored the extreme dangers posed to our country by the entry of foreign nationals who are not properly vetted, as well as those who come here as temporary visitors and overstay their visas,\" Trump said. \"We don\u2019t want them.\"",
      "The suspect in the Boulder attack, Mohamed Sabry Soliman, is accused of using a \u201cmakeshift flamethrower\u201d and Molotov cocktails on a group of people peacefully calling for the release of Israeli hostages in Gaza.",
      "Soliman entered the U.S. legally from Egypt in 2022 on a tourist visa, according to officials.",
      "Egypt is not one of the countries affected by the new travel ban.",
      "When asked at the White House on Thursday why Egypt was excluded from the list of restricted nations, Trump said, \"Egypt has been a country that we deal with very closely.\"",
      "\"They have things under control,\" he said.\"The countries that we have don\u2019t have things under control.\"",
      "Are there any exceptions?",
      "Yes. The ban will not affect nationals who are already lawful permanent residents of the U.S. In other words, the proclamation will not apply to nationals from the list of banned countries who have green cards or who are living in the U.S. with a visa.",
      "It will also not affect citizens of the banned countries who have citizenship in a second country and are entering the U.S. with a passport from an unrestricted nation.",
      "Other exemptions include Afghans who helped the U.S. government during the war in Afghanistan; ethnic and religious minorities facing persecution in Iran; athletes from banned countries who are entering the U.S for the World Cup or the Olympics; and children who are being adopted."

    "published": "Thu, 05 Jun 2025 14:16:17 GMT",
    "summary": "One of the few companies to specialize in iPhone cybersecurity said that it has uncovered evidence of a potentially groundbreaking hacking campaign.",
    "story": [
      "One of the few companies to specialize in iPhone cybersecurity said in a report Thursday that it has uncovered evidence in a handful of mobile phones of a potential hacking campaign targeting five high-profile Americans in media, artificial intelligence and politics, including former members of Kamala Harris\u2019 presidential campaign.",
      "The preliminary research, conducted by the cybersecurity firm iVerify, includes a \u201csignificant amount of circumstantial evidence,\u201d iVerify CEO Rocky Cole said. Apple, the maker of the iPhone, pushed back on the findings.",
      "But Cole said the report was worth publishing for use by the cybersecurity research community. Apple's reputation is sterling among security professionals, and if it is confirmed a hack occurred, it would be a significant development in the cybersecurity industry.",
      "IVerify has not identified who may be behind the potential hacking operation, but believes the targets and technical sophistication suggest a capable spy agency may have been involved.",
      "Two people familiar with the investigation told NBC News that former members of the Harris-Walz campaign were some of the people iVerify believes were targeted.\u00a0It\u2019s not clear what initially set off the investigation.",
      "IVerify said that in addition to the Americans who were targeted, a European government official\u2019s iPhone had indications of remote tampering. It appears that last year, a hacker remotely and secretly installed a type of invasive, malicious program known as spyware to snoop on those users without their knowledge, iVerify said. Out of nearly 50,000 phones that iVerify analyzed, it found only six \u2014 all belonging to high-profile people who would be potential targets for an espionage campaign \u2014 that showed evidence of exploitation.",
      "Apple disputed iVerify\u2019s conclusion that its evidence is a strong indication that iPhones were hacked.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve thoroughly analyzed the information provided by iVerify, and strongly disagree with the claims of a targeted attack against our users. Based on field data from our devices, this report points to a conventional software bug that we identified and fixed in iOS 18.3,\u201d Ivan Krsti\u0107, the head of Apple Security Engineering and Architecture, said in an emailed statement.",
      "Apple is \u201cnot currently aware of any credible indication that the bug points to an exploitation attempt or active attack,\u201d Krsti\u0107 said.",
      "Cole, iVerify's CEO, responded in a statement: \u201cIn light of the recent public conversation around mobile security, there is ample evidence in the report worth sharing with the research community. We\u2019ve never claimed there is a smoking gun here, only a significant amount of circumstantial evidence.\u201d",
      "iVerify\u2019s report makes it clear it did not directly catch malicious software that took over phones. Instead, its researchers found evidence that it had been installed, then deleted. The phones suspected of being hacked displayed suspicious activity in crash logs, the records a computer or a smartphone automatically writes when the operating system encounters an error or a program fails. That indicates tampering, the company said.",
      "\u201cWe identified exceedingly rare crash logs that appeared exclusively on devices belonging to high-risk individuals including government officials, political campaign staff, journalists, and tech executives,\u201d the report says. \u201cAt least one affected European Union government official received an Apple Threat Notification approximately thirty days after we observed this crash on their device, and forensic examination of another device revealed signs of successful exploitation.\u201d",
      "Andrew Hoog, a co-founder of the mobile phone security company NowSecure, told NBC News that he found iVerify\u2019s \u201canalysis and conclusions credible and consistent with what we\u2019ve observed over nearly a decade of mobile zero-click attacks.\u201d",
      "If a spyware campaign has been taking over high-profile Americans\u2019 phones, it would be a major escalation in the back-and-forth between cyberspies and the security engineers who try to stop them. The iPhone\u2019s cybersecurity is widely revered, and cybersecurity experts largely view iPhones as some of the most secure devices that are commercially available.",
      "Apple routinely updates its operating system to fix flaws that hackers use to break in. But it has also designed the iPhone operating system to share very little information with cybersecurity researchers, far less than most other operating systems.",
      "iVerify\u2019s claim comes in the context of other allegations that cyberspies snooped on the 2024 presidential campaigns, including the United States\u2019 accusing China of listening to both parties\u2019 presidential campaigns\u2019 phone calls and Iran of hacking Trump campaign emails and sending stolen information to Biden campaign officials. Under the Biden administration, the Justice Department charged three Iranians in connection with the operation in September.",
      "Researchers have for years tracked governments\u2019 use of spyware to spy on journalists and activists in other countries. Politicians in France and Spain have been targeted by spyware, prompting national scandals. IVerify\u2019s report is the first major public claim of spyware\u2019s successfully breaking into iPhones tied to American phone numbers and high-profile Americans.",
      "There is precedent for cyberspies\u2019 targeting major political campaigns. Last year, Microsoft, Google and several federal agencies said Chinese intelligence had hacked several major telecommunications companies, including AT&T and Verizon, and used that access to specifically spy on both the Trump and Harris campaigns\u2019 conversations.",
      "The White House did not respond to a request for comment. The Trump campaign did not hire iVerify, so it does not have data from it to analyze. Sources who confirmed that members of the Harris-Walz campaign were among those whom iVerify has investigated as targets of the campaign did not identify those people.",
      "iVerify also discovered a potential way hackers could have gotten in: a vulnerability in iMessage, the chat app that comes preloaded in Apple phones, that appears to be a zero-click vulnerability, meaning a hacker could exploit it without the user\u2019s even knowing. Apple has since patched the vulnerability.",
      "Spyware can give remote hackers remarkable insight into their victims\u2019 personal messages and accounts. While confirmed instances are rare, it is the only proven tactic for hackers to reliably bypass the major privacy protections available for commercial phones, like the encrypted messaging app Signal. A hacker who successfully deploys spyware on politicians\u2019 phones, for instance, could read all their Signal chats, track their browsing histories, listen to their phone calls and even turn the phones into covert listening devices to spy on conversations while they are in the targets\u2019 pockets.",
      "By giving a hacker remote access to a phone, spyware goes beyond even the Salt Typhoon espionage campaign, in which the United States accused China last year of hacking AT&T and Verizon to intercept phone calls and text messages as they traveled from one person to another \u2014 including targeting the messages of both the Trump-Vance and Harris-Walz campaigns.",
      "The most commonly identified spyware in such cases is designed by the Israeli company NSO Group, which is sanctioned by the United States and has long claimed its products cannot be used to hack phones with American numbers. An NSO Group spokesperson told NBC News it was not involved in the incidents iVerify\u2019s research identified.",
      "American diplomats and embassy workers abroad have also been infected with NSO spyware, according to the Biden White House, but evidence that such technology had targeted a U.S. presidential campaign or other high-profile Americans in the United States has never been previously reported.",
      "\u201cI think it illustrates that mobile compromise is real, not academic or hypothetical, and it\u2019s happening here in the United States in a systematic way,\u201d said Cole, iVerify\u2019s CEO. He declined to specify the identities of the five people whose phones exhibited signs of having been targeted with spyware, except to say that they are all Americans who work in politics, media and artificial intelligence and that all would be of interest to a foreign intelligence service.",
      "The fact that sophisticated phone spyware is becoming the most reliable way to read a person\u2019s otherwise secure messages makes it an obvious tactic for spy agencies, despite its technical difficulty, said Patrick Arvidson, a National Security Agency veteran who worked on mobile phone security at the agency, who viewed iVerify\u2019s report before it was published.",
      "\u201cI think that you\u2019re going to see in the coming year, two years, three years, more and more of these kinds of mass-scale incidents,\u201d he said."

      "Ames has worked at the department since 2004, but the dispute arose after she began reporting to a lesbian woman in 2017. She was denied the promotion she sought two years later and demoted soon after that. She was at work on Thursday when the Supreme Court ruled.",
      "The state says Ames was demoted because new leadership in the agency wanted to restructure its operations to focus on sexual violence in the juvenile corrections system. Ames had led a program aimed at combating rape in prison but was seen as difficult to work with, according to the state\u2019s court papers.",
      "Officials involved in making those decisions are straight, the state has pointed out.",
      "Lower courts, including the Cincinnati-based 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, ruled for the state agency. Ames then turned to the Supreme Court."

      "The U.S.-based Gaza Humanitarian Foundation said only two sites in southern Gaza\u2019s Rafah area would operate Thursday, after all sites were closed the day before for maintenance.

      "Luigi Mangione wrote about plans to kill UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in his diary months before the healthcare executive was gunned down in New York City last year, state prosecutors alleged in a Wednesday court filing.",
      "Mangione, a 27-year-old who has pleaded not guilty to state and federal charges in connection with the December murder, allegedly used a red notebook as a diary to document his plans to kill Thompson, the court filing states. The notebook was confiscated by authorities during Mangione's arrest in Pennsylvania after a five-day manhunt for Thompson's killer.",
      "\"So say you want to rebel against the deadly, greed fueled health insurance cartel. Do you bomb the HQ? No. Bombs=terrorism,\" Mangione allegedly wrote in August 2024, the state court filing states. \"Such actions appear the unjustified anger of someone who simply got sick/had bad luck and took their frustration out on the insurance industry, while recklessly endangering countless employees.\"",
      "Instead of carrying out a bombing, prosecutors allege, Mangione wrote in an entry last October that someone should \"wack [sic] the CEO at the annual parasitic bean-counter convention.\"",
      "\"It's targeted, precise, and doesn't risk innocents. Most importantly, the point is self-evident,\" the diary entry reads, according to the filing. \"The point is made in the news headline 'Insurance CEO killed at annual investors conference.'\"",
      "In submitting the court filing, state prosecutors were trying to justify the terrorism enhancement added to Mangione's first-degree murder charge. Last month, Mangione's attorney filed a motion to dismiss the New York state murder charges against him.",
      "\"If ever there were an open and shut case pointing to defendant\u2019s guilty, this case is that case,\" Manhattan Assistant District Attorney Joel Seidemann wrote in the filing. \"Simply put, one would be hard pressed to find a case with such overwhelming evidence of guilt as to the identity of the murderer and premeditated nature of the assassination.\"",
      "\"Brian Thompson and UHC were simply symbols of the healthcare industry and what the defendant considered a deadly greed-fueled cartel,\"  Seidemann added in the filing.",
      "Mangione\u2019s attorney did not immediately return a request for comment.",
      "Thompson, 50, was fatally shot in December by a masked gunman outside the New York Hilton hotel in midtown Manhattan, hours before he was set to speak at UnitedHealth Group\u2019s investor conference.",
      "The shooter fled on a bike and rode into Central Park, evading capture by authorities.",
      "Five days later, a worker at a McDonald\u2019s in Altoona, Pennsylvania, called the police and said they believed a masked man who matched images authorities released of the gunman. The masked man in the McDonald's was Mangione, authorities said.",
      "While Thompson's death caused outcry, it also prompted a wider national conversation about the high costs of healthcare in the United States.",
      "Mangione's state and federal hearings in New York City regularly draw protests against the healthcare industry, with flocks of people gathering outside the courthouse calling for Mangione's release.",
      "The legal defense fund for Mangione has surpassed $1 million in the weeks after Attorney General Pam Bondi directed federal prosecutors to seek the death penalty for the 27-year-old.",
      "Mangione will next appear in court for his state charges on June 26."

    "story": [
      "By the end of Season 3 of \"Ginny & Georgia,\" Georgia Miller\u2019s carefully crafted image as a charming Southern mom has officially unraveled. Beneath the sunny smile and picture-perfect exterior is a woman who has killed three times.",
      "Not every act was cold-blooded murder, but each one left a body behind. Georgia may have walked out of court a free woman, but her secrets are no longer buried. Her past, once guarded so fiercely, is now in full view.",
      "\u201cWe\u2019ve been calling this Georgia\u2019s breakdown season,\u201d actor Brianne Howey, who plays Georgia, tells TODAY.com. \u201cGinny had to go through it last season, and now it was Georgia\u2019s turn. Georgia has to face these consequences, and yes, as an actor, it was devastating.\u201d",
      "\u201cGeorgia got very burned this season \u2014 but I\u2019m hoping to see her rise from the ashes,\u201d she says.",
      "Here\u2019s a breakdown of the lives Georgia has taken, her motivations and how those choices may continue to unravel in future seasons.",
      "Tom Fuller (Season 2, Episode 10)",
      "Georgia\u2019s most controversial kill comes in the Season 2 finale, when she smothers Cynthia Fuller\u2019s (Sabrina Grdevich) comatose husband, Tom (Vincent Legault), with a pillow. Cynthia never asked her to \u2014 but Georgia takes it upon herself.",
      "It\u2019s framed as a mercy killing, but it also conveniently removes an obstacle in Cynthia\u2019s life \u2014 which benefits Georgia socially and emotionally.",
      "\u201cThere haven\u2019t, historically in her life, been a lot of people who have helped her, so that has so much weight to her,\u201d series creator Sarah Lampert tells TODAY.com. \u201cShe really does see killing Cynthia\u2019s husband, in her mind, as a favor. She views herself as judge, jury and executioner.\u201d",
      "Georgia feels indebted to Cynthia for helping her get rid of her abusive ex, Gil. Killing Tom is Georgia\u2019s twisted way of repaying that kindness, actor Howey says.",
      "\u201cGeorgia didn\u2019t want anybody to know what her relationship with Gil was like,\u201d Howey tells TODAY.com. \u201cBut Georgia doesn\u2019t have a lot of friends. The act of kindness Cynthia offered her \u2014 by making sure Gil couldn\u2019t live in town \u2014 was paramount for Georgia. Nothing had meant more to her.\u201d",
      "\u201cSo yes, Georgia can feel morally ambiguous,\u201d she adds. \u201cBut Georgia feels that her intentions are pure. She wanted to give Cynthia the same favor Cynthia gave her \u2014 to remove the pain in her life. It\u2019s very nuanced and complicated, but I think there\u2019s a recognition between these two women about how hard it is to be a mom and a woman.\u201d",
      "Kenny Drexel (Season 1)",
      "Kenny (Darryl Scheelar), Georgia\u2019s wealthy second husband, dies under mysterious circumstances \u2014 until it\u2019s revealed Georgia had poisoned his smoothie with wolfsbane.",
      "Georgia later claims she did it to protect Ginny, after discovering Kenny had been sexually inappropriate toward her daughter. It\u2019s the first clear sign that Georgia is willing to kill for her family \u2014 and to keep control of the narrative.",
      "\u201cKenny was a bad guy,\u201d Antonia Gentry, who plays Ginny, tells TODAY.com. \u201cA lot of what happens to Ginny and Georgia happens simply because of the decisions they make. So maybe the bad guy at the end of the day is just their carelessness, their recklessness, their impulsivity.\u201d",
      "Anthony Green (Season 1, Flashback)",
      "In a flashback from years earlier, Georgia\u2019s abusive ex-husband, Anthony Green (Rodrigo Fernandez-Stoll), shows up, threatening both her and a young Ginny. Georgia shoots him, a death that\u2019s arguably self-defense.",
      "Still, she disposes of the body and never reports it. The moment shapes her view of justice: If the system won\u2019t help her, she\u2019ll take matters into her own hands.",
      "\u201cGeorgia can feel morally ambiguous, but Georgia feels that her intentions are pure,\u201d Howey says."

      "Paul Moves In to Georgia\u2019s House",
      "With their relationship progressing and wedding plans underway, Georgia (Brianne Howey) and Paul (Scott Porter) move in together. It isn\u2019t all sunshine and roses, though.",
      "Paul quickly grows frustrated with Georgia\u2019s fierce independence when it comes to parenting her children. After all, he loves Ginny (Antonia Gentry) and Austin (Diesel La Torraca) and wants to play a role in their lives.",
      "Paul also discovers one of Georgia\u2019s guns and emphasizes how much he wishes she didn\u2019t have one in the house.",
      "Over time, Georgia opens up more to Paul, even if she didn\u2019t originally plan to (more on that later).",
      "Austin\u2019s Father Gets Out of Jail and Shows Up",
      "Gil (Aaron Ashmore), Austin\u2019s father and Georgia\u2019s abusive ex, gets released from jail in Season 2 and causes chaos when he shows up to town. He\u2019s pretty annoyed that Georgia framed him for embezzlement and he\u2019s determined to make her life miserable.",
      "Gil tries to blackmail Georgia into getting money for him from Paul, whose family is wealthy, and promises not to tell Paul some of her seedy secrets in return.",
      "Gil\u2019s violent tendencies are seen in the past via flashback scenes and also in the present, when he threatens Georgia in her own kitchen and gets physical. Austin sees his father hurting his mother and grabs his mother\u2019s gun and shoots him. Gil only sustains a minor wound.",
      "Georgia covers up the mess but later fesses up to Paul about the incident, along with several of the secrets from her past, and he gets his lawyer involved. He tells Gil he no longer has leverage against Georgia since she told him everything (well, almost) and says he needs to go through him to contact Georgia or Austin.",
      "Georgia Tells Ginny She Killed Her First Husband",
      "Heading into Season 2, Ginny already knew that Georgia killed her ex-husband Kenny. During the second season, the mother of two also opens up to her daughter about one of her deepest, darkest secrets: The murder of her first husband.",
      "Ginny reveals that she killed him by mistake back when Ginny was a baby. As it turns out, she was just trying to make him sleep for a few hours but messed up the dosage of whatever concoction she made him and he ended up dying.",
      "Cynthia and Joe Formed a Deeper Connection",
      "Cynthia (Sabrina Grdevich) is having a hard time watching her husband, who is in hospice and unconscious, slowly slip away at home. She finds comfort talking to Joe (Raymond Ablack) and before they know it, they\u2019re ripping each other\u2019s clothes off one night after forming a close connection.",

      "Ginny and Marcus Break Up",
      "Marcus (Felix Mallard) and Ginny\u2019s relationship has been flourishing ever since they finally made things official. But like all teenage romances, it\u2019s bound to encounter a few bumps along the way.",
      "For instance, Marcus suddenly starts drinking more and shows up to school drunk one day. Meanwhile, he\u2019s been exhibiting symptoms of depression, causing his family (and Ginny) to be concerned about his well-being.",
      "While talking with his twin sister, Max (Sara Waisglass), Marcus says Ginny is the only thing that makes him happy right now, but he realizes that one person can\u2019t be responsible for another\u2019s happiness. He questions if he should be in a relationship, and Ginny overhears without catching the context of the conversation.",
      "While attending a school play, Ginny and Marcus get into a fight and she asks if he wants to be with her. After going back and forth, Marcus acknowledges that he doesn\u2019t have room for anyone else\u2019s pain except his own right now.",
      "Ginny later learns that Marcus is struggling emotionally and vows to support him, even if they\u2019re not romantically involved anymore.",
      "Love Blossoms for Several of Ginny\u2019s Friends",
      "Ginny and Marcus\u2019 relationship isn\u2019t the only high school romance during Season 2. Ginny\u2019s friend Bracia (Tameka Griffiths) has a crush on one of her co-stars from the school play and works up the courage to ask him out. He tells her she\u2019s the reason he did the play since he also has a crush on her.",
      "Sparks also fly between Max and a girl named Silver (Katelyn Wells) who has been responsible for the play\u2019s wardrobe when they share a kiss after the play. Max\u2019s former flame Sophie (Humberly Gonz\u00e1lez) then asks if she wants to get together to talk and address some unresolved business.",
      "While they meet, Max says she can\u2019t be Sophie\u2019s friend because she just started getting over her.",
      "Georgia Kills Cynthia's Husband",
      "Though Cynthia and Georgia have a complicated, frenemy type of relationship, they band together for various reasons in Season 2. When Cynthia sees Gil harassing Georgia, Cynthia makes sure he won\u2019t get an apartment in town by blacklisting his rental application.",
      "As Georgia and Cynthia\u2019s sons have become close friends, Georgia has witnessed how brokenhearted and exhausted Cynthia is caring for her husband in hospice. Georgia eventually does what she considers an act of mercy: Georgia smothers Cynthia\u2019s husband with a pillow, killing him. Unbeknownst to Georgia, Austin is hiding in a closet in the room and sees the whole thing.",
      "Georgia Marries Paul \u2014 Then Gets Arrested",

That's down from the 145% punitive level Trump had imposed until a handshake agreement in Geneva last month led to a mutual stand-down that also saw China reduce its duties on U.S. imports down to 10% from 125%.",
      "But tensions heated up again Friday after Trump accused China of violating the Geneva understanding, though without adding many specifics. That prompted China to level a similar accusation against Trump on Monday.",

      "\u201cThe venue is only a 10-minute ride from my school, and it would have been fun to go with friends,\u201d she said.",
      "C9 Entertainment, which manages Epex, cited \u201clocal circumstances\u201d in announcing the cancellation on May 9, dashing hopes that China was opening its doors to K-pop shows for the first time since 2016.",
      "The ban, which China has never officially acknowledged, began after South Korea announced the deployment of an American anti-ballistic missile defense system that China said was aimed at constraining its power in the region.",
      "Before the ban, China \u2014 the second-biggest music market in Asia after Japan \u2014 was one of the fastest-growing markets for K-pop and other South Korean pop culture, whose rapid rise in global popularity is known as the Korean Wave, or hallyu.",
      "\u201cIn the K-content and K-pop markets as well, China\u2019s consumer power is regarded as top-tier,\u201d said Kang Soyoung, a professor at Seoul Digital University.",
      "The China ban is estimated to have cost the South Korean economy almost $16 billion since 2016, she said.",
      "But the Epex concert\u2019s cancellation does not necessarily reflect the official position of the Chinese government, Kang cautioned, as China has been gradually reopening to South Korean culture after years of tension.",
      "While K-pop acts have been blocked, other South Korean bands have been allowed to play. In April, the South Korean hip-hop trio Homies became the first all-Korean act to perform in mainland China in eight years. A South Korea-based Korean American musician in a one-man indie rock band performed in the Chinese cities of Xi'an, Wuhan and Zhengzhou in late 2024 and early 2025.",
      "A large-scale K-pop joint concert is also scheduled to be held in September at a 40,000-seat stadium in the Chinese island province of Hainan. The Korea Entertainment Producers\u2019 Association, which announced the event in April, did not reply to an email asking whether that concert is still going ahead.",
      "Kang said she believed the hallyu ban would soon be lifted and the Hainan concert would \u201cproceed without issue.\u201d",
      "There are also signs of growing business ties. Hybe, the South Korean entertainment company that manages the global K-pop sensation BTS, recently opened an office in Beijing, according to South Korean media. On Friday, China\u2019s Tencent Music was set to become the second-largest shareholder in the other major K-pop label, SM Entertainment, after Hybe said in a regulatory filing that it would sell Tencent its entire stake.",
      "\u201cIt shows that there is a greater opportunity for collaboration between the two countries, especially in the entertainment industry,\u201d said Ellen Kim, director of academic affairs at the Korea Economic Institute of America. \u201cIt might be a starting point for industry-level cooperation that could open more doors between the two countries.\u201d",
      "The diplomatic thaw extends beyond culture. In November, China said it would grant visa exemptions for South Korean visitors, and South Korea has said it will do the same for visitors from China.",
      "China\u2019s growing friendliness toward South Korea might be partly motivated by the unstable situation on the international stage, Kim said. Both countries face increasingly hostile and unpredictable U.S. trade policies under President Donald Trump.",
      "In addition, China is struggling with weak domestic consumption that would be aided by K-pop\u2019s high-spending fans.",
      "China has also been strengthening its own entertainment industry and has more confidence in it, Kang said, pointing to the record-breaking success this year of the Chinese film \u201cNe Zha 2,\u201d the world\u2019s highest-grossing animated film ever.",
      "\u201cIt now has robust resilience against the \u2018invasion\u2019 of foreign content,\u201d she said.",
      "China\u2019s potential thaw toward South Korean entertainment comes as it further restricts the number of Hollywood films allowed to be screened in its theaters in response to Trump\u2019s tariffs.",
      "China-South Korea ties could also get a boost from next week\u2019s South Korean presidential election. The front-runner, Lee Jae-myung, is considered friendlier to China than his predecessor.",
      "\u201cIf he wins, it might be a matter of time that things will change, which will allow the Korean entertainers to come into the country and play their music,\u201d Kim said."

      "Three M\u0101ori lawmakers in New Zealand received record suspensions of up to three weeks on Thursday over a protest haka they performed in Parliament last year against a contentious bill.",
      "The lawmakers drew global attention in November when they performed the haka, a ceremonial chanting dance of defiance that is a cherished cultural symbol of New Zealand. They were protesting legislation that would have reinterpreted the country\u2019s 184-year-old founding document, a treaty that was signed between colonial British rulers and Indigenous M\u0101ori.",
      "A parliamentary committee found the three lawmakers in contempt of parliament last month and recommended that they be suspended for up to three weeks \u201cfor acting in a manner that could have the effect of intimidating a member of the House.\u201d",
      "Debbie Ngarewa-Packer and Rawiri Waititi, co-leaders of Te P\u0101ti M\u0101ori, the M\u0101ori party, which holds six of Parliament\u2019s 123 seats, were suspended for three weeks each.",
      "Hana-Rawhiti Maipi-Clarke, who at 22 is New Zealand\u2019s youngest legislator, was suspended for one week on the recommendation of the committee, which said in its report that she had demonstrated \u201csome level of contrition\u201d in her written statement.",
      "The vote was 68-55 against Maipi-Clarke, 68-54 against Ngarewa-Packer and 68-53 against Waititi, all of whom were suspended immediately.",
      "Waititi told reporters after the vote that he and his colleagues would \u201ccontinue to be the voices our people expect us to be.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey are demonizing haka,\u201d he said of the lawmakers who voted for the suspensions. \u201cThey are making us out to be violent, to be disruptive, and our people have heard that for a long, long time.\u201d",
      "It is rare for New Zealand lawmakers to receive such suspensions, which are unpaid, and the longest anyone had previously been suspended was three days.",
      "The opposition Labour Party as well as the Green Party criticized the suspensions as disproportionate, with the Labour Party proposing censure instead.",
      "The three lawmakers performed the protest haka in November during the reading of a bill that would have redefined the Treaty of Waitangi. Signed in 1840 between the British Crown and M\u0101ori chiefs, the treaty established British governance and structures to protect M\u0101ori rights and continues to influence policy today.",
      "The legislation was brought by the small libertarian party ACT New Zealand, which said the treaty had been misinterpreted to give M\u0101ori people special treatment.",
      "Critics of the bill, which was defeated in April, said it would undo decades of progress for M\u0101ori, who make up about 20% of New Zealand\u2019s 5 million people and fare worse than the rest of the population in health, education and the criminal justice system.",
      "One of the M\u0101ori lawmakers, Maipi-Clarke, led the haka by tearing up a copy of the bill, joined by other M\u0101ori members and some visitors in the public gallery. Video of the protest went viral and gathered hundreds of millions of views across social media.",
      "Some lawmakers objected to the way their M\u0101ori colleagues advanced toward them across the floor.",
      "\u201cThis was a very serious incident, the likes of which I have never seen before in my 23 years in the debating chamber,\u201d said Judith Collins of the center-right National Party, chair of the parliamentary committee that issued the report.",
      "She added that the lawmakers had performed the haka without permission and that the disruption had suspended legislative proceedings for 30 minutes.",
      "The three M\u0101ori lawmakers declined to appear before the committee during its investigation, citing disrespect for their cultural traditions. Their party said the way it was being conducted was \u201cgrossly unjust\u201d and that \u201cthis was not about process, this became personal.\u201d",
      "The committee said the lawmakers were being sanctioned not for performing the haka, but for \u201cthe time at and manner in which it was performed.\u201d It said the severity of the sanctions was intended to \u201cleave members in no doubt that the behavior discussed is not acceptable.\u201d",
      "The vote had originally been scheduled for last month but was postponed so that the three M\u0101ori lawmakers could participate in debate over the federal budget.",
      "Performing haka in Parliament is not uncommon, and is typically seen when M\u0101ori members celebrate the passage of a particular bill. The dance is known abroad for being performed at matches by New Zealand\u2019s rugby teams, and variations of it are also performed at funerals and formal welcomes.",
      "\u201cIt would have been clearly understood by everyone in the parliament that this was a peaceful act of protest done in a way that aligns with M\u0101ori tradition,\u201d said Julian Rawiri Kusabs, a M\u0101ori historian and researcher at the University of Melbourne in Australia.",
      "Kusabs said the suspension was a setback in decades of reconciliation efforts between the New Zealand government and M\u0101ori communities, whose members have had to navigate \u201ca highly complex and frequently painful relationship\u201d even to achieve representation in Parliament.",
      "The suspension, he said, reinforces the longstanding perception that \u201cM\u0101ori culture is not equally respected within New Zealand\u2019s formal institutions of governance.\u201d"

      "In video posted on X by the film\u2019s co-director, Yuval Abraham, an Israeli soldier tells a group of international journalists that there is \u201cno passage\u201d in the area because of a military order. Basel Adra, a Palestinian co-director of the film who lives in the area, said the military then blocked the journalists from entering two Palestinian villages they had hoped to visit.",
      "Israel\u2019s military said in a statement that entry into Khallet A-Daba was banned because it was in a live-fire training zone. Tuwani is not in the firing zone, but the military said it had barred \u201cindividuals who might disrupt order from entering the area,\u201d in order to \u201cmaintain public order and prevent friction.\u201d",
      "\u201cThey don\u2019t want journalists to visit the villages to meet the residents,\u201d said Adra, who had invited the journalists to his home. \u201cIt\u2019s clear they don\u2019t want the world to see what is happening here.\u201d",
      "Some of the surrounding area, including a collection of small Bedouin villages known as Masafer Yatta, was declared by the military to be a live-fire training zone in the 1980s. Some 1,000 Palestinians have remained there despite being ordered out, and journalists, human rights activists and diplomats have visited the villages in the past.",
      "Palestinian residents in the area have reported increasing settler violence since Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas attacked Israel and kickstarted the war in the Gaza Strip. Israeli soldiers regularly move in to demolish homes, tents, water tanks and olive orchards \u2014 and Palestinians fear outright expulsion could come at any time.",
      "Adra said the journalists were eventually able to enter one of the villages in Masafer Yatta but were barred from entering Tuwani, the village where he lives, and Khallet A-Daba, where he had hoped to take them.",
      "Adra said settlers arrived in Khallet A-Daba on Monday and took over some of the caves where village residents live, destroying residents\u2019 belongings and grazing hundreds of sheep on village lands. The military demolished much of the village last month.",
      "It said in a statement to AP that the structures in the village were built illegally and demolished after the residents had the chance to present their cases against demolition.",
      "\u201cNo Other Land,\u201d which won the Oscar this year for best documentary, chronicles the struggle by residents to stop the Israeli military from demolishing their villages. The joint Palestinian-Israeli production was directed by Adra and Hamdan Ballal, another Palestinian activist from Masafer Yatta, along with Israeli directors Yuval Abraham and Rachel Szor.",
      "The film has won a string of international awards.",
      "Israel captured the West Bank in the 1967 Mideast war, along with the Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem. The Palestinians want all three for their future state and view settlement growth as a major obstacle to a two-state solution.",
      "Israel has built well over 100 settlements, home to over 500,000 settlers who have Israeli citizenship. The 3 million Palestinians in the West Bank live under seemingly open-ended Israeli military rule, with the Western-backed Palestinian Authority administering population centers."

      "Workers were observed pulling tethers, and possibly using barrage balloons, in a manual effort to right the ship, it added. The imagery shows the vessel\u2019s bow still on land, with possible damage to its sonar section.",
      "\u201cTo repair this, the ship will need to be moved out of the water to either a large floating drydock or graving dock once afloat,\u201d 38 North said. \u201cHowever, Chongjin\u2019s shipyard does not offer this infrastructure.\u201d",
